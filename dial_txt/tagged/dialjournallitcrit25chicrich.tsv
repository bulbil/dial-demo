		28 A CENTURY OF
AMERICAN FICTION	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American novel is just one hundred years old .

		It took the colonists nearly two cen - turies to free their imagination from the phys - ical and intellectual trammels imposed upon it by the hard necessity of making a virgin world into a habitation fit for man , and the still harder bondage of a theocratic conception of society .

		As long as the forests remained uncleared and the Indians unsubdued , and as long as men 's minds were under the obsession of a grim the - ology , there was little hope for creative litera - ture , and the writers who put pen to paper were chiefly urged by a desire to take part in some ephemeral controversy of religion or poli - tics , or , at the utmost , by the hope of emulating certain favorite examples of the mother coun - try 's literary product .

		Thus the best of our early writings were imitative , and imitative our budding literature remained until a time within the memory of many persons now living .

		But the publication of
Brown	PERSON	's `` Wieland , '' in
1798	DATE	, at least marked the beginning of the end of our long term of sterility , and this is why it becomes appropriate , in
1898	DATE	, to ask what has been accomplished for us by a century of novel - writing .

		When we entered upon the
first decade of the present century	DATE	, we had nothing to show in the form of fiction except the earliest of
Brown	PERSON	's romances , and two or three such books as
Susanna Rowson	PERSON	's ''
Charlotte Temple	ORGANIZATION	, a Tale of Truth , '' whose '' pages were long bedewed with many tears of many readers . ''

		But the novel-reader of these days was not as insatiate in appetite as he has since become , and was well content with
Richardson	PERSON	, and Fielding , and
Sterne	PERSON	, and
Miss Burney	PERSON	, if his taste were of the finer sort ; with
Walpole	LOCATION	, and ''
Monk '' Lewis	PERSON	, and
Ann Radcliffe	PERSON	, if his imagination thirsted for mystery and gloom .

		He was prob - ably happier with the few books of native origin that he did possess than our latter-day readers , who get more American fiction than they can possibly digest , yet wax indignant because the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	is so long delayed , and declaim upon the national folly of our liking all good books in the English language , even if they are written by our kin beyond seas , or translated from the tongues of the stranger .

		It may prove interesting to take the present 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, century by decades , and see what each decen - nial period has done for the development of the art of novel-writing in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		We have seen how the account stood in the begin - ning ; what had we to show for ourselves ten years later ?

		It is a question easily answered .

		There were the rest of
Brown	PERSON	's romances , a few such books as
Tabitha Tenney	PERSON	's '' Female Quixotism '' and
Caroline Warren	PERSON	's The Gamesters , '' and of greater significance than anything hitherto done in American letters the book which , although not a novel , was to prove the starting-point of truly native inspir - ation in fiction , the famous History of
New York	LOCATION	'' by one
Diedrich Knickerbocker	PERSON	.

		When another ten years had passed , the pioneer work begun with this delightful piece of quasi - historical and humorous fiction was still further emphasized by the publication of '' The Sketch - Book . ''

		Of the stories included in this volume , Professor
Richardson	PERSON	justly says : '' They are local in scene and character , strong in delinea - tion of the personages introduced , and thor - oughly artistic in literary form and elabora - tion ... When to novelty in theme and form was added the easy serenity of an assured and confident literary touch , American fiction had clearly passed beyond the stage of apology and curiosity . ''

		The year 1820 is also noteworthy as the year in which '' Precaution '' saw the light , and the most important thing to be said about the twenties is that they witnessed the development of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's activity at the rate of one new novel for almost every year .

		It was evident that
America	LOCATION	had at last produced a novelist who had come to stay , and the acclaim with which
Cooper	PERSON	was received both at home and abroad made it clear enough that the new world was ready to provide both the occasion and the field , and that men would soon be forthcoming to seize upon the one and cultivate the other .

		Meanwhile , '' the obscurest man of letters in
America	LOCATION	, '' as
Hawthorne	PERSON	once styled himself , was slowly passing through the chrysalis stage , and ''
Fanshawe	PERSON	, '' the first of his novels , was actually written during the late twenties , although the public was to know nothing about it until many years later , when the fame of the author as the greatest of American novelists had become fully assured .

		Besides witnessing the continued production of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's novels , the thirties brought into prominence the name of
Paulding	LOCATION	, the friend and collaborator of
Irving	LOCATION	, and the one book by that writer which still retains a precarious hold upon life , `` The Dutchman 's Fireside , '' bears the date of
1831	DATE	.

		The year following was the year of '' Swallow Barn , '' which marked the beginning of a distinctively Southern va - riety of the American novel .

		Kennedy 's slender contribution to our fiction falls wholly within this decade , as does also the first instalment of the romantic fiction that was for thirty years to flow in such a stream from the prolific pen of
Simms	PERSON	.

		Nor must we forget to mention the name of Dr. Bird , if it be only to note the fact that the yellow - covered '' dime '' novel of a later generation traced its lineage back to ''
Nick	PERSON	of the Woods '' and The Hawks of Hawk Hol - low . ''

		From the late thirties also date the popular '' Zenobia '' and '' Aurelian '' of Will - iam
Ware	ORGANIZATION	, which still find admirers , we believe , in certain strata of the reading public .

		When this decade came to its close , the '' Twice-Told Tales , '' first collected three years before , had shown the existence of a hitherto unexampled artistic force in American letters , the ''
Hyper	PERSON	- ion '' of the year just preceding had given our public a faint but charming reflection of the romantic movement in
Germany	LOCATION	, while
Poe	PERSON	's `` Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque '' made the year 1840 a landmark in the history of our fiction .

		The fifth decade was distinguished by noth - ing more noteworthy than
Herman Melville	PERSON	's stories of the southern seas , which appeared in rapid succession during these years .

		But the year that stands midway in the century is doubly significant , for it was in
1850	DATE	that
Cooper	PERSON	's last novel saw the light , and that The Scarlet Letter '' the most perfect piece of creative literature yet produced iu the
United States	LOCATION	was given to the world .

		The decade of the fifties was dominated by the genius of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and brought forward only two new names that were destined to outlive their gen - eration .

		`` Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' and `` The Virginia Comedians '' must be remembered in any survey , however summary , of our native fiction the one for its immense social influence , the other for being , on the whole , the best novel produced by the South during the ante-bellum period .

		The ten years that included the four of the Civil War added several important new names to the annals of our fiction , and are certainly not chargeable with sterility , even if their lit - erary activity did not prove commensurate with the expansion of the national consciousness .

		The two famous novels of
Holmes	PERSON	, the promis - ing tales of
Winthrop	LOCATION	, the respectable fictions
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 of
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, Dr.
Kale	PERSON	's '' Man Without a Country , '' Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's '' Story of a Bad Boy , '' and '' The Innocents Abroad '' make up a fairly satisfactory list , while the very
last year of the decade	DATE	was that in which '' The Luck of Roaring Camp '' took the public by storm , and brought into our fiction a new and resonant note of which the echoes have not yet grown faint .

		In all our annals there is probably nothing more significant than the publication of this idyl of the new rough West .

		It meant , as we can see plainly enough after these thirty years , that our fiction was about to become intensely local and vividly realistic .

		The fine flower of ideal literary art had blossomed and died with
Hawthorne	LOCATION	; henceforth our novelists were to busy themselves with the interpretation of life at close range , and were to produce a kaleido - scopic body of fiction each bit of which should sparkle with its own characteristic and inde - pendent color .

		This is the general formula which enables us to include in one category , no matter how varied the scene and how diverse the accent , the work of Mr.
Harte	PERSON	, Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, and Mr.
James	PERSON	, the novels of Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	, Mr.
Warner	PERSON	, Mr.
Cable	PERSON	, and Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	, the countless sketches and social studies of Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	, Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	, Mr.
Page	PERSON	,
Colonel Johnston	PERSON	, and
Major Kirkland	PERSON	, and the charming section of our literature that em - braces the writings of Miss Murfree ,
Miss Wilkins	LOCATION	,
Miss Jewett	PERSON	, Miss French , and Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	.

		Compared with this list , which might be indefinitely extended with minor yet deserv - ing names , the novelists who have eschewed realism and stood for the old romantic conven - tions are but a small company , and have done little to check the tidal movement of the period .

		An entire generation of novel-readers has found satisfaction in fiction of the descriptive and analytical type , and the inevitable reaction of taste sets in so slowly that , although the signs have been gathering for several years , the changing of the old order has barely begun .

		Such is the history of American fiction , from the ''
Wieland	PERSON	'' of
1798	DATE	to the
Caleb West	PERSON	, '' let us say , of exactly a hundred years later .

		PROBABLY the most satisfactory black-and-white reproductions of the principal works in the annual Royal Academy exhibitions are to be found in Messrs.
Cassell	PERSON	& Company 's well-known '' Royal Academy Pictures . ''

		The reproductions given are of adequate size , carefully printed on fine plate paper , and convey , on the whole , a very good idea of the originals .

		The
1898	DATE	edition of this work , issued , as usual , in five parts , is now ready .

		THE PASSING SHOW .

		There are two or three features in the dramatic season of 1897-98 in
Chicago	LOCATION	that are worth noting .

		In the first place the season opened with a rather remarkable activity in the field of the '' American '' drama , no less than four principal theatres present - ing for opening attractions new productions by Amer - ican playwrights .

		The Grand began
August 15	DATE	, with '' The Hoosier Doctor , '' by Mr.
Augustin Thomas ; Hooley	PERSON	's opened the same week with Mr.
Louis N. Parker	PERSON	's '' The Mayflower '' ; Mr.
Clay Clement	PERSON	's new play , '' A Southern Gentleman , '' was given at
McVicker	PERSON	's
August 23	DATE	, and the
Schiller Stock	ORGANIZATION	com - pany made their first appearance
August 30	DATE	with Captain
Charles King	PERSON	's ''
Fort Frayne	PERSON	. ''

		Of these four plays , the success was moderate , the one last named meeting with greatest favor .

		The '' Amer - ican '' play has remained more or less in evidence all through the year .

		Mr.
Clay Clement	PERSON	's ever delightful comedy , '' The New Dominion , '' came on at
McVicker	ORGANIZATION	's in
September	DATE	; and , beginning on the 27th of that month , Mr.
William Gillette	PERSON	's '' Secret Service '' had for six successive weeks or is said to have had the most successful run of any play in the history of
Hooley	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre .

		This was fol - lowed immediately , at the same theatre , by '' A Vir - ginia Courtship , '' the work of Mr.
Eugene W. Pres	PERSON	- brey , which won popularity in the hands of Mr.
William H. Crane	PERSON	, and held the boards three weeks .

		It was a coincidence that brought Mr.
Stuart Robson	PERSON	to
McVicker	PERSON	's at the same time -LRB- November 7 -RRB- , in Mr.
Bronson Howard	PERSON	's old success , '' The Henrietta . '' ''

		At
Piney Ridge	ORGANIZATION	, '' a play of the
Tennessee	LOCATION	moun - tains , by Mr.
David Higgins	PERSON	, came on at the last - named theatre ,
November 28	DATE	, and was followed by Mr.
Denman Thompson	PERSON	in '' The Old Homestead '' in
December	DATE	.

		Mr.
Belasco	PERSON	's '' Heart of
Maryland	LOCATION	'' was at the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	during that month also , with Mrs.
Leslie Carter	PERSON	in the leading role .

		Mr.
Nat Goodwin	PERSON	, in '' An American Citizen , '' played at
Hooley	PERSON	's for three weeks in
January	DATE	, and then pro- duced the season 's novelty in this field , the heroic drama of ''
Nathan Hale	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	.

		This was the most notable event of the year , although the success of this interesting effort was not uncon - ditioned .

		Mr.
James A. Hearne	PERSON	's always popular '' Shore Acres '' was on at
McVicker	PERSON	's for two weeks in
February	DATE	, while Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's '' Sunshine of Paradise Alley '' ran coincidently at
Hooley	ORGANIZATION	's , and Mr.
Joseph Arthur	PERSON	's '' Blue Jeans '' came to the
Schiller	PERSON	,
February 20	DATE	. ''

		Shenandoah , '' Mr.
Bronson Howard	PERSON	's effective melodrama , began a phenomenal run at

Chattanooga	LOCATION	, '' a new play by Mr.
Lincoln J. Carter	PERSON	, was put on at the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
June 25	DATE	.

		So much for '' American '' drama down-town .

		A study of the attractions presented at the outlying theatres shows that the patrons of these latter places 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, of amusement are fond of native color also .

		Of course in these houses melodrama rules .

		The titles on their bills run thus : '' The Brand of
Cain	PERSON	, '' ' Straight from the Heart , '' '' Humanity , '' - Land of the Living , '' '' Woman in Black , '' '' A Guilty Mother , '' '' Fallen Among Thieves , '' '' The Span of Life , '' `` The Great Train Robbery , '' `` When Lon - don Sleeps , '' '' Under the Polar Star , '' etc. .

		Spec - tacular realism , particularly as developed in Mr.
Lincoln J. Carter	PERSON	's ingenious plays `` The Tor - nado , '' '' The Fast Mail , '' '' Under the Dome , '' and others of the same type , '' The Operator , '' '' The Electrician , '' '' A Midnight Alarm , '' '' The Police Patrol , '' is exceedingly popular ; and of course plays dealing with the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	, such as '' The
Ensign	PERSON	, '' '' The Man o ' War 's Man , '' '' The White Squadron , '' have had some vogue .

		The titles here presented are typical of the productions which have held the boards at the Academy , the Al ham - bra , the
Bijou	PERSON	, the
Lincoln	LOCATION	, daring the season past The lover of melodrama is also fond of local settings , and Mr.
Carter	PERSON	's sensational achievement entitled `` The Heart of
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' in which mechanical effects are successfully combined with familiar scenes as an ingenious setting for the customary plot , is a popular play . ''

		Under the Dome '' has had a good run ; so also have ''
McFadden	PERSON	's Flats '' and ''
Hogan	PERSON	's Alley . ''

		It is natural enough that for this class of plays the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	metropolis should be the favorite among American cities in furnishing a locale , and it is amusing to note how these me - chanics of art ring the changes on their theme .

		Thus , early in the season came a play called '' The Wolves of
New York	LOCATION	'' ; this was followed by `` The Streets of
New York	LOCATION	'' ; then came '' The Pulse of
New York	LOCATION	'' ; later , '' The Sidewalks of
New York	LOCATION	'' ; and lastly , '' Alone in
Greater New York	LOCATION	. ''

		On the whole , there is surprisingly little of the morally objectionable presented at any one of these four houses during the year .

		The managers appear to understand what their patrons want , and supply the demand in quality good of its kind .

		A study of the material furnished the people who attend these houses is interesting and not discouraging .

		How - ever lurid these dramas may be , the illumination is commonly that of honest fireworks , and the smell of gunpowder is more wholesome than the fumes of more pretentious plays in another class .

		That there are four cheap houses in
Chicago	LOCATION	which have sev - erally supplied melodrama of a legitimate type almost continuously for the year , along with
Colonel Hopkins	PERSON	's excellent play-house serving standard attractions of a similar sort , is matter for congratu - lation among those who look seriously at the prob - lem of public amusement in a great city .

		A year ago we noticed the tendency to go to suc - cessful works of fiction for dramatic material .

		Among plays of this class we have had this year in addition to '' The Prisoner of Zenda , '' '' Under the Red Robe , '' and '' Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	, '' an adaptation of
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Prince Otto '' in a pro- duction entitled ''
Prince Rudolph	PERSON	, '' along with another dramatization by Mr.
Rose	PERSON	, of Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's new story '' The Adventure of the Lady Ur - sula . ''

		The success of this last named play , in the hands of Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	and
Miss Harned	PERSON	, fairly rivals that of its ever popular predecessor .

		Two other dramatizations proved very effective upon the stage : `` A Lady of Quality , '' presented by Miss
Julia Arthur	PERSON	, and ''
Tess	PERSON	of the D'Urbervilles , '' with Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	in the title role .

		The effort to construct an acting-play out of `` Beside the
Bonnie Brier Bush	PERSON	'' was either ludicrous or pitiful , as the reader chooses ; it is proper , however , to chronicle the event as one of the novelties of the year .

		The ultimate purpose of this annual review of the local dramatic season is to maintain somewhere a convenient record of the Shakespearian perform - ances in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		* Although the
Chicago	LOCATION	stage is distinctly provincial , this city is nevertheless very near the centre of national life , and is perhaps as truly indicative of the rise and fall in dramatic values as any city in the country .

		Two years ago the city was remarkably fortunate in the numerous productions of the Shakespearian dramas and in the general excellence of their artistic merit ; there were eighty-eight performances recorded for that year -LRB- 1895-96 -RRB- .

		During the season of 1896-97 there were sixty-eight .

		For the season of 1897-98 , just closed , only fifty Shakespearian performances were given .

		In each of the previous years , thirteen of the plays were brought out ; this season there were but ten . ''

		The Comedy of Errors '' is the only new production of the year .

		Aside from the return to the stage of
Madame Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	in her old-time repertory , the notable event of the year was the appearance in
September	DATE	, and again in
March	DATE	and
April	DATE	, of Mr.
Thomas Keene	PERSON	.

		Now that the season of this popular and conscientious actor has indeed closed forever , it is pleasant to recall the double visit with its extended list of plays ; no less than nine different characters were essayed by Mr.
Keene	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL 13 THE I ^
AST	ORGANIZATION	SIGNER OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE .

		* Among the signatures to the Declaration of Independence , that of
Charles Carroll	PERSON	of Car - rollton always attracts attention because of its peculiarity .

		But the individuality of
Charles Carroll	PERSON	was marked in many other ways .

		He was supposed to be the richest man in the re - bellious American colonies ,
George	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	ranking second .

		The Carrolls in
Maryland	LOCATION	were so numerous that he added the name of one of his plantations to properly designate himself .

		Being a Roman Catholic , his acces - sion to the ranks of the rebels rebuked those Protestants who claimed that the Church was hostile to the cause .

		For the same reason , and because he had been educated in
France	LOCATION	, he was chosen by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, although not a member of that body , as one of three com - missioners to the Canadians in a forlorn hope of getting them into the rebellion against the king .

		He was one of the signers of the Declaration , but was not present when that document was popularly supposed to have been signed on
the fourth of July	DATE	.

		He was the last survivor of the signers , and issued a `` reaffirmatory declara - tion '' fifty years after he had placed his name to the original .

		In view of his long life , and the part he took in the most prominent events of the nation 's history , the opinions of
Charles Carroll	PERSON	would be invaluable if they had been preserved .

		Not being a
New Englander	LOCATION	, he was not trained in the duty of keeping a diary ; and , equally un - fortunately , he did not even preserve his letters . ''

		When those events -LSB- of the Revolution -RSB- had gone by , the matters to which they relate ceas - ing to be interesting to the writers , the letters were destroyed , at least those that were directed to me . ''

		Had he been more provident , or in the habit of reducing his thoughts to writing , he might have thrown much light on disputed and obscure points .

		He was present as a visitor when the procession of delegates marched from the
City Tavern	LOCATION	to the
Carpenters	ORGANIZATION	'
Hall	PERSON	to organize the
First Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but he left not a line concerning it .

		His timely return to the
Maryland	LOCATION	legislature , after the
Canada	LOCATION	expe - dition , turned the scale for independence , and * LOFE AND CORRESPONDENCE OF
CHARLES CARROLL	PERSON	OF
CARROLLTON	LOCATION	.

		By
Kate Mason Rowland	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		he was at once elected to the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Con - gress and signed the engrossed copy of the Declaration .

		He was a member of the state convention which formed a constitution for
Maryland	LOCATION	, and a state senator under that con - stitution , as we know from his name on the records .

		He refused to serve on what would have been the most important of the many mis - sions to which he was called ,
viz.	LOCATION	, as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention at
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia in
1787	DATE	; yet one can only conjecture the reason for his refusal .

		His name alone tells that he was in the
Maryland	LOCATION	convention where the Constitution was ratified by a rather high - handed proceeding .

		He was the first
United States	LOCATION	senator from
Maryland	LOCATION	, but has added little to our meagre information concerning those days of closed senate doors .

		Yet a chronologically arranged statement of
Carroll	ORGANIZATION	's services , taken from the records and from letters preserved by others , is a veritable and desirable addition to historical literature .

		So thorough and systematic has been the search already made by biographers , that one can scarcely expect to find much new matter con - cerning the public life of any Revolutionary father .

		The private letters and papers written before entering and after leaving public life are likely to be the only reward of the investi - gator ; and here the author of the volumes under consideration has made a praiseworthy contribution .

		The letters written by the father of
Charles Carroll	PERSON	to his son in European schools show the Roman Catholic in a colony supposed to have been planted for the freedom of that sect , but persecuted by an '' established church , '' de - prived of office , obliged to pay double taxes , forbidden to give a religious education to his children , and his life made so intolerable that he contemplates sacrificing his vast landed property for the sake of an asylum in some more liberal land .

		Indeed , an ancestor had long be - fore changed his motto to '' Anywhere with liberty , '' and fled from an intolerant old world only to have his descendant find an equal intol - erance in the new .

		A religious as well as civil freedom was demanded ; and
Charles Carroll	PERSON	of
Carrollton	LOCATION	, hearing the story of colonial per - secution from his father , had a grievance which easily persuaded him to embark his immense fortune in a rebellion against a tyrannical state and a tyrannical state church . ''

		To obtain reli - gious as well as civil liberty , I entered zealously into the Revolution ; and observing the
Chris	PERSON	- tian religion divided into many sects , I founded 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, the hope that no one would be so predominant as to become the religion of the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Equally interesting are the family letters of
Carroll	PERSON	after his retirement from public life , commenting on the political changes and the rising complications of the
United States	LOCATION	with foreign nations .

		Pleasant glimpses are afforded of the daily life of a gentleman of leisure , a fine classical scholar , and a devout churchman .

		The rigid requirement of the modern biog - raphy , that it give facts instead of eulogy , has been well observed by the author .

		Of the equally binding demand that the portraiture be unmarred by a foreign background or distracting accessories , as much can not be said .

		The elec - tion of a biography as a vehicle for proving a theory is most unfortunate if not unpardonable .

		To attempt to prove now-a-days that our fathers thought and spoke of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	in the plural number , is to set up a man of straw for an adversary .

		It smacks of the hair-splitting dead - language days of ante-bellum controversy .

		No reasoning man now questions the historical su - premacy of the States more than he does the necessary supremacy of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The effort in the case of
Carroll	ORGANIZATION	is the more labored be - cause he trained with the Union-making
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eralists .

		He acted , as did all the fathers , ac - cording to the light they then had .

		To make them discern the later contest on this question of the supremacy of one of the joint powers , is to endow them with the gift of prophecy , a height of rhapsody to which the calm reader can scarcely be carried by any biographer .

		The author has been unfortunate in trying to follow the confused nomenclature of parties at the time of their birth , instead of adopting the terms now accepted .

		The attempts to ex - plain these distinctions make the confusion worse , and at times it is difficult to get the intended meaning of the comments .


Carroll	PERSON	spoke of the
Jefferson	PERSON	faction as Anti-Federal - ists , although
Jefferson	PERSON	denied that he had ever been an Anti-Federalist .

		When
Carroll	PERSON	called them Democrats he was probably thinking of '' democrats '' men who paraded '' under the worn-out guise of equal liberty and right , and equal division of property , held out to the indo - lent and needy ; but not really intended to be executed . ''

		Jefferson repudiated the title Demo - crat , derived from the excesses of the Demo - cratic clubs .

		He adopted the word Republican , since he believed in a representative republic ; it remained for the rough old '' Hickory ''
Jack	PERSON	- son to establish a levelling Democratic party .

		Barring a few minor discrepancies , such as the confusion of the date of
Carroll	PERSON	signing the Declaration -LRB-
Aug. 2	DATE	on page 180 of Vol .

		1. , and
Aug. 20	DATE	on page 343 of Vol .

		II . -RRB-

		, the edit - ing has been carefully and most exhaustively done .

		No one can lay aside these volumes with - out an increased respect for this worthy gentle - man of
Doughrohegan Manor	PERSON	, and of thanks to the editor of his life and correspondence .


EDWIN E. SPARKS	PERSON	.

		A MODERN ROMANCER .

		* No literary movement could be more distinct than the romantic revival which has come about in the past few years and this , in its popular and most apparent form , could not be better illustrated than by the work of Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	.

		It has , indeed , a side rarer than the casual eye can view , and an inspiration too subtle for the casual thought to divine , but , as generally conceived , it is a revival of wonder at the glow and color and splendor of a past time , a revival of interest in the epic scenes and figures of a younger world .

		The thousand fine - nesses bred of a modern art and thought are , of course , admitted , but the movement is compared to that which inspired the fiction of the early nineteenth century ; and therefore his roman - ticism being not unlike that of
Scott	PERSON	this author is made to represent it , as Scott repre - sented the first phase of a greater renaissance .

		It would be easy to say , and is possibly true , that the essentials for his type of romance remain unchanged , though the forms in which they are presented be as different as the Old World and the New .

		The material offered by the history of French
Canada	LOCATION	for action , the historic struggle ; for setting , the strange forest and ocean ; for atmosphere , the keen wind of danger ; and for figures , the seigneur , soldier , and lady , the priest and voyageur and coureur de bois all this seems not unlike the material of the old romancer ; for in analysis we find its elements to be the ancient ideal of courage , the simple faith of the sword , the deeds of men to whom life and death were matters of profound simplicity .

		Yet the difference between the two worlds is , perhaps , what gives to our romance its distinguishing quality for , when worthily ours , it has something of the unexampled freshness , promise , power , of a marvellous young conti - nent .

		Here , if we vision it and have strength GILBKBT PARKER 1 * NOVELS .

		THE DIAL 15 to use it , lies the advantage of our material .

		To a certain extent , Mr.
Parker	PERSON	has used it .

		His characters , it is true , are not men of intense ideals , finding in the wilderness the home of religious liberty only men eager for adven - ture , explorers , traders , soldiers , ready to fling away their lives , some under the lilies of
France	LOCATION	, some under the cross of
St. George	ORGANIZATION	, to hold the land for the king .

		Yet '' trading , fighting , revelling '' he makes them suggest the fresh spirit of their time , the daring dream of their new world ; and he gives us , too , a conception which , heretofore , the historian alone has given the conception of our continent as a great , splendid , half-mysterious stage , on which the strong nations of
Europe	LOCATION	were set to play the drama of conquest .

		In all this he proves him - self American ; by these signs his work belongs to us .

		It is difficult to speak of Mr.
Parker	PERSON	except as concerning himself with the past , for his genius comes to its own in historic epochs and among picturesque figures .

		Of his modern stories if they may properly be called such '' The Trespasser '' is the only one which ap - proaches in power '' The Seats of the Mighty '' or '' The Trail of the Sword '' and the chief character here is a man from a strange , wild country , having Indian blood in his veins , with a curious magnetism about him , and with cer - tain looks , thoughts , memories , which make him almost the incarnation of a far-off ancestor .

		Such a subject , though it presents a deeply romantic problem , to which he can not do jus - tice and which , indeed , calls for the genius of a
Hawthorne	LOCATION	is not wholly unsuited to Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's abilities .

		But when he writes of really modern people , he is in a strange air , seeking strange gods .

		It is not that he would give these people adventure we are never too civilized for that ; but he can not present modern men and women in adventure , and when he essays to do so is either theatrical or dull .

		Even the speech of the modern is not his ; he has skill in dialogue , but it must be such dialogue as that between Captain
Robert Moray	PERSON	and Mon - sieur Doltaire , eighteenth-century soldiers and gentlemen , or as that between the sprightly English
Jessica	PERSON	and young
Iberville	LOCATION	, envoy from Count Frontenac to the English governor .

		In short , he must have , for the proper exercise of his art , material which is innately picturesque and impressive .

		With such stuff to work upon , he is not theatrical , but dramatic ; it lends itself to his style , which , though simple , has a roman - tic glow and suggestiveness ; and his thrilling , imaginative phrases '' The Seats of the Mighty , '' '' The Porch of the World , '' As Water unto Wine , '' `` The Gates of Misfor - tune '' are entirely suited to it .

		The very char - acter of the French people , and the vividness of their speech and manner , give him warrant for certain emotional scenes .


Iberville	LOCATION	, saying to Frontenac , '' Once , sir , you made it a choice between the woman and the sword , '' and press - ing his lips to the sword 's hilt-cross , is not unreal , but simply un-English .

		Nor is
Alixe Duvar	PERSON	- ney unreal when she tells how , at the palace of the Intendant , to a roomful of banqueters , she played the part of danseuse , in order to save her lover .

		Indeed , in Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's mas - terpiece , from which this last example is drawn , there are none but the most legitimate effects , and there is a real delicacy of touch , a great dignity of narration .

		The time is not so far past when no one cared , or dared , to tell these heroic tales , and when our art was fearful lest , by chance , it should create an impressive character .

		The change to this romanticism has been very marked , and from the extreme which Mr.
Parker	PERSON	represents we must expect some backward swing to heroisms finer than those of the sword , and to adventures whose end is greater than the con - quest of provinces .

		But there can hardly come a time when we shall not find something thrill - ing in the wide canvass of early
America	LOCATION	, and something poetic in the stalwart figures that people it , no matter what their ideals .

Henry Smith	PERSON	of

Grant	ORGANIZATION	family from which our own
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	claimed descent .

		Lady Strachey , wife of Sir
Richard Strachey	PERSON	and a kinswoman of the Grants , has edited the memoirs .

		They cover the years from
1797	DATE	to
1880	DATE	, although the writer , who died in
1885	DATE	in her eighty - ninth year , brought them down to a much later date .

		Her father , Sir
John Peter Grant	PERSON	, a gentleman of considerable property , an advo - cate by profession , and in later life appointed to '' a judgeship in
Bombay	LOCATION	, '' led a restless , roving life , as did his family with him .

		Hence the variety and interest of the '' Memoirs , '' and the allusions to countless places and persons of note .

		Life at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in
1810	DATE	, the installation of Lord
Grenville	PERSON	as chancellor of the
Univer	PERSON	- sity , reminiscences of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's student days at this period , a sojourn at

Waterloo	LOCATION	, and one to
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	a few years after
Napoleon	PERSON	's death , these and a thousand other matters lure the reader on from page to page .

		A single passage , in con - clusion , concerning Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	may be welcome : '' I was never in company with
Walter Scott	PERSON	; he went oat very little , and when he did go he was not agreeable , generally sitting very silent , looking dull and listless , unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance .

		In his own house he was another character , especially if he liked his guests .

		It was odd , hut Sir
Walter	PERSON	never had the reputation in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	he had elsewhere was not the lion , I mean . ''

		The life of the
Earl of Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Edwin Hodder	PERSON	, in three bulky volumes , pub - lished in
1886	DATE	, is so well known that the pres - ent outline of the '' good ''
Earl	PERSON	's work as a social reformer calls for but a brief , though a heartily commendatory , notice .

		The growing interest taken in social questions in recent years , to the increasing exclusion of purely political ones , is in no small measure due to
Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	's lifelong labors to better the con - dition of the English laboring classes .

		Receiv - ing no sympathy , and , it would seem , scarcely any love from his parents , the wonder is that his nature , instead of being embittered and hard - ened in youth , developed such all-embracing warmth and affection as characterized his mani - fold activities in the cause of social reform .

		Refusing high offices , honors , and a handsome income , he labored under a burden of financial embarrassment and in the face of persistent and often malignant opposition , but with un - faltering devotion , first in the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Com - mons , and then , upon his father 's death in
1851	DATE	, in the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, to secure much-needed legislation for the protection of the laboring classes , the poor and the unfortunate .

		Factory hands , miners , brick-makers , chimney-sweeps , agricultural laborers , lunatics , flower girls , shoe-blacks , and countless others , profited by his exertions .

		Active personal examination and inspection of mines , factories , asylums , schools , and a hundred other institutions , were added to his official duties in
Parliament	LOCATION	; tak - ing nothing upon hearsay , he desired a minute personal knowledge of all abuses calling for correction .

		The magnitude of his labors and the vast number of good causes initiated or encouraged by him almost passes belief ; and it was said of him that his speeches in behalf of each of these reforms made his hearers believe him solely and entirely engrossed in promoting that particular reform , as the one great work of his life . ''

		Love , serve , '' was his ancestral motto ; and nobly did he live up to it .

		The book , handy , clearly written , and inspiring , will be especially welcome to those unable to own the author 's more extended life of Lord Shaftesbury .

		Again the anonymous author of the '' Prig '' books and of an entertaining life of Sir
Kenelm Digby	PERSON	, already reviewed in these columns , comes to the front with a life of
Lucius Gary	PERSON	, second
Viscount Falkland	PERSON	, preceded by a briefer account of
Henry Gary	PERSON	, the first viscount .

		He declares his book to be written with a purpose '' to amuse its author '' ; and , as often hap - pens , in recording what amuses himself , the writer has succeeded in amusing his readers .


Elizabeth Tanfield	PERSON	, wife of
Henry Gary	PERSON	, claims no small part of the reader 's interest .

		When only ten years old , so keen-witted was she that she saved the life of a poor woman on trial for witchcraft ; but the story is too long to give in full , and will not bear cutting .

		The charm and value of the book lie in its treatment of what might be considered unimportant details ; for , as the author says , '' the minor details of the past are rarer than the major , and ... often help to illustrate the period in which they have occurred . ''

		The writer deplores his inability to enliven his pages with any anecdotes of Lucius

Gary	PERSON	's and
Letice Morison	PERSON	's love-making ; and so the element that contributed so much to the picturesqueness of the career of
Kenelm Digby	PERSON	, his contemporary , is entirely lacking in the present volume .

		But the same devotion to scholarly pursuits , so common with noblemen of that period , is found in the lives of both .

		The second
Viscount Falkland	PERSON	was an excellent classical scholar , a poet not without recognition , the author of '' A Discourse on the Infallibility of the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' and the supposed joint author of
Chillingworth	PERSON	's '' History of Protest - antism . ''

		In his learned seclusion at
Great Tew	LOCATION	, where he was visited by the chief men of letters of his time , he presents a pleasing pic - ture .

		A common saying of his , '' I pity un - learned gentlemen in a rainy day , '' is worth remembering .

		In public life his going over from Parliament to King was redeemed by his fidelity to the latter , even unto death .

		He was killed at the battle of
Newbury	ORGANIZATION	, after showing himself a brave soldier .

		While not a great contribution to historical literature , the present volume brings together , in convenient and attractive form , much that has hitherto been scattered and more or less inaccessible .

		After
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's estimate of
Falkland	LOCATION	as a '' martyr of sweetness and light , of lucidity of mind and largeness of temper , '' this his latest biographer can not surely be accused of undue prejudice in favor of his hero .

		As a general rule , a voluminous autobiography -LRB- not a posthumous one -RRB- , embellished with two portraits of its author , and containing chapters on '' The Work of My Life Recognized '' and '' Testimonies to My Life 's Work , '' is not ex - actly the kind of book one feels a burning desire to read and a hungry eagerness to possess .

		And when it is discovered that a good portion of the book has to do with an academy presided over by the writer and brought more promi - nently to the reader 's attention by means of photo-engravings , the volume begins to be sug - gestive of an elaborate advertisement , and the longing to explore its pages assumes a still more negative character .

		Yet Dr.
Porter	PERSON	's life has been full of action and incident , and his work , both in the church and in education , has been of great value to his
State	ORGANIZATION	and to the South generally .

		But when we encounter such frank instances of self-glorification as this sen - tence on page 253 , '' The class of the refined and educated was to be saved to the South through my efforts , '' we feel that the author is far above the need of any praise from us .

		RECENT BOOKS or TRAVEL , .

		* Quite the most notable recent book on Asian travel is '' From
Tonkin	LOCATION	to
India	LOCATION	, '' by Prince D'Or - leans .

		This elaborate work describes a journey made , in company with two fellow countrymen , from
Tonkin	LOCATION	to
India	LOCATION	, by way of lower
Yunnan	LOCATION	and Thibet and
Upper Assam	LOCATION	, largely through little - known country , and to some extent through country previously unvisited by Europeans .

		The aim was to find < k the shortest route from
China	LOCATION	to
India	LOCATION	, '' and to explore the Chinese Mekong and the sources of the
Irawadi	LOCATION	, and in all this he was successful .

		Much of the travelling was over very rough ground , and on the borders of
Assam	LOCATION	the party reached what the author called '' the acme of cumulative obstruction . '' ''

		Up to the present we had overcome many a spell of choice obstacles .

		They had not exhausted the vagaries of nature .

		Indeed , they might be looked upon rather as the occasional rockets of the entertainment , and this as the feu d ?

		artifices .

		Jagged points , slippery surface , crumbling brinks , creepers that tripped , worm-eaten trunks up which to swarm , almost vertical ladders to climb formed of wooden pickets driven in the face of overhanging bluffs , often hauled by the sheer strength of a couple of men and liana drag-ropes over boulders .

		We struggled on because we had to , and sat down abruptly on the other side , to marvel how the deuce we got there .

		Let anyone who wants good training for biceps or calf come here .

		A mile or two in a day was sometimes all we could do , and at this rate we began to despair of seeing
India	LOCATION	in
1896	DATE	. ''

		The author 's accounts of his struggles through this mountainous region and his descent into the plains of
Assam	LOCATION	are much the most interesting parts of the book .

		The larger part is a rather dry summary , too sketchy , desultory , and matter-of-fact to be of the highest interest .

		The writer is too lacking in graphic vigor , humor , and spirit of adventure for its own sake , to give his experiences literary charm .

		He alludes in high terms of praise to Mr.
Rockhill	PERSON	, the American explorer , whose name , however , he * FROM

July 1	DATE	, spells `` Rochill . ''

		He speaks bitterly of English aggression , bat can not conceal his admiration of English administration .

		The good maps , the artis - tic illustrations , and the scientific appendices add much to the value of this work .

		Through
Finland	LOCATION	in Carts , '' by Mrs.
Alec Tweedie	PERSON	, is an entertaining account of quite an ex - tended trip along the eastern shore of the Baltic , with special facilities for studying the home-life of the people .

		The title , however , is somewhat of a mis - nomer , as the journey was mostly made by boats .

		Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	saw much of the life of the upper classes , of the peasantry , and of the clergy .

		She thus describes a country church service : '' The church held nearly 4000 people , and every man and woman present was a peasant .

		The building was crowded to excess , the sexes being divided by the centre aisle .

		Nearly every one wore black , that being consid - ered the proper wear for
Sundays	DATE	, weddings , etc. , espe - cially for the married women , who also wore black silk handkerchiefs over their heads .

		Each woman carried a large white handkerchief in her hand , upon which she leaned her head while praying .

		Subsequently we found that all the females rolled their prayer-books up in these cloths while carrying them home .

		Service had begun at ten , so that three hours of it was over when we ar - rived , and the
Communion	ORGANIZATION	, which lasted another hour and a half , was about to begin .

		The place was packed , the day very hot , and the peasant atmosphere a little oppressive .

		We were much struck by the children ; mere babies actually being nursed by their mothers , while elder urchins walked in and out of the building going sometimes to have a game with various little friends amidst the graves outside , plaiting daisy-chains , or telling fortunes by large ox-eyed daisies .

		The men walked out also , and enjoyed a pipe or gossip with a neighbor , and there was that general air of freedom which prevails in a
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	during divine service ; nevertheless , the intense sympathy , the devotion , the general inclination to moan and weep , reminded us of the
Highland Kirk	LOCATION	.

		But it was very surprising to hear the pastor tell his congregation that at a certain day he would be at an appointed place to receive grain , butter , potatoes , calves , etc. .

		The clergy - men are paid in kind , which to them is a very suitable arrangement , as they are generally peasants ' sons and well able to attend to their own glebes ; but it did sound funny to hear a clergyman , standing in the pulpit , talk of butter and eggs .

		When the congregation stood up we naturally stood up with them .

		The Findlanders are short ; and for two women five feet six or seven high , with bats on the tops of their heads , suddenly to rise , amazed a congregation the female members of which were seldom taller than five feet one or two , and wore nothing on their heads but a flat handkerchief .

		We felt like giraffes towering over the rest of the people , and gradually grew more and more ashamed of our height and hats , simple though the latter were .

		How we longed to be short and have our heads covered with black silk handkerchiefs like the rest of the folk around , so as to be unnoticeable in their midst . ''

		Everywhere Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	enjoys her travel experi - ences and slight adventures with a rare zest , which she is very successful in communicating to her readers .

		While this work can not be accounted a finished literary performance , nor a very notable and thorough account of the Finnish land and peo - ple , it is yet an extremely bright , pleasant , merry book , a thoroughly popular travel book of the best sort .

		The volume is handsomely got up , and is pro- vided with a good map and interesting illustrations .

		The late
Charles A. Dana	PERSON	's volume of '' Eastern Journeys '' is a very slight collection of notes de - scriptive of a flying trip through
Russia	LOCATION	, Trans -
Caucasia	LOCATION	, and Palestine .

		These notes are too brief and cursory to be of much importance , though their very recent date may give them some value for cer - tain purposes , as for intending tourists .

		The book - let is well written , and the notices of Tiflis and the Darial Pass , which places are somewhat out of the beaten route , are of considerable interest Mr.
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	, a correspondent of a
London	LOCATION	paper , gives us , in the book entitled '' With the Con - quering Turk , '' a spirited and interesting account of the recent Turko-Greek affair .

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	started from
Salonica	LOCATION	, where , strange to say , he found the majority of inhabitants Jews , and '' the reigning speech old Spanish . ''

		He accompanied the Turkish forces throughout the brief campaign , which he characterizes as not '' really war '' but a political demonstration . ''

		It began as the servant of diplo - macy , instead of its master , as war should be ; so it went on .

		Everybody had his eye on the Concert of
Europe	LOCATION	and the terms of peace . ''

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	greatly admires the fighting qualities of the Turk .

		As evidence of this we quote his vigorous descrip - tion of the storming of Vasili by the Turks . ''

		They heard the bullets cracking past like whips , and the shells screaming like mad horses ; they saw their comrades fling wild arms abroad and lurch forward onto their faces .

		Yet these indomitable men never once moved out of their steady slouch . '

		Allah !

		Allah !

		Allah ! '

		they cried , with a fierce but a very self-contained enthusiasm , as they tramped first through deep corn and then out over the bare plough . '

		Allah !

		Allah !

		Allah ! '

		the sound swelling and mingling to a hoarse roar as they lined out into open order and began firing quickly but not hurriedly .

		` Allah !

		Allah !

		Allahl ' as the jets of fire ran more clearly round the village , and men went down beside them , and the bullets kicked up little dust - devels between their legs .

		And
Allah	PERSON	saw them through .

		The Greeks bolted .

		I doubt if they lost a man , for the Turks looked to shoot very high .

		But they saw their masters coming , and they went to kennel .

		They could not stand there and face those slipshod heroes shambling composedly forward past death to victory . ''

		While Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	's style is in general good and vivid , it sometimes is marred by flippancy , and some - times the constant staccato effect becomes weari - some , especially where he is tempted , as the corre - spondent must be , to merely - make copy . ''

		But on the whole the work is to be commended as a clear , careful , and readable account ; and the excellent maps add much to its usefulness .

		Mr.
Henry M. Stanley	PERSON	's latest contribution to African subjects , entitled '' Through
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' consists of brief and cursory letters descriptive of a trip to
Bulawayo	LOCATION	on the opening of the railway last fall , and includes also some material relating to a
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 visit to the
Transvaal	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	thinks that
Bulawayo	LOCATION	is destined to become the
Chicago	LOCATION	of
South Africa	LOCATION	; and as to the situation in the Trans - vaal he is even abusive of Kriiger and his policy .

		This little book is certainly acute and suggestive , and though it can not be called dispassionate , it will serve as an introduction to the present status of
South Africa	LOCATION	for those who have not time or inclin - ation for larger works .

		The present complication with
Cuba	LOCATION	will draw attention to such books as '' Marching with
Gomez	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Grover Flint	PERSON	.

		This book , though made up of the author 's letters to a
New York	LOCATION	paper , is de - cidedly superior in matter and form to the usual run of this kind of publication .

		It is a plain direct nar - rative , unsensational , and apparently truthful and impartial .

		As throwing some light on the state of the Cuban insurgents and on the nature of Spanish rule , it is of considerable value .

		Mr.
Flint	PERSON	finds that the fighting Cubans are disdainful of autonomy and of annexation , but wholly bent on absolute independence .

		The historical introduction to this book , by Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	, is of decided value , and the sketches and maps are of interest .

		The book on
Alaska	LOCATION	, by the Hon.
A. P. Swine	PERSON	- ford , is the result of personal observation in all parts of that vast territory .

		It is much better than the usual run of books on the subject , and furnishes a useful and apparently trustworthy compend .

		The Klondike region is included in the survey .

		The description of the Indians of
Alaska	LOCATION	, though sum - mary , is of value .

		The book has a good map and fair illustrations .

		Mr.
J. W. Tyrrell	PERSON	's '' Across the Sub-Arctics of
Canada	LOCATION	'' is a very modest and simple narrative of an exploring trip made in
1893	DATE	through the Barren Lands adjacent to
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	.

		The expedition was sent out by the
Canadian Government	ORGANIZATION	, to discover a water route from
Black Lake	ORGANIZATION	, which is just above
Lake Athabasca	LOCATION	, to
Baker Lake	PERSON	at the head of
Chesterfield Inlet	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Tyrrell	PERSON	accomplished this by a canoe journey , interrupted by frequent portages , along river and lake for 810 miles through an unknown country .

		He returned late in the au - tumn , by a very perilous coasting trip along
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	to
Fort Churchill	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Tyrrell	PERSON	came in con - tact with both Indians and Eskimos .

		To the
Eski	PERSON	- mos he devotes two chapters , which , though contri - buting little that is new , are yet fresh with personal observation .

		He describes the
Mackenzie River Es	LOCATION	- kimos as '' wearing stones in the cheeks , upon each side of the mouth . ''

		They '' have the reputation of being a bad lot , and it is said when they are heard to rattle their cheek stones against their teeth it is time to be on the lookout .

		The stones are cut in the shape of large shirt studs , and are let through the cheeks by cutting holes for them . ''

		The book is suitably illustrated from photographs , and it has a sketch-map of the author 's route .

		In '' The Isles and Shrines of
Greece	LOCATION	'' Mr.
S. J. Barrows	PERSON	discourses very pleasantly and enthusias - tically of
Greece	LOCATION	old and new .

		He includes in his survey the most famous and beautiful of the
Isles	LOCATION	and Shrines in the
Ionian Islands	LOCATION	, the
Peloponne	PERSON	- sus ,
Phocis	LOCATION	,
Thessaly	LOCATION	,
Attica	LOCATION	, the JEgean Islands , and Troy .

		Some of his pilgrimages were made under the leadership of the renowned Dorpf eld , who lectured to his students in the midst of the very ruins he described .

		A suggestive remark is this : '' In modern times we build churches where we think people will resort to them ; in primitive days of nature-worship the Greeks built their altars where they thought the gods loved to come . ''

		Mr.
Barrows	PERSON	's brief , genial , unpedantic sketches may well serve as a popular intoduction to classical Greek archaeology in the light of the most recent investigations .


Chris	PERSON	- tian archaeology is touched upon , and the Greek life of to-day is clearly described .

		The photographic illustrations are very good , but there is no map .

		`` Brown Men and Women , '' by Mr.
Edward Reeves	PERSON	, is an account , rather glib and desultory , of a hasting traveller to the usual ports in the
South Seas	LOCATION	.

		The Friendly Islands ,
Samoa	LOCATION	, the
Fiji Group	ORGANIZATION	, the
Cook Group	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Society Islands	ORGANIZATION	are described in a light and lively vein ; but we regret to say that the temper shown is often unscientific and the tone vulgar .

		At the most , the author gets but glimpses of
Island	LOCATION	life ; yet he writes in a most assertive and even pugnacious manner , as witness particularly his savage denunciation of the missionaries .

		And yet , as a recent sketch of the status of
Polynesia	ORGANIZATION	, the book has considerable value and interest .

		It has no general map of the route , but is provided with nu - merous and striking illustrations .

		Much the best of recent books on
Alaska	LOCATION	that we have met with is '' Through the Gold-Fields of
Alaska	LOCATION	to Bering Straits , '' by Mr.
Harry De Windt	PERSON	.

		Mr.
De Windt	PERSON	, who is evidently a professional traveller , attempted a journey from
New York	LOCATION	to
Paris	LOCATION	by land ; but he succeeded only in reaching
Fort St. Michaels	LOCATION	, on the Yukon , where he learned that Bering Straits were not practicable for a crossing on the ice .

		So he had recourse to the
U. S. Steamer	PERSON	'' Bear , '' which landed him at Oumwaidjik , on the Siberian side of the Straits .

		Here he was in virtual captivity among the Tchuktchi savages for some months , vainly endeavoring to get forwarded to
Ana	LOCATION	- drysk .

		Matters finally began to look serious ; but he was at length rescued by a passing whaler .

		Mr.
De Windt	PERSON	's story of his Tchuktchi experiences is extremely interesting , though we suspect that most readers will be chiefly attracted by the first part of the book , wherein is a vivid account of the
Klon	PERSON	- dike region , through which the author passed , by way of the Chilkoot pass , not long before the great gold discoveries .

		Alaska he regards as '' one of the few countries of the world where , so far as travelling facilities are concerned , money goes for nothing .

		Here all grades are equal , from the government official to the
San Francisco	LOCATION	tough . ' ''

		The journey to
Dawson City	LOCATION	he describes as '' passed under cir - cumstances compared to which the roughest work 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, in other wild lands is mere child 's play * '' At one place '' the trail lies through a dense , swampy forest , and half the distance is barely covered when we are literally driven back by clouds of mosquitoes .

		The air is black with the pests , which attack as with almost alarming ferocity .

		For the first time I no longer doubt
Cooper	PERSON	's assertion that the strongest men sometimes break down and give way to tears under their sufferings . ''

		Mr. De Windt greatly ad - mires the Alaskan scenery , which resembles
Switzer	PERSON	- land .

		The account of the Klondike country is brought down to date .

		We can recommend this book as a very capable and entertaining book of travels .

		It is well furnished with illustrations and with a map of the route , and the paper and the presswork are a delight to the eye .

		so far does it depart from the ordinary conventions of romance , so filled is it with the sense of a close communion with nature , and so radiant with sheer imaginative beauty .

		It is one of those rare produc - tions that compel immediate acceptance as literature in the classical meaning of the term , and silence all critical questionings by the supreme excellence of the achievement which they embody .

		Some notion of what it is may perhaps be conveyed by asking the reader to think of a romance by
William Morris	PERSON	blended with the high spirits of a Zenda tale .

		It has the grace of the one and the action of the other , and its local habitation is as far to seek as in either of these illustrative cases .

		Whether we are to think of
France	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	when absorbed in its pages matters but little , and our fancy is left free to range through the centuries of medieevalism if we even care to wonder into what particular period of the world 's chronicle we are transported .

		The book is a joy to read and to remember , a source of clean and pure delight to the spiritual sense , a triumph of romance reduced to the essentials , and interpreted with a mastery of expression that is well-nigh be - yond praise .

		Both fiction and actual life have afforded numer - ous instances of love affairs between Englishmen and Japanese maidens , and the novelists , at any rate , have usually given an ideal coloring to the relation , and sought in the comparison to put our Western loves to shame .

		It is evidently for the purpose of showing the other side of the shield that Mr.
Carlton Dawe	PERSON	has written his story of '' A Bride of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' and , although we think he has exaggerated the con - sequences of this particular form of mixed marriage , it is undeniable that he has given a powerful por - trayal of the situation from his own point of view .

		The book is unpleasant , yet one that we would not have missed reading .

		Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's new novel , '' Helbeck of Bannisdale , '' comes to our table unheralded by the puff preliminary or other cheap devices for creating an anticipatory prejudice in its favor , and the fact that it has gone hastily through the press is evi - denced by a proof-reading so careless that we find it difficult to recognize the workmanship of a pub - lishing house whose name usually stands for the most fastidious accuracy in the mechanical details of book-making .

		Perhaps the first thing to say about the book considered as literature is to record the fact that it harks back to Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	'' period , and marks the abandonment for the time being of her concern in the social prob - lems of the time .

		The problem here presented is the religious one , and , as before , the religious prob - lem in its inmost spiritual essence , while the conflict in the present case is sharper than that to which
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	succumbed , and the issue more tragic .

		In the earlier work , we were made to con - template the struggle of a strong intellectual nature with the blind forces of religions dogmatism , and the outcome left the hero morally triumphant although physically overthrown .

		In the present
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 instance the antagonism is between a woman bred in the atmosphere of rationalism , strong indeed in will , but without the intellectual equipment she so sorely needs , and the most rigid and exacting form of Catholic belief .

		The conflict proves too unequal for the heroine , and she finds refuge only in self - destruction .

		That two strenuous natures , differing radically in their religious views , can not find even in the strongest love for one another the bond neces - sary for happiness seems to be Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's thesis ; and out of this fundamental intellectual incompati - bility her tragedy springs .

		This difficulty has formed the basis of many a novel before '' Helbeck of Ban - nisdale , '' and as usually presented we have fre - quently had occasion to describe the resulting es - trangement as morbid if not absolutely immoral .

		We hesitate to use such terms to characterize the solution here offered , for , however untypical , we feel that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has created for us two human beings whose conduct , under the given circumstances , was nothing less than inevitable . ''

		Love is enough '' is a formula that will not fit with
Helbeck	PERSON	and
Laura	LOCATION	; but we are constrained to say , while admit - ting the full importance of the religious tempera - ment in sweetening life and strengthening character , that it is fortunate there are few fanatics of Hel - beck 's sort , and few women with
Laura	ORGANIZATION	's unbalanced nature .

		Yet Helbeck commands our admiration , much as Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's Brand demands it ; and the fact that the moral triumph remains with him rather than with her is a conspicuous illustration of the fairness with which Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has handled a contro - versial matter which clearly enlists her sympathies upon the other side .

		As far as development of the action goes , many of her pages might be spared , for she has not been able to keep the philosophical es - sayist out of her book .

		But these superfluous pages are so ripened in thought and so chastened in sym - pathy that from another point of view we would not willingly miss them .

		That this novel overshadows all but the very best of contemporary fiction goes without saying . ''

		The Making of a Prig '' is a charming story compounded of strictly familiar ingredients .

		A young man is laid up by accident in a country town , and comes under the ministrations of a young girl , too innocent to know that all the while she is read - ing and talking with him she is also falling in love .

		He , on the other hand , is interested and amused by her fresh and emotional nature , and anticipates nothing serious .

		Afterwards , she goes to
London	LOCATION	in search of employment , impelled not by necessity but by a quixotic impulse to do something for her - self , and has all the harrowing experiences of which we have so often read .

		There is also a country youth , affectionate and slangy , who loves her in a dumb sort of way , but clearly has no chance after the brilliant stranger has appeared upon the scene .

		The latter discovers , in the end , that the feeling of camaraderie has given place to something deeper , and the story closes happily , after the proper series of prettily pathetic passages .

		The title is hardly justified , for the heroine is nowise priggish in any ordinary sense , but a very sweet girl , swayed by natural impulse , and womanly in the best meaning of the term .

		`` Seiiorita Montenar '' should prove a popular book just now .

		It is about Spaniards and war - ships and fighting , and other subjects that engage the mind of the excited public .

		The fact that it relates to the Chilean war of independence does not make any real difference , for Chileans and Cubans are much the same thing , and American readers dearly love to take a whack at Spanish tyranny anywhere .

		It is , moreover , an admirable story of its sort , brim full of perilous adventure , and placed amid scenes sufficiently novel to give it an added zest .

		The days of the great O'Higgins live for us again in these pages , and the heart warms to the new world patriotism of his followers .

		We commend Mr.
Crouch	PERSON	's story to amateurs of romantic adven - ture .

		Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	, after essaying with doubt - ful success one or two forms of serious fiction , has again opened the vein of social satire which won him his reputation with '' The Green Carnation , '' and produced one of the most entertaining books that we have read for many a day . ''

		The Lon - doners '' has all of the epigrammatic wit that made Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	seem so preternaturally clever in his first book , and it has , in addition , enough of a plot to stimulate the interest , and keep the reader from being merely dazed by the incessant heat-lightning of the author 's satirical fancy .

		The treatment is so broadly farcical that the book can not be called a novel in any serious sense , but it is rarely amusing for all that , and makes the best of reading for an idle
summer	DATE	day . ''

		The Story of a Play '' is a pleasing addition to the list of the charming trivialities to which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has chiefly devoted himself of late years .

		It now seems a confirmed habit with him to select for treatment some closely circumscribed phase of experience , to make it the subject of the most search - ing and minute observation , and to develope its utmost possibilities .

		This intensive method of lit - erary cultivation is the method best calculated to yield artistic results ; and , if the recent work of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	does sometimes suggest the carving of cherry-stones , the carving is very neatly done .

		Few subjects are more hackneyed than that of the bud - ding man of letters seeking to make his way in an unappreciative world , and it requires some daring to bring it once more into service .

		In the present case , the aspirant for fame pins his fortunes to play - writing , which gives the author an opportunity to introduce the chief types of player-folk into his pages , and to illuminate their ways with many a flash of gentle humor .

		By making the wife of the hero collaborate in the work of writing the play , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is enabled to add to his collection an - other of those examples of femininity that usually prove so exasperating to the sex that they assume to represent .

		It is all very well by way of semi - 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, satirical pastime , but women are sometimes rational beings , the score or more of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's novels to the contrary notwithstanding .

		A book by Colonel
Richard Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	is always welcome , even if it be , as in the case of ''
Pearce Amerson	PERSON	's Will , '' only the repnblication of a novelette that has already done duty in the pages of a monthly magazine .

		While not equal to the author 's strongest work `` Widow
Guthrie	PERSON	, '' for example , the present story is charmingly writ - ten , of geniality all compact , and an admirable pic - ture of manners in
Georgia	LOCATION	half a century ago .

		In this field
Colonel Johnston	PERSON	is without a rival ; there is no other writer living who has his freshness of recollection combined with his instinct for the effec - tive form of literary expression , and his books are at the same time acceptable works of fiction and important historical documents .

		We have often wondered why , in the present revival of historical romance , the age of the Italian despots should not have been made to furnish forth a greater proportion of our current literature .

		The Elizabethan dramatists well knew the value of this material , but the Victorian novelists have made slight use of it .

		To be sure , we had the other day a romance dealing with the conspiracy of
Fieschi	PERSON	and the despotism of the
Doria	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	now gives us a romance of
Gian Galeazzo	PERSON	and the conquest of
Milan	LOCATION	, but there is room for many more workers in this attractive field .

		Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	's book is neither good nor bad .

		It follows a familiar plan , is correctly elaborated in accord - ance with the literary tradition which it affects , dis - plays some knowledge of the period concerned , and is written in a careful and fluent style .

		Few historical figures so lend themselves to the purposes of romance as does that of
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	, and we are not surprised to find still an - other novelist attracted by that theme .

		In '' The King 's Henchman , '' Mr.
William Henry Johnson	PERSON	tells a tale of the conventional pattern , neither better nor worse than fifty others that have recently been told , dealing with subtle intrigues and fierce battles , the woes of a persecuted damsel and the bravery of her chosen champion .

		For once , however , the hero does not get his reward , and is left disconsolate in the end a fact which will hardly recommend the romance to the sort of audience for which all such romances are written .

		We find it difficult to rediscover in '' The Con - tinental Dragoon '' the author of '' An Enemy to the King . ''

		In that spirited piece of fiction we had swift dramatic action and a reasonable degree of romantic probability .

		In the new novel , on the other hand , we have a situation so improbable that even the most hardened reader of this sort of book remains in a constant state of revolt , while the nar - rative is so clogged in its action by the historical material introduced that the reader loses patience completely .

		It takes some fifty pages of undigested Colonial history to get the story fairly started , and the feeling of exasperation caused by this unhappy overture is not abated when the preposterous nature 1 of the plot begins to be unfolded .

		There are a few j pages of brilliant writing in the book , but they do not make up for its general shapelessness . ''

		At the the Sign of the Silver Crescent , '' by Mrs.
Helen Choate Prince	PERSON	, is the third novel by this attractive and thoughtful writer .

		Like its two pre - decessors , it deals with the subject that Mrs.
Prince	PERSON	seems to have made her own French life as it exists in the provinces rather than in the capital .

		While the characterization is superficial , and the criticism of life somewhat narrowed , rather by the obvious limitations of the writer than by the exigen - cies of her theme , there is a well-managed plot , and the interest is maintained at a moderate tension throughout the work .

		The book is pleasing rather than strong , better fitted for entertainment than for illumination . ''

		Soutien de Famille , '' the novel completed for publication by
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	not long before his death , is now published in an English transla - tion , and bears for a title `` The Head of the Fam - ily . ''

		The translation is by Mr.
Levin Carnac	PERSON	, and is far from being a good one .

		The charm of the author 's style has almost wholly evaporated during the process , and there are even occasional lapses from ordinary correct English .

		The novel , which is here prefaced by Professor
Cohn	PERSON	's sketch of Daudet which first appeared in '' The Bookman , '' will make no perceptible addition to the author 's rep - utation .

		Being by
Daudet	PERSON	, it is , of course , an admir - able piece of work , but it does not retain the fresh - ness of the earlier masterpieces , nor is it really worthy of Daudet from the standpoints of construc - tion and characterization .

		The hero is a worthless fellow , consumed by vanity , and falling without effort to resist into a vicious life .

		It is only ironically that he is '' soutien de famille , '' and the real burden of sustaining his widowed mother is left to the so - cially unattractive younger son , who bravely accepts the responsibility , and is too stupid to understand the despicable character of his brilliant elder brother .

		The final act of the hero , who enlists because nothing else is left him to do , is a mere piece of sentimental bravado , and does nothing to rehabilitate his char - acter in the mind of any intelligent reader , although we rather suspect that the author intended the act to have some such effect .

		The delicious inconse - quence of the hero 's closing injunction , to the effect that his son be not allowed to study Latin , is but one instance out of many which go to show how much of its old-time cunning was lost by the hand of the author during the years of suffering that brought his life to its term . ''

		The Disaster , '' by MM .

		Paul and
Victor Mar	PERSON	- gueritte , is an act of piety rather than a work of art , a day-by-day chronicle of the war between
France	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	rather than a piece of historical fiction .

		It has even less of artistic quality than
M. Zola	PERSON	's La I -RRB- i : li ; `` idi ; . ''

		and that work is defective enough in construction .

		But '' The Disaster '' is so sincere a book , and succeeds in so enforcing both tin - hor -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 rors of war in the abstract and the lesson of the degradation wrought in
France	LOCATION	by twenty years of a corrupt Empire , that it becomes impressive by sheer accumulation of detail and weight of moral earnestness .

		It deals chiefly , as the translator tells us in his well - written introduction , with the opera - tions of the army of the Rhine , '' the long agony of the finest troops in the French army , day after day duped until the fatal hour of the capitulation of Metz by Bazaine . ''

		It is , moreover , the story of the conflict from the officer 's point of view , the story of gradual disillusionment , of growing despair , and of the birth of a new resolve in the younger genera - tion , the resolve to create a new and better
France	LOCATION	out of the wreck of the old .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		In a monograph on Charles the Great in the `` Foreign Statesmen '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Thomas Hodgkin	PERSON	well sustains his reputation as an accurate and en - tertaining writer of history .

		His excellent choice of language , together with a comprehensive historical knowledge which enables him to impress his facts by means of historical comparisons and contrasts , makes the book delightful and profitable reading .

		These historical parallels , which the author finds so readily , serve not only to heighten the interest but to fortify the memory and stimulate the ambition for further reading .

		For example , commenting upon the similarity of the policy of Clovis with that of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	says : '' Both men em - phatically fought ' for their own hands ' ; both were more intent on massing great countries under their sway than on really assimilating the possessions which they had already acquired ; both in different ways made , or tried to make , the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	an instrument of their ambition ; and both seemed to have looked upon
Europe	LOCATION	, or so much of it as they could acquire , as a big estate to be divided among their children or relations . ''

		What could more clearly picture the personal , non-national character of the policy of Clovis , or more certainly impress the memory ?

		While the life and government of Charles the Great are described with simplicity and accuracy , the most valuable chapters in the book are devoted to the later Merovingians , and to the Mayors of the
Palace	ORGANIZATION	.

		The position in the government held by these mayors , whether in
Neustria	LOCATION	or
Austrasia	LOCATION	, their powers , their limitations , and the conditions which led to a decrease of their control in the one state and an increase in the other , are matters which few historians have been able to state clearly .

		Mr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	, briefly , but with ample reference to and quotations from early authorities , has made plain much that has heretofore been only indefinitely stated .

		Although the title of the book is
Charles the Great	PERSON	, the more familiar compound ,
Charle	LOCATION	- magne , is used , in spite of the teaching of the late Professor
Freeman	PERSON	, who first protested against this form of the name .

		The author 's reason for some - times Gallicizing the title of the great Teutonic hero is that the name commonly used '' by its union of the Teutonic Karl with the Latin Magnus not inaptly symbolizes the blending of the German and Roman elements in the Frankish Empire . ''

		Only the trite remark that '' it reads like a romance '' can properly de - scribe the autobiography of the
Chev	ORGANIZATION	- alier de Pontgibaud , a French volunteer of the American War of Independence -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		After numerous adventures , including an escape from prison in his native
France	LOCATION	, the author arrived a penniless adventurer in
America	LOCATION	and became a pro- tege of the chivalric Marquis de la Fayette at '' Valley Forges . ''

		He followed the fortunes of the Revolutionary War , was present when Andre * was captured , and finally saw
Rochambeau	LOCATION	wave the prof - fered sword of Cornwallis toward General Washing - ton .

		He returned to
France	LOCATION	in time to be driven out in the French Revolution , and came back to
America	LOCATION	to join the colony of Emigres who embraced , in their new stations , farmers , merchants , market women , and an elephant exhibitor .

		The changed fortunes of the royalists after the fall of Napoleon restored the
Chevalier	PERSON	to a quiet life in
France	LOCATION	, and gave opportunity of writing his reminiscences .

		The easy style in which these are composed gives pleasant little glimpses of those personalities which are com - monly cloaked by the glamor of heroes .

		At one time , being with
Lafayette	LOCATION	in a vessel off the coast of
New Foundland	ORGANIZATION	and threatened with death in a violent storm , he relates that the young
Marquis	PERSON	, who was very seasick in addition to his other woes , began to philosophize '' on the emptiness of glory and fame .

		* Diable !

		I have done well , certainly .

		At my time of life barely twenty years of age , with my name , rank , and fortune , and after having married Mile , de Noailles , to leave everything and serve as a breakfast for codfish ! ' ''

		But a kind fate restored him to the arms of the surprised
Madame de la Fayette	ORGANIZATION	, who was brought by
Queen Marie Antoinette	PERSON	in her carriage to meet him .

		Col.
Higginson	PERSON	's Of the principal movements in life '' Cheerful and letters in the last three-quarters Yesterdays . ''

		Q ^ ig cen tury , perhaps no man now living can say more truthfully than Mr.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	, '' All of which I saw , and part of which I was . ''

		Moreover , few are masters of such a happy art in narration ; consequently , Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	's `` Cheerful Yesterdays '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- would be hard to surpass as a book of reminiscences .

		Without falling into undue discursiveness on per - sonal matters , the author contrives to throw that light upon his period and locality which it is the special merit of books of this class to bestow .

		Life at
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, when
Commencement Day	ORGANIZATION	was such an event that
Boston	LOCATION	banks were closed and 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	,
Boston	LOCATION	gentlemen repaired to
Cambridge	LOCATION	to keep open house while the ceremonies lasted ; American literature coming to its birth through the cohesion of those six leaders whom we still count as our greatest , yet who were so unlike in many ways that we were spared any clique or a literary yoke of any kind ; the unquiet epoch of the Transcendental - ists , '' these and other things are portrayed with a picturesqueness all the author 's own , and in a way to emphasize the great changes of our time .

		But our author has been no less closely in touch with affairs than with literature .

		The born reformer is shown in his eager part in the fugitive slave epoch , in the
Kansas	LOCATION	struggles , in the
John Brown	PERSON	episode , in the Civil War as colonel of the first colored regi - ment , in every recent progressive movement in the halls of legislation in his own
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Naturally , one who has seen the accomplishment of so many good things is optimistic in regard to the future ; and the full text of the
Wordsworth	PERSON	lines which furnish the title are entirely applicable : '' A man he seems of cheerful yesterdays .

		And confident to-morrows . ''

		It would hardly be fair to the authors ITS.TJ * '' '' '' * of `` Under the Stars , and Other Songs of the Sea '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to delay mention of their little book until it shall be convenient to survey the poetical product of three months or more in our usual way .

		These verses are intended for immediate ` consumption , being songs and ballads of the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	, written to meet a pressing need for war poetry ; and Messrs.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	and
Barrett Eastman	PERSON	, who have thus oblig - ingly assumed upon short notice the difficult role of
American Campbells	ORGANIZATION	, have every right to expect a responsive welcome for their efforts .

		The two col - laborators in this production have written eight poems apiece , most of them bearing the marks of haste , yet spirited , breezy , and not unsatisfying withal . ''

		The
First American Sailors	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Rice	PERSON	, is a really fine ballad , and is likely to be remem - bered .

		We also like Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	's '' Brothers of One Blood , '' both for its form and its sentiment .

		These seem to us the best of the poems , although there are several others that we have read with a considerable degree of pleasure .

		Tkt t * ppre * titm The suppression of seriousness among oftervnunru women particularly among college - among women .

		WO men and club - women is the motive of a little volume by Mrs.
Helen Watterson Moody	PERSON	, entitled The Unquiet Sex '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The author adopts , perhaps as suitable to this purpose , a popular manner of airiness and inconsequence ; ahe makes , here and there , a radical mistake , as in asserting that the typical woman-collegian goes in for reforms '' ; and club - women may claim , with a show of reason , that her view of their clubs is not a broad view .

		Nevertheless , she speaks some certain truths , for example , that the modern wo - man is still '' on nervous tiptoe '' ; that club-work is apt to be taken with too much gravity ; and that the college-girl is conscious of her type , but will cease to be when her grandmother is known as a bachelor of arts .

		There are also some sensible things in the little book which are not of the nature of accusations .

		Such is the contention that '' no club can do more than receive the result of individual scholarship and culture , or offer more than mere stimulation '' ; and such , too , is the statement that , in any field of work , an emphasis on the fact that women are new-comers must tend to the lowering of wages .

		The preface gives fair warning that the author will speak on but one side of the subject , and it is probably for this reason that nothing is said of the club-member who takes her club easily , or of the college-girl who is so fearful of being considered '' serious '' that she goes to unnecessary lengths of flippancy .

		The attitude of the book is quite clearly indicated by the an - nouncement that it is '' for men , women , and the Unquiet Sex . ''

		By some strange lapse into serious - ness , it has marginal notes .

		One does not read far in Mr.
Lau	PERSON	- wnce Button 's A Boy I Knew , and Four Dogs '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- before discov - ering that the Boy '' in evidence was none other than the author himself .

		The sketches originally appeared in '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	, '' and may be read with pleasure by old and young .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	seems to have been in the main a boy of the usual type , what is approvingly called a '' regular boy , '' and to have had the `` regular boy 's '' stock experiences , such , for instance , as falling in love with a girl much older than himself .

		Mr.
Button	PERSON	's flame was called
Phoebe Hawkins	PERSON	he remembers putting himself on record at the time as ' loving his love with an F , because she was Feeby . ''

		Mr. 1 1 niton 's retrospect is tinged with a quaint humor that savors a little of
Mark Twain	PERSON	, yet there is a manifest note of tender senti - ment throughout .

		A number of family portraits , evidently from old daguerreotypes and photographs , form a novel feature of the little volume .

		Intide views of railroad life .

		The good graphic quality and rugged realism of Mr.
Herbert Elliott	PERSON	Ham - blen 's On Many Seas '' are again manifest in his capital picture of the career of a - railroad man '' entitled The General Manager 's Story '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		While the story is cast in the form of fiction , the experiences are , we should judge , real , and the writer 's own , though this assumption involves the inference that he has been a '' railroad man '' as well as a sailor .

		At any rate , the book is a most realistic one , showing an intimate knowledge of the life and the characters it portrays .

		A number of spirited illustrations materially enliven the text .

		_ Some of the late
George Du Maurier	PERSON	's entertaining chats about his art and gome Q f hig old notably Leech and
Keene	PERSON	, are collected in a dainty volume of a hundred or so pages entitled '' Social Du Manner and tome of hit fellow craJUmen ,
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 25 Pictorial Satire '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A liberal number of specimen drawings are given , in which
Keene	PERSON	's artistic superiority to his popular predecessor on '' Punch '' is clearly apparent .

		Leech 's drawings are mostly slight things , but the fun conveyed is always kindly and wholesome , if sometimes rather mild even for '' Punch . ''

		There are three por - traits in the volume .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Dr. and Mrs.
Frankland	PERSON	's memoir of Pasteur -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is a model of biography .

		Clear , concise , and complete , it photographs the man without using the art of the retoucher , and tells the story of his achievements .

		As recorded on his mausoleum in the Institut Pasteur in
Paris	LOCATION	, these were investigations of molecular dissym - metry ,
1848	DATE	; fermentations ,
1857	DATE	; generations called spontaneous ,
1862	DATE	; maladies of wine and beer , 1863-71 ; diseases of the silk worm ,
1865	DATE	; infectious plagues and immunity against them , 1877-80 ; protection against hydrophobia ,
1885	DATE	.

		Any one of these should have insured his fame .

		Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	has many titles to the grati - tude of students interested in American history , and none more clear than that which is due him for his edi - tion of '' The Federalist , '' just published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a volume of eight hundred pages .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	has gone very thoroughly into the questions of disputed authorship , and provided a great variety of apparatus including an extensive and searching index .

		The work is admirably done in all important respects , and should be upon the desk of every teacher of Amer - ican constitutional history . ''

		He by no means makes the impres - sion of an insane man .

		His eyes are beautiful and clear .

		He has retained much of his old dignity and elegance , but he speaks little , and the paralysis shows itself in his heavy and unsteady gate and movements .

		He is per - fectly ignorant of the awful fate that has befallen him , and this fact I feel to be a great comfort .

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		OUR ships of war are the one subject about which the people of this country are coming to speak and think by day and dream by night ; in which they are the most deeply interested , and of which they are growing to be the most proud .

		Ten yean ago we bowed our heads in shame when our navy waa spoken of .

		To-day we have , for its size , perhaps the finest navy in the world .

		Ten years from to-day we shall likely have one of the largest , and be able to victoriously contest the sea with far mightier nations than
Spain	LOCATION	.

		In this volume is given an admirable presentation of the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	, including its history , from the first shot of the Revolution to the sinking of the
Maine	LOCATION	; a lucid description of the development of the modern types of war vessels , and a detailed account of all the ships that make up the navy of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		To those who wish to know of what a modern navy consists , what is meant by conning tower , turret , barbette , rapid-fire guns , torpedoes , mines , the resistance of armor and the penetration * of projectiles , and all the multitudinous matters which have to do with modern naval science and engineering , this book may be heartily commended .

		In short , it is a museum of all that concerns the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	, alike in its history , its ships , and its development THE AMERICAN IN

		The intensely dramatic life of

		The excite - ment of the times , well portrayed , carries the reader breathlessly along the current of the story , while through it all runs the stern , courageous morality of the great reformer that lends a noble thrill to the interest it arouses and holds .

		The author of '' A Yellow Aster '' already has a wide public among readers of fiction on both sides of the sea .

		Hence this second book from the same pen will be read with the double interest of contrast with the earlier suc - cess and of curiosity concerning its own plot and char - acters .

		These both sustain the reputation already acquired by Iota , and it will be surprising if many readers do not give the palm to '' Poor Max . ''

		With all the cleverness of its predecessor , it has a substantial quality of its own .

A. Conan Doyle	PERSON	has a splendid chance to use his descriptive powers , and splendid material to draw con - trasts in nationalities and to compare civilization with barbarity .

		This he has done very successfully , and the ' Desert Drama ' forms an interesting narrative .

		Be - sides his splendid description of the desert , and bis por - traiture of the cruel Dervishes and their fierce religious teal , the author has given each of his characters a dis - tinctiveness which is worked out very cleverly . ''

		52 ANNO UNCEMENT .

		By arrangement with
Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the owners of '' The Chap-Book , '' the sub - scription list , the name , and the good-will of that publication have been purchased by
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, which will fill out all subscriptions .

		The last issue of '' The Chap-Book '' was that of
July 1	DATE	.

		The magazine was first published on
May 15 , 1894	DATE	, in
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, by
Messrs. Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	, both members of which firm were then undergrad - uates in
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was in form a small duodecimo pamphlet , issued semi-monthly , and was at first meant to be little more than an attractive kind of circular for advertising the books published by the firm .

		But its instant and somewhat unex - pected popularity led its publishers at once into an attempt to make the magazine an organ of the younger American writers , and a means of intro - ducing to the public new and curious developments in foreign literatures . ''

		The Chap-Book '' was either praised as being up-to-date , or denounced as being '' decadent , '' and had considerable vogue .

		Publica - tions which were evidently imitations of it , both in form and spirit , sprang up in many quarters , and its editors have collected something like one hundred and fifty of these curious ventures .

		In
October , 1894	DATE	, the periodical was removed from
Cambridge	LOCATION	to
Chicago	LOCATION	, and since that date has been continuously issued from the latter city on the first and fifteenth of every month .


May 1 , 1896	DATE	, it was transferred by its original owners to the new publishing firm of
Herbert S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has been edited from the start by Mr.
Herbert S. Stone	PERSON	, with the assistance of Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	at the beginning , and of Mr.
Harrison Garfield Rhodes	PERSON	during the last four years .

		In
January , 1897	DATE	, '' The Chap-Book '' was enlarged to quarto size , and introduced reviews of current literature as a prominent feature of its contents .

		This change brought with it a marked increase of dignity and authority ; it became more serious than it had been , yet it did not cease to be entertaining .

		Editorially , it was conducted with independence and vigor , and occupied to a considerable extent a field which it had made its own .

		One hundred numbers were issued altogether , sixty-four in the smaller and thirty-six in the larger form .

		When purchased by
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, four numbers of the ninth volume had appeared . ''

		The Chap-Book '' has had a distinguished list of contributors , including most of the poets , novelists , and essayists , both of
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, whose names are widely known to the read - ing public , and its pages have furnished forth the contents of several volumes of stories and essays .

		We take much pleasure , upon this occasion of join - ing its fortunes with our own , in paying this tribute to its sturdy and valuable services in behalf of good literature .

		By this accession
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	gains a new and important constituency , which it will of course seek to make permanently its own .

		While features likely to increase its interest and value may be added , this journal will in the main adhere to the well-defined aims and principles which have governed it for nearly twenty years and have given it the favor and support of the literary public of
America	LOCATION	.

		38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, LOCAL COLOR AND ETERNAL TRUTH .

		Literature is an artistic product , as truly as sculpture or architecture .

		All the fine arts have for their aim perfection of form , the crea - tion of beauty , but , to a Puritan at least , nothing seems permanently beautiful which fails to suggest heroic human endeavor .

		Ar - tists must , indeed , take their material , and in some degree their suggestions , from their indi - vidual and local environment .

		Yet of all crea - tive work , the expression of thought in language is least limited by space or time .

		The
Erech	LOCATION	- thenm is a ruin , and can never leave its deso - lated
Acropolis	LOCATION	; the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	torso has outlived its proper setting it stands lost and dethroned in a gallery of antiques ; but Homer remains crowned and serene , as clear-voiced as ever , in far higher honor , indeed , than the singer in his lifetime can ever have dreamed of being .

		Still , all the creations of genius are imperishably beautiful .

		Perhaps their greatest helpfulness to men lies precisely herein : that they lift us , in imagination , quite out of all the cramping limitations besetting our daily routine out of mere reality into the ideal world .

		Possibly no group of creative writers ever fitted more naturally and easily into their set - ting than the authors of
Concord	LOCATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Yet , while
Emerson	PERSON	and his friends will always be known as the
New England	LOCATION	poets , their origin , their life , their influence is neither chiefly sectional nor even merely national .


New England	LOCATION	did not create them , did not own them , can not contain them .

		As truly as that earliest singer whose time is disputed , whose name is denied , and to whose wide-wandering ghost an earthly abiding-place will doubtless never be granted , so these whom we fondly call our own are in truth a treasure forevermore .

		Nor do we turn to them chiefly , or most con - fidently , for a better knowledge of
New England	LOCATION	life .

		Sir Launf al is at least as precious to many of us as ` Zekiel , or as
Hosea	PERSON	himself ; Donatello and
Miriam	PERSON	outshine the paler pair of our own folk standing beside them .

		Whittier himself has sung
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	's march through
Frederick	PERSON	, and even the relief of far-off Luck - now , more thrillingly perhaps more truly than
Floyd Ireson	PERSON	's ride .

		It has sometimes been proposed , as a grace - ful tribute to our most popular authors , that their statues should be set up in public parks , surrounded by the ideal beings who are the creatures of their genius .

		In
Longfellow	LOCATION	's case this would surely include
Hiawatha	LOCATION	and his
Minnehaha	LOCATION	,
Evangeline	PERSON	and
Gabriel	PERSON	, per - haps also that kingly pair ,
Robert	PERSON	of
Sicily	LOCATION	and
Olaf	PERSON	the Dane ; certainly we could not spare dear
Elsie	PERSON	, who offers her young life so gladly for her prince , in the
Legenda Aurea	LOCATION	.

		Yet these favorites are almost wholly folk who never could have breathed our air , or understood a word of our speech .

		What is so evidently true of this poet -LRB- still the dearest to the national heart -RRB- is quite as true of the masters in fiction everywhere .

		A great author never merely sketches such an individual man or woman as he and we have known .

		Every true stroke delineates more the universal than the particular .

		Is Andro - mache a Grecian like her minstrel , a Trojan like her husband , or the Cilician daughter of Ee ` tion ?

		No one ever cared to ask .

		She is the type of sorrowing wifehood in the bitter hours of war and bereavement .

		As in Homer 's day , so in ours .

		Romola ,
Miriam	PERSON	, and even
Lorna	PERSON	, are neither living individuals nor racial types .

		They are merely typical woman-souls .

		Each is an ideal of nineteenth-century woman - hood ; but we are made to see , too , how in her , as in us , all the past experience of humanity is crystallized into expression , all serener future possibilities are foreshadowed .

		The same test may be safely applied even to the prince of artists .

		Ophelia has no Danish feature ,
Juliet	PERSON	is Italian only in her absolute impulsive naturalness : it never occurred to us that
Rosalind	PERSON	is a French demoiselle !

		Neither has the great magician metamorphosed them all into English girls , and assigned them to the Elizabethan age or to any other generation .

		They abide in a fairer land than merry En - gland or sunny
France	LOCATION	, in statelier homes than Veronese palace or royal castle of
Denmark	LOCATION	: for they dwell lovingly together in the noble realm of art and ideal beauty .

		That which is most precious , and most lasting , in a poem , a tale , or even an essay , is least distinctively En - glish , or American , or French .

		It is '' Euripides the Human , '' Montaigne the human ,
Burns	PERSON	the human , whose influence lives and works long - lasting as the world .

		The '' Scarlet Letter '' has a vivid local set - ting , and so has '' Heart of Mid-Lothian . ''

		Neither is a masterpiece merely , or chiefly , because it is a more or less accurate study of Puritanism in
New England	LOCATION	, or of Scottish life .

		Hawthorne 's genius -LRB- and perhaps
Scott	PERSON	's also -RRB- is revealed , rather , in the treatment of that most universal of problems , the vain attempt to escape from the inherent penalty of sin .

		As
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 Rembrandt throws the high light on human faces , so does every great artist , whatever the material in which he works .

		Tito is man tempted and fallen ;
Savonarola	LOCATION	, like
Romola	LOCATION	, is man rising heroic from temptation and from the bewilderment of self-delusion .

		Indeed ,
Savonarola	LOCATION	's right to appear in the book must be vindicated , if at all , by the part he plays in the central plot of the romance .

		Whether the real reformer of
Florence	LOCATION	was just such a man , whether the background is archaeologically accurate : these are alike minor details , hardly touching aesthetic criticism at all .

		The recent death of our most influential writer reminds us of the question once so fiercely debated , whether ''
Uncle Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' was a truthful picture of slavery days in
Ken	PERSON	- tucky and
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		If it could be proved that no black family was ever separated , no innocent negro ever flogged , since
Jamestown	LOCATION	was founded , the swarthy hero of a baseless romance would remain as deathless as
Homer	ORGANIZATION	's impossible son of the sea-nymph , with his magic armor and his talking horse !

		Both are truly drawn , since they act in response to the most universal human motives .

		No other test of artistic quality is essential .

		Yet we must once more reverse the shield of truth .

		While the artist 's thought is thus free and eternal , the form in which he clothes it is largely shaped for him by usage and tradition , even before he himself is born .

		Phidias , the pupil of his Hellenic masters , working under the
Attic	LOCATION	sky , was not merely forced to use his native Pentelic marble , instead of
New Hamp	LOCATION	- shire granite or '' staff '' : it was equally im - possible or inconceivable for him , upon the
Acropolis	LOCATION	, to rear a Florentine dome or a Gothic spire .

		Even so , we who speak and write the En - glish tongue can not escape the wise do not even struggle against the masterful influence of the myriad workers who through so many centuries have moulded and perfected
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	speech .

		We , and those who form our audience , have been from infancy the pupils of Chaucer -LRB- Professor Child would have bidden me say , of Ca3dmon -RRB- and of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and of all the goodly array between .

		Whatever is traditional in all our arts , except perhaps music , is chiefly and primarily English in form , though it is largely Greek in spirit .

		Moreover , free as the writer is , he , especially , works in materials which have already been shaped for him : even , it may be , moulded over and over before him , by weak hands as well as strong .

		-LRB- A really fresh rhyme brings us nowadays almost a shock of surprise .

		In this matter our mother-tongue , with its excessive variety of endings , gives us rather step-motherly fare . -RRB-

		We sometimes seem to ourselves almost like those late Romans who shaped their structures wholly out of blocks , ready carved , taken from the earlier buildings .

		THE DIAL , especially , has long waged an effective warfare , of argument and ridicule , against the notion that American literature in general , and sectional Western literature in particular , should cut loose from the English traditions that make up the past , and grow from roots deep-struck in a virginal native soil .

		It is in fact only very incompletely , if at all , that literature in
America	LOCATION	can ever tear itself free from the parent stock in what
Hawthorne	PERSON	was fond of calling '' Our Old Home . ''

		It is precisely the vital English element in our lan - guage and literature , in our political and social instincts , in our entire civilization indeed , that has enabled us in any hopeful degree to assimi - late that chaotic mass of humanity which year by year has poured into the great gateway of
Manhattan	LOCATION	.

		The last thing a far-sighted patriot can desire is a weakening of any ties which still bind us to the happiest of our many father - lands , the island stronghold '' Where Freedom broadens slowly down From precedent to precedent . ''

		May even the exigencies of politics never again require an outburst of half-sincere jealousy , or unreasoning rage , against our next of kin , '' such as of late o'er pale Britannia past ! ''

		But at any rate , the sincere student of letters must see clearly that we -LRB- I speak now for the `` old New Englanders '' -RRB- are twice-transplanted Anglo-Saxon folk , who , in the forms of our speech , as chiefly in the forms of our life , have been moulded by the long , slow centuries of English growth .

		And yet , so far as the instinct of the artist awakes in each man , the boundless universe is his .

		The environment in which he sets his gem , or his cathedral , may be as homely and familiar as
Maud Muller	PERSON	's farm : it may be the vaguest spot in '' desolate , windswept space . ''

		One thing only is essential : the presence , or the suggestion , of human beings , acting from mo - tives not wholly ignoble , as we ourselves might conceivably act , or wish that we had acted .

		Even Homer , or
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, or Sophocles , can teach us , directly , little more than what
Sidney	PERSON	said , and
Longfellow	PERSON	only echoed : '' Look , then , into thy heart , and write ! ''

		IrfKUTKNANT PEABY IN
NOBTHKBN GBKKNLAND	LOCATION	.

		* In all .

		Lieutenant
Peary	PERSON	has made five ex - cursions into the inhospitable regions near the eightieth parallel of north latitude .

		The first , in
1886	DATE	, was only a reconnoisanoe .

		The second and third , in 1891-92 and 1893-95 , were in a much larger sense preliminary , undertaken with the purpose of establishing a base of oper - ations whence it might be possible to launch an expedition to the northern pole .

		The fourth and fifth were simply
summer	DATE	trips made to secure certain notable meteoric masses discov - ered by him upon the
Greenland	LOCATION	coast .

		Previous to Lieutenant
Peary	PERSON	's journeys , the insular character of
Greenland	LOCATION	had been guessed but not determined .

		It was known only as a triangular area more than seventeen hundred miles in length from north to south , and about six hundred miles wide at the eight - ieth parallel of latitude .

		Of this area , only about twenty-five miles in width of selvedge along the western and part of the eastern shore was known to explorers and whale fishers , bleak in the few
summer days	DATE	, ice-bound through the long arctic winter , and peopled with only a few nomadic Eskimos .

		Everywhere this selvedge is interrupted by bays , inlets , and fiords , each headed by a glacier and each glacier launching its annual quota of the fleet of icebergs that become the dread of
Atlantic	LOCATION	sailors .

		Peary reasoned that these icebergs were the outcrop - ping of a broad glacial field or ice-cap covering the whole peninsula , rising gradually toward a central divide , and presenting a surface either rigidly frozen or often freshly covered with snow , which would be easily travelled upon a proper equipment of snow-shoes or ski .

		He farther conceived that an exploring party should consist of not more than two or three persons , hardy , sturdy , and determined , clothed like the natives , supplied with the most con - centrated foods , their impedimenta moved on sledges by dogs , which should be counted as provision on the foot , to be consumed by their companions as the burden of freight diminished .

		Once upon this highway , traversed as freely as the open sea , the explorer could easily reach a latitude limited only by the unknown northern NOBTHW ARD OvSR TH GREAT Io .

		coast of
Greenland	LOCATION	.

		From the point so reached , a small and determined band , with a like outfit , at a proper juncture might make a dash for the coveted acme of northern exploration .

		The reconnoisanoe of
1886	DATE	determined the possibility of using the ice-cap as a highway .

		The test was made by a journey eastward from
Disco Bay	LOCATION	.

		In about three weeks from start to return a trip was made to a point having an altitude of about 7500 feet and well within the central area of the ice-cap .

		The most important of Lieutenant
Peary	PERSON	's journeys , thongh not that which consumed the most time , was that of 1891-2 .

		With him went his wife and five assistants .

		McCormick
Bay	LOCATION	, near the northwestern angle of
Greenland	LOCATION	, was reached on
July 23	DATE	, after a voyage much delayed by ice .

		The season was already too much advanced to permit the undertaking of the great journey over the ice to the eastern angle of
Greenland	LOCATION	, which was the chief object of the expedition .

		Besides , a vicious tiller had worked loose in a storm and had broken the chief 's leg .

		During the enforced delay of an arctic winter , much valuable work was done in ethnological study and collection , which , how - ever , was but a side issue compared with the real purpose of the campaign .

		On the 3d of
May	DATE	, after most careful preparation , the '' Great White March '' was begun .

		The outfit was soon reduced to fourteen dogs , the lading of two sledges , and one companion .

		The jour - ney extended nearly six hundred miles , to
Navy Cliff	ORGANIZATION	at the head of Independence Bay , in lat - itude 81 37 ' 5 '' north , and longitude 34 5 ' west .

		On
June 5	DATE	the travellers had reached the summit of the divide , altitude 5700 feet .

		On
July 4	DATE	the terminus was reached .

		The season was midsummer ; flowers bloomed in abund - ance , birds and insects were plentiful , while musk-oxen were so many that the travellers readily secured all needful for themselves and for their dogs .

		After a brief rest on the 7th , the return began .

		Eight dogs only remained , and drew all the freight on a single sledge .

		In one month the journey was finished , the average marches being about twenty miles per diem .

		So much of the mission was accomplished as the determination of the northern limit of
Green	ORGANIZATION	- land , and the discovery of a route which might lead as an imperial highway towards the pole .

		Peary 's third expedition left
Philadelphia	LOCATION
June 23 , 1895	DATE	, and reached
Inglefield Gulf	ORGANIZATION	on the 3d of
August	DATE	.

		As soon as the opening
spring	DATE	should permit , a party of eight was to move over the ice to the northeast coast .

		Three
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 of these were to attempt the journey to the pole ; three were to go southward to
Cape Bismarck	LOCATION	on the eastern coast and return thence overland to the western base ; while two were to main - tain a station to which the northern party might return or retreat as the occasion should prove .

		On
March 6 , 1894	DATE	, the start was made .

		By
April 10	DATE	so many mishaps had befallen , men disabled and dogs dead , that it was evident the march must be abandoned for the season .

		The larger part of the surplus of supplies was cached at a point about one hundred and thirty miles from the lodge by the sea , whither the party retreated .

		Other caches were made on the way .

		In
October	DATE	an expedition was made to recover these caches , repack them , and mark afresh their positions ; but they were not found .

		The storms and the drifted snows had obliterated every trace of them .

		The difficulties of marking and finding loca - tions upon the ice-cap proved to be insuperable .

		The surface of the elevated plateau was covered with an icy crust , carved and seamed by relent - less winds whose traces were quickly obliterated by the drifting of new-fallen snow .

		The air was full of snow .

		The vision was bounded by a canopy of cloud which allowed no glimpse of sun or star , and nautical observations could seldom be made .

		A point could be determined only by the dead reckoning of a compass and an odometer .

		The following winter was spent in gathering from the resources of the country supplies , chiefly of frozen walrus and deer meat , to re - place those which had been lost .

		On
April 1 , 1895	DATE	, with two men and forty dogs , the jour - ney across the ice-cap was again undertaken .

		The story of this march is a record of indomi - table courage and of patient endurance never surpassed , but expended upon judgment which can hardly be approved , and effective of no adequate result .

		The reasons for a return in
1894	DATE	were yet more potent in
1895	DATE	.

		The stock of supplies was far less fit than on the preceding year .

		Independence Bay might be revisited , but it was evident that the northward trip could not follow , nor could the foundation be then laid for such a trip in the future .

		The result was less disastrous than could reasonably have been expected .

		The men survived the march of
1200	DATE	miles over the '' Great Ice . ''

		They found the cliff which overlooked the bay , but dared not risk the descent .

		They retraced their steps , and when they regained the lodge by the western sea they had barely escaped eating their sole remaining dog , through whose attenuated carcass all the other forty had made a vicarious passage .

		The narrative of this journey , simply and modestly told , excites sympathy and ad - miration , but it recalls the remark of the French marshall who witnessed the famous charge of the six hundred . ''

		C'est magnifique , mais ce n'est pas la guerre . ''

		It is not our purpose to analyse , much less to criticise , the plans for polar search by way of
Whale Sound	ORGANIZATION	and Independence Bay .

		Others more competent to judge have given them their approval .

		Lieutenant
Peary	PERSON	has already en - tered upon a renewed attempt at this solution of the polar problem .

		His countrymen unite in the hope that his undoubted nerve , pluck , and perseverance may be so guided and so for - tunate as to win for him a successful issue .

		THE MONROE DOCTRINE FROM AN ENGLISH STANDPOINT .

		* So much has lately been said about the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	that a new book upon the subject is likely to attract attention .

		Mr.
Red	PERSON	- daway 's contribution to the discussion is a short essay of a hundred and fifty pages , which was originally prepared in competition for a Cam - bridge University prize .

		The author says in his preface that he has laid under contribution a mass of unpublished documents in the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	, but he does not seem to have discovered much that is not already to be found in easily accessible printed sources .

		The book is interesting , however , as a discussion of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	from the English point of view .

		The larger part of the essay is devoted to an account of the origin of the Doctrine .

		The statement of the European side of the situation is well done , but the account of the American side betrays the fact that the author 's acquaint - ance witn the history of the
United States	LOCATION	is by no means intimate .

		It is surprising to be told that , '' It is the proudest trophy of the American government that the pen of
Jefferson	PERSON	could formulate against
France	LOCATION	broad princi - ples of neutrality to which time has added nothing , '' when it is well known that
Jefferson	PERSON	not only did not write the proclamation of neu - trality , but denounced its phraseology as '' pu - sillanimous . ''

		The sentence quoted illustrates a tendency toward rhetorical flourish and an * THB MONKOK DOCTRINE .

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, indirectness of statement that characterize the With respect to the authorship of the
Decla	LOCATION	- ration , Mr.
Reddaway	PERSON	concludes that '' the conception of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	and much of its phraseology came from
Adams	PERSON	, and the share of
Monroe	PERSON	did not extend beyond revi - sion . '' ''

		The part played by
Jefferson	PERSON	, '' he says , '' seems to be defined in the fact that his advice was sought and not followed . ''

		It has always been well known that
John Qnincy Adams	PERSON	largely inspired
Monroe	PERSON	's Declaration , but Mr.
Reddaway	PERSON	overstates the case in his favor .

		The Declaration consisted of three propositions , each of which had a different origin .

		The first proposition opposed further European colonization of the American conti - nents .

		This part was wholly due to
Adams	PERSON	, and was but a re-statement of his declaration to
Baron Tuyl	PERSON	and his instructions to Rush .

		The second proposition opposed American interfer - ence in European affairs .

		Innumerable pre - cedents for this part of the Declaration might be cited , of which the most notable are Wash - ington 's Farewell Address and
Jefferson 's First Inaugural	ORGANIZATION	.

		The idea was clearly expressed in
Paine	LOCATION	's '' Common Sense '' the first published argument for the independence of the colonies .

		As this earliest precedent seems to have been overlooked by writers upon this subject , it is worth quoting in full .

		Paine wrote : `` Submission to or dependence on
Great Britain	LOCATION	tends directly to involve this Continent in European wars and quarrels , and -LSB- to -RSB- set us at variance with nations who would otherwise seek our friendship , and against whom we have neither anger nor complaint .

		As
Europe	LOCATION	is our market for trade , we ought to form no partial connec - tion with any part of it .

		It is the true interest of
America	LOCATION	to steer clear of European contentions , which she never can do while , by her dependence on
Britain	LOCATION	, he is made the make - weight in the scale of British politics . ''

		This proposition was a part of the stock of political ideas common to the American people from the time of the Revolution .

		If the honor of first formulating it is to be assigned to any - one , it would seem to belong to
Paine	LOCATION	.

		The third proposition of the Declaration opposed European interference in American affairs .

		Simple as is this corollary of the second propo - sition , it had never before been publicly and officially stated .

		It is the important advance that
Monroe	PERSON	made upon previous statements .

		The '' conception '' seems to be more distinctly traceable to
Jefferson	PERSON	than to any other states - man .

		The purchase of
Louisiana	LOCATION	was a most important step toward diminishing European influence in
America	LOCATION	.

		In
1808	DATE	Jefferson wrote , in reference to
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	: '' We consider their interests and ours as the same , and the object of both must be to exclude all European influence in this hemisphere . ''

		In his celebrated letter to
Monroe	PERSON	in reference to the proposed Declaration ,
Jefferson	PERSON	wrote : Our first and fundamental maxim should be never to entangle ourselves in the broils of
Europe	LOCATION	; our second , never to suffer
Europe	LOCATION	to intermeddle with cis -
Atlantic	LOCATION	affairs .

		America ,
North and South	ORGANIZATION	, has a set of interests distinct from those of
Europe	LOCATION	, and peculiarly her own .

		She should , therefore , have a system of her own , sepa - rate and apart from that of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		While the last is laboring to become the domicile of despotism , our en - deavor should surely be to make our hemisphere that of freedom . ''

		Here we have the exact ideas and almost the phraseology of
Monroe	ORGANIZATION	's message .

		It is true that
Jefferson	PERSON	favored a joint declaration , and that a separate declaration was finally decided upon ; but that does not alter the fact that the most important part of the message originated in his suggestion .

		The
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	is thus seen to have been a composite production , to which
Adams	PERSON	and
Jefferson	PERSON	contributed in nearly equal proportions .

		The remainder of Mr.
Reddaway	PERSON	's little book discusses the reception of the Doctrine , its rela - tion to International Law , and its later appli - cations .

		He finds that the Declaration pro- duced slight effect in South American states , and that they looked chiefly to
Great Britain	LOCATION	for support .

		He points out that the policy of a single power does not modify the
Law of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, and that the influence of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	is evil so far as it leads the people of the
United States	LOCATION	to believe that they possess in their international relations greater rights than they are entitled to under the rules of International Law .

		The author 's concluding analysis of the foundation of the
Monroe Doc	ORGANIZATION	- trine may be briefly summarized .

		In his view , the Doctrine is based upon the assumption that the distance between European and American states creates a natural line of demarkation between them .

		This assumption , he claims , is unfounded .

		Land , rather than water , separates nations .

		Intercourse , rather than geographical position , unites them .

		With existing means of transit ,
South America	LOCATION	is as closely connected with
Europe	LOCATION	as with the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The assumption failing , upon which the
Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	is based , the
Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	must fall with it .

		Mr.
Reddaway	PERSON	's book can not , of course , include the latest phase in the history of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	.

		Just as
Europe	LOCATION	seems to
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL yield a tacit assent to the assumptions advanced in its name , a considerable portion of the Amer - ican people propose in effect to discard the Doctrine as too confining for the purposes of our future development .

		It should not be forgotten that these propositions are reciprocal .

		`` THE DRAMA AS LITERATURE . ''

		* Many people nowadays , especially in this country , if they want the choicest fine blossom of the contemporary drama , have to get it by reading .

		Either because of absence from me - tropoles , or because of the absence of apprecia - tive managers , they find it next to impossible to see '' Heimat , '' for instance , or '' The Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' or '' Die versunkene Glocke , '' and more than impossible to see `` La Princesse Maleine '' or '' Salome . ''

		They may be able in the future , perhaps , to see '' La Ville Morte '' or '' Cyrano de Bergerac , '' but still , practically , they have to content themselves with reading : inferior plays they can see on the stage , but the plays which have interested the world they must read .

		Now , ever since the dictum of a well-known critic last
January	DATE	, reading plays has been like eating ashes .

		Previously there had been an idea that some plays were even better '' as lit - erature '' than on the stage .

		But the ruling just mentioned did away with such a fancy .

		It laid down the principle that a dramatist '' must please his immediate audience '' ; it held up the ideal of an '' imaginative sympathy needful to enable -LSB- readers or critics -RSB- to see a play as it might appear on the stage '' ; it gathered itself * PLAYS : PLEASANT AND UNPLEASANT .

George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		together in the remark that '' there is no more patent absurdity than the play that is not intended to be acted . ''

		The critic in question meant that reading plays was merely a very unsatisfactory substitute for seeing them ; that it had no independent existence .

		He did not mention the fact that it is impossible for us to see any of the plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Aristophanes	LOCATION	, etc. , as their authors imagined them , and impossible also to recreate in the imagination any of these masterpieces of the drama as they were seen by the audience for which they were written ; namely , that it was impossible to enjoy them in anything but a sur - reptitious and fanciful way .

		It was of no conse - quence to him that he deprived of enjoyment many of his fellow-creatures ; indeed , he prob - ably did not think of this matter , for his mind was quite absorbed in his great conception that there was no such thing as a '' literary play . ''

		The gloom thus diffused throughout the reading public , however , was somewhat light - ened by the announcement that the plays of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	were to be published .


Bernard Shaw	PERSON	was a name to arouse the imag - ination , for everybody felt quite sure that he must be somebody , and nobody -LRB- in
America	LOCATION	-RRB- knew just who he was .

		It was obvious also that his plays must be literary plays , because no one could remember having seen them or having heard of them on the stage .

		Here was a bit of comfort for those who held that , entirely aside from stage representation , there was intel - ligent pleasure to be gained from reading plays .

		The position would seem to be this : Here are so-called plays .

		They have not been great stage successes .

		They do not please immediate audiences .

		Yet shall they not be read , per - haps , with intelligent pleasure ?

		Here is a book ; and a book of which the content distinguishes it readily from directories , catalogues , vol - umes of this or that '' series , '' railway novels , logarithmic tables , accumulations of by-gone journalism , cook-books , and so forth , to which we instinctively deny the name of literature : these plays are read with aroused intelligence , they must give impressions or opinions , and these impressions or opinions must be of inter - est to the critic .

		What shall he say about them ?

		Of course these plays are not ostentatious '' closet-plays '' ; they are not remarkable in form or technique .

		Some plays , as we read them , do not seem at all adapted for the stage . ''

		Hanneles Himmelfahrt '' was successful , cu - riously enough , but we do not readily imagine anyone acting '' Pelleas et Melisande . ''

		The 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, plays of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, however , are cast 44 in the ordinary practical comedy form in use at all the theatres '' ; they are meant to be acted when anyone comes along that can act them .

		Still , the author publishes them that they may also be read .

		His reasons for thinking it well to read plays are not precisely those just indicated .

		Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	says that Englishmen do not customarily go to the theatre .

		Even if they did , they might not like '' literary plays '' : in
Spain	LOCATION	people go to the theatre every night , but they do not wish to see '' literary plays '' for all that ; they have invented another kind of en - tertainment which they like much better .

		Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	also thinks '' that a perfectly adequate and successful stage representation of a play requires a combination of circumstances so extraordinarily fortunate that -LSB- he -RSB- doubts whether it ever occurred in the history of the world . ''

		This I take leave to think is almost hypercritical .

		A writer of plays probably con - ceives his unwritten play in terms of the stage - circumstance to which he is accustomed ; and if the play appears in that circumstance , it is probably adequately presented , '' as ade - quately , at least , as it can ever exist in the mind of a reader .

		It is not for these reasons that I approve of printed plays .

		I approve of them because I can see that there may be such a thing as a lit - erary form called '' the drama '' which will en - able a man to do what he can not do in any other way .

		This literary form is conditioned partly by the simpler current exigencies of the stage as they are understood by most readers this is the conventional part , and partly by the necessity of appealing to one reader alone , instead of to a number of hearers together .

		The acted play is governed by neither of these neces - sities .

		The acted play must conform to a great number of mechanical and theatrical neces - sities , which the average reader knows nothing at all about , and it appeals to the eyes and the minds of a number of persons gathered together , which is a very different thing from one person alone .

		Perhaps the greatest plays are those which succeed under all these conditions ; but certainly some plays will answer one set of re - quirements and other plays will answer the other .

		Now suppose you have a play which an - swers the first set , but not the second ; what will you do ?

		Call it an absurdity , with Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	?

		I imagine myself doing so , and feel that I am absurd myself ; so I try to regard it otherwise .

		After this it may seem unwise to allow that the chief characteristics of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's plays are not precisely dramatic .

		They might appear in other work of their author as well as here .

		A great dramatist has leading charac - teristics which are especially dramatic , which demand the stage .

		I do not see that Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	has .

		Sudermann ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Mae	PERSON	- terlinck , to take both practical playwrights and airy theorists , are each noteworthy for things that would not appear if they wrote novels .

		In the case of Sudermann , who has written novels , the chief characteristic of his dramatic work which I take to be the com - bining of a number of motives in one focus is not at all obvious in them .

		But the striking thing about Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	might be made to appear in a novel , and , I think , quite as well as it is made to appear in the plays .

		It does not follow from this that these plays are especially undramatic , even from the point of view of the stage .

		In fact , they were all written for the stage .

		One does not wonder that '' Arms and the Man '' received some applause ; it is more remarkable that '' You Never Can Tell '' was not put on the stage . ''

		Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession '' was barred for non-dramatic reasons .

		I have said that the main characteristic of these plays the par - ticular mood of realism was not dramatic .

		I am inclined to think , however , that the special mode of its manifestation does belong to the stage .

		Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	is a realist , but he does not mean to be dull for all that , not over - serious , plodding , stupid , dry-as-dust , dodder - ing .

		He attains his end by a curious expedient which I think must belong particularly to the stage , I do not easily conceive of it elsewhere , namely , by what , at first , appears to be almost conventional farce .

		This general form of irony is not impossible in other kinds of literature , although it is rather uncommon ; but it can not be realized in the way followed here , except on the stage .

		These plays of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	might make , and probably have made , a good deal of talk from a point of view which does not dis - tinguish between a play and , let us say , a trea - tise .

		4t Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession '' is written on a matter which is not usually regarded and rightly enough as mentionable in ordi - nary society .

		4t Widowers ' Houses '' deals with another problem , '' and this time a perfectly proper one . ''

		The Philanderer '' is apparently conceived as being on still another question ; but here Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	carries his farce so
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 far that it is impossible to regard the matter seriously .

		These are the '' unpleasant plays '' so called ; less pleasant than the others chiefly because they exhibit the following out of rather a poor idea .

		The '' problem play '' seems to be rather a modern English habit ; Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	and Mr.
Jones	PERSON	lean to it .

		But it is not in its nature anything especially dramatic : in fact , reasoning from
Aristotle	LOCATION	's central idea , it seems to me undramatic .

		Anyway , it is not here a matter of especial interest , for it is not a characteristic of the best of these plays .

		It is lacking in ''
Candida	PERSON	, '' '' Arms and the Man , '' and '' You Never Can Tell '' ; these have no problems , they are not tracts or criticisms or police reports in disguise .

		They are simply plays . ''

		Pleasant Plays '' they are called by Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, and to my mind the reason for their being pleasant is because they are much better as plays than the unpleasant ones .

		Of the three , '' Candida '' has most depth .

		The two others are very amusing and have much good meat to them .

		But '' Candida '' has more earnest searching - ness , or searching earnestness , on some rather deep points .

		I have seen it called '' as true a poem as was ever written in prose . ''

		This seems a complimentary remark , but neither well - founded nor at all descriptive .

		I should say that it is a play which pleases at the time and pleases in remembrance .

		I almost regret that the poet in the play was not lame , or something of the sort -LRB- as Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	suggests -RRB- , so that it might have been acted .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		THE PROBLEM OF THE ARYANS .

		* The learned author of '' The Evolution of the Aryan , ''
Rudolph von Ihering	PERSON	, never fully completed the work .

		Three books out of the seven which were to comprise it were never written , and the fourth book is probably far from complete .

		It is well , however , that what was written has been printed .

		The books in which the life and history of the primitive Aryan have been reconstructed deal chiefly or exclusively with evidence from language .

		This work is a study of survival in custom .

		The translator , in his preface , says : ''
Von Ihering	PERSON	was a wonderfully versatile man .

		A Professor of Roman Law one of the greatest author - ities on the subject that ever lived , he devoted much * THE EVOLUTION OF THE ARYAN .

		of his spare time to the study of ancient history , prin - cipally of those customs pertaining to law which seemed to him incongruous with the state of civilization which the Romans of that period had reached : and this work is the outcome of his researches . ''

		Our author 's conclusions are not always in harmony with some of the favorite views of the present time .

		He believes the first home of the Aryans was in
Asia	LOCATION	in ancient
Bactria	LOCATION	.

		He claims that migration took place from there into
Europe	LOCATION	and into
India	LOCATION	.

		This ancient Asiatic people is his parent-nation or mother - nation .

		He considers the migration to have been of long duration , and locates a second home of the Aryans in the great plain of
South	LOCATION	- ern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		This second home appears to have been a resting-place for the migrating masses .

		From it , later migrations populated almost the whole of
Europe	LOCATION	with Aryan folk , and the dif - ferentiation of the five great nations Greeks , Latins , Celts , Teutons , Slavs took place locally .

		To the migrating peoples , particularly while in their second home , the author appears to confine the name Indo-European .

		These are fundamental ideas from which and to which von Ihering works .

		His argument is interesting and ingenious .

		Almost ignoring lin - guistic evidence , he studies survival and cus - tom .

		In the four books he investigates the
Aryan Parent Nation	ORGANIZATION	, Aryans and Semites , Emigration of the Aryans , The Wandering .

		The fifth , sixth , and seventh books were to have dealt with the
Second Home	ORGANIZATION	, Origin of the
European Nations	ORGANIZATION	, Difference of the
European Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Von Ihering considers the Aryans in their original home to have lacked energy and practicality ; the modern Hindu , dreamy and unpractical , more adequately represents them than do the modern peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		By his method the author claims to prove that the first home was inland , and probably isolated by lines of enclosing mountains .

		Although a settled and populous folk , the parent nation was pastoral and non-agricultural ; it was ignorant of metals , and built neither towns nor houses of stones ; law , whether international or domestic , crim - inal or property , was at a low stage of devel - opment .

		The power which converted the Aryan dreamer of inland
Asia	LOCATION	into a nation , from which should come the eminently practical Roman , is claimed to have been contact with Semitic civilization .

		The contrast drawn be - tween Aryan and Semitic cultures , and the pic - ture of old Babylonian culture , are masterpieces of work .

		To the Babylonian , von Ihering 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, attributes the town , the fortress , the stone -LRB- or brick -RRB- house , the trade of building , measure - ment of time and dimension , brick-burning , use of water , navigation and commerce ; and these were transmitted to the Aryans .

		The fact of the migration , its character , the customs devel - oped in it and by it , are investigated , and many curious and at first sight inexplicable customs are traced in their beginnings back to that time .

		In the ver sacrum , for example , von Ihering sees the ceremonial repetition of the once forced swarming forth of the young to seek a new home .

		Most interesting of all , perhaps , is the tracing back to reasonable and useful origins of the curious practices connected with the Roman fetiales , pontijices , and auspices .

		The style of the work is charming ; the argu - ment forceful .

		The analysis is clear , and the ar - gument is summed up in a series of propositions , each growing out of the preceding .

		Whether the author 's conclusions are always sound , or his fundamental ideas are accepted , the mate - rial and the mode of presenting it are so new and important that the book must have a not - able influence in the discussion of Aryan ori - gins and development .

		THE REACTION OF ON FAITH .

		* If the first effect of a growth in knowledge was unbelief , its far more extended and permanent re - sult has been a reopening and a reconsideration in many ways of the terms of faith .

		The group of books before us , and the multitude of works with which they are associated , are illustrations of the eagerness with which men shortly bring any new resources of knowledge to the ever-enduring and inescapable inquiries of our spiritual life .

		The first book on our list , '' The New Puritanism , '' illustrates this reaction in one of the many phases which it presents .

		The New Puritanism is the re - ligions cast which a wider sympathy with men has given to our Christian life .

		trative grasp of its immediate facts , and a very living interest in them .

		It was this spiritual insight which imparted to him a prophetic force , and impelled him to give a more loving and tender ren - dering of Christian life .

		Christ was to him the great heart of God , the great heart of humanity ; and so arose the New Puritanism .

		Those who united in the recent celebration of the fiftieth anni - versary of
Plymouth Church	ORGANIZATION	are men of a kindred temper , and the occasion was chiefly improved in the enforcement of this more universal life .

		The book has interest for all who are in sympathy with a more immediate and renovative effort among men , in their personal and social relations .

		Selfhood and
Service	ORGANIZATION	'' is also a bringing of social truth to Christian experience .

		Its main con - tention is the personal and social discipline which attends upon the acquisition of wealth .

		The thought so far is plain , adequate , and stimulating .

		We can hardly feel that the author , in treating this theme , was at liberty to overlook , to the degree he has , two essentials in making production personally and socially beneficent .

		Thorough integrity , a keen recog - nition of the rights of men , and generous sympathy making one 's efforts directly aidful to all asso - ciated with him must be present , or the getting and dispensing of wealth will both lose their spiritual value .

		The three stand in this order of importance : integrity , aidfulness , beneficence .

		Beneficence , divorced from the other two , is mere tinsel .

		The fine beneficence of a modern Cioesns is not suffi - cient to gild the enormous mass of injury inflicted on society by his business methods and spirit . ''

		Divine Immanence '' approaches the central spiritual problem , the conception of the nature of God , from the side of philosophy and science .

		What conception brings most light , and is most in har - mony with our present forms of knowledge ?

		The book is unusually clear , definite , and progressive in its line of thought .

		The subject , though abstruse , is followed with ease and pleasure in its presentation .

		The author keeps firmly to the ground except when he approaches his last dogmatic conclusion .

		He then leaps somewhat into the air .

		`` The Mystery of Life '' is another bringing to - gether of the terms of science and faith .

		It is a work not without ability , yet it yields comparatively little stimulus or instruction .

		The two elements of science and revelation are not thoroughly fused in each other .

		The book is the presentation and vin - dication of a somewhat involved and arbitrary dogma that of a distinct spirit superinduced upon mind , life , and body .

		The spiritual being is a fourth entity , on whose presence or absence man 's higher and immortal hopes are made to rest .

		The recon - ciliation , therefore , of the physical and the spiritual is the absence of any contradiction between them , not their union in one supreme product .

		Revelation remains revelation under a narrow dogmatic form . ''

		Among these essays are : ''
Oriental Relig	PERSON	- ions , '' '' Christianity and Mohammedanism , '' '' The
Natural History of Church Organization	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' The Heresy of Non-Progressive Orthodoxy , '' '' Miracles . ''

		The author has a highly speculative mind , and this fact will render some of the essays less interesting to the mass of readers .

		His thought is coherent and his style perspicuous .

		One feels that he is brought in contact with an unusually vigorous personality .

		The appeal is constantly and exclusively to reason .

		Yet a strong religious faith pervades the discussions .

		We especially commend the essay entitled '' Bud - dhism and Christianity . ''

		The chief interest of '' Clerical Life '' is literary .

		It is made up of letters , twenty in number , addressed chiefly to some minister whose faults or circum - stances are to come under criticism .

		Though these letters are , on the title page , referred to eight differ - ent authors , they are each anonymous , and are quite uniform in method and in style .

		Eight of them , signed X. , are presumably written by Dr.
Watson	PERSON	.

		They are somewhat of the Addisonian order : indi - rect , mild , and satirical , in their praise and censure .

		The occasion chosen is not ordinarily a serious one , and it is gracefully presented under a variety of side lights .

		The book is enjoyable and not unin - structive .

		The title , however , is more serious than the treatment .

		There is an occasional defect in taste in allowing the subject of stricture to become too idiotic in his faults as in the case of the min - ister who had been to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The re -LRB- * cover of '' The International Scientific Series '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- has come to be & tra a e .

		mar -RSB- j O f scientific respectability .

		As in all series , the works differ widely in scholarship and value ; but a laudable standard of average excellence has been maintained .

		It is particularly unfortunate that a topic which has been so constantly beset with the dogmatism of system-makers should find such an unsatisfactory representation in this series .

		Volume LXXVIII .

		-LRB- '' Memory and its Cultivation , '' by
F. W. Edridge Green	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is as completely out of place in a scientific series as it is innocent of the sound psychological principles upon which alone a modern book on mem - ory can be wisely written .

		Instead of the compre - hensive physiological and psychological basis for the proper presentation of the processes of memory which modern research makes possible , we have a totally arbitrary system of rejuvenated phrenolog - ical faculties in which
Time	ORGANIZATION	and Eventuality , Size and Incongruity , Causality and Cautiousness ,
Imi	ORGANIZATION	- tation and Benevolence , all hold coordinate and chaotic sway .

		Eight most illogical and unnecessary reasons are given why it is not possible to determine the position of a faculty from the conformations of the skull , and a medley of thirteen even more un - fortunate arguments is offered to prove that the faculties of the mind are multiple .

		Is this nineteenth - century science ?

		With such a theoretical basis , the nature of memory is unfolded and a system of practical rules for the cultivation of memory is de - veloped .

		The expositions and explanations are quite largely of the type of a by-gone age when the power of opium to put one to sleep was acceptably ex - plained by reason of its soporific faculty .

		A man who has a '' large faculty for colour '' is one who remembers colors easily , and one who remembers colors easily may be said to have a `` large fac - ulty for colour . ''

		The precepts founded upon this type of analysis are of that aggravatingly vague and didactic form which tell us to seek a certain end , which is exactly what we clearly know , and fail to tell us how to go about it , which is the helpless ignorance we had hoped to relieve .

		No book written by an intelligent writer is continuously bad ; and there are scattered here and there through - out the three hundred pages some suggestive facts and illustrations .

		But it is hopeless to suppose that any seeker after a good memory , who is urged on by the glittering prospect of the preface that the discovery of the facts of memory enabled the author to learn a subject in a fifth of the time that it for - merly occupied , will be able to steer his tortuous way through this poorly illuminated tangle , with either profit or pleasure .

		A student who attended the memory classes of a famous '' memory profes - sor , '' when asked how he profited by the instruction , replied that he thought he would have progressed very satisfactorily , were it not that he constantly forgot to go to the lessons .

		The best advice to offer the student of memory is to ask him to remember , not to attempt the study of memory by the aid of this unfortunate volume .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	If a recent publication entitled and the spirit ''
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and the Spirit of of the age .

		the Age -LRB- p utnam -RRB- ha a f a n en into the hands of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	previous to his recent discourse upon American literary centres , he might have added
Sewanee	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, to his list .

		To the reading public ,
Sewanee	LOCATION	is known as the seat of the
University of the South	ORGANIZATION	, the home of at least three distinguished men of letters Professor Trent , Professor
Wells	PERSON	, and the Rev.
Greenough White	PERSON	and the place of publication of that admirable and dignified quarterly , '' The Sewanee Review . ''

		It transpires from the volume above mentioned that
Sewanee	LOCATION	also boasts an English Club of gentlemen and ladies , which has had a somewhat chequered existence since
1885	DATE	, and has devoted itself to the study of English language , literature , and thought .

		The subject chosen for last year 's study was '' the spirit of the age '' as typified by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	; and it was voted , at the end of the season , to pub - lish the papers that had been written about this 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, theme .

		The result ia a handsome volume , edited by Mr.
Greenough White	PERSON	, and containing fourteen brief essays which consider , besides
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's own work , such writers as
Clougb	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, Mr.
Austin	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	, and such cognate topics aa '' The Late Coarse of Religious Thought , '' '' Recent History Writing , '' and '' Lord
Leighton	PERSON	and the Late Coarse of English Art . ''

		The value of work of this sort is , of coarse , chiefly subjective and social , bat the book of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	makes an attract - ive showing , and sets an excellent example to other similar organizations .

		The papers contributed by the editor , and by his clerical colleague , Mr.
W. P. DuBose	PERSON	, are those of the most value , although all are thoughtful and well-expressed .

		A certain nar - rowness of standpoint , an occasional unpleasant assumption of superior airs , and a trifle too much of editing , are the main defects of the discussion .

		We must find room for one delicioas bit of unconscious humor in the statement that '' it is apparent that a work on the plan of Dr.
Moulton	PERSON	's ' Modern Read - er 's Bible ' would have delighted '' Arnold .

		Dr.
Moulton	PERSON	has numerous gifts , but he has not the gift of style for himself or of the sense for style in lit - erature , and his scientific arrangement of the scrip - tures is precisely the sort of thing that would have filled Arnold 's soul with grief and inspired his most pungent satire .

		His '' Isaiah '' showed how the thing ought to be done , and his way was not Dr.
Moulton	PERSON	's way , to put it mildly .

		Thackeray 's request that he should not be made the subject of a formal biography is well-known , and has hitherto kept the material remaining in the possess - ion of his family from being used in a life of the great novelist Such sketches of his career as have been produced have been drawn from unofficial sources , and have proved meagre and unsatisfactory .

		But during the thirty-five years that have elapsed since his death , a considerable amount of his corre - spondence has been made public , and the outline , at least , of his life-history has gradually shaped itself in the minds of interested students of his work .

		So many misconceptions have arisen , both concerning his private life and his artistic endeavor , that it be - comes a delicate question of ethics to determine whether his family have acted wisely in their literal compliance with his expressed wish .

		At all events , Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	, the daughter from whose pen the biography , if ever decided upon , should properly come , has so far relaxed her original resolution as to take part in the production of a '' biographical edition '' of his writings that will serve , to a consid - erable extent , as a substitute for the more formal '' life '' for which many students have not ceased to hope .

		In any case , this new publication presents the work of
Thackeray	PERSON	to his readers in a highly acceptable form , and seems likely to supersede all its predecessors in popular favor and become the standard library edition of his novels .

		There are to be thirteen stout volumes in all , published monthly -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , and with each volume there will be incor - porated , in the form of an introduction , such pas - sages from his letters , journals , and sketch-books as relate to the history of the novel in question , and to the private life of the novelist at the time con - cerned .

		Three of the volumes have thus far been issued ; and as each of them contains about forty pages of this introductory matter , much of which has never before been published , a simple calculation will show that we may expect from them all a biography , however fragmentary and incoherent , amounting in the aggregate to some five hundred pages .

		That this will prove a boon to the student of literary history is quite evident , and the name of Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	guarantees performance of the delicate task in a manner that will be at once tactful and trustworthy .

		Mr.
Philip H. Goepp	PERSON	's '' Symphonies and their Meaning '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is the sort of book that we approach with a dark foreboding .

		So much nonsense has been written about the '' meaning '' of absolute music , and so many writers have sought to give an objective significance to their own purely subjective impressions of the sonata and the symphony , that suspicion of such a title as the above is not unrea - sonable .

		Happily , Mr.
Goepp	PERSON	does not justify the suspicion , and his discussion is reasonably free from the vagaries of interpretation that make so much of the critical literature of music absolutely worth - less .

		He does not escape the rhapsodical manner altogether , but it is fairly evident that his language is figurative , and that he understands it to be so .

		Still , this sort of thing , which occurs now and then , is at least ominous : '' Suddenly a turn of the major lets in a clear ray of hope , and then comes the heroic lift from the abode of devils to that of angels , from hell to heaven from sinister , overwhelming evil to moral triumph . ''

		For the most part , how - ever , Mr.
Goepp	PERSON	's book is a technical but not too technical analysis of about a dozen of the greatest of the symphonies , written with both knowledge and understanding , and provided with copious illus - trations in musical notation .

		It is a good book for the serious concert-goer who , although not a musi - cian himself , has reached the point of realizing that music is one of the most important means of culture , and can not be omitted from any well-considered scheme of liberal education . ''

		The Library of Literary History , '' a publishing enterprise undertaken by Mr.
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	and repre - sented in this country by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , pens its prospectus in the following words : '' There is for every nation a history , which dues not respond to the trumpet-call of battle , which does not limit its interest to the conflict of dynasties .

		This the history of intellectual growth and artistic achievement if less romantic than the popular panorama of kings and queens , finds its material in imperishable masterpieces , and reveals to the student
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 something at once more vital and more picturesque than the quarrels of rival parliaments .

		Nor is it in any sense unscientific to shift the point of view from politics to literature .

		It is but the fashion of his - tory which insists that a nation lives only for her warriors , a fashion which might long since have been ousted by the commonplace reflection that , in spite of history , the poets are the true masters of the earth . ''

		As well , perhaps , as general terms can de - scribe such a series of volumes as is here projected , the passage quoted will suffice ; and we may point to
M. Jusserand	PERSON	's '' Literary History of the English People '' as an already existent concrete embodiment of the idea .

		The first volume of the new series , '' A Literary History of
India	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
R. W. Frazer	PERSON	, speaks well for the enterprise , and presents the views of a scholar long and favorably identified with his subject , who commands at the same time a singu - larly graceful and attractive style .

		Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	begins with the Aryans , and carries us from the twilight period of Indian history , through the secular struggle between
Brahmanism	PERSON	and Buddhism , down to modern times and what literature these times have produced .

		The epics and the drama are made the subject of special studies , and the work is , as a whole , the most readable and interesting treatment of its entire theme with which we are acquainted .

		It makes a handsome volume of nearly five hundred pages , and sets for its successors a standard of ex - cellence that will not easily be surpassed .

		We note that Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	has been commis - sioned to prepare '' A Literary History of the
United States	LOCATION	'' for the series .

		Dr. Garners Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	's '' History of ite!ature .

		Italian Literature '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is the fourth volume to appear in the series of '' Literatures of the World , '' and is the best of the four , which amounts to very high praise when we consider the admirable treatment given to French and English literature by Professor
Dowden	PERSON	and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	.

		It also emphasizes , even more than its prede - cessors , the intention of the series as a whole , which is obviously not to furnish an elementary compendium of knowledge , but rather to discuss literature from the standpoint of modern criticism , and for the benefit of an audience already in possession of the bare facts .

		One must know a certain amount beforehand about the history of Italian literature to get much profit from such a study as Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	has written , and we are sometimes inclined to think that he takes too much previous information for granted to permit an appeal to other than a narrow audience .

		On the other hand , given the intention of addressing a cultivated circle of readers , there is not sufficient cause for refraining so carefully from the smallest scrap of original quotation , particularly as the author does not hesitate to introduce Latin quotations whenever it pleases him .

		In quoting
Jowett	PERSON	with seeming approval , to the effect that Italian literature is '' the greatest in the world after Greek , Latin , English , '' we think that enthusiasm for his subject has carried
Kruger	PERSON	and the
South African Republic	LOCATION	.

		the author too far .

		Even if the names of the great Italians are '' weighed rather than counted , '' as he suggests , French literature still remains a more im - portant product , and is the second of modern litera - tures as unquestionably as English is the first .

		The style of Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	's book , although it slips now and then , is on the whole singularly fine ; it is fin - ished and graceful , at once delicate and strong , and never relapses into prosiness .

		The translations intro - duced are numerous , largely made by Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	himself , and are exceptionally successful in repro - ducing both the thought and the form of their orig - inals .

		Mr.
Reginald Statham	PERSON	, in ''
Paul Kruger	PERSON	and his Times '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives an account of the rise of the
South African Republic	LOCATION	, a small and remote country lately made conspicuous by the fiasco of the
Jameson Raid	PERSON	, and the development of the
Kruger	PERSON	family , newly illustrious through its worthy repre - sentative
Paul Kruger	PERSON	, beloved by his own people as ''
Oom Paul	PERSON	, '' the biographical and historical ele - ments appearing to be quite inseparable .

		The nar - rative is well sustained , the situations are strongly picturesque , and the contrasts and parallels are handled with the skill of a trained advocate .

		The reader , however , is compelled to feel that there must be a respondent in the case , whose presentation , though different , might be equally interesting , per - haps equally convincing .


Gladstone Nothing	ORGANIZATION	better in its way has ever delineated by come to our notice than Mr.
James	PERSON	Mr.
Bryee	PERSON	.

		Bryce 's study of
Gladstone -LRB- Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The little book is a model of pith and com - pression and effective breadth of delineation , and it should be read and conned by everyone desiring a competent knowledge of this foremost of Victorian statesmen .

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's life was long , and sin - gularly eventful ; his character was as complex as his pursuits were multifarious ; and for almost half a century his career was so closely interwoven with the public affairs of his country that the story of his parliamentary life comes near to being an outline of concurrent English politics .

		Yet in the brief space of 104 small pages , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	has man - aged to give us a portrait that for essential truth is likely to remain unsurpassed .

		He discusses his hero as parliamentarian , orator , and author , and there are separate chapters on his social qualities , his '' originality and independence , '' his religious char - acter , and so on .

		The book contains a striking frontispiece portrait .

		A suitable complement to Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's somewhat abstract and analytical study is Mr.
Lionel Tollemache	PERSON	's capital little volume entitled '' Talks with Mr.
Glad	PERSON	- stone -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Mr.
Tollemache	PERSON	has attempted very successfully , though in a small way , to Bos - wellize Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, with whom he had a number of rather serious talks on topics literary , political ,
Gladstone	PERSON	depicted in his `` talks .

		1 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, and religious , and whom he seems to have '' drawn oat '' very skilfully .

		The - talks '' ranged from
1856	DATE	to
1870	DATE	, and from
1891	DATE	to
1896	DATE	; and they certainly offer a good many curiosities , even eccen - tricities , of opinion .

		Perhaps Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	liked to be paradoxical on occasion .

		Once , when Mr.
Tolle	PERSON	- mache asked him at what period he wished his lot could have been thrown -LRB- he had already expressed his own preference for the nineteenth century -RRB- , the liberal leader replied : I should have chosen the time of Homer . ''

		Commenting on Dives , he ob - served : '' I look upon him as a very mild instance .

		As landlords go , he was above the average ; he did let
Lazarus	PERSON	have of his superfluities . ''

		Mr.
Tollemache	PERSON	has reported his '' talks '' nearly verbatim , and they are decidedly fresh , interesting , and suggestive .

		The frontispiece portrait is evidently from a quite recent photograph , and is painfully suggestive of the long period of suffering that preceded Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's death .

		In Outlines of the
Earth	LOCATION	's History '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , Professor S baler , of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, has supplied a much-needed compendium of physiography .

		Illus - trating his statements from a copious fund of mate - rial authenticated by careful observation , experi - ment , and research , the author describes and explains the processes now active in earth , sea , air , and the surrounding universe .

		He holds that the history of the earth is a continuous record , whose most instructive chapter is that now being written .

		Nature 's laws change not .

		That which is is that which hath been , and the present is the interpreter of the past .

		Professor S baler 's style is clear , pleas - ant , and persuasive , and the book will appeal to the popular reader as well as to the student of this most fascinating science .

		A catalogue of the
Dante	ORGANIZATION	collection presented to
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	by Professor
Willard Fiske	PERSON	is in course of preparation by Mr.
Theodore W. Koch	PERSON	, whose '' Dante in
America	LOCATION	'' we reviewed about a year ago .

		The first part of this catalogue , including only ''
Dante	PERSON	's Works '' -LRB- in the original and translations -RRB- has just been published at
Ithaca	LOCATION	, and forms a quarto pamphlet of nearly a hundred double-column pages .

		Two further parts are being prepared , and the work will be paged continuously .

		The entries include , besides strictly bib - liographical particulars , such additional matter as notes on the textual value of the editions , extracts from ex - planatory prefaces , and occasional bits of authoritative quotation .

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's dainty publications are always welcome , and all the more so when they come unexpected , as in the case of the booklet recently issued .

		Our Ambassador to
England	LOCATION	, Mr.
John Hay	PERSON	, was a guest of the
Omar Khayyam Club	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	at a dinner last
December	DATE	, and made a brief address so felicitous that it well de - served the honor of the present publication .

		All Omar collectors will want these words '' In Praise of Omar , '' and will thank the publisher for having given them so exquisite a dress .

		Two or three apt quotations in prose and verse , from Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, Mr.
J. II	PERSON	.

		McCarthy , and Mrs.
Marriott	PERSON	-
Watson	PERSON	, add to the charm of this minia - ture volume .

		Although so many thousand cases have been decided by the higher
Federal Courts	ORGANIZATION	, few embrace the great basic principles of Constitutional Law .

		For the con - venience of students and others having occasion to refer to them , Dr.
Carl Evans Boyd	PERSON	has edited sixty - three representative cases under the title '' Cases on Consti - tutional Law '' -LRB-
Callaghan	PERSON	' -RRB- .

		They extend from
Cbis	ORGANIZATION	- holm vs.

		Messrs.
Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	deserve the lasting grati - tude of book-lovers for the series of volumes in which they have reproduced certain of the sonnet-sequences of English poetry
Rossetti	PERSON	, Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, and others .

Kelmscott Press of William Morris	ORGANIZATION	, with ornamental designs by Mr.
Bertram Gros	PERSON	- venor
Goodhue	PERSON	.

		This edition follows the divisions of the sonnets made by Mr.
Charles Armitage Brown	PERSON	, marking the two main sections with bordered pages , and the subdivisions with larger initials than those com - monly used .

		Miss
Mary E. Butt	PERSON	, who has done so much excellent work in the preparation of reading-books for children , has collaborated with Mrs.
George W. Cable	PERSON	in the edit - ing of '' The Eugene Field Book '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a collec - tion of verses , stories , and letters for school reading .

		Miss
Burt	PERSON	has made her selections '' upon a basis fur - nished by the children themselves , after repeated expe - riments , '' and the extracts '' have been graded and arranged , after repeated tests , in the order of their simplicity . ''

		The book has an introduction by Mr.
Cable	PERSON	, a sheaf of Field 's letters to his children , and a chapter of annotated autobiography .

		The semi-annual bound volume of '' The Land of Sunshine '' -LRB-
December	DATE	to
June	DATE	-RRB- makes the accustomed good showing in text and illustrations .

		The latter are more profuse , and of a better average quality , thau heretofore , and present effectively many charming phases of
California	LOCATION	life and landscape .

		The notes by the editor , Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	, are a strong fea - ture of this periodical , piquant , vigorous , independent , and representing an Americanism of the truer and more stable sort which we have none too much of in

		Besides the proceedings of this celebration , the volume contains a biography of
Girard	PERSON	, a copy of his will , and other documents .

Karl Marx	PERSON	was a suggestive writer , no doubt , but his theories on political economy were bristling with fallacy .

		For instance , he regarded labor and value as tantamount to the same thing .

		This and other errors in his reason - ing were exposed by Professor
Eugen von Bohm	PERSON	-
Bawerk	PERSON	, the
Austrian Minister of Finance	ORGANIZATION	, in a treatise ostensibly published in honor of Professor
Karl Kneis	PERSON	.

		But the treatise really amounts to a smashing refutation of the Marxian system , and is of cosmopolitan import - ance .

		Hence Miss
Alice M. Macdonald	PERSON	has been at the pains to translate it in a volume entitled ''
Karl Marx	PERSON	and the Close of his System . ''

		To it Dr.
James Bonar	PERSON	has contributed an argumentative preface .

		The volume is published in this country by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	has nearly finished printing the first part of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri , which is being edited by Messrs.

St. Matthew 's Gospel	ORGANIZATION	,
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	,
Aristoxenus	LOCATION	,
Sophocles	LOCATION	, and of other lost and extant classics .

		The remainder is a selection of official and private documents dating from the first to the
seventh century	DATE	of our era , many of them of exceptional interest .

		The texts are accompanied by introductions , notes , and , in most cases , by translations .

		There are eight collotype plates illus - trating the papyri of principal literary and palteograph - ical importance .

		The annual gathering of booksellers and publishers ' representatives at
Chicago	LOCATION	, which has been held for several years past , is this year an event of more than usual interest to the trade .

		Most of the American houses have forwarded exhibits containing sample copies of their publications for the inspection of their custo - mers , and a considerable portion of the
Palmer House	ORGANIZATION	is converted into a book bazar for the occasion .

		Book - sellers from all parts of the West and South , and even from the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, make their annual literary pil - grimage to this unique book fair , which gives them an opportunity for inspecting and selecting stock such as they could not otherwise obtain .

		The advance copies and prospectuses of works in press make a good promise for the Fall season , and the reports of those in attend - ance are on the whole encouraging as to the conditions and prospects of the trade .

		The gathering is to continue through
July	DATE	and a part of
August	DATE	.

CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE .

		Following our custom of past years , we pre - sent , in this and the following issue of THE DIAL , a condensation of the annual summary of the literature of
Continental Europe	LOCATION	pre - pared for '' The Athenaeum '' by special con - tributors from the countries concerned .

		The articles upon which we have drawn are by Pro- fessor
Paul Fredericq	PERSON	for
Belgium	LOCATION	, Professor
V. Tille	PERSON	for
Bohemia	LOCATION	, Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	for
Denmark	LOCATION	,
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	for
France	LOCATION	,
Hofrath Robert Zimmermann	PERSON	for

S. P. Lambros	PERSON	for

Russia	LOCATION	,
Don Rafael Altamira	ORGANIZATION	for
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Herr	PERSON	Hugo Tigerschiold for
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		The Italian summary is omitted for this year , owing to the fact that
Commendatore Giacosa	PERSON	, who was to have written it , was prevented from completing his task by unavoidable demands upon his atten - tion .

		This general acknowledgment of the sources of the information in the present article , and the one to follow in our next number , will make further credit unnecessary ; but we can - not fail to add a word of appreciation of the enterprise of our English contemporary in pro- viding these summaries from year to year , and of our indebtedness for the information which they contain . ''

		In
France	LOCATION	for some years past -LSB- writes
M. Brune	PERSON	- tiere -RSB- we have got into an annoying habit of considering as relevant to literature ' only collections of verse , novels , dramatic pieces , and occasionally studies in crit - icism or literary history .

		Many reasons might be given for this ; the principal is that all the world considers itself fit to decide the value of a vaudeville or a novel ; and , in fact , a novel or a vaudeville is addressed to all the world .

		In the second place , their only aim is to ' please . '

		The engrossing claims of art are more obvi - ous , more constantly in evidence here than in a book of history or philosophy for instance , and here no effort is made to teach the reader or improve his morals .

		No petty piece is played at the
Alcazar	PERSON	or the
Eldorado	LOCATION	without finding the immediate support of twenty writers of feuilletons to criticize it .

		No novel by , say ,
M. Zola	PERSON	or
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	is published without being fully chronicled on the very day of its appearance .

		And in some journals at least , or in some reviews , if the poets 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, are infinitely less befriended than the novelists , yet they are spoken of and discussed .

		But the historians , the scholars , the philosophers , are left in the cold . ''

		The writer makes up for this neglect , as far as possible , by devoting his article very largely to works that are not '' literature '' in the narrow sense .

		First of all , he discusses at length such books as ''
Esquisse d'une Philosophic de la Religion d'apres la Psychologic	ORGANIZATION	et 1 ` Histoire , '' by
M. Auguste Sabatier	PERSON	; '' Le Catholicisme , '' by
M. Pierre Laffitte	PERSON	; `` Le Cardinal Man - ning , '' by
M. Francis de Pressense	PERSON	; and '' Le Congres des Religions , '' by
M. Victor Char	PERSON	- bonnel .

		Of the last of these , he says : '' It is one of the most curious and interesting to be read anywhere , because
M. Charbonnel	PERSON	seldom takes upon himself to speak ; he leaves that to numerous cor - respondents consulted by him all over the world on the advisability of a
Congress of Religions	ORGANIZATION	; and they have extremely divergent views on the question .

		Bat what he has not seen is that if it is easy to make a Bud - dhist , a
Mohammedan	DATE	, a Christian , and a Freethinker agree in certain common principles , it is done by ranking them as ' philosophers ' or < rationalists , ' and not at all as faithful adherents to a communion . ''

		All these books , he remarks , '' point to the undoubted conclusion that , for some time past , in
France	LOCATION	as well as in
Europe	LOCATION	, more attention than ever is being paid to religious questions , above all in their connection with social ques - tions . ''

		The plays of the year also support this conclusion , as may be illustrated by the '' Re pas du Lion , '' by
M. Francois de Curel	PERSON	; the '' Mauvais Bergers '' of
M. Octave Mirbeau	PERSON	; the '' Vassale '' of
M. Jules Case	PERSON	; and the '' Aine'e '' of
M. Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	.

		A great num - ber of dramas in verse have also appeared , such as the '' Fre ` de ` gonde '' of
M. Dubont	PERSON	, the '' Cyrano de Bergerac '' of
M. E. Rostand	PERSON	, the ''
Don Juan	PERSON	de Manara '' of
M. Haraucourt	PERSON	, the - Martyre '' of
M. Jean Richepin	PERSON	, and the '' Ville Morte '' of
M. G. d'Annunzio	PERSON	. ''

		The ' Ville Morte ' is a poem in prose , in which observations of a very subtle pyscbology , realistic and symbolic by turns , are expressed in a language both romantic and precise .

		On the contrary , the Fre ` de ' - gonde ' of
M. Dubout	PERSON	and the
Martyre	ORGANIZATION	' of
M. Richepin	PERSON	are respectively pseudo-classic tragedy , and drama or melodrama of the false romantic sort , and the more artificial for the bias of realism exhibited by their au - thors .

		The first is taken from the ' Re * cits Me ` rovingiens ' of
Augustin Thierry	PERSON	, the second from some nondescript confusion of the essence of Christianity with the pro- fanest element in the passions of love .

		A similar com - bination is readily discernible in the '
Don Juan	PERSON	' of
M. Haraucourt	PERSON	; the atmosphere is that of an ardent sensuality , also studied in the ' Passe * ' of M. 6 .

		de Porto Riche . ''

		Of ''
Cyrano de Bergerac	ORGANIZATION	, '' we read that '' Its success is , I have no doubt , known to most of my readers , and Heaven forbid that I should deny its sin - gular merit !

		It has life , youth , and gaiety , but for a five-act piece in verse it lacks depth and originality somewhat .

		This is not an essential point , and does not raise any question of art or groundwork .


M. Rostand	PERSON	is an admirable artist , and his present play marks a decided advance on his previous efforts .

		He must , how - ever , mould his verse to a more preeious metal of more homogeneity and strength . ''

		Among the poets , the following volumes are the most important , although the best of them lack not exactly originality , but personality '' : Bois Sacre * , '' by
M. le Vte	ORGANIZATION	.

		de Guerne ; ''
Jeux Rustiques	PERSON	et Divins , '' by
M. Henri de Kcgnier	PERSON	; Au Jardin de 1 ' Infante , '' by M .

		Samain ; `` La Clarte '' de Vie , '' by
M. Francis Vielc	PERSON	-
Griffin	PERSON	; and '' Poemes Fabuleux , '' by
M. Henri Ronger	PERSON	.

		Turning to the novels , only bare men - tion is made of Boisfleury , '' by M. Theuriet ; ''
Jacquine Vanesse	PERSON	, '' by
M. Cherbuliez	PERSON	; '' Sou - tien de Famille , '' by
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	; '' Com - plications Sen timen tales , '' by
M. Bourget	PERSON	; and the
Paris	LOCATION	'' of
M. Zola	PERSON	.

		On the other hand , five novels are singled out for analysis , because they all mark what we call a ' date ' in the career of their authors . ''

		They are '' Le Man - nequin d'Osier , '' by M.
France	LOCATION	; '' La Cathe 1 - drale , '' by
M. Huysmans	PERSON	; '' Les De ` racine 's , '' by
M. Barres	PERSON	; Le Desastre , '' by MM .

		Paul and
Victor Margueritte	PERSON	; and - Le Manage du Pastor Naudie , '' by
M. Rod	PERSON	. ''

		Other novels worth notice are ' Temple d'Amour , ' by
M. K'Miiv	PERSON
Saint-Maurice	LOCATION	; ` Golo / by
M. Pol Neveux	ORGANIZATION	; 1 Devant le Bonheur , ' by
M. Jean Thorel	PERSON	; ' La Confes - sion -LRB- I ' u a Enfant du Siege , ' by
M. M. Corday	PERSON	; and the 1
Saint Cendre	PERSON	' of
M. Maindron	PERSON	.

		This last author , I warn the reader , is not for bread-and-butter misses .

		To write a history of the sixteenth century and to get thoroughly at home ,
M. Maindron	PERSON	has re-read Brantome , one can see , and not forgotten him sufficiently . ''

		Much interesting correspondence has appeared during the year , notably the letters of Merimee ,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Lamennais	LOCATION	, Hugo , and Renan .

		Criti - cism and literary history are represented by a great number of works , and we have space for only a few of the more prominent titles .

		The following seem particularly worthy of mention : '' Nevroses , '' by
Madame A. Barine	PERSON	; '' 1 tusk in et la Religion de la Beaute , '' by
M. Robert	PERSON	de la Sizeranne ; ''
Ecrivains Etrangers	PERSON	, '' by
M. T. de Wyze	PERSON	`` wa ; ''
Henri Heine	PERSON	, '' by
M. J. Legras	PERSON	; ''
Ferdinand Lassalle	PERSON	, '' by
M. Ernest Seilliere	PERSON	; ''
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, Poete et Penseur , '' by
M. Henri Lichtenberger	PERSON	; '' La Philosophic de Nietzsche , '' by the same writer ; '' La Podsie Italienne Contemporaine , '' by `` Jean Dornis '' ; '' Choses et
Gens	PERSON	d'Ame * rique , '' by '' Th .

		Bent - con '' ; `` La Findu Classicisme dans les Der -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 63 nieres Annees du XVIIIe Siecle , '' by
M. Louis Bertrand	PERSON	; '' L'Elegie en
France	LOCATION	depuis
Parny jusqu'a Lamartine	PERSON	, '' by
M. Henri Potez	PERSON	; ''
Drame Ancien	PERSON	,
Drame Moderne	PERSON	, '' by
M. Emile Faguet	PERSON	; and
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	's own '' Man - uel de 1 ` Histoire de la Litterature FranQaise . ''

		Finally , historical scholarship is represented by such works as '' Voltaire avant et pendant la Guerre de Sept Ans , '' by the Due de Broglie ; '' Histoire et Poesie , '' by the Vte .

		E. M. de
Vogue	LOCATION	; '' Letters Inedites de
Napoleon	PERSON	ler , '' edited by M. Lecestre ; ''
Napoleon	PERSON	et la Fam - ille , '' by
M. Frederic Masson	PERSON	; '' La
Jeunesse de Napoleon	PERSON	, '' by
M. Arthur Chuquet	PERSON	; and
M. Renouvier	PERSON	's '' Philosophic Analytique de 1 ` Histoire . ''

		The article ends with the follow - ing suggestive paragraph : '' I may say also that history is the gate by which ideas enter into literature .

		And , as I indicated at the beginning of this article , it is not sufficient for a book to be full of ideas to be qualified as ' literature ' : it must have some qualities of form and style which raise it above its fellows .

		But it is not enough for its form to be original or exquisite : it must contain ideas , too !

		Nothing is more generally admitted in theory , at least , and discussion and nothing is more forgotten by his - torians of literature , or less put into practice , than this two-sided truism . ''


Belgium	LOCATION	, as is well known , has two literary languages , and this year something must be said of a third .

		The Belgian Germans who live on the frontier of
Luxembourg	LOCATION	and the Rhineland have begun a literary movement of their own which has resulted in the production of a number of books , of which two noteworthy examples are ''
Ludwig Tieck	PERSON	als Dramaturg , '' by
Herr Bischoff	PERSON	, and `` Die Kritik in der Englischen Literatur des 17 und 18
Jahrhun	PERSON	- derts , '' by
Herr Paul Hamelius	PERSON	.

		The Belgian French books of the year include a final volume of Laveleye 's '' Essais et Etudes '' ; a work on the '' Socialistes Anglais , '' by
M. P. Verhaegen	PERSON	; '' Ce Que Flnde Doit a la Grece , '' by M. le Comte Goblet d'Alviella : a book on
Wagner	PERSON	's '' Meistersinger , '' by
M. Maurice Kufferath	PERSON	; and '' La Vie et 1 ` Art en Autriche-Hongrie , '' by
M. J. G. Freson	PERSON	.

		There is nothing very noticeable in poetry and fiction , although nu - merous titles are cited .

		Among the Belgian Flemish books , on the other hand , several works of pure literature are prominent .

		They are : '' Madeleine , '' by Miss
Virginie Loveling	PERSON	; '' Wrakken '' -LRB- Wreck -RRB- , by
Heer	PERSON	E. de Bom ; '' Aan ' t Minnewater , '' by
Heer Maurits Sabbe	PERSON	, a decidedly taking sketch of the life of the inhabitants of
Bruges	LOCATION	; and '' Schoppenboer '' -LRB- The Knave of
Spades	LOCATION	-RRB- , by
Heer Cyriel Buysse	PERSON	, `` the Flemish Zola , who once again brings before us unabashed the crime and shame of the brutalized peasants and coarse poachers of certain parts of Flanders . ''

		Dramatic litera - ture , also , shows signs of originality in such pieces as '' De Bruid van
Quinten Metsys	PERSON	'' -LRB- The Bride of Quinten Metsys -RRB- , by
Heer H. de Marez	PERSON	; ''
Koning Hagen	PERSON	, '' by
Heer Huibert Melis	PERSON	; and '' Starkadd , '' by
Heer Alfred Heg	PERSON	- enscheidt .

		The most characteristic event of the Dutch literary year is the appearance of the fourth and last volume of Professor
H. P. G. Quack	PERSON	's '' De Socialisten . '' ''

		The author has devoted over twenty years to chroni - cling the evolution of Socialism from
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's time to the present day .

		His aim is to describe and explain the historic phenomenon of Socialism in the nineteenth cen - tury , to urge upon the reader that this ideal is more than a passing error , and to depict the principal Socialist thinkers of all times . ''

		Socialism , or at least sociology , seems to be the chief subject of the day in
Holland	LOCATION	, as is further evidenced by Mrs.
Goekoop	PERSON	's ''
Hilda van Suylenburg	PERSON	, '' a plea in fiction for the eman - cipation of women , Miss
Helene Mercier	PERSON	's ''
Sociale Schetsen	PERSON	, '' Dr.
C. J. Wynaendts Francken	PERSON	's ''
Sociale Ethiek	PERSON	, '' a collection of `` Verzamelde Opstellen , '' by the principal Dutch advocates of socialism , and the poems of the socialist editor ,
Heer Herman Gorter	PERSON	.

		Something of a surprise is the volume of '' Ver - zen '' by
Heer P. C. Boutens	PERSON	, a new writer .

		Works of fiction include '' Psyche , '' a parable by
Heer Couperus	PERSON	; '' De Roman van
Bernard Bandt	PERSON	, '' by
Heer	PERSON	H. Robbers ; '' Het Eene Noodige '' -LRB- The One Thing Needful -RRB- , by Miss
Anna de Savornin Lohman	PERSON	; and ''
Barthold Meryan	PERSON	, '' a socialistic novel by Miss
Cornelie Huyghens	PERSON	.

		More serious works are the philo - sophical '' Studies '' of Dr.
F. van Eeden	PERSON	, the '' Gouden Eeuw '' -LRB- Golden Age -RRB- of Dr.
J. P. Muller	PERSON	, and the '' Era of the Patriots , '' by Dr.
H. T. Colenbrander	PERSON	.

		The Spanish summary does not say a word about the present war , which would seem to be non-existent as far as its effect upon the pro- duction of books is concerned .

		History and the allied departments of knowledge still en - gage the best intellectual energies of the Span - iards , and of the many important works de - scribed a few must be named here . ''

		The first place is due to the voluminous and inter - esting collection of ' Relaciones Geograficas de Indias , ' the opening volume of which appeared in
1881	DATE	, the second in
1885	DATE	, and the last two in
1897	DATE	.

		Its import - ance lies in the fact that the immense majority of the 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, documents contained in it are official that ia to say , papers from the earliest times of the discovery , drawn up by our navigators , explorers , and authorities in
America	LOCATION	by order of the kings and Council of the Indies for the purpose of affording a knowledge in full detail of the new countries , and furnishing in this way a founda - tion solid and positive for the governmental arrange - ments which were framed in
Spain	LOCATION	for the colonies . ''

		Other historical works are ''
Los Origenes	LOCATION	del Justioia de Aragon , '' by
Don Julian Ribera	PERSON	; Alquimia en Espafia , '' by Professor Luanco ; and the first two volumes of a '' Historia Critica y Documentada de las
Comunidades de Cas	ORGANIZATION	- tilla , '' edited by
Sefior Danvila	PERSON	.

		A great crit - ical edition of the works of Quevedo is well under way .

		Fiction is represented by the '' 1 Abuelo '' of
Sefior Galdos	PERSON	, two small volumes of stories by
Don Juan Valera	PERSON	, '' El Saludo de las Brujas , '' by
Sefiora Bazan	PERSON	, and '' Fignra y Paisatje , '' a collection of tales by SeSor
Nar	ORGANIZATION	- ciso Oiler . ''

		Poets continue to crop up in

		ENGLISH AND SPANISH SEA POWER .

		* The wondrousness of the Elizabethan age is a commonplace , but one phase of it the dis - location of the Spanish colonial empire by the daring achievements of
Raleigh	LOCATION	,
Grenville	LOCATION	,
Drake	PERSON	, and
Hawkins	PERSON	has a peculiar interest for us who are to-day watching the breaking of the last link in the chain .

		Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	's history of ''
Drake	PERSON	and the
Tudor Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' is , therefore , particularly apposite .

		In reading it one feels that the thought of the nation is the thought of the race , and is conscious of the moral and racial connection between those cap - tains then and these to-day .

		Probably no spot on the surface of
England	LOCATION	of equal area was so fertile in men of action in the time of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	as
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The group of unforgotten heroes that issued thence
Hawkins	PERSON	,
Drake	PERSON	,
Raleigh	LOCATION	flung the En - glish flag around the globe , and , as one has said , '' hit , as with ceaseless lightning-strokes , the ships and coasts and power of
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		The Elizabethan seaman was no mere sailor .

		He was of the age in which he lived , and was lifted up by large ideas and grand purposes .

		The passion for adventure and discovery which led
Frobisher	PERSON	into three vain voyages in search of the
Northwest Passage	ORGANIZATION	, and sent Sir
John Davis	PERSON	on the elusive Cathayan quest , was only equalled by English hatred of the Spaniard , whether as a cruel trader , a heartless colonist , or an inquis - itorial fanatic .

		The mixture of these motives of the corsair and the theologian resulted in that curious combination of Puritanism and piracy which is a psychic feature of the epoch .

		One of the most interesting paragraphs Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	has penned is this : '' To men who went to their Bible for their opinions as we go to our newspapers , the Papists easily became Egyptians to be despoiled , Amalekites to be destroyed .

		It was a creed that came comfortably to a pirate , and yet it would be to misread the times to doubt that it was not also a real conviction .

		To the earnest , and particularly the uneducated , Protestant , the Catholics were idolaters .

		For him the mass was an abomination , as honestly loathed as by earnest Catholics it was de - voutly loved .

		The two sentiments are correlative , and to ignore the force of the one is to underrate the depth of the other .

		Nor must we forget the large class that stood between the two extremes of religious opinion , a class of men ambitious of name and fortune , bent on achieving their careers , and yet by instinct or education * DRAKE AND THE
TUDOR NAVY	ORGANIZATION	.

England	LOCATION	as a

		scrupulous enough to reject any means for which a re - ligious sanction was not to be found ... The chaplain of
Drake	ORGANIZATION	's ship ... solemnly told him that it was law - ful to recover his losses upon the King of
Spain	LOCATION	; and
Bishop Jewell	PERSON	, we are told , had given to
Elizabeth	PERSON	his opinion that to exact reprisals from the Spaniards would be pleasing in the sight of God . ''


Francis Drake	PERSON	was the son of a Devonshire farmer , and was born in the mid-years of the English revolt against
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The seed of Catholic hatred was in the family .

		In his boy - hood , '' so clear was the issue , so intense the party feeling , that children forgot their games to play at politics .

		They snowballed the Span - ish ambassador ; they fought mock - combats between
Wyatt	PERSON	and the Prince of
Spain	LOCATION	, and once were barely prevented from hanging the lad who played the part of Philip . ''

		His father , who had suffered in his fortunes , got a place among the seamen in the
King	LOCATION	's navy to read prayers to them , and during his famous son 's early years was stationed at
Grillingham Reach	ORGANIZATION	, just below
Chatham	LOCATION	, which was the eastern headquarters of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here , '' where the old navy hulks were like playfellows , and the river a taskmaster to be learned and humored , ''
Drake	PERSON	got the first bent toward the sea which his kinship with
Hawkins	PERSON	confirmed .

		When he was eighteen he went with the latter as third officer of a ship to
Biscay	LOCATION	.

		Soon after , at a time which can not be determined , and on an unknown vessel , he shipped to the Indies .

		In
1567	DATE	he joined
Hawkins	PERSON	's third Indian voyage .

		On this expedition the affair of
Nombre de Dios	ORGANIZATION	won him a command .

		A three-years independ - ent voyage followed -LRB- 1571-1574 -RRB- , during which
Drake	PERSON	systematically rifled the towns of the Spanish Main .

		It was on this trip that from the ridge of the Cordilleras the first En - glish eyes saw the wondrous waters of the
South Sea	LOCATION	open before them ; and then it was that the ambition was born within him to circumnavi - gate the globe .

		But though
Drake	PERSON	was the first commander so to do -LRB- 1577-1580 -RRB- , the great - ness of this feat lies rather in his marvellous seamanship , and as the prophecy of English colonial empire , than in rounding
Cape Horn	LOCATION	and crossing the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		In
Drake	PERSON	's time the problem of the navigation of the
North Pacific	LOCATION	had been solved , so that '' this part of his feat , '' as Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	points out , '' can in no way com - pare with
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	's heroic venture across what was then an absolutely trackless waste . ''

		When one reads of the amazing difficulties which
Drake	PERSON	met from storm and tempest off the
Straits	LOCATION	, one can well believe that to English - men the empire of the sea is given .

		Let Mr. 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	,
Corbett	PERSON	and the log of the Golden Hind tell the story of
Drake	ORGANIZATION	's adventures off Cape Horn : '' They were involved in a maze of tortuous channels where , buffeted hither and thither by constantly chang - ing wind * that without warning swept down upon them in icy squalls from every direction , they were in contin - ual danger of wreck .

		Above them frowned tiers of glaciers and peaks higher and more fantastic than they bad ever seen .

		Below them were depths no cable could fathom .

		All the terrors of the abandoned passage were about them , and they seemed at the mercy of God .

		Still they struggled on , and by the seventeenth day bad the
South Sea	LOCATION	before them ... For two days they stood northwest ... and the wont of their dan - gers seemed past , when they were struck by a gale from the northeast which proved to be of a severity far beyond anything they had ever heard of . '

		God , ' says the
Nar	ORGANIZATION	- rative , ' by a contrary wind and terrible tempest , seemed to set himself against us . '

		Day after day they drove in snow and darkness to west-southwest before a storm that continually increased in fury .

		To add to their terrors , at the end of tf week there was an eclipse of the moon , and a fortnight later , in the nighttime , the Marigold disappeared and was never heard of again ... By the end of the month they had been driven , as they calcu - lated , beyond the fifty-seventh parallel and some two hundred leagues to the westward .

		With
October	DATE	the weather slightly mended , and they managed to work back to the northeast , so that by the 7th they were able to anchor among some islands a little to the north of the point where they had emerged from the
Straits	LOCATION	.

		It was the first land they had seen since a month before they bad met the gale .

		Exhausted with their toil , they were enjoying the prospect of riding out the storm in peace , when , a few hours after anchoring , a squall caught them .

		The Golden Hind parted her cable , the
Elizabeth	PERSON	had to slip hers , and though both vessels managed to regain the open sea , they almost immediately lost sight of each other and never met again ... Meanwhile , the Admiral was once more driven to the southward ; nor was it until be had been carried as low as the fifty - fifth parallel that the terrific weather moderated .

		At this height he was able to run in among some islands ; ... but even here they had but little rest .

		In two days a renewal of the gale drove them from their an - chors , and increased to such violence that they regarded their escape from the lee shore and the unprecedented seas as no less than a miracle .

		When it abated a little they ran in again among some islands probably in
Darwin Sound	LOCATION	, not many leagues to the south of their former anchorage .

		But again the foul weather in - creased .

		The Golden Hind lost another anchor and cable , and once more
Drake	PERSON	's consummate seamanship was like an interposition of
Providence	LOCATION	to save them .

		A storm of such fury and persistence was beyond all experience . '

		The like of it , ' says the Narrative , ' no traveller had felt , neither hath there ever been such a tempest that any records make mention of , so violent and of such continuance , since
Noah	PERSON	's flood , for it lasted from
September 7	DATE	to
October 28	DATE	full fifty-two days . ' ''

		After these experiences ,
Drake	PERSON	, in a single vessel , continued his way northward , reaching the Chilian and Peruvian coasts , and finally falling in with the treasure-ship of the viceroy of Pern , laden with thirteen chests of pieces of eight , eighty pounds of gold and twenty-six tons of silver , besides jewels and plate .

		The effect of these daring enterprises upon the Spanish colonies was great .


Mexico	LOCATION	,
Central America	LOCATION	, the west coast , were filled with alarm .

		Prayers were offered in the churches for deliverance from
Drake	LOCATION	, and the Bishop of
Guatemala	LOCATION	offered the provincial governor the bells of his cathedral to be melted down into guns .

		Meanwhile
Drake	PERSON	's sole thought was how to get home in safety .

		He believed that there was choice of four routes : one by the Moluccas and
Cape of Good Hope	LOCATION	; one by the Straits of
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	the way he had come ; a third by
Norway	LOCATION	, or '' The Northeast Passage '' of Ca - bot 's Muscovy Company ; the fourth by the famous '' Northwest Passage '' which
Martin Frobisher	PERSON	lived for and
Hendrik Hudson	PERSON	died for .

		But the Admiral at last concluded that safety advised the known Portuguese route , and so , after skirting the coast of North Amer - ica beyond
Cape Mendocino	LOCATION	with no sign of the looked-for Straits , and having taken pos - session of
California	LOCATION	in the name of his Queen , he bent his course straight for the
East Indies	LOCATION	.

		The immortal voyage of nearly three years ended late in
September	DATE	, when the Golden Hind dropped anchor in
Plymouth Sound	LOCATION	.

		Knighthood was
Drake	ORGANIZATION	's reward .

		The great man returned at a welcome mo - ment , for early in
1580	DATE	the last of the
Avis	ORGANIZATION	, the reigning house of
Portugal	LOCATION	, had died , and
Philip II	PERSON	.

		immediately laid claim to the throne in right of his wife .

		Protestant
Europe	LOCATION	was aghast .

		The political situation was a crisis . '

		If Philip bad been formidable before , he was doubly formidable now .

		Besides the whole of the
East Indies	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, and the African settlements , he could claim all the
Peninsula	LOCATION	; of the Italian states ,
Sicily	LOCATION	,
Naples	LOCATION	,
Sardinia	LOCATION	, and the Duchy of
Milan	LOCATION	; and in the north , all of what is now
Holland	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		... To appre - ciate the prominence into which the new situation ulti - mately forced
Drake	PERSON	, the position of other powers must be borne in mind .

		The Pope , between fear of the old rivalry of a real empire and hatred of the heretic powers , must be practically neutral .


France	LOCATION	was equally incapa - ble of action .

		She was at this time divided between the Valois king at
Paris	LOCATION	, representing the national
Gallican Church	ORGANIZATION	, the
Bourbon Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	, head of the Huguenots and champion of reformation , and lastly , the Ultramontane Guises leaning on
Rome	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	was as much divided . ''

		It fell , then , upon
England	LOCATION	alone to face
Spain	LOCATION	's imperial designs and the counter-reformation .

		Drake , appealed to by
Walsingham	PERSON	, with ready wit recommended the seizure of the
Azores	LOCATION	; but the scheme failed because of
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's false policy of mixing commercialism and pol - itics .

		She allowed the
Muscovy Company	ORGANIZATION	a share in the enterprise , so that it degenerated
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 into a disastrous filibustering expedition .

		As if to accomplish its ruin ,
Drake	PERSON	himself , much to his disgust , was kept at home , '' because , in view of the warlike outlook , it was thought unwise to let him leave the country . ''

		But civil honors the mayoralty of
Plymouth	LOCATION	, member - ship in the
Royal Navy Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and finally election to Parliament were paltry rewards for a man of action in those stirring times .

		At this point it is a matter of amazement to one unacquainted with the diplomacy of the sixteenth century to be told that , in spite of these years of privateering and reprisal by both
Spain	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, the two powers were yet technically at peace .

		Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	has some illuminating paragraphs upon the international law of the time .

		He says : '' The feature of international relations which most sharply distinguishes the sixteenth century from our own time is the length to which hostilities could be pushed without leading to an open rupture .

		Continually we encounter the phenomena of two powers standing with regard to each other in a position that was neither peace nor war .

		... It was then in foreign affairs a recognized proceeding for a sovereign to seek redress in one of the various forms of hostility which by the consent of international lawyers were regarded as fall - ing short of war . ''

		The incensed condition of the two nations , how - ever , at last -LRB- in
1584	DATE	-RRB- found vent .

		The ex - pansive force of English commerce , the adven - turous and militant spirit of the nation , and religious fervor , all combined for the inevitable duel .

		At this moment the Spanish monarchy was at its height .

		The acquisition of
Portugal	LOCATION	by
Philip	LOCATION	had given him what he had long de - sired an
Atlantic	LOCATION	fleet ; for hitherto , save the galleons and frigates of the Indian Guard , the Spanish king had no standing navy .

		More - over , the latter , since they were maintained by a special tax levied upon those merchants en - gaged in traffic , were not legally available for the purposes of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1584	DATE	, for the fifth time ,
Drake	ORGANIZATION	sailed on a two-years cruise to the Indies , harrying the Spanish coast on the way out , and relieving
Raleigh	LOCATION	's
Virginia	LOCATION	colony on the return .

		Events moved fast with him now .

		In
1587	DATE	he was ac - tive in new depredations on the Spanish coasts , which he described as '' singeing the King of
Spain	LOCATION	's beard . ''

		In
1588	DATE	English naval prowess reached its height in the defeat of the Spanish Armada , though
Drake	PERSON	did not play the most prominent part in those stirring events .

		Like
Nelson	PERSON	,
Drake	PERSON	was great enough to disobey orders at times when his judgment advised .

		This conduct not unnaturally angered his su - periors , so that the official dispatches give lit - tle light concerning his work in those memo - rable channel engagements , though we know he was not punished for his independence .

		The truth is , the great Admiral never could work successfully under instructions , and the red tape of officialdom in
1589	DATE	, when the Lis - bon Expedition was entrusted to him , brought him into disgrace .

		The loss of the Revenge in the next year restored him to favor .

		For some years he was employed on Parliamentary commissions and on missions , and at last , in
1596	DATE	, again found himself in command of a squadron .

		The objective point was
Panama	LOCATION	still a virgin city .

		But times had changed in the twenty years since
Drake	PERSON	had reconnoitred it from the forest along the Isthmus road , and this neither the Queen nor
Drake	PERSON	himself ap - preciated . ''

		In the failure to grasp that
Spain	LOCATION	had become a great sea-power , with a fleet in a constant state of prep - aration , and admirals well practised in protecting large numbers of ships , lay the fatal misconception that over - hung the whole expedition . ''

		Elizabeth never gave the slightest evidence of grasping even the elementary principles of na - val warfare , and what
England	LOCATION	had achieved had been in spite of her .

		Of Drake Mr.
Cor	PERSON	- bett has something to say in palliation , for , with the knowledge at his command , the project was sound .

		The trouble was that he had been kept out of touch with the enemy for five years , and , moreover , naturally expected to repeat his former triumphs .

		He could only judge by the experience of his first great expedition .

		Mis - fortune attended the entire voyage , - at
Las Palmas	LOCATION	, at
Guadeloupe	LOCATION	, at
Porto Rico	LOCATION	.

		From present evidence Spannish gunnery has wof ully declined since those days , for as the fleet made the harbor at
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, '' The batteries opened so hot a fire that the surprise was on the part of the English , and as the Spanish gunners got the range the fire grew deadly .

		A shot got home in the Defiance 's mizzen , another crashed through her main cabin where
Drake	PERSON	and his officers were sitting at supper , and with disastrous effect .

		The Admiral had his seat shot from under him ; Sir
Nicho	PERSON	- las
Clifford	PERSON	and
Brute Brown	PERSON	, a great favorite of
Drake	LOCATION	, were mortally wounded , and several others more or less hurt . ''

		Worst of all ,
Drake	PERSON	, in his own words , had '' hardly any time left to serve God . ''

		He was ill to death of dysentery , but the brave spirit in him would not yet down .

		Nombre de Dios , the scene of his earliest exploits ,
La Hacha	LOCATION	, and
Santa Marta	LOCATION	were successfully attacked , as if in amends for earlier disaster .

		But the heaviness increased upon him , and on
January 68	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1 , 27 , 1597	DATE	,
Francis Drake	PERSON	died and was buried at sea off the coast of
Honduras	LOCATION	.

		Yet his work died not with him .

		Drake was more than a daring navigator and a prince of corsairs of whom
England	LOCATION	is half ashamed to be proud . ''

		It was he whose pre - science saw the importance sea-power was to have upon his country 's history .

		He was a statesman whose thought and achievement has made him one of the conscious creators of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	.

		The British Empire is his monument , as it is Olive 's and
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's and
Canning 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		In praising the Admiral , a word in praise of his historian must not be withheld .

		Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	has done his work so well that it would seem no manuscript has been left untouched .

		Black-letter tomes from
the Records and Rolls Office	ORGANIZATION	, the treasures of the British Museum , state documents , Spanish , Dutch , and French archives , and family papers , all have been searched and compared by a practised student .

		The specialist will rejoice in the technical ac - count of the development of naval art in the sixteenth century , and the initiated will find in these two volumes a mass of supplemental information upon the politics of the time , its statecraft and diplomacy .

New York	LOCATION	: Ch * rl < * Scribner 's Son * .

		the many questions involved , and his under - standing of the great lawyer 's purpose , indicate frequent conferences between the men , and a close bond of confidence and affection .

		Before Mr.
Field	PERSON	's death in
1894	DATE	, at the age of almost ninety years , he had long been recog - nized as one of the greatest men in his profes - He loved the law .

		He had mastered its sion .

		principles .

		He had been eminently successful .

		His practice was large and lucrative .

		But he saw its faults both in expression and practice .

		During the best years of his life he wrought for the reformation of the law itself .

		He be - lieved that it should be administered with less of process , in order that men might have its help with less of delay and at a minimum cost .

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	was led to this great object of his life by seeing the possible injustice of legal proceedings .

		Even to those outside the profes - sion the words ** law and equity '' are perfectly familiar .

		We would suppose that the terms refer to such laws as shall secure what every - one sees to be equitable .

		But not so .

		Equity may manifestly point one way , while the law may be directly opposed to this .

		Lord Chan - cellor
Westbury	LOCATION	, speaking before the English Law Amendment Society , revealed the condi - tions when he said that it was '' a shame that a party could recover a judgment on one side of
Westminster Hall	PERSON	, and on the other be branded as a rogue for having recovered it . ''

		The more thoroughly he considered '' the body of common law , '' and its methods of pro- cedure , the more of injustice he beheld .

		Com - mon law !

		What is it ?

		Not , as some suppose , those rules founded on the great basal princi - ples of justice , commonly held among men as universally right .

		These would certainly win and retain our regard .

		But no , not this .

		Com - mon law is only common usage .

		It is not a compilation of the laws enacted by legislatures , but consists of precedents , the decisions of judges , some of them wise , some otherwise ; some weak , some wicked .

		Is it any wonder that a lover of justice should be dissatisfied with such a system ?

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	would not destroy law because he did not like it , but would improve it because he so loved it .

		And so , from
1839	DATE	, for fifty-five years he devoted him - self to this great task .

		Through his efforts the legislature in
New York	LOCATION	, in
1847	DATE	, appointed a commission , of which he became chairman , to present codes of civil and criminal procedure .

		These were completed in
1850	DATE	, and covered the whole ground of remedial law .

		The work had fallen almost entirely on Mr.
Field	PERSON	, but such
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 was his eagerness for the cause that he cheer - fully assumed the burdens .

		The successful working of the reform meth - ods in
New York	LOCATION	led other States to adopt Mr.
Field	PERSON	's codes .

		And the influence was not confined to this continent .

		English statesmen saw the benefits , and immediately sought to profit from Mr.
Field	PERSON	's work .

		Then he deter - mined to go still farther , even to the reforma - tion and codification of the whole body of com - mon law ; to throw out what was needless and manifestly unjust ; to put desirable decisions into simplest and best possible language , and to '' reduce into a written and systematic code the whole body of the law . ''

		The
New York Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, in
1857	DATE	, appointed commissioners to perform this work , but allowed no compen - sation in any way .

		`` The law was to be made so plain that every man could understand it , and so obviously just that all should approve it . ''

		In this work Mr.
Field	PERSON	had the partial assistance of the other commissioners , but the greater part of the work and the expense de - volved upon him .

		Day and night he worked with a persistence almost incredible , until , in
1865	DATE	, on his sixtieth birthday , the last report was made to the legislature .

		The codes for
New York	LOCATION	had been written .

		The civil code , the penal code , and the political code give the substantive law .

		Two others , the codes of civil and of criminal procedure , prescribe the prac - tice of the courts and define their jurisdiction .

		Thus , for nearly eighteen years had Mr.
Field	PERSON	labored , and at last the great work was ready for use .

		One would suppose that common sense would dictate an immediate adoption of such an im - proved formulation of laws and methods .

		But to-day , after thirty-three years ,
New York State	ORGANIZATION	has only partially adopted them , not because of imperfections , but because there are men small enough , and yet with enough of influence , to hinder the adoption of codes which would simplify the processes of law , and make less work for lawyers .

		The task , however , was not in vain .

		Other States have seen the advantages which Mr.
Field	PERSON	's own
State	ORGANIZATION	has neglected ; so that , at the present time , it is estimated that forty millions of American citizens are enjoying the help which Mr.
Field	PERSON	's work made possible .

		En - gland also has been helped .

		English colonies the world over have incorporated these reforms .

		While travelling in
India	LOCATION	he was surprised to find courts of law working under rules which he had written , word for word , in his library in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		And even in
Singapore	LOCATION	and
Hongkong	ORGANIZATION	he saw justice administered according to statutes which he had worded .

		A still larger conception presented itself to him .

		It was nothing less than the codification of international laws .

		His interests were world-wide .

		In his travels in every land he had become intimately acquainted with the states - men of the world .

		In this new undertaking he found an interest already existing , but no one ready to assume the task .

		He had already reached an age when most men plan to make their work easier ; but with a great thought before him , and with the encouragement of the world 's legal thinkers , he began a work so vast that even with skilled assistance it required seven years of unremitting toil before he could produce his '' Draft of Outlines of International Law . ''

		It was not a final statement , for he felt that International Law was progressive ; but it was a good foundation , and strengthened an international sentiment .

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	was interested in all public mat - ters , wherever men live .

		The previously un - written history of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's first nomination shows Mr.
Field	PERSON	as a power among ambitious and contending forces , and tells us who really gave us our great War President .

		His partici - pation and leadership in the peace parliaments in different lands reveal his influence and his purpose .

		Only once did Mr.
Field	PERSON	hold public office , and then for only two months , to fill an unexpired term in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, while the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	was at work in
1876	DATE	.

		At no time did he occupy the Judge 's bench ; such honors he left for others , while he devoted himself to his chosen task of the revision and classification of the laws .

		This is but a part of the record which Dr. Field has given of his distinguished brother 's career .

		Such a life-story , told in such a way , should be of interest , not only to members of the bar , but to thinking men and women in every walk of life .

		THE following extract is from a letter recently written by Mr.

Curtin	PERSON	, his English translator : '' I receive a multitude of letters from
America	LOCATION	.

		In a few weeks upward of two hundred and seventy have come to me , and eight or ten new ones arrive every day .

		These letters are so many in num - ber that in view of my work and family afflictions I have been unable to answer them .

		I shall send replies to all those letters , but not till I have finished ' The Knights of the Cross . '

		That work done , I shall take up at once the letters sent me from

		* '' Letters on Strategy , '' by Prince
Kraft zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen	PERSON	, is published in the En - glish ''
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	Series '' of military books .

		The work is translated into straightforward , idio - matic , military English ; the editor is Captain
Walter H. James	PERSON	of the English army .

		It is in two volumes which are excellently printed , and the elaborate maps and plans are carefully drawn .

		The letters do not treat of abstract rules of strategy , but deduce their lessons from actual campaigns .

		The campaigns considered are the Napoleonic campaign of
1806	DATE	against the
Prus	PERSON	- sians , which ended in the battle of
Jena	LOCATION	; the campaign of
1859	DATE	in
Italy	LOCATION	, in which the last
Napoleon	PERSON	fought the Austrians under
Gyulai	PERSON	; and the campaigns of the Franco-Prussian War in
1870	DATE	.

		As the reader interested in military studies knows , the late Prince
Kraft	PERSON	was the author of several highly valued works on military sub - jects .

		Among our own army men his Con - versations on Cavalry '' is held in high esteem .

		Captain
James	PERSON	says of Prince
Kraft	PERSON	: '' He was not only known as one of
Prussia	LOCATION	's ablest soldiers , but also as one of the best of German military authors .

		During the wars of
1866	DATE	and
1870	DATE	he com - manded the artillery of the Guard -LRB- an army corps of three divisions -RRB- , and in the latter part of the
Franco	PERSON	- Prussian war he directed the artillery operations against
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		So much for an introduction to a work which needs nothing more than an introduction .

		The present reviewer has given these '' Letters on Strategy '' great attention , and it seems to him that there is no other work with which he is acquainted , however great the military genius of its author , that will set the student better in the way of learning the art of strategy .

		Prince
Kraft	PERSON	studied the art of war under the old masters ; he lived his life in the army ; he had vast experience in war ; evidently his mind was absorbed in his profession , and certainly he was a gallant soldier .

		He knew the dangers of war , and liked them for the honor there was in braving them .

		Fortunately , so good a soldier possessed also the rare art of the teacher .

		No technical book could be more pleasantly written .

		In the first place , Prince
Kraft	PERSON	does away with abstractions , and with the numbered rules and their unnumbered exceptions which , he says , used to put him to sleep when he was a LETTERS ox STRATEGY .

		student .

		He does not believe in learning the dry formulas and rules of the books which , after all , teach one very little about war and only give him a distaste for the subject .

		But having discarded the learning of the books , he does not delight the student by saying that there is little left to learn : on the contrary , he says that only the study and the experience of years will make a fair general officer , or an efficient staff officer .

		Prince
Kraft	PERSON	shows that the knowledge which largely goes to make the strategist is the knowledge of almost countless details .

		Napoleon excelled in this sort of knowl - edge .

		Genius without the knowledge of these details would be helpless .

		Certainly
Germany	LOCATION	, which called itself '' The Nation in Arms , '' has gone a long way towards discovering what are the secrets of military success .

		The best energies of its best men have been given to the study of this question .

		In this important time in our own country , when every day witnesses the appointment of civil - ians and other inexperienced men to staff posi - tions in our army , I can not forbear quoting what one of the best of these German authori - ties says as to the necessary technical knowl - edge of the staff officer : * A good strategist requires a vast amount of knowl - edge .

		Not only must he be acquainted with the organ - ization of his own and foreign armies , he must be thoroughly up in the proper mode of issuing orders , instructions , and march tables : he must know all about marches , camping , cantonments and bivouacs , lines of communication and supplies , besides what is wanted with regard to weapons , ammunition , and clothing .

		He must be able to make military sketches and to recon - noitre , be well posted in all matters concerning fortifi - cations and fighting , understand the management of telegraphs and railways , and the transport of the wounded .

		He must be well acquainted with statistics , so as to know the capabilities of a country , and the num - ber of troops it can maintain , and should be sufficiently well up in civil administration to be able to rule a con - quered country until the regular civil officials can take over this duty .

		He must be able to judge the carrying capacity of a railroad and appraise the power of resist - ance of a fortress , having regard to its position , con - struction , and garrison . ''

		In the present war our national existence is not at stake , to be sure , and we shall be vic - torious whoever are our staff officers ; but if our country is not at stake , the lives of our countrymen are , and certainly when our coun - trymen go out to fight and risk their lives for us we should not , by the appointment of ineffi - cient staff officers , make their fight any harder or their risk any greater .

		On every page of these two volumes by Prince
Kraft	PERSON	he shows how good or evil came from the work of the

		THE DIAL 71 staff .

		Anyone reading these volumes will hope that before another war , before another cam - paign in this war , army appointments may be forever cut loose from politics and favoritism , and that the appointing power may appreciate its serious duty its duty as serious as life and death , its duty which is bound up with its honor to appoint over our brave soldiers the best military men that the country affords .

		A very instructive matter that Prince
Kraft	PERSON	notices in every war he writes of is the influence of politics .

		In each war , politics was , on one side or the other , a cause of disaster .

		It is only by sheer luck that popular demand as to mili - tary movements is not wrong .

		In
1870	DATE	Mc -
Mahon	PERSON	was driven by the
Paris	LOCATION	newspapers and the
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	to take a step contrary to military reason .

		It was a step bound to fail .

		It ended in the battle of Sedan .

		Prince
Kraft	PERSON	was a firm disbeliever in coun - cils of war .

		He believed that these councils were bad in every way .

		In the campaign of
1806	DATE	, the combined plan of all the generals was worse than the poorest plan proposed by any of them .

		To show the perfection to which the German commissary department attained , the author states that during the great war he recalls only two days when the men did not have proper rations .

		Those were the days of the battles of
St. Privat	ORGANIZATION	and Sedan .

		There is no reason why we can not do as well .

		If these books could be widely read they would do much towards teaching what are the duties of soldiers , officers , generals , legislatures , newspapers , and cabinets in war , and in pre - paring for war .

		MEDIAEVAL , LAW AND POLITICS .

		* A more inclusive title than that Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	has chosen for his '' Law and Politics in the Middle Ages '' would be difficult to find .

		Yet such a careful study of the book as its merit warrants will prove the exactitude of the title .

		The work is not , however , a complete history of mediaeval times , which is fairly implied in words so comprehensive as law and politics this would be to assign to them a quantitative , when they are to be taken in a qualitative sense ; but rather an inquiry into the origins and natures of the laws and politics of

		the establishment of modern methods of legis - lation and government .

		In the late Professor von Ihering 's '' The Evolution of the Aryan , '' an admirable exam - ple of close argument from historic law to pre - historic custom is to be had , wherein seemingly inexplicable matters in the lex scripta are at last compelled to unfold themselves in a pan - orama , dimly lighted but not indistinct , of national happenings in the days of demigods .

		This monumental work is the evolution of the Aryan in a double sense : it is the latest pro- duct in the process of evolution of the methods made most familiar to us through the writings of Sir
Henry Maine	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	has not pro- gressed so far , nor are his pretensions so great .

		There is nothing in his ratiocination which makes us involuntarily exclaim in admiration , as in the elder work .

		He is more cautious , and does not find it needful to pass some of his topics on the run , as it were , in his haste to illumine a vast area with facts which at best are dim .

		If he is less clever , he is still original ; though his work is only one of many , filling a necessary place with credit if not with distinc - tion a step towards the goal , if not the goal itself .

		It may be that no one will ever do more than round out von Ihering 's work where his lamented death left it confessedly incomplete ; it is a certainty that Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	's study will find some of its conclusions embodied in some mas - terly consideration of the question of the ob - scuration of his own place as an investigator . ''

		It aims to deal only with conduct , not with speculation ; with action , not with thought , '' he says of his work . ''

		It should be further con - fessed that the book makes no pretence of severe scholarship , '' he adds .

		We hasten to supplement these explanations with comment of our own : it leaves established in a manner both clear and comprehensive the simple thesis which he sets out to demonstrate , '' that law , at any rate in the Middle Ages , is not the arbitrary command of authority , but something entirely different . ''

		Palpably , this is a flight in the face of Aus - tinian dogma .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	, where the multi - plicity of special students in all fields of thought leave conflicting theories in nearly all of them , a clash of authorities from which the final spark of truth is to leap , it is a comparatively light matter to dispute the conclusions of any thinker , however profound sometimes it is a mere question of marshalling the appropriate monographs on the subject in opposition .

		In
England	LOCATION	, where the national love for precedent 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, and authority is frequently overwhelming , the skilful limitation of Professor
Austin	PERSON	's famous definition is to be imputed to Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	both for courage and zeal for truth .

		Yet his rea - soning , always cogent , is by no means startling in either premises or conclusion .

		The Austin ian theory , that '' law is a command of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' is found to fit affairs very well indeed when in that condition we call final '' because our own notions have not advanced beyond it .

		But it fails us when we inquire into the beginnings of things .

		Something even more remote than
Blaokstone	PERSON	's definition of custom is implied , and here is to be sought the seed of the lex non scripta .

		Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	brings this out clearly .

		The law , national , and the politics , interna - tional , are shown by him to be matters not of command but of determination .

		Given a state - ment of facts , and there was always a condition of law to meet it , crude and plastic it may be , but still enough to limit the labors of courts , councillors , and kings to ascertaining and re - cording it they do nothing more than mint the gold they mine , leaving its value unchanged though more readily ascertainable .

		To follow Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	into details , especially in his vivid presentment of the contractual idea hi its later developments , is to fail to interest the general reader , though his conclusions are important to the special student .

		To the latter it may indeed be highly commended , not least because it serves to show how assured a place is held by the administration of justice in English-speaking lands , its roots being deeply planted in the very genius of the people evolved by long habitudes , its trunk being an orderly and regular progression , free during many cen - turies from arbitrary disturbance , its branches flourishing in an atmosphere of slow but effi - cient adaptability .

		That the ripened product of such a growth should be rather the holy fear of injustice than a desire to measure out exact retribution , is the crowning glory of it all though Mr.
Jenks	PERSON	does not say so .

		GUESSES AT THE RIDDLES OF SOCIETY .

		* Mr.
J. H. W. Stnckenberg	PERSON	, the author of an In - troduction to the Study of Sociology , '' declares bis purpose to be '' to lay tbe basis for sociological study , to designate the problems involved , and to aid the beginner in tbe solution of these problems . ''

		His book is designed for use among professional men , private students , and classes in educational institu - tions .

		The first chapter is devoted to the '' genesis of the idea of society , '' the various attempts to found a science of sociology .

		After Comte , only a few works are mentioned , and these very briefly .

		Then follows a discussion of the definition and scope of sociology .

		The subject-matter of sociology is every kind of human association , tbe association energies , what associates men , what creates society , and the results of association .

		Excluded from sociological study are metaphysical problems , as materialism and spiritualism ; biology ; the theory of evolution ; psy - chology , save as an instrument of research ; theology .

		A protest is entered against attempting to expand economics or politics over the field of sociology : '' in one case society is reduced to industrialism ; and in tbe other , to a political institution . ''

		Theoretically and practically , both tendencies are pernicious , and lead to intellectual bias and to actual injury . ''

		By grouping the various disciplines which pertain to humanity , we at best get only separate sciences of certain human factors , as economics and politics ; but this leaves society itself without a science . ''

		In the '' Principles of Society '' we are asked to consider '' all that must be in order that society may be . ''

		The author declares that '' every effort to interpret society as composed of individuals has proved a signal failure .

		Yet that is the universal conception of society ... Strictly speaking , indi - viduals are aggregated , never associated . ''

		He ad - mits that this is a private and original judgment , and that the dictionaries are against him .

		Perhaps bondage to traditional and customary modes of think - ing of society as composed of real people , makes one obtuse ; but the sentence quoted will be a hard say - ing to many , and the author struggles all through the book to explain and enforce his idea .

		Society is said , further , not to consist of individuals in their totality , but only so much of each individual as actually enters society -LRB- pages 118 , 119 -RRB- .

		What tbe members of a society have in common , the purpose of the association , what they share , constitutes the association .

		This conception of a part of a person joining a club and leaving the major part of his INTRODUCTION TO TBB STUDY OF SOCIOLOGY .

		THE DIAL 73 substance elsewhere , or locked in the secret abysses of his inner consciousness , will stagger some begin - ners .

		The proper materials of sociology are not men , but `` social energies . ''

		Money -LRB- p. 124 -RRB- is called a social force .

		The author introduces the word '' Sociation '' to designate those personal forces which interact be - tween men , what men share , what associates .

		He claims that all men have reserves which are never drawn into this union , never form a part of the essence of society . ''

		The beginner may find it dif - ficult to treat society as a system of forces ; but practice will overcome the difficulty , and he will soon wonder how he could ever imagine that society consisted of individuals as totalities , instead of the social energies of individuals '' -LRB- p. 136 -RRB- .

		The author himself seems to find it difficult to do what he pre - scribes for beginners , for he says -LRB- p. 245 -RRB- : '' Hit - man beings really associated , whether consciously or not , that is th * fundamental concept of society . ''

		And again -LRB- p. 247 -RRB- : '' Men with their attachments are the social factors in which the social energies inhere . ''

		Under the title '' Historical Evolution '' the various social forces are enumerated and their functions defined , but there is very scant unfolding of the laws of the process .

		There is a long criticism of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's formulas . ''

		Sociological Ethics '' deals with the ends of society and the means of realizing them . ''

		Social ethics purposes to give a system of social morality ; in sociological ethics we aim to give the principles of social progress '' -LRB- p. 208 -RRB- .

		Very brief treatment is given to the social ideal , and to the means of progress .

		The teacher will be interested in the author 's method in the study of sociology .

		This method con - sists in the discovery of the principles , of the evolu - tion of social energies , and of the ideals and means of progress .

		A brief bibliography is supplied , and at the close a plan for the study of a community is furnished .

		The author has read widely , travelled far , lived long in
Europe	LOCATION	, and gives to his readers many suggestions drawn from reflection and obser - vation .

		The trained student may read the book with real hope of stimulation and of gaining new points of view .

		The vision of life is lofty , ethical , and spiritual .

		But the book is not for beginners , and the contributions offered to the discussion are open to severe criticism .

		There is no attempt to throw light on current and concrete problems , or to attain general laws .

		The recommendations of books heap titles together without clear discrimination , the powerful masterpieces being classed with very infer - ior works , with no hint of the vast difference between them .

		It is questionable whether the pedagogic method is at all suitable for young students ; and in this respect most teachers will feel that the last chapter should be first and much enlarged .

		The teacher should be familiar with the subjects of the earlier chapters , but the pupil should start with the last subject mentioned , with the plan of a commu - nity or with definite problems or situations which will at once engage his voluntary attention .

		Clearness , downright honesty , and straightfor - ward purpose to report the mind of the writer , char - acterize the '' Outlines of Sociology , '' by Dr.
Lester F. Ward	PERSON	.

		The discussion is not adapted to juvenile minds , but it should be clear to any mature student who has had a good college course and some first - hand acquaintance with scientific modes of thought .

		The classification of the sciences offered by
Comte	ORGANIZATION	is accepted , with explanations , as substantially valid , astronomy , physics , chemistry , biology , and soci - ology .

		A distinct place should be given to psychol - ogy immediately next to sociology .

		A place is given to political economy as a branch of sociology , sub - stantially as defined by
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, one of the greatest economists , who said of his special subject : '' It does not treat of the whole of man 's nature as modified by the social state , nor of the whole conduct of man in society .

		It is concerned with him solely as a being who desires to possess wealth , and who is ca - pable of judging of the comparative efficacy of means of obtaining that end . ''

		Mill formulated the essential problems of sociology before
Comte	ORGANIZATION	invented the now accepted title of the discipline .

		Sociology does not rest directly , but only indirectly , on biology .

		The analogies of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	are crit - icized , and a true '' homology '' is found by compar - ing the nervous system with the central organi - zation of society .

		Anthropology has for its task the study of the concrete facts of human nature and man 's works ; it is a branch of zoology in which man is the subject studied .

		Sociology employs the data furnished by anthropology in its investigation of the laws of association .

		Man was not at first a social being , and is not entirely socialized yet .

		So - ciety is an artificial acquisition , while animal asso - ciation is instinctive and natural .

		The relation of sociology to psychology is most important to study .

		Psychology embraces the en - tire field of psychic phenomena , which are divided by the author into sense and intellect , the word sense being synonymous with feeling in general .

		The will is the active expression of the feelings .

		Intellect is simply a means to the end ; the end is the good ; and the good '' is nothing else than agree - able sensation . ''

		The ethical end is '' to secure the maximum of absolute enjoyment . ''

		The problem of ethics is '' to secure the greatest pleasure ... The relative worthiness of pleasure is , therefore , ulti - mately based on the quantity of pleasure yielded .

		It is this and nothing else that is meant when virtue is enjoined and vice condemned '' -LRB- pp. 100101 -RRB- .

		The author is frankly a Hedonist .

		Not only
T. H. Green	ORGANIZATION	and all the Kantians and idealists , but even
Shelley	PERSON	, are set down as victims of mere mysticism .

		These lines of Shelley would be repudiated : '' Were it virtue 's only need to dwell In a celestial palace , all resigned To pleasurable impulses , immured Within the prison of itself , the will Of changeless Nature would be unfulfilled .

		Learn to make others happy .

		Spirit , come !

		This is thine high reward . ''

		The author places intellectual pleasures above THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, those of altruism -LRB- p. 104 -RRB- .

		The object of Nature is function ; the object of man is happiness ; the object of society is effort .

		The result of all is evo - lution .

		The data of sociology are the principles of the subordinate sciences , `` the broad princi - ples that underlie and govern all departments of natural phenomena . ''

		Sociology is the synthesis of the other sciences , and is a university study for ad - vanced students .

		The social forces are the desire * which lead to acts of reproduction , self-preservation , and satisfaction of the esthetic and intellectual nature .

		The social mechanism means the social order , and social statics is its science .

		Progress im - plies the modification of structure and of environ - ment .

		It is genetic or telic ; that is , natural '' and without purpose , or artificial and the result of a con - scions plan .

		Intentional modifications are individ - ual or collective ; and this last mode of progress is a late arrival , as yet only in its beginnings .

		The future form of society promises to be not individ - ualism nor socialism , but '' sociocracy . ''

		Sociocracy recognizes natural inequalities , and aims to abolish artificial inequalities ; it seeks to substitute the inter - est of all for the dominance of a few ; it would con - fer benefits in strict proportion to merit , but insists upon equality of opportunity .

		Natural selection does not secure the survival of the fittest , as is pop - ularly supposed , but only of those who are adapted to an inferior environment .

		Sociocracy will improve the environment , and so produce better natures .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	is a smart writer .

		In '' Aristocracy and Evolution '' he appears at his best in full dress .

		It is charming to see him writing down the socialists , while he holds up to scorn their arch enemy , Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	has made a wonderful discovery in sociology : he has found out that brains and blood will tell , and that the most rapid runners get first to the goal .

		The socialists are stupid fellows for denying this epoch - making truth , and no sociologist has ever recognized it .

		We have , to quote Mr.
L. F. Ward	PERSON	, been tread - ing on the keys of the universe without knowing it .

		The great man '' is the world 's creditor ; let us take off our hats to him as he drives by or over us !

		To be sure , this '' great man '' may be neither un - usually intelligent nor good ; greatness '' need not necessarily imply any moral , nor indeed any intel - lectual , superiority '' -LRB- p. 336 -RRB- .

		After pruning away several other desirable qualities , the title '' Magnus '' seems of doubtful propriety .

		Carlyle did not say '' general '' but only '' captain '' of industry .

		The Business Manager , albeit he is represented as a crea - ture who will serve the world only for plenty of hard cash , is glorified as the leader of progress .

		Incur - able
Philistinism	LOCATION	is deified .

		Plutocracy is crowned .

		To be sure , the essential idea , that the inventor is an exceptional man and the social leader , had been worked out by
Tarde	LOCATION	,
Guyau	LOCATION	,
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	, and other sociologists ; but Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	is innocent of knowl - edge of these thinkers ; at least he does not mention them .

		He is well acquainted with some striking j > : i.s : it , ` et < in Mr.
Benjamin Kidd	PERSON	.

		but SrliiilHe .

		whone 44 authorities '' resemble Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's 44 great men , '' is not on the list .

		This childlike displacement of
M. Tarde	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	is quite interesting to stu - dents of sociology .

		It is this ignorance of the lit - erature of sociology which permits the author to say that the whole school of contemporary soci - ologists , with Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	as their head , absolutely refuse to take any account whatever of the congen - ital inequalities by which individuals within the same aggregate are differentiated . ''

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	is a bright man and a delightful essayist , even when he is largely ignorant of his subject .

		I have said '' ignorant '' because it would be unpleasant to suggest the alternative .

		If he really is acquainted with
M. Tarde	PERSON	or Professor
Giddings	PERSON	, and their recognition of invention in relation to so - cial progress , we should have to charge him with moral obliquity or misrepresentation ; and we prefer not to choose that form of statement .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	has presented , in vigorous , clear English , one of the keenest and most incisive attacks on communistic theories yet published .

		The notion that animal labor is the sole source of wealth , which is not at all complimentary to wage-workers , is shown to be essentially false , and that is a good service to all classes of producers .

		The conservative and individualist speaks in Mr.
Mackay	PERSON	's book on ''
The State	ORGANIZATION	and Charity . ''

		There is rather too much unconscious assumption of pre - mises , as in the assertion so quietly introduced -LRB- p. 6 -RRB- that under a system of entire freedom labor would find a ready market Unquestionably the writer has found the weak places in the administra - tion of public relief , and the criticisms fall even more heavily on American methods than on those of
England	LOCATION	.

		Some parts of the book contribute important and suggestive interpretations of the ten - dencies of thought in relation to endowed charities .

		The reader should compare this with another book in the same series u The Poor Law , '' by
T. W. Fowle	ORGANIZATION	in order to appreciate the particular phase of the subject here discussed , and to give a more complete view of the field of public relief .

		This work will belong in the library of every student of charity . ''

		The
Twentieth Century City	ORGANIZATION	'' is a title which suggests the prophet ; and it is with earnest , solemn , insistent speech that the devoted author urges the need for religious patriotism .

		He dwells upon the materialism of modern civilization , and illustrates the idea that the city reveals the character of the age in its most pronounced form .

		He repeats the story of the tendency of population to urban life , and shows that the causes of this tendency are last - ing .

		Moral growth , be believes , has not kept pace with the commercial and industrial advance , and the city has become a menace to itself , and to the state and nation .

		The par - ticular measures which the author urges are a sort of referendum backed by an organized movement of young people 's societies to distribute patriotic and instructive tracts .

		While there is large room for doubt as to whether or not the means proposed would be at all adequate , there can be no question that there is a neglected duty to be taken up , and the author has given an eloquent voice to the call of the nation for the highest form of educational work in the obligations of citizenship .

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		nothing more than a novelette of the sketchiest sort , and leaves us at the end in doubt concerning the outcome .

		It is the story of the exiled king of an imaginary realm of
Messina	PERSON	, who trades upon the loyalty of his following to plan an expedition for the recovery of his throne , and who secretly betrays his own cause for a subsidy .

		The action takes place at
Tangier	LOCATION	, and the motley types of adventurers who are grouped about the king are sketched in an incisive way , but not characterized in any real sense .

		The story is clever and entertaining , but the author himself could not expect us to take it very seriously .

		The matter-of-fact and the whimsical are the distinctive elements in Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's writing except when he is unhappily tempted to mix him - self up with sea-fights and pirate treasures , and both are evident enough in '' The Girl at Cobhurst . ''

		If we may venture upon so fine a distinction , it is proper to say that matter-of-fact gets the better of whimsy in this story , and becomes deliciously droll by virtue of its very bareness .

		The book also pre - sents us with some quite tolerable charactered rawing , subject to the limitations of the author 's method , and possesses considerable interest as a quiet narra - tive of life in a country town . ''

		She wanted her Individuality back ; that was the long and the short of it . ''

		In this brief quota - tion from Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's new novel the work is neatly epitomized in more ways than one .

		For we find in these few words not only a statement of the theme , but also , in the capitalization of the principal noun , the false placing of emphasis that character - izes the entire work , and in the unlucky choice of phrase , the essential commonness of the style in which the book is written .

		The latter criticism , indeed , might safely be made from the title alone . ''

		American Wives and English Husbands '' would do for a sociological treatise , or for an essay in '' The Spectator '' ; as the name of a novel it is sim - ply impossible .

		The story deals , moreover , almost wholly with one English husband and his American wife , while the latter is not a wife at all until we are midway in the narrative .

		Possibly , however , there are more Anglo-American couples to follow in later volumes , for , although no promises are made , the story is by no means cleared up , and we can not think it Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's intention to leave us in the dark concerning the manner in which the heroine gets '' her Individuality back . ''

		In this restless chafing for freedom , she reminds us of the heroine of Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's recent novel , and a superficial view might discover several points of similarity be - tween the books which these two women respec - tively dominate .

		But a closer view would disclose contrasts much more marked than these resem - blances , for the ideals of '' American Wives and English Husbands '' are as low as those of '' The Gospel of Freedom '' are high , and while Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's heroine is moulded of such fine clay that she is attractive even when at fault , Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's heroine is so badly spoiled by her training and en - vironment that she commands little sympathy in the 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, crisis of her fortunes .

		The book is in some respects brilliant , and displays much shrewd first-hand ob - servation , but there is a streak of vulgarity running through it .

		and it moves upon a low moral plane . ''

		In Kings ' Houses , '' Mrs.
Dorr	PERSON	's story of the days of Queen
Anne	PERSON	, is a pretty story of the senti - mental sort , extremely mild in interest , but display - ing a close and even affectionate familiarity with the history and customs of its period .

		The Queen becomes a more gracious figure in Mrs.
Dorr	PERSON	's pages than she appears in most books , and is the only historical personage whom the author attempts to characterize seriously .

		Others flit across the scene , but make no impression , unless we call a historical personage the young Duke of Gloster , her son , whose early death destroyed the last real hope of the Stuarts .

		Rather more than half of the book , in fact , is given to the boyhood of this interesting lad , and the last years of the great King and statesman who made secure for all time the liberties of the English people .

		Mr.
Clinton Ross	PERSON	has sought pastures new for his latest excursions in romance .

		A Trooper of the Empress '' is a tale of
South Africa	LOCATION	, and tells how a great territory was saved for
England	LOCATION	by the energetic daring of a more fortunate Dr.
Jameson	PERSON	.


Bobbie McDuff	PERSON	'' is a tale of gypsies and Russian princes and medieval strongholds , and tells us how the son of a great house learned of his origin , and came to his own after the most surprising and peri - lous adventures .

		Both of these books are interest - ing , in spite of their jerkiness of manner , and their trick of reducing a scene to its bare elements , leav - ing the reader 's imagination to supply all the needed details .

		When a sequel to some successful work of fiction is promised , it is customary for sapient people to shake their heads , make irrelevant remarks about '' Don Quijote '' and ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' and '' Tar - tarin , '' and prophesy a more or less dismal failure .

		These famous books illustrate , no doubt , the truth that genius rarely reproduces or revivifies its hap - piest inspirations , but to argue from this that the popular novelist may not transfer his characters from one book to another , and still another if he wish , with effect as pleasing as when they were first intro - duced to the public , is to employ a mistaken analogy .

		To make '' The Prisoner of Zenda , '' for example , the text of such an argument , is to take that enter - taining book much too seriously .

		For our part , we have no doubt that ''
Anthony	PERSON	Hope '' could write '' Zenda '' stories by the dozen , without any weak - ening of interest , for the charm of these stories is in their invention alone , and invention has little or nothing to do with works of genius .

		Our chief regret , then , in reading Rupert of Hentzau , '' is that the principal characters are all killed , thus making fur - ther volumes in the series at least improbable .

		The new romance is quite as good as its predecessor , filled quite as full of ingeniously planned situations and dramatic effects .

		We are bound to say , however , that the wanton slaying of the hero strikes a dis - cordant note .

		He was doubtless in a fix , and the author was in an equally obvious one .

		But the note of comedy is the fundamental note of the whole performance , and its abrupt displacement by the note of tragedy produces a shock .

		If the writer had been wholly consistent , he would have made the hero take his own life in satisfaction of his some - what strained ideal of honorable conduct , instead of having him taken off by what is hardly more than an accident .

		This would have been tragic also , but not so perverse as the solution actually devised .

		And few readers would have felt any real scruples in accepting him henceforth as the husband of
Flavia	PERSON	and the
King of Ruritania	ORGANIZATION	.

		As for his pretty epi - taph , we need not have lost even that , for it would have served quite as well after ten or twenty years of beneficent rule and conjugal happiness .

		The populace deserved the one , and
Flavia	PERSON	was entitled to the other .

		Kronstadt '' is a sufficiently thrilling tale to war - rant our approval , although the approval must be somewhat closely qualified .

		As a serious social study , it is naught ; as an entertaining narrative of adventure , with the guardian fortress of the Russian Empire for a stage-setting , and for a background the vast and mysterious despotism of the Tsar , it is dis - tinctly successful .

		How an Englishwoman spied upon the fortifications and sold their secrets to the English government , how she won the love of a Russian officer , and made him forget his duty in fleeing with her after the discovery of her treachery , and how all their troubles came to a happy ending , is what Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	has told us in this charming story , and his art is most apparent in the fact that both the man and the woman keep their hold upon our sympathies in spite of conduct which , calmly considered , is reprehensible .

		The escape from
Kronstadt	LOCATION	in a small boat is particularly well man - aged , and although agony is piled upon agony , the line of sensationalism does not seem to be overpassed .

		There are also some capital pages of descriptive writing in the book , description that is forcible , vivid , and yet restrained .

		The wars of the sixteenth century in the Nether - lands , and , more specifically , the siege of
Leyden	PERSON	, constitute the theme of Sons of Adversity , '' a new romance by Mr.
L. Cope Cornford	PERSON	, whose '' Master - Beggars '' we had the pleasure of commending a year or more ago .

		We now have another story of much the same sort , a story of political intrigue , hazardous adventure , and successful love .

		It does not speak well for the author 's accuracy to find , on the first page , such a phrase as '' the year of our Lord
1574	DATE	.

		being the fifteenth year of the glorious reign of Elizabeth , '' but the story is none the less interesting for a few such slips .

		Novels in which music is the element of chief interest are apt to overflow into sentimentality , and '' The Duenna of a Genius '' is no exception to the rule .

		The chapters of Mrs.
Blundell	PERSON	's story are all provided with phrases borrowed from the Italianate vocabulary of the art musical , and the changes are
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 rung by means of such terms as '' staccato , '' '' con tristezza , '' '' appassionato subito , '' and '' sempre crescendo . ''

		The '' finale con molto sentimento '' not only describes the closing chapter , but the greater number of the others as well .

		Still , the story is pretty enough , although its characterization is ex - tremely superficial , and its dramatic substance of the thinnest possible consistency .

		There is something less of the sentimental strain in '' The Concert - Director , '' and something more of successful representation of character .

		The story is ingeniously planned , and tells how an unscrupu - lous adventurer sought the love of a famous singer to secure for himself the rank and emoluments of a concert-manager .

		He is more successful than he expected to be , and finds that he really loves her into the bargain .

		She , for her part , tires of him when she learns of his insincerity , and seeks for happiness elsewhere .

		The story deals with musi - cians and musical commercialism throughout , and shows close acquaintance with the types of character that are developed by the concert-hall and the oper - atic stage .

		The third musical novel on our list is much better than the other two ; first , because it is not so effu - sively sentimental , and second , because it has a well - constructed and almost original plot .

		Here , the chief character is a man of fine temper who marries a singer of shallow nature , because he has given a promise to his friend , her brother , who exacted it upon his death-bed .

		Granting this somewhat ques - tionable point of honor , the after-events follow as natural consequences ; for to keep his promise the hero sacrifices the woman whom he loves , and makes her life as well as his own one great renunciation .

		The wife proves unworthy of him , although she stops short of actually sinning against him , and makes an escapade which comes near to resulting seriously , and which supplies material for the sub - stance of the plot .

		The haunting strain of one of the immortal melodies of the world '' Che faro senza Eurydice '' runs through the novel , and acquires a symbolical significance from the relations into which the characters fall .

		It is even introduced in musical notation over and over again , and provides a leit-motiv for the action .

		The book is nowise strong , but it is distinctly readable and interesting .

		The fourth of our musical novels , and the last to be considered , has nothing in common with the other three , being the work of a master and not of an amateur .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	has had a somewhat chequered career as a novelist , and his books have deeply stirred the waters of discussion upon more than one occasion .

		Their power has always been undeniable , and they have shown a fine instinct for the best models of style and composition , but their subjects and manner of treatment have at times displayed a questionable morality and a conspicuous lack of delicacy .

		The tradition which for so long kept English fiction from sounding the deeps of life in its passionate aspects affected Mr.
Moore	PERSON	like a red rag , and his reaction against the convention - alities more than once resulted in sending him to the extreme of boldness and outspoken utterance .

		In ''
Evelyn Innes	PERSON	'' he has produced a work that must be taken seriously , whatever one may think of its purport .

		It is a strong and penetrating portrayal of modern life , written with both mastery and knowl - edge .

		We always hesitate to pronounce a book im - moral in tendency simply because some of its char - acters lead immoral lives .

		So superficial a view as that has no place in serious criticism , because the real problem is so much deeper .

		We do not need to approve of
Evelyn	PERSON	's conduct in calling her history an essentially moral one .

		She is simply a woman of weak will , in whose temperament the artistic ele - ment outweighs for a time the sense for conduct , and leads her into a course that is no doubt shock - ing , but that is at the same time inevitable , given her character to begin with .

		It is equally inevit - able that her conscience should become awakened in the end , and by precisely the means that are here employed , and the renunciation of her sinful rela - tions with the two men who love her , and the sin - cerity of her atonement , seem to adjust the ethical balance of the work .

		The end of it all is not made quite clear , but
Evelyn	PERSON	is left in the path of spiritual purification , and it seems that the author would have us believe that her steps are not to be retraced , but are to carry her , however painfully , along the nar - rower and better way that she has chosen .

		We have said nothing as yet of the musical part of the story .

		In brief ,
Evelyn	PERSON	is the daughter of a man whose whole life is devoted to a restoration of church music to the austere simplicity and beauty of the early centuries .

		The cult of Palestrina fills all her early life , yet she herself becomes a great dramatic singer and an interpreter of the characters created by the genius of
Wagner	PERSON	.

		The story of her career introduces much musical criticism , and the author 's analysis of the great Wagnerian dramas is extra - ordinarily acute and subtle .

		Yet , with his evident appreciation of these works , there flows along an undercurrent of the thought embodied in
Count Tolstoi	LOCATION	's ''
Kreutzer Sonata	PERSON	, '' the thought that this great art is in the deepest sense immoral , full of sinful promptings , and dangerous to the soul 's wel - fare .

		We feel bound to repudiate this conception as vehemently as we may , and to assert instead that the mind in which it can arise is morbidly affected , and incapable of the purest vision of beauty and truth .

		If we were to style ''
Evelyn Innes	PERSON	'' an immoral book , it would be upon this ground rather than that of the life led by the heroine .

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	seems to have written himself nearly out .

		It is undeniable that his stories of the struggle for the Covenant display both knowledge and vigor , and , if he has diluted the vigor with overmuch of modern sentimentalism , the product still has power to stir the blood , and help us to a vivid conception of the old rough life of seventeenth century
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		But he has told his tale as best he knows how , and there is no reason why he should continue to tell it with slight variations . ''

		The 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	,
Standard Bearer	ORGANIZATION	'' would interest us deeply were it not the latest of a long line of romantic fictions ; being such , and the product of a narrowly limited imagination , we know just what is coming , and can find no great zest in the reading . ''

		The Lake of Wine '' is an exciting story of
England	LOCATION	a hundred years ago , written in a most pernicious style of the would-be Meredithian sort .

		The search for a great ruby -LRB- for the fanciful title means just that -RRB- in an out-of-the-way country house , the crimes of the cutthroat who first stole it , and of the scoundrel who sought to regain it after he had met his deserts on the gallows , provide the story with its substance , and set in motion an ingeniously - contrived plot .

		The story is interesting in spite of the perverse language in which it is written , and has the happy ending which readers of such stories rightfully expect .

		The very title of Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's new novel strikes the note of restlessness and dull cynicism by which it is pervaded . ''

		The
Whirlpool	ORGANIZATION	'' is , of course , modern society as it exists in
London	LOCATION	, or , for that matter , any other great city .

		More , perhaps , than the author 's earlier books , this one seeks to produce the impression that civilization is about played out .

		The programme is not inspiring , to say the least , and there is a petulant quality to Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's cynicism which makes its sincerity seem doubtful .

		Imagine a Thackeray without humor , without ten - derness , and without much real insight into human nature , and you have the author of '' The Whirl - pool '' and its fellows .

		The effect is dismal enough , when it is added that the author is committed to the austere theory of fiction that does not permit a story to get anywhere in particular , or to offer any - thing more than a random chapter from the annals of everyday life .

		Why should story-tellers be at the pains to invent plots when history offers them ready-made ?

		Such seems to have been the attitude of Messrs.
Louis Becke	PERSON	and
Walter Jeffery	PERSON	when , casting about in search of material for a new story of the southern seas , they hit upon the tragical history of the Bounty and its mutineers .

		While heightening the dramatic effect of the story here and there , and giving it an artistic veneer of minor incident , the authors have kept close to the main lines of the actual occurrences , and shown that the history of the famous mutineer colony of
Pitcairn Island	LOCATION	makes as thrilling a ro - mance as any that was ever imagined .

		These events took place a full hundred years ago , but they seem only of yesterday when we read about them in these pages .

		The details are all provided the brutality of Captain
Bligh	PERSON	, the revolt of the men , the expul - sion of the captain and those who remained loyal to him , the long voyage in search of a safe refuge , the final settlement upon
Pitcairn Island	LOCATION	, and the bloody feuds that wiped out the greater number of the colonists .

		It is all truth , yet certainly stranger than most of what we call fiction .

		The authors are to be congratulated upon the skill with which they have worked this material into romantic form .

		`` The Nigger of the Narcissus , '' by Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, has been one of the most successful books of the year in
England	LOCATION	.

		For some utterly unac - countable reason , its American publishers have seen fit to rechristen it with the commonplace title The Children of the Sea , '' a piece of foolishness matched only by the substitution of '' Transformation '' for `` The Marble Faun . ''

		It is not a story in the ordi - nary sense , for it has no plot , no interplay of motive , no mystery deftly concealed until the proper mo - ment for disclosure .

		It is simply the account of one voyage of a trading vessel from
India	LOCATION	to En - gland , told by an inhabitant of the forecastle , and made stirring by nothing more dramatic than a storm encountered in rounding the
Cape	LOCATION	, and an abortive mutiny near the close of the voyage .

		Its power lies in its exposition of the psychology of the mutiny , of the storm -LRB- if this metonymy be allowed -RRB- , and of certain typical characters among officers and crew .

		In addition to power , it has style , a thing not adequately to be illustrated within this narrow space , but for which one brief passage , suggested by the sight of an unlettered seaman reading one of the garish early novels of
Bulwer /	ORGANIZATION	may be allowed to stand . ''

		Are those beings who exist beyond the pale of life stirred by his tales as by an enigmatical disclosure of a resplendent world that exists within the frontier of infamy and filth , within that border of dirt and hunger , of misery and dissipation , that comes down on all sides to the water 's edge of the incorruptible ocean , and is the only thing they know of life , the only thing they see of surrounding land , those lifelong prisoners of the sea ? ''

		The book contains many such things as this , passages of terse and superb poetic vigor , passages that suggest the magical utterance of a ''
Charles Egbert Craddock	PERSON	'' or a
Pierre Lot	PERSON	i. '' As for the psychological aspect of it , we doubt if a more searching study of seafar - ing life has ever been worked out .

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	has been a fairly prolific writer since he made his first appearance , two or three years ago , with `` Almayer 's Folly , '' and we now have from him , at the same time with the longer work above described , a collection of five Tales of Unrest . ''

		Three of them are sketches of the Dutch and Span - ish Indies , a region which Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's imagination has annexed to English literature almost as com - pletely as
British India	LOCATION	has been annexed by the imagination of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, or the
South Sea Islands	LOCATION	by
Stevenson	PERSON	and Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	. ''

		Karain : a Memory '' and '' An Outpost of Progress '' are mas - terly studies of the contact of civilization with the alien races of the
East Indies	LOCATION	.

		The product of a sombre temperament , which absorbs the prismatic colors of oriental life , reflecting the duller hues alone , it is clear that they show forth but one phase of an existence that must have many others ; but this truth is so convincing that we are made to for - get , while under their spell , that the world may be fair , and the skies blue , even to an English trader among the Malays .

		Most readers who turn to Mr. ZangwilTs '' Dream -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 ers of the Ghetto '' will find themselves compelled to revise their earlier estimate of the writer 's abili - ties .

		Heretofore , he has stood as the embodiment of a sort of commonplace cleverness , and most of his work has been so ill-planned and diffuse as to be impossible from any artistic point of view .

		Even when he has dealt with the customs and character of his own race , his view has seemed superficial , his method to single out the grotesque and the acci - dental rather than the essential and permanent as - pects of Jewish life and tradition .

		Occasional flashes of insight have not , indeed , been wanting , but the most generous criticism could hardly have found in them the promise of such a book as the one now before us .

		In this series of sketches half story and half philosophical disquisition we have the very soul of the Jewry , the vital expression of its thought , its poetry , and its ideal aspirations .

		We have also a vast display of the lore that clusters about the Talmud and the
Cabalah	LOCATION	, and many epi - sodes from the dusty annals of the author 's race
spring	DATE	from the domain of chronicle into that of life at his command .

		Some of the characters chosen for study by Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	are familiar to the gen - eral reader
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	,
Maimon	PERSON	,
Lassalle	LOCATION	,
Uriel Acosta	PERSON	, others are absolutely unknown to the everyday public .

		A few , again , are creations of his own , and here we must mention the exquisite story of '' A Child of the Ghetto , '' with which the collection opens , and the marvellous fantasy , ''
Chad Gadya	PERSON	, '' with which it closes .

		The book is deeply significant , both as a richly sympathetic and imag - inative interpretation of the Jewish ideal , and as an altogether unexpected revelation of the powers hith - erto latent in its author .

		From now on , Mr.
Zang	PERSON	- will must be taken seriously .

		Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	's '' Tales of Trail and Town '' is shown by the publishers ' list prefixed to the book to be the thirty-fourth volume of '' novels and stories '' by this perennial writer .

		Incidentally , it makes one wonder , thinking also of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	and a host of others , whether
London	LOCATION	is not , after all , the chief of the American literary centres about which Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has recently discoursed so charmingly .

		There are seven stories in the new volume , five of them wholly American , the other two of international flavor .

		The author gratifies his taste for sharp contrasts in the story of '' The Strange Experience of
Alkali Dick	PERSON	, '' a '' Booflobil '' weary of the ways of civilization , who has a sur - prising adventure in a French chateau on his way to the seaport of Le Havre . ''

		The Judgment of Bolinas Plain '' will be recognized by many as the original from which the play called '' Sue '' has been dramatized .

		The longest and most serious of these stories is '' The Ancestors of
Peter Atherley	PERSON	, '' a really remarkable study of the influence of heredity .

		Our fiction offers few examples of an evolution so remarkable as that illustrated by Mr.
Henry Harland	PERSON	.

		From '' As It Was Written '' and '' Mrs.
Peixada	PERSON	'' to the '' Comedies and Errors '' of his latest volume is a progress indeed , and in the fine artistic feeling of Mr.
Harland	PERSON	's recent work we find it almost impossible to recognize the pen that offered us those crude efforts of melodramatic sensational - ism .

		For these '' Comedies and Errors '' reveal the instinct of the true artist , the sense of form , the compression and restraint , the lightness of touch and the deft handling of incident that characterize the short stories of the most famous practitioners .

		Mr.
Harland	PERSON	has not gone to the school of the best Frenchmen in vain , and has at last shown himself capable of workmanship so delicate that we have not the heart to say aught but praise concerning it .

		Mr.
Henry Fuller	PERSON	is another of our younger story - writers whose artistic development has been steady and sure , although in his case the contrast is not so marked between his first book and his last .

		He may well be proud of the achievement represented by the four stories entitled '' From the Other Side . ''

		Some if not all of them have previously appeared in the magazines , but they deserve a reperusal . ''

		The Pilgrim Sons '' is perhaps the happiest of the four , as embodying the most definite idea , although '' What Youth Can Do '' stands as a close second .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	has the gift of style , which is much , and the gift of restraint , which is more .

		Last of all upon our list comes the collection of stories by Mr.
T. R. Sullivan	PERSON	, properly enough en - titled '' Ars et Vita , '' although the part of '' Ara '' in them is small .

		They are bright sketches of European life , some of them grouped about the year 1870-71 and the happenings of the war period .

		Their interest is rather sentimental than dramatic , and they do not strike deep enough into life to leave any very definite impression .

		They are , in a word , the sort of thing whose production is fostered by the popular magazine , and they fulfil their function of passing entertainment in a satisfactory fashion .

		A figure for the novelist .

		Those who have learned their Scotch history entirely from
Scott	PERSON	may not remember
Kirkaldy of Grange	ORGANIZATION	.

		We do not recollect that he is more than mentioned in the
Waverley Novels	LOCATION	, although two of them are de - voted to the time in which he played his part .

		In the '' Abbot '' he helps to rout the too-impetuous attack of the enthusiastic followers of
Mary Queen	PERSON	of Scots at
Langside	LOCATION	.

		There he is called '' cele - brated '' and '' the first soldier of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' though he was contemporary with
Don John	PERSON	of
Austria	LOCATION	and
Admiral Coligny	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir
William Kirkaldy	PERSON	was a distinctly romantic figure in a romantic period , and it is a little singular that
Scott	PERSON	should not have found his career attractive .

		He was one of that band which assassinated
Cardinal Beaton	PERSON	, and stood siege in the castle of
St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	until driven out by the French cannon .

		With
John Knox	PERSON	and others he was carried prisoner to
France	LOCATION	; and while
Knox	PERSON	80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, WM sent to the galleys , he was confined in
Mont St. Michel	PERSON	, whence he managed to escape .

		Return - ing to
Scotland	LOCATION	, he took part with those who thought to punish the murderers of
Darnley	LOCATION	; and to that end , after the fiasco of Carberry Hill , he pursued
Bothwell	PERSON	up to his earldom of Orkney and compelled him to seek ref oge in
Norway	LOCATION	.

		After the battle of Langside , he held
Edinburgh Castle	ORGANIZATION	against the Regent Lenox , and against his successor , the
Earl of Mar	ORGANIZATION	, but was brought to terms by the English bombardment , taken , and finally executed .

		Here is certainly material for the romancer .


Scott	PERSON	did not deal with it , nor did
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Of the two , we should say it would have been more to the mind of the latter .

		The cannon on the steeple of
St. Andrews ' Church	ORGANIZATION	, the escape from
Mont St. Michel	ORGANIZATION	over the waste of sand at low tide , the wild chase of the
Earl of Bothwell	ORGANIZATION	among the
Northern Inlands	LOCATION	, and the wreck of the Unicorn '' in the rock-sin - wn channel , these seem rather incidents in a novel of
Stevenson	PERSON	's than in one of
Scott 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		But even more like
Stevenson	PERSON	's material was the character of
Kirk	PERSON	- aldy himself .

		Stevenson would have been at home in the portrayal of that '' honorable man and brave patriot '' who seemed in turn traitor to all .

		Mr.
L. A. Barbe	PERSON	, who writes the life of
Kirkaldy	LOCATION	in the '' Famous Scots '' series -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , has for an aim rather to show the honesty of purpose of the man than to exhibit the romantic elements in his career .

		We hope that his view is as well - founded as he makes appear , although that question would seem to be beyond all who are not especially versed in Scottish history .

		At any rate , the book is an interesting record of a striking figure , and may be read with pleasure even by those who never heard of its subject .

		Uf and utter , In
March , 1879	DATE	, died at an early age , of a dittinyvuhtd and at the flood-tide of his powers BnglUh journal * .

		an -LRB- J j n fl ueDce > one o f t h e foremost of English journalists , Mr.
James Macdonell	PERSON	, whose Life , by Dr.
W. Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, is now published by
Messrs. Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Nicoll	PERSON	has given us an excellent piece of biographical writing terse , lively , warmly sympathetic yet not uncritical , what we take to be a true , as it is a most engaging , por - trait of a man who , all in all , seems to have been a rarely perfect type of the higher order of journalist .

		Journalism can ill spare such men as
James Mac	PERSON	- donell men who bring to their calling ripe and varied culture , a rare power of clear exposition , a lightness that has no savor of levity , and who en - deavor to make of it a calling and a mission rather than a trade .

		For durable literary work Mr.
Mac	PERSON	- donell had no time , his life being occupied as a writer of '' leaders . ''

		His popularity with the pro- fession was great , and it was said when he died that had the train which carried his friends from
London	LOCATION	to
Beckenham	LOCATION	, where his funeral was held , been wrecked , Liberal journalism in
London	LOCATION	would mo - mentarily have stopped .

		Mr.
Macdonell	PERSON	worked at his profession successively at Aberdeen -LRB- he was by birth a Scotchman -RRB- ,
Edinburgh	LOCATION	,
Newcastle	LOCATION	, and
London	LOCATION	.

		He was on the staff of the '' Times '' when he died ; and it was said of him by a well-known writer that '' he was probably the most brilliant and accomplished of all the men of genius who , by their modest but not unfruitful labors , have given the 4 Times ' the great place it now holds among the newspapers of the world . ''

		Mr.
Macdonell	PERSON	had a distinguished circle of friends -LRB- with him an acquaint - ance usually meant a friend -RRB- , and Dr.
Nicoll	PERSON	has judiciously leavened his text with glimpses of and chat about people of whom the world still w lubes to know more .

		The letters , both of Mr.
Macdonell	PERSON	and his accomplished wife , written many of them during holiday jaunts to the Continent , are pleasant reading , and of these there is good store .

		In short , Dr.
Nicoll	PERSON	has produced one of the best and most graceful biographical sketches -LRB- it is not too big -RRB- we have seen in a long while one that we heartily recommend as a model for writers with a similar work on their hands .

		American journalists will find the book a profitable study of the career of a distinguished English member of their calling .

		There is a good portrait of Mr.
Macdonell	PERSON	.

		The latest addition to The Ethical Library '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is Professor
Henry Sidgwick	PERSON	's volume called '' Practical Ethics . ''

		It is a collection of serious and discriminating essays on matters of everyday life and conduct .

		Of special interest at the present moment is the chapter on '' The Morality of Strife , '' showing that , from an ethical point of view , war is not to be regarded as an unmixed evil , that it is not a mere collision of passions and cupidities , but a conflict in which usually each side conceives itself to be contending on behalf of legitimate interests , and is due , as a rule , to conflicting views of rights .

		Chapters on Luxury '' and '' The Pursuit of Cul - ture '' are full of suggestive thought on these living subjects , while the ones on '' The Ethics of Religious Conformity '' and on '' Clerical Veracity , '' may be heartily commended to the consideration of unor - thodox persons in orthodox churches and pulpits .

		`` Practical EtMet . ''

		A memorial of a man '' In a sketchy sort of way , '' wrote Judge
Rearden	PERSON	of his discussion of Ballads and Lyrics , and of his essay on
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, not more than a sketchy review , the materials for which might be examined by anyone in an hour 's time spent in an ordinary public library . ''

		Essays which can be so characterized depend much for interest upon charm of style and breadth of culture on the part of their author .

		Judge
Rearden	PERSON	, who died some years ago , was for many years one of the foremost men of letters in
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		He did not write much , although some of his work appeared in the early numbers , we believe , of The Overland Magazine . ''

		These essays -LRB- '' Petrarch and Other Essays , ''
Doxey	PERSON	-RRB- are pleasant wander - ings over familiar fields at least some of them are and are full of a polished scholarship and a
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 genial temper .

		The essays on
Klaus Groth	PERSON	and
Fritz Renter	ORGANIZATION	offer something more and something less , more , in that they will introduce most read - ers to new ground , and less in that there is little of that observation and familiar comment that makes the others agreeable .

		These essays are not definite treatises on their subjects ; they are rather desul - tory , except where biographical .

		But in such diva - gations one is always likely to find something to his mind ; almost everybody will pick out something new and interesting .

		This volume seems to be a second edition , although the fact is not noted , nor is any editor named .

		It is a pity that there was no competent editor .

		Judge
Rearden	PERSON	would have been vexed at being made to mention among
Tennyson	PERSON	's poems , ''
Brackett	PERSON	, '' '' Nemuc , '' '' Aenone . ''

		Of such slips , however , there are not very many , so that on the whole the volume is a fit memorial of a culti - vated man .

		With the seventh volume of Profes - The founding of the sor yon
Sybel	ORGANIZATION	's `` Founding of the German Empire .

		_ ^ ^ _ .

		TTTH .

		T German Empire by
William I.	PERSON	-LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- this valuable work is completed .

		This volume gives the history not only of
Germany	LOCATION	, but of
France	LOCATION	, and in a measure of
Spain	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Austria	LOCATION	, from the
spring of 1868	DATE	to the outbreak of the great war in
1870	DATE	.

		It is in part a continu - ation of the topics treated in the preceding volume ; but it brings them to a most dramatic conclusion .

		The oft-told story is given clearly and interestingly , of course from the German point of view , but fairly , and , as seems likely , largely as it will finally stand in history .

		Of timely interest is the description of unhappy
Spain	LOCATION	and her efforts to secure a king after her revolution .

		One prince after another put aside the proffered crown with disdain , and
Leopold	PERSON	only accepted it after thrice rejecting it , and then de - clined it again when
France	LOCATION	became so astonishingly excited .

		But the great topic is the steady progress of
Germany	LOCATION	under
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's rule toward the uni - fication that had been the dream of her poets and patriots , and had seemed , until he appeared , so im - possible of attainment .

		Along with this went the desperate effort of
France	LOCATION	to maintain her old lead - ership in
Europe	LOCATION	, the failure of her policy in one attempt after another , the discrediting of the Em - pire , and the popular desire for a war that should reduce the presumptuous Prussian to the position he had occupied after
Jena	PERSON	and restore the glory of
France	LOCATION	.

		The author seems to be successful in prov - ing that the war was not a diabolical scheme of Bismarck to ruin
France	LOCATION	, but that
France	LOCATION	brought her ruin upon her own head .

		The grammar Professor
John Earle	PERSON	's `` Simple of English .

		Grammar of English Now in Use '' now m use .

		-LRB- Putnam -RRB- is as interesting as a gram - mar can be , and , since it has to do with the language as written and spoken in
England	LOCATION	to-day , is prob - ably more interesting to an American than to the author 's own countrymen .

		Though a professor in Anglo-Saxon in
Oxford	LOCATION	, his knowledge is used to illuminate , not to dazzle , the treatment of the sub - ject .

		But why should Numerals be erected into a tenth Part of Speech ?

		And , after writing in one place that '' our language , which is more advanced toward simplicity and truth than any other language , has discarded this unmeaning Gender of Nouns , '' and in another , '' Gender can not be said to survive anywhere in the English language except in the Personal Pronoun of the
Third Person Singular	ORGANIZATION	, '' does Professor
Earle	PERSON	give his nouns not merely a possessive , but a dative , an accusative , and a voca - tive case ?

		Surely , though logical cases , like logical gender , remain , grammatical cases have gone the way of the others in English , and '' can not be said to survive anywhere in the English language except in the ... pronoun . ''

		It is noteworthy that British use holds to forms like '' one and twenty , '' '' one and twentieth , '' while ranking '' bidden , '' '' drunken , '' '' stricken , '' and '' gotten , '' with '' foughten , '' '' shot - ten , '' and the like ; does away with the differences of person in the subjunctive use of '' would '' and '' should , '' and permits shade of
Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	!

		such a tense as the '' Continuous Present Passive '' : '' I am being taken , thou art being taken , '' etc. .

		American The second volume of Professor history told by
Hart	PERSON	's series of ''
American History	ORGANIZATION	contemporaries .

		Told by Contemporaries '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- is , in its essential features , a reproduction of the first volume , and fairly sustains the reputation which that publication created .

		Perhaps some read - ers will think the matter , on the whole , less valu - able ; but such judgment , if given , will , not unlikely , be influenced by the critic 's greater interest in the one period than in the other .

		Certainly some of the matter hardly seems worth reproducing .

		Chapter XIV .

		on '' Intellectual Life , '' for example , strikes us as nothing less than poor .

		We do not see , either , that the editor 's notes are more abundant than in the former volume , which was criticized on this score .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	is one of the best of the large number of men who are now cultivating Amer - ican history ; he is rendering the cause good service in this series , but he distinctly impresses us as being a man who has too many irons in the fire .

		Studies in American literature .

		Professor
Charles Noble	PERSON	's '' Studies in American Literature '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- is a well-arranged text-book for academies and high schools .

		Books on this subject have been numerous of late ; the special aim of this one is to treat especially of form in its relation to literary expression , to furnish a method of analysis which shall combine the study of an author 's man - ner and method along with the interpretation of his content .

		Not the least of the merits of the volume is its up-to-date character , dealing with the last twenty years and with living writers .

		The portraits of American writers are numerous and , for the most part , excellent .

		82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, Under * UUe `` Various Frag - mentB '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	publishes a collection of seventeen articles on topics more or less related to his usual themes .

		All of them have been previously published , either in magazines , pamphlets , or as chapters in early editions of his books .

		Some date back nearly half a century , and relate to dead issues ; some are '' rejoinders '' to his critics .

		Each has ita special significance and value , and taken together they strikingly illustrate the varied interests of one of the leading thinkers of our century .

		The book is uniform in style and binding with the volumes of the Synthetic Philosophy , '' and hence forms a part of the complete edition of this epoch-making series .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
William Macdonald	PERSON	of
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	has edited a series of '' Select Documents Illustrative of the History of the
United States	LOCATION	, 1776-1861 '' -LRB- Mac - mil Ian -RRB- .

		It is a work of the utmost value to teachers and students of American history , for it brings them into close contact with the sources , a condition '' now rightly insisted upon as the basis of all sound historical knowledge . ''

		The documents given number nearly a hundred , from the Declaration of Independence to the Constitution of the
Confederate States of America	LOCATION	.

		Some have been condensed , and many others '' are in the form of significant extracts only , '' thus bringing the entire series within the compass of less than five hundred pages .

		Each document is supplied with a brief intro - duction and select bibliography . ''

		The '' Globe '' edition of '' The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a welcome publication , albeit the one - volume edition of the '' Oxford '' Chaucer some - what forestalled the welcome that has long awaited the later volume .

		Projected over
thirty years ago	DATE	, the work has at last been completed under the editorial supervision of Mr.
Alfred W. Pollard	PERSON	, assisted by Messrs.
H. Frank Heath	PERSON	,
Mark H. Liddell	PERSON	, and
W. S. McCormick	PERSON	.

		The volume extends to between eight and nine hundred double-columned pages .

		The following are publications of the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in their series of `` Eclectic English Classics '' : Pope 's `` Rape of the Lock , '' and `` Essay on Man , '' edited by Mr.
A. M. Van Dyke	PERSON	; '' Selections from the Poems of
Robert Burns	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
W. H. Venable	PERSON	; similar '' Selections '' from

Venable	PERSON	; '' Selections '' from Gray , edited by Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	, and
Dryden	PERSON	's ''

		Advanced subscrip - tions of twenty dollars will secure the entire work .

		Professor
William Knight	PERSON	has recently presented to tbe trustees of Dove Cottage his important collection of
Wordsworthiana	LOCATION	, including editions , manuscripts , let - ters , portraits , and miscellaneous relics .

		The Rev.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	, acknowledging this gift on behalf of the trustees , speaks in fitting terms of the donor 's '' frank and magnificent generosity , '' and refers to Dove Cottage as now '' a goal of pilgrimage second only to
Stratford	LOCATION	- on-Avon '' in tbe minds of lovers of literature .


John Moses	PERSON	, who died in
Chicago	LOCATION	early last month was the author of ''
Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, Historical and Statistical , '' and was for many years librarian of the
Chicago	LOCATION	His - torical Society .

		He also collaborated with tbe late
Joseph Kirkland	PERSON	in writing a '' History of
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		Born in
Canada	LOCATION	in
1825	DATE	, he came to
Illinois	LOCATION	when a boy , became private Secretary to Governor
Yates	PERSON	, and served on tbe bench of his adopted State .

		He was a man of quiet intellectual tastes and marked ability as both scholar and writer .

		II err
G. Hedeler	PERSON	, of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, has just sent us Part III .

		of his useful '' Verzeichniss von I rivat-Bibliothekeu . ''

		This volume is devoted to private libraries in
Germany	LOCATION	, of which 817 are briefly described , alphabetically listed , and indexed as to their principal subjects .

		The de - scriptions are in English , German , and French .

		Amer - ican owners of libraries not represented in earlier parts of this publication are requested to communicate par - ticulars of their collections to the publisher , who makes no charge for insertion in his lists .

		Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	has printed , in a private limited edition , a bilingual ''
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, '' the text of Fit / .

		Gerald 's final revision occupying the right-band pages , while facing them are tbe quatrains of an elegiac Latin version by Mr.
Herbert Wilson Greene	PERSON	, of Ox - ford .

		Mr.
Greene	PERSON	's tour de force was completed five years ago , and printed in an edition of a hundred copies , which are now almost impossible to get .


Fitz Gerald	PERSON	himself experimented a little in Latin versions of the Rubaiyat , writing once to Professor Cowell : '' You will 1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 think me a perfectly Aristophanic Old Man , when I tell you how many of Omar I could not help running into such bad Latin . ''

		Mr.
Dole	PERSON	's edition is published with the consent of both Mr.
Greene	PERSON	and
Fitz Gerald	PERSON	's lit - erary executor , and makes the prettiest of vest-pocket volumes , bound in flexible green leather a delicate tribute to the translator .

		The '' Complete Prose Works '' of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, just published by
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a companion to the '' Leaves of Grass , '' and thus makes it possible to possess , in two handsome volumes , the en - tire mass of Whitman 's work , excepting only the letters styled '' The Wound Dresser , '' which appear in a sup - plementary collection .

		We have here the '' Specimen Days and Collect , '' ''
November	DATE	Boughs , '' and '' Good Bye , My Fancy , '' filling over five hundred pages alto - gether , beautifully printed and bound .

		There are six full-page illustrations .

		Mrs.
Elizabeth Lynn Linton	PERSON	, who died in
London	LOCATION	on the fourteenth of
July	DATE	, was the widow of the famous wood-engraver ,
William J. Linton	PERSON	, and was herself a writer of long established reputation .

		She was born at
Keswick	ORGANIZATION	in
1822	DATE	, and married Mr.
Linton	PERSON	in
1858	DATE	.

		Although they separated soon after , he coming to Amer - ica to live , the relations between them remained ami - cable .

		Mrs.
Linton	PERSON	wrote innumerable magazine articles and short stories , besides a considerable number of longer works of fiction . ''

		The True History of
Joshua Davidson	PERSON	'' is probably her most important and charac - teristic work .

		The '' Municipal History and Present Organization of the City of
Chicago	LOCATION	'' is a doctoral thesis presented to the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Samuel Edwin Sparling	PERSON	, and published as a Bulletin of that institution .

		In preparing the monograph , Mr.
Sparling	PERSON	has not only served himself , but has also rendered an important ser - vice to the city with which the work is concerned , for such a conspectus of the history of
Chicago	LOCATION	in its legal and administrative aspects has not before been published , and has long been a desideratum .

		The work is brought up to date by a description of the new laws respecting taxation and primary elections .

		The prevailing war spirit moved Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	lately to write a poem called '' A Night in Time of War '' for the
London	LOCATION	''
Saturday	DATE	Review . ''

		But when the poem appeared in print the author was amazed to read `` Faint , faint , these mildewed chords that twang So feebly , where the music rang Deep organ-notes when omer sang I '' Whether the Greek or the Persian poet was meant was evidently what troubled the conscientious compositor who made this ingenious compromise .

		The final retirement of Mr.
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	from the editorship of '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' although not from his connection with the publishing business of
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is only the fulfilment of a step anticipated by the public ever since Mr.
Walter H. Page	PERSON	became associated with the magazine three years ago .

		That this change has not resulted in losing for the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' its old-time supremacy over our other mag - azines is evident enough from a glance at the bound volume for the half-year just ended , a volume which for dignity , discrimination in the editing , agreeable variety of contents , and unfailing literary excellence , may easily challenge comparison with any of the eighty that have preceded it .

		THIS book is intended as an introduction to the study of Literature .

		Its plan rests upon the belief that the forms of Composition , in prose and verse , should be taught early in the course of education , and can best be taught by the study of the Literature in which they are embodied .

		In the Introduction the elements of form are given , as sim - ply as possible , with examples from American authors .

		The following chapters contain a historical survey of our Litera - ture .

		In each period the works are classified according to the accepted divisions of Epic ,
Lyric	LOCATION	, and Dramatic verse ; and
Narrative	ORGANIZATION	,
Expository	LOCATION	, and Oratorical prose .

		Under each division , characteristic selections are studied with reference to form and content .

		The effort is to make these studios suggestive to the teacher , and to prepare the student for more thorough analytical study in more advanced courses .

CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE .

		n .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	at present the drama dominates all the other literary forms , and to it three - fifths of the year 's summary is devoted .

		The names of
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	and
Herr Haupt	PERSON	- mann stand foremost among the dramatists , and , since the latter has produced no new play of late , the `` Johannes '' of the former is un - questionably the book of the twelvemonth .

		Of the circumstances attending the stage-produc - tion of this work , we are informed as follows : '' A Christian state , such as
Prussia	LOCATION	still is officially , even though it does not use the term , can not be blamed for objecting to see personages hallowed by tradition and religious veneration made the subject of dramatic liberties and too vivid actual presentation .

		On this ac - count the performance of this tragedy in
Berlin	LOCATION	was postponed until
January 14th , 1898	DATE	, although it had been ready some time previously , and then it was not the Court stage of the royal Schauspielhaus , but the private stage of the Deutsches Theatre , that witnessed the performance . ''

		Historical dramas in a stricter sense are still written in
Germany	LOCATION	in considerable numbers , although the public interest in them seems to be on the wane . ''


Alarich	PERSON	,
Koenig	PERSON	der West - gothen , '' by
Herr Verdy du Vernois	PERSON	, and
Herr Domanig	PERSON	's Tyrolese trilogy of
Andreas Hofer	PERSON	, are the most remarkable examples of this spe - cies .

		In general , we are told that `` at the present time the stage is held by coarse popular plays , farces , bourgeois drama , dramatized stories , and of late fairy tales , with all the cus - tomary musical and optical effects . ''

		The plays discussed most fully in the present article are '' Neigung , '' by
Herr J. J. David	PERSON	; ''
Agnes Jordan	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Georg Hirschfeld	PERSON	; ''
Mutter Erde	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Max Halbe	PERSON	, and an unnamed love drama by
Herr Heyse	PERSON	, with
Vanina Vanini	PERSON	, for a heroine , and based upon the Italian con - spiracies of the early part of this century .


Herr Heyse	PERSON	has also published a collection of `` Neue Gedichte und Jugendlieder , '' and re - mains
Germany	LOCATION	's most brilliant poet in the classical manner .

		The modern German short story , which derives also from
Herr Heyse	PERSON	, is illustrated this year by the volumes '' Aus Alter
Schule	PERSON	, '' by
Frau von Ebner	PERSON	-
Eschenbach	PERSON	; ''
Tiefe Wasser	PERSON	, '' by
Herr	PERSON	von Wildenbruch ; and ''
Novellen	PERSON	aus Oesterreich , '' by
Herr	PERSON	von Saar .

		`` Amid the deluge of novels , ` Arachne , ' by Dr.
Georg Ebers	PERSON	, and * Ebroin , ' by
Herr Felix Dahn	PERSON	, are remarkable rather for the names of their authors than the novelty of their contents .

		We have a sort of impression of having read them both before , although we know well enough that this can only have been among the works of the same authors . ''

		The former takes us back to the Alexandrian epoch and the latter to the period of the
Volkerwanderung	ORGANIZATION	.

		Other works of fiction are Herr Guido List 's '' Car - nuntum '' and ''
Ossip Schubin	PERSON	's '' '' Wenn 's
Nur Schon	PERSON	Winter War ! ''

		both Austrian ro - mances , the one of ancient , the other of modern times .

		Works of serious scholarship include the following : ''

Dessen Verhiiltniss	PERSON	zu Kunst and Politik , '' by
Herr Franz Xaver Kraus	PERSON	; and '' Erinnerunger au Brahms , '' by
Herr J. Victor Widmann	PERSON	.

		We are told of
Denmark	LOCATION	: `` The literary movement which commenced some twenty-five yean ago with the lectures of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	is now ebbing fast By some it was styled realism , by others Brandesianism .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	him - self called it naturalism ... What he meant by nat - uralism was a theory strictly opposed to clericalism or any form of clericalism , a culture of nature in the widest sense of the word , it being strictly understood that there is no room for elements of orthodox and revealed religion or morals in this system .

		He was not an inno - vator in the same sense as
Grundtvig	LOCATION	, the author of novel ideas which would never have appeared if he had not given them life ; but he was the spokesman of new thoughts and feelings which were just then in vogue in the great centres of civilization , but had not as yet reached us .

		Our literary criticisms were still abstract and rested on the terminology of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Brandes intro - duced the realistic methods of
Taine	PERSON	and Sainte-Beuve , based on the philosophy of Comte and others .

		But at the same time it must be acknowledged that he was something more than a literary critic in the general sense of the word : he was an enthusiastic and sympathetic interpreter of the great poets of all times and countries , a man who knew the charm of his own language , and mastered it as an artist , a fervent and fertile genius .

		... A literary movement which commenced its career as a hymn to the beauty and glory of natural life when liberated from Christianity and other moral and polit - ical restrictions has already changed into its own oppo - site , and confesses the inevitable and irredeemable mis - ery of human life , not on account of social prejudices and encumbrances , but on account of the conditions of life in themselves . ''


Herr Edvard Brandes	PERSON	, a brother of the critic , illustrates this transformation in his '' Lykkens Blaendvaerk '' -LRB- The Delusion of Happiness -RRB- , as pessimistic a book as is often seen . ''

		En Kri - tisk Tid '' -LRB- A Critical Time -RRB- , by
Herr Jacob Hansen	PERSON	, '' deals with the striking problem how theoretical rejection of the freedom of the will may be realized in practice .

		The hero of this book -LRB- improperly termed so -RRB- is an interesting example of a human being in whom there is no feeling , no will , no conscience , only a series of reflections , almost mechanical .

		Yet there lies behind them a world of subdued feelings subdued because they would kill the person with remorse if they were set free . ''


Herr Johannes Jorgensen	PERSON	, '' who from an advanced standpoint went back to the
Roman Church	ORGANIZATION	, which is here in
Denmark	LOCATION	a retrogression of more than three centuries and a half , has lately published a book called ` Helvedesf jender ' -LRB- The Enemies of Hell -RRB- to demonstrate that those who now so passionately attack the dogma of hell use this pretence only as a mask for their hostility to Christianity itself .

		It is the sharp - est weapon that has been used against the ene - mies of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and as a general defence of religious feeling it is eloquent and convinc - ing . ''


Herr Einar Christiansen	PERSON	'' has written a great drama called ` Cosmus , ' in which he treats of modern social questions from a new standpoint .

		Each man , he says , has his place and his duties in his generation through his family .

		In fidelity towards his own kin and the duties it lays upon him he fulfils his duties towards humanity in general .

		In other words , we can not all have the same social aims , but each of us must find his duties for himself in connection with his special position in life . ''


Herr Drachmann	PERSON	'' published last year no fewer than three dramas or melodramas , a form he has introduced in our literature .

		But brilliant and powerful as he is when he is at his best , he is empty and vaporous when he is at his worst ; and his
Brav Karl	PERSON	' -LRB- Good Fellow -RRB- is indeed one of his unsuccessful efforts .

		Even the songs introduced are not of his best .

		Dramatic he , on the whole , is not , and in this field he has not produced anything of more than ephemeral interest ; only the lyrics occurring in some of his dramas retain a certain value . ''

		Other books worth mentioning are
Herr Nyrop	ORGANIZATION	's ** Kysset og ets Historic '' -LRB- The Kiss and Its Story -RRB- , a beautiful and most learned piece of pleasantry which really ought to be adapted and laid be - fore English readers , '' a second part of
Herr Schandorph	PERSON	's `` Memoirs , ''
Herr C. Ewald	PERSON	's ''
James Singleton	PERSON	's Store Udenlands Kejse '' -LRB-
James Singleton	PERSON	's Great Journey Abroad -RRB- , and the monograph on ``
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	, '' pub - lished by Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	on the occasion of the seventieth birthday of the great Norwegian poet and dramatist . ''

		In
Norway	LOCATION	, the past twelve months have not produced any book of special importance , '' but they have witnessed the celebration of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's seventieth birthday , which calls for mention .

		The dramatist even made a brief speech now and then , upon banquets and other festive occasions .

		`` The chief information he vouchsafed was that this Christmas the usual new play by him must not be looked for , though hitherto every other year such has been the case .

		It would seem that for the present Ibsen is occu - pied with compiling his memoirs , a work which is nat - turally looked forward to with the greatest interest He
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 95 is also seeing through the press a fresh edition of his collected works in the original as well as in a German translation .

		It caused no little sensation when , at a festive meeting of an Advanced Woman 's Club , he dis - tinctly disclaimed that from his creation of '
Nora	PERSON	' any inference should be drawn of his having headed the ranks of the supporters of women 's emancipation .

		On the contrary , he asserted woman 's true place in the social scale to be as wife and mother , to lay the founda - tion of morality and culture for the next generation . ''

		The drama is at present the most vital form of literature in
Norway	LOCATION	, and , although its two great exponents have produced no play during the year , no less than seven dramatic works of unusual merit are described by the writer .

		They are '' Lindelin , '' by
Herr Jonas	PERSON	Lie ; '' The
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Herr Gunnar Heiberg	PERSON	; ''
Johanne	PERSON	, '' by
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	^ / s / `` Godfather 's Gift , '' by
Herr Peter Egge	PERSON	; '' Evening Red , '' by
Herr Knut Harnsun	PERSON	; '' Drops of Red , '' by
Herr Sigbjbrn Obstfelder	PERSON	; and '' Between the Processions , '' by
Herr Hans Kinck	PERSON	.

		Under the heads of poetry and fiction we find nothing of any significance chronicled .

		Works of scholarship are '' Our Younger Con - temporary Poets , '' by
Herr Carl Naerup	PERSON	; a study of
Welhaven	LOCATION	, by Dr.
Arne Lochen	PERSON	; ''
Keiser Hadrian	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
A. Raeder	PERSON	; and two supple - mentary accounts of Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	's expedition , by
Herr Nordahl	PERSON	and Lieutenant
Johansen	PERSON	.

		In
Sweden	LOCATION	, '' the past year has been remark - able for the revival of the national feeling in every department of literature .

		Even belles - lettres have been influenced by this national movement .

		Whereas formerly the romance mainly looked to everyday life for its subjects , striving after a photographic reproduction of facts , authors nowadays prefer to return to the past history of the Swedish people , and paint pictures of the life and culture of bygone times .

		... The historical story and romance have revived in a much improved form , inasmuch as they are founded upon more serious and thor - ough researches into the history of the times they delineate , and therefore , as a rule , present truer and more impressive pictures . ''

		The chief illustrations of this thesis are '' Pictures of
Sweden	LOCATION	from the
Sixteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Herr Elof Tegner	PERSON	; The Days of Gustaf III. , '' by
Herr O. Levertin	PERSON	; '' A Knight of Fortune , '' by
Herr H. Molander	PERSON	; and stories from the time of
Charles XII.	PERSON	, by
Herr Verner	PERSON	von Heidenstamm . ''

		Miss
Selma Lagerlof	PERSON	, who a few years ago excited considerable and well-merited attention by her romantic '
Gosta Berlings Saga	PERSON	, ' written in a strongly individual style , has this year published ' Antikrists Mirakler , ' where , in the most charming manner , she relates the myths and legends of
Sicily	LOCATION	.

		This book has placed her at a bound in the front rank of
Sweden	LOCATION	's female authors .

		Another book by a woman , but in quite a different style , is ' Den Nya Verlden , ' by Miss
Hilma Angerod Strand	PERSON	- berg , which gives us an impressive and gloomy picture of the sufferings which a family of emigrants to
America	LOCATION	has to endure in the cruel struggle for existence . ''

		In poetry , there are new volumes by
Herr Snoilsky	ORGANIZATION	and
Herr C. D. af Wirsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fol - lowing interesting note concerns one of the most notorious , if not one of the greatest , of living Swedish writers : ''
Herr August Strindberg	PERSON	, the realist and Nihilist , has undergone a peculiar , if not altogether unexpected metamorphosis , inasmuch as he has stuck fast in an almost crazy mysticism and self-introspection .

		His ' Inferno ' and '
Legender	PERSON	' are the diaries of a sick soul , in which a sick man 's thoughts and visions are treated as the most important events in the universe , and in which he alternately calls down the anathemas of heaven upon wasted lives and elevates his own particular ego into a centre around which everything is to revolve and to which everything is to be referred .

		But such books scarce belong to literature at all , though they may inter - est hospital physicians . ''

		A comment upon
Nobel	ORGANIZATION	's `` magnificent donation to humanity '' closes the summary of Swedish literary activities .

		Contemporary Russian literature , we are told , `` is in a condition of decay and stagnation .

		Having produced some great names which have gained a world - wide celebrity , Russian genius has for a time as it were exhausted itself .

		The heroic period of artistic produc - tion is ended , and the literary activity of contemporary
Russia	LOCATION	produces on the observer the same impression as is produced by dull , everyday life after a brilliant and noisy festival .

		Out of the number of books which have appeared during the past twelve months , only two or three are worthy of attention , to wit , the ' Tales ' of Mr.
Anton Chekhov	PERSON	; ' The Mirrors , ' a collection of stories and poems by Mrs.
Zenaida Gippius	PERSON	; ' Shadows , ' a collection of tales and poems by Mr. Th .

		Sologub ; and the second volume of the poems of Mrs.
Lokhvitskaya	PERSON	, a young writer whose verses are always harmonious and devoted almost exclusively to the two eternal subjects , love and death .

		In them we feel the inexhaustible efflorescence of youth , the splendid luxury of a
spring	DATE	morning with its abundance of sound , colour , and fragrance . ''

		A good deal of attention has been given of late to translations from other modern literatures , and a new version of our own
Poe	PERSON	has increased the circle of his friends in
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		During the past year in
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	there ap - peared a collection of the works of Dr.
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	in a Russian translation .

		The works of
Byron	LOCATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Burns	PERSON	have been translated afresh , and again find readers .

		It is by familiarizing itself with the great models of European poetry , and the careful study of them , that Russian literature will escape its contem - porary barrenness , and take to itself original forms . ''

		Two items of scholarly interest are the work on '' Russian Poetry , '' by Mr.
S. Vengerow	PERSON	, and the continuation of the same author 's ''
Critico	PERSON	-

		The Polish nation celebrates this jear the centenary of the greatest poet that she in particular , and the whole race of Slavs in general , has seen ,
Adam Mickiewicz	PERSON	.

		In all parts of old
Poland	LOCATION	this unusual occasion for fes - tival is being watched with a wide and deep interest , which must , however , in the different provinces take the form that local political conditions impose .

		The books and pamphlets suitable to the occasion pop - ular biographies , papers on the meaning of the poet and his works , historical memoirs , cantatas , pictures , etc. .

		have already appeared or will do so in great numbers .

		National collections will also provide for two great monuments of
Mickiewicz	PERSON	in
Cracow	LOCATION	and
Warsaw	LOCATION	, to be unveiled this year ; the town of
Lemberg	ORGANIZATION	is planning in the immediate future a third .


Poland	LOCATION	honours in
Mickiewicz	PERSON	not only the first of her poets , but also a great patriot and spiritual leader . ''

		Among the publications of the year , the fol - lowing are the most important : '' The Way to Luck , '' a story by Mr.
T. T. Jez	PERSON	; '' The Angel of Death , '' by Mr.
K. Tetmajer	PERSON	; '' Rust , '' by Mr.
A. Krechowiecki	PERSON	; '' The Leader of the Dance , '' by Mrs.
G. Zapolska	PERSON	; '' Baczmaha , '' by Mr.
M. Pawlikowski	PERSON	; and '' The Life and Thoughts of
Sigismund Podfilipski	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
J. Weyssenhoff	PERSON	.

		These are all works of fiction .

		A number of successful plays are also men - tioned , including ''
Malka Schwarzenkopf	PERSON	'' and `` Hi * , '' both by Mrs.
Zapolska	PERSON	.

		The '' Dramas and Comedies '' of Mr.
Adam Belci	PERSON	- kowski , the writer of the article , have been published in five volumes .

		Three important publications in literary history are the ''
Adam Mickiewicz	PERSON	'' of Mr.
J. Kallenbach	PERSON	, the two - volume work '' Our Dramatic Literature , '' of Mr.
P. Chmielowski	PERSON	, and the first volume of Mr.
H. Biegeleiseu	PERSON	's '' Illustrated History of Polish Literature . '' ''

		A few months since Polish literature sustained a loss that can never be repaired , in the death of two of her most important poets in modern times ,
Kornel Ujrjski	PERSON	and
Adam Asnyk	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Sienkiewiez	PERSON	has published nothing during the year , but we learn from other sources that he is engaged upon a historical romance to be entitled '' The Knights of the Cross . ''

		The most important fact in the literary ac - tivity of
Bohemia	LOCATION	appears to be 44 the approaching hundredth anniversary of the birth of
Bohemia	LOCATION	's most celebrated historian , whose fame , even in his lifetime , spread far beyond the boundaries of bis native land
Francis Palacky	PERSON	.

		His genius placed him above all his contemporaries ; his researches into the annals of his country were profound , systematic , and impartial ; and the outcome of his life 's labour , the vol - uminous ' History of the
Bohemian Nation	ORGANIZATION	, ' gained for him a position among the most celebrated of European historians .

		Of the numerous publications which are to appear on this occasion , the most valuable for the knowl - edge of this best of
Bohemia	LOCATION	's sons will be several vol - umes of his correspondence , which are to appear at the expense of the
Academy of Science	ORGANIZATION	, and an essay which is being based on new matter due to the original re - search of Professor
Goll	PERSON	. ''

		In belles-lettres , mention is made of an edition of
Havlicek	PERSON	's poetical works , of Yrchlicky 's new narrative poem '' Bar-Kochba , '' of two other volumes of poems by the same author , and of Rohac na Sione , '' a historical poem by
Svatopluk Cech	PERSON	.

		In fiction , there are
Jirasek	ORGANIZATION	's U U Nas , ''
Zeyer	PERSON	's '' In the Dawn of the Gods '' and '' The House of the Drowning Star , '' and
Kosmak	PERSON	's posthumous tale , '' A Poisoned Rose . ''

		The drama has received a new impulse this year , '' in consequence , perhaps , of the lively interest awakened by the attempt to es - tablish a second Bohemian theatre in
Prague	LOCATION	. ''

		The chief plays mentioned are
Hilbert	PERSON	's pro- hibited '' For God , ''
Zeyer	PERSON	's fairy-piece '' Raduz a Mahulena , ''
Vrchlicky	ORGANIZATION	's comedy from
King Arthur	PERSON	's times , '' King and
Fowler	PERSON	, '' and Kapil 's '' Princess Dandelion . ''

		WHERE ARE THE POETS OF THE CUBAN WAR ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		Will some reader of THE DIAL kindly essay an ex - planation of the curious and rather mortifying fact that the war now waging is evoking no poetry worth men - tioning ?

		America is prolific of poets to say nothing of poetasters ; but as yet no TyrUean strain born of the occasion has fired the heart of the American soldier , and the heroic deeds of
Manila	LOCATION	and
Santiago	LOCATION	remain unsung .

		Not even a half-way respectable war-song '' of the 44 Marching Through
Georgia	LOCATION	'' type has appeared .

		What has become of all the ladies and gentlemen who , in the piping times of peace , marvellously produce such floods of pretty magazine verse , albeit driven to themes as hackneyed as the
Advent of Spring	ORGANIZATION	and as slight M the Death of a Canary Bird ?

		Why are they so strangely mute , now that the air is charged with the most potent forces of poetic inspiration , and while topics as tempt - ing as ever fired a patriotic pen are going a-begging ?

		Is the valor of American soldiers and sailors to miss the meed of song ?

		Think how eagerly Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	-LRB- who found it in him to celebrate even the abortive 44 ride '' and summary thrashing of '' Doctor Jim '' -RRB- would have improved the occasion had it been ''
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	'' who won
El Caney	ORGANIZATION	and stormed the heights of
San Juanl Perhaps	LOCATION	our poets are incubating things poetic that will appear and dazzle us in the fulness of time .

		But to your correspondent the dearth of spon - taneous verse of the kind indicated verse with a true native ring and breath of militant patriotism in it , such as our Civil War called forth in plenty , seems as dis - appointing as remarkable .

		THE CENTURY ATLAS .

		* The great `` Century Atlas , '' uniform in size and shape with '' The Century Dictionary '' and '' Cyclopedia of Names , '' is a completing and a companion volume to those important works .

		It contains no less than 117 double-page mod - ern maps , together with a still larger number of '' corner or inset '' maps .

		There are , more - over , two charts of the Heavens , a dozen or more pages of historical maps , and an ingen - ious '' Index Chart '' showing the number and extent of every map .

		Extensive indexes containing , it is said , the enormous number of 170,000 names serve as keys to the exact location of every place upon the maps , and also , in some sort , as a gazetteer , inasmuch as the population of every land , district , and town is given , wherever ascertain able .

		These indexes are one of the most valuable features of the work .

		Especial features of the maps are the contour-lines -LRB- lines of equal elevation above the sea -RRB- , which are printed in olive or brown ; and the admirable device of printing the lines of railroad in red , so as to distinguish them at a glance from the numerous lines traced in black .

		These maps do not exhibit topographical details so minutely as the carefully engraved and ar - tistic maps of Stieler 's celebrated Hand -
Atlas	LOCATION	; but they appear on the whole , at least to the American eye , somewhat clearer and easier of reference than the maps in Stieler .

		The editor states that all the maps '' have been based upon the latest and best official information , with a comparison of the results of recent explora - tions . ''

		Such tests as I have been able to make have tended to confirm this statement .

		In attempting to form an opinion of the accu - racy and completeness of this
Atlas	LOCATION	, one natu - rally turns to the maps of those states with which one chances to be especially familiar .

		In the maps of the smaller states , which can be figured on these quarto pages on relatively large scales , there is little to complain of as regards detail .

		Thus ,
Vermont	LOCATION	and
New Hampshire	LOCATION	are shown together transversely across the double page -LRB- i. e. , so that the book must be turned -RRB- , on the scale of thirteen miles to the inch ;
New Jersey	LOCATION	-LRB- also transversely -RRB- on the * THE CENTURY ATLAS OF THE WORLD .

		scale of eleven miles to the inch ;
Connecticut	LOCATION	and
Rhode Island	LOCATION	on the scale of nine miles to the inch ; while the excellent map of
Eastern Massachusetts	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- also transversely -RRB- is drawn to the scale of six and one-half miles to the inch .

		There are numerous inset maps on an even larger scale ; of these , the maps of
Greater New York	LOCATION	,
Jersey City	LOCATION	and Vicinity ,
Buffalo	LOCATION	and the
Niagara Frontier	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Pittsburg	LOCATION	,
Savannah	LOCATION	, and their respective vicinities , all on the scale of four miles to the inch , are handsome examples .


Charleston	LOCATION	and its vicinity is finely exhibited on a considerably larger scale ; the more com - prehensive map of
San Francisco	LOCATION	and her Bay is drawn to the scale of seven miles to the inch ; those of
Richmond	LOCATION	and
Norfolk	LOCATION	, and their vicin - ities , to the scale of eight miles ; that of Gal - veston and
Houston	LOCATION	to the scale of ten miles ; and the scales of the maps of
New Orleans	LOCATION	and
Chattanooga	LOCATION	are not given .

		The little map of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	and
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, on the petty scale of eight miles to the inch , is scarcely calculated to satisfy either the pride of their citizens or the curiosity of others .

		It is a pity that the capital plan of showing the vicinities of large towns on a uniform scale of four miles to the inch was departed from in this case .

		In this way the greater compactness of European cities , and the enormous superficial areas covered by the newer cities of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	are shown at a glance .


Vienna	LOCATION	, with its million and a third of inhabitants , appears to cover , on the scale of four miles to the inch , barely as much ground as is covered by
Minneapolis	LOCATION	on the scale of eight miles .

		Liverpool would go twice into
Cleveland	LOCATION	;
Brussels	LOCATION	and
Amsterdam	LOCATION	are of contemptible size in comparison with
Omaha	LOCATION	;
Hamburg	LOCATION	and
Altona	LOCATION	, as figured here on the scale of two miles to the inch , bulk scarcely bigger than the two
Kansas Cities	ORGANIZATION	on the scale of four miles ; while circular
London	LOCATION	might , by a process of violent distortion , be packed into the North and
South Sides of Chicago	LOCATION	, leaving plenty of room on the
West Side	LOCATION	to slip
Paris	LOCATION	in without disturbing its oval symmetry .

		As fig - ured here on the scale of four miles to the inch ,
Paris	LOCATION	is about the size and shape of a walnut ,
London	LOCATION	of an enormous peach ,
Boston	LOCATION	proper of a small strawberry ,
New York	LOCATION	proper of a large peapod ,
Chicago	LOCATION	of no known vegetable product , unless it be a generous slice of bread , irregu - larly cut and inequitably buttered , and appar - ently nibbled away on one side .

		By the scales permitted by the size of this
Atlas	PERSON	, the great states of the
Middle West	LOCATION	, the 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, topography of which is for the most part so monotonous , can be shown with some detail .

		Thus ,
Indiana	LOCATION	, with its area of 36,350 square miles -LRB- somewhat larger than
Ireland	LOCATION	-RRB- can be shown on a single map at a scale of nineteen miles to the inch .

		The state of
New York	LOCATION	-LRB- 47 , - 620 square miles , somewhat smaller than
England	LOCATION	-RRB- is shown on the scale of sixteen miles to the inch , three maps being necessary , giving room , however , for the large inset maps of
New York	LOCATION	,
Buffalo	LOCATION	, etc. .

		It is convenient , by the way , to bear in mind that the combined areas of
New York	LOCATION	and
Indiana	LOCATION	are but a little greater than the combined areas of
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, so that for purposes of comparison they can be regarded as the same .

		The still larger state of
Illinois	LOCATION	-LRB- 56,650 square miles -RRB- is exhibited on two of these sheets at a scale of eighteen miles to the inch .

		Inas - much as little is to be shown ou the map of
Illinois	LOCATION	save the position and names of the towns , the names and boundaries of the coun - ties , the frequent railways , and the infrequent streams , the scale adopted is quite unnecessar - ily large ; an even smaller scale would , indeed , have permitted the insertion of interesting fea - tures of the landscape , such , for example , as
Starved Rock	ORGANIZATION	and Deer Park .

		On the map of
Northern Illinois	LOCATION	I discover but two contour lines ; one running down both sides of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	from
Keokuk	LOCATION	, the other running down both sides of the
Illinois	LOCATION	from
Seneca	LOCATION	, the rest of the country , including the Lake , being at an elevation of more than five hundred feet above the sea .

		The great state of
California	LOCATION	, on the other hand , presenting , as it does , every topograph - ical feature that can be shown upon a map , would require for even tolerable representation at least as large a scale as that here adopted for
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		And
California	LOCATION	is as eminently worthy of detailed treatment in an American Atlas as any state .


California	LOCATION	is said to have an area of 158,360 square miles , so that it would cut up into three and a half states of the size of
New York	LOCATION	, leaving a remnant more than large enough to form
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		It is about equal in extent to the four kingdoms of
Italy	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	, and
the Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		The map of
California	LOCATION	must exhibit a state of far more diversified topographical configura - tion than any other .

		It must show intricate mountain-systems , with lofty , snow-clad sum - mits and ridges , giving rise to important streams which , in cutting their way to the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	, have formed a number of canons and gorges comparable to the well-known
Yosemite Valley	ORGANIZATION	.

		These mountains are doubtless still rich in con - cealed mineral resources ; they are already traversed by wagon-roads and stage-routes in many places , and are even penetrated by more than one railway .

		In the not distant future they are destined to serve for Americans as a
summer	DATE	playground quite equal in all kinds of opportunities for seekers of health or healthful pleasure to the distant , tourist-haunted Alps .

		Taking account of her mountains ,
California	LOCATION	can boast of a greater variety of climates and products than can be found along the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast from
Maine	LOCATION	to
Florida	LOCATION	.

		In every respect save that of great population ,
California	LOCATION	is second in interest and importance -LRB- from the standpoint , at least , of the student of geog - raphy -RRB- to no state in the
Union	LOCATION	.

		Yet the ed - itor of this
Atlas	LOCATION	has crowded her eight hun - dred miles of length and two hundred miles of breadth into a portion of two of these small sheets , and has adopted the scale of thirty-six miles to the inch , just half that adopted for
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		On this relatively minute scale it has been impossible for the map-maker to do jus - tice to this vast region of configuration so varied .

		The map lacks the clearness which is , in general , characteristic of this
Atlas	LOCATION	, and leaves much to be desired in point of detail .

		The multitudinous contour-lines are extremely confused , it is difficult to follow them even with a magnifying glass .

		One would gladly sacrifice all these puzzling lines for indica - tions of the principal stage-routes and other wagon-roads .

		Important post-routes in the
United States	LOCATION	are indicated , I believe , only on the maps of
Arizona	LOCATION	,
New Mexico	LOCATION	,
Nevada	LOCATION	,
Utah	LOCATION	, and
Western Texas	LOCATION	.

		Why not also in
California	LOCATION	, where the wagon-routes are so nu - merous , economically so important , and scen - ically so interesting ?

		In general throughout the Atlas the plan seems to be to indicate wagon-roads chiefly in regions where there are no railroads .

		As has been already shown , this plan is not consistently carried out .

		On the map of
Scotland	LOCATION	, where the highways are perhaps more systematically shown than in the case of any other European country , they generally disappear before the railway , but in two or three instances the high - way is shown running amicably alongside the railway .

		In
England	LOCATION	,
Wales	LOCATION	, and
Ireland	LOCATION	, there are , to judge from these maps , no wagon-roads at all .

		Even in the case of the otherwise so satisfactory map of
Central England	LOCATION	, on the scale of nine miles to the inch , not a highway
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 99 is shown .

		Still worse , in the cases of several of the special inset maps on larger scales than the accompanying main maps , there are no highways .

		Examples are the maps of
San Francisco	LOCATION	and vicinity , of the
Hudson River	LOCATION	country from
Kingston	LOCATION	to
Yonkers	LOCATION	, of the French Mediterranean coast from
Narbonne	LOCATION	to
Mentone	LOCATION	.

		On the map of
Southern France	LOCATION	but one highway through the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	is shown ; on that of
Spain	LOCATION	, although on a much minuter scale , four or five are shown ; but on neither is there a road to the Republic of
Andorra	LOCATION	.

		In
Iceland	LOCATION	, as in
Ireland	LOCATION	, the chapter on roads would be like the famous chapter on snakes ; and the same would apply to the whole vast Dominion of
Canada	LOCATION	, with the sole exception , if I mistake not , of the Yukon and the
Eraser River	LOCATION	regions .

		On the map of
Switzerland	LOCATION	-LRB- drawn to the scale of fourteen miles to the inch -RRB- the great stage routes are indicated with some approach to system , although even here one misses , among others , the important roads from the Spliigen Pass and the Engadine Val - ley to
Lake Como	LOCATION	.

		On the maps of
Africa	LOCATION	and
South America	LOCATION	important roads or caravan routes are shown more clearly than in any other parts of the world , being printed in red , and yet plainly distinguishable from the railways by the double lines .

		This is so excellent a device that one is puzzled by its non-adoption else - where , especially for the Russian and the Chi - nese Empires .

		It is adopted just once , appar - ently by accident , on one of the American maps -LRB- leaving inset maps out of account -RRB- , to show one of the roads running into the
Yellowstone National Park	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is also adopted for the Rus - sian caravan routes on the map of the
Chinese Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the whole , this
Atlas	LOCATION	might fairly and without satirical intention be called a railway atlas of the world .

		Its indications of railways seem to be , for the most part , full , accurate , and '' up-to-date . ''

		To this statement there are some noteworthy exceptions .

		On the map of the Chinese Empire a great portion of the Trans-Siberian Railway is indicated by a red dotted line as '' under construction '' ; on the map of
Asia	LOCATION	the same portion -LRB-
Lake Baikal	LOCATION	east for hundreds of miles to Stryetensk -RRB- is indicated by a continuous black line , as if com - pleted .

		On Map 103 the Trans-Caspian Rail - way is made to run beyond
Samarkand	LOCATION	to the limit of the map ; it would be interesting to know how much farther it is completed in that direction .

		The last volume of '' The States - man 's Year-Book '' -LRB- 1897 -RRB- mentions
Samar	PERSON	- kand as the terminus , but announces the begin - ning of a continuation .

		On the map of
Asia	LOCATION	which , we are kindly informed , has '' special reference to
Siberia	LOCATION	and
Central Asia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- i. e. , to
Russia	LOCATION	in
Asia	LOCATION	-RRB- this important railway is not given .

		On the map of
Russia	LOCATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	the branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway from
Cheliabinsk	LOCATION	to
Ekaterinburg	LOCATION	-LRB- 150 miles -RRB- , said in the '' Statesman 's Year-Book '' to have been opened in
1896	DATE	, is figured as merely `` pro- posed '' ; while the proposed railroad of more than 600 miles from
Perm	LOCATION	to
Vyatka	LOCATION	and thence northward to the junction of the
Dvina	PERSON	and the Vichegda the purpose of which is to give
Western Siberia	LOCATION	a seaport at Archangel is not figured at all .

		Considering the vast scope and untold significance of Russian railway un - dertakings , these seem grave shortcomings in an Atlas of such pretensions .

		As concerns the
United States	LOCATION	, the foreign student of this
American Atlas	ORGANIZATION	might fairly draw from it the inference that we have sur - rendered unconditionally to the railroad .

		In these days when the universal use of the bicycle is making the importance of good highways so strongly felt , the system here adopted of ignor - ing their existence seems a reactionary proceed - ing .

		After all , when in search of accurate information touching railway lines , it is not to an atlas that we look , but to the railway guides which are distributed gratuitously at every sta - tion and hotel in the land .

		There is in this Atlas a convenient '' Travel-Map '' of
Central Europe	LOCATION	.

		Why not give us a similar travel-map of the
United States	LOCATION	, and on other maps replace the railway by the highway ?

		Why not pursue this plan universally for railway-ridden lands ?

		But this would not be a necessary condition of the restoration of the highway .

		On such maps as those of the
New England States	LOCATION	, for exam - ple , and of
France	LOCATION	, there is ample room for the insertion of the most important highways without displacing a single present feature of those maps .

		However , I venture to think that the Atlas of the Future will relegate the railway to a special map , will restore the slow and dignified highway to something of its ancient importance , and will lay down mountain roads and trails distinguished mainly for their scenical interest .

		In this way a map gets charged with appeals to the imagination , and allures the student to much fascinating fireside travel .

		Few things are more poetic than a wagon-road can be at its best , just as few things are more prosaic than a railroad .

		There is one map in this Atlas which is charm - 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, ing , ami , but for the red spider-web of railways that overlays it , would be poetical .

		I refer to the fine map of the Vicinity of
London	LOCATION	, really a map of
Central England	LOCATION	as far west as
Salis	PERSON	- bury and
Warwick	PERSON	.

		It is upon the generous scale of nine miles to the inch , showing all the parks in green and all the county and munici - pal boroughs in brown .

		I need not say what a boon such a map is to the student of history and the reader of literature .

		The Philistine who made this beautiful map just missed being a poet .

		Had he only been moved to leave out his beloved , but in this case useless and mean - ingless , railways , and to put in the roads and lanes !

		For what have railways to do with green English parks ?

		Several of the maps are of especial present interest .

		That of
South Africa	LOCATION	shows railways running from half a dozen points on the coast to the gold-fields of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, as well as the long railway line of more than 1500 miles from
Cape Town	LOCATION	to
Bulawayo	LOCATION	.

		A number of battlefields are marked , the latest being that of Krngersdorp .

		The map of
Central Africa	LOCATION	, although on a much smaller scale , is not less interesting .

		It presents an almost startling picture of the march of colonization and of the international race for territory in the heart of the
Dark Continent	ORGANIZATION	.

		The map of the Greater Antilles is on the scale of forty-eight miles to the inch , too small to show in detail the daily movements of the opposing forces in
Cuba	LOCATION	.


Australia	LOCATION	is too meagerly treated on a scale of two hundred miles to the inch ; and the map of the
East Indian Islands	LOCATION	, including the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines , on the same scale , is rather tantalizing to the student of the present war .

		Of especial historical interest are the more comprehensive maps , e. gr. , those of
Africa	LOCATION	, of the
West Indies	LOCATION	, and of the Region around the
North Pole	LOCATION	, by means of which the routes of dis - coverers can be traced from the time of Co - lumbus to the time of
Nansen	ORGANIZATION	.

		The historical maps proper are good as far as they go , but no claim for completeness can be made for them .

		Aside from the map of
Britain	LOCATION	and the two maps of
Saxon England	LOCATION	, there is no map exhibiting the political condition of the world during the six centuries and a half from the beginning of the reign of Hadrian to the begin - ning of the reign of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	.

		Aside from the map of
England	LOCATION	and the maps of
France	LOCATION	, there is no map illustrating the state of
Europe	LOCATION	at any time during the seven centuries between
Charlemagne	PERSON	and the Reformation .

		Nothing is given in illustration of the rise and spread of Christianity , nor of Mohammedanism and the
Saracen Empire	ORGANIZATION	, nor of the Crusades .

		Quite disproportionate attention is given to
Poland	LOCATION	, as much as to
England	LOCATION	or to
France	LOCATION	, the whole of one of these thirteen precious pages being devoted to her provincial history .

		It is generally supposed by historical students that the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars , or the Rise of
Prussia	LOCATION	, or the Formation of the German Empire , or the Unification of
Italy	LOCATION	, to mention no other great movement left unnoticed here , is of more worldwide significance than the lamentable story of the partition of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		I have dwelt upon what seem to me the short - comings of this Atlas , because it is worthy of serious criticism .

		Its genuine value will com - mend it to so many buyers that its energetic publishers will be moved to revise it .

		The faults I have indicated are none of them vital .

		A considerable number of additional maps could be added without rendering the bulk of the volume either excessive or out of proportion with the other volumes of the great work which it worthily completes .

		Possessors of those vol - umes should make haste to add this one to the set ; they will not find it the least useful .

		NATURE FOR NATURE 'S SAKE .

		* When life is cheapened , as it is in these days , to the standards of a narrowly conceived utility , impressions of beauty are not easily received .

		Yet all around us , every day and hour , it waits in all the loveliness of perfection , urgent to come in .

		Life , by reason of our wilful ways and the restraints we have put upon it , has found itself nowhere free to work out its own design .

		It thus shows everywhere incomplete , blurred and weakened in outline and in form .

		Thus , that aureole of beauty which rests upon all perfection hovers nowhere about it , and only as art has reconstructed its types in their ideal forms does it show glorious .

		With na - ture it is not so .

		No wilfulness has blurred the lines here ; nowhere have its forms been con - strained to feebleness , or left unfinished .

		Its face , whether it smiles or frowns , is sad or gay , is always perfect in its own way .

		It would seem , then , that we could not miss this beauty so constant in its expression , even when lack - NATURE FOB ITS OWN SAKE .

Natural Appearance *	ORGANIZATION	.

John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Charles bcribner 's Sons .

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 101 ing its ministry of art ; yet somehow we do , perhaps because it is so constant , and so freely ours .

		Hence , it is well that someone should point out to us the value of this our '' untaxed heritage , '' and show us how rich we are .

		In '' Nature for Its Own Sake , '' Prof.
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	has accomplished such a task .

		The purpose suggested in the title of his book is more explicitly stated as follows : '' In treating of this nature I have not considered it as the classic or romantic background of human story , nor regarded man as an essential factor in it .

		... Nature is considered as sufficient unto itself .

		The forms and colors of this earth need no association with man - kind to make them beautiful . ''

		Beauty in its last analysis is , of course , a thing of the mind , a certain kind of delightful impres - sion left upon it , and not something to be arbi - trarily affirmed of that which leaves this impres - sion ; nor is there any implication in Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's book that this is not so .

		His object is simply to show how much of such delight that beauty gives , and may be ours if we will only look about us .

		Could we compare them , we should find that the impressions we now receive from earth and sky are very different from our childish ones .

		Yet it is the child who really sees nature as it is , and the mind , when present with its expe - rience and its reasons , only darkens perception .

		But this self-forgetfulness upon which all the truth of objective impressions depends is no condition of any constructive work by which we seek to impart them to others .

		In doing this , we must remember what we had forgotten ; we must use our knowledge of our subject , and exercise our maturer right to ask the reason why .

		Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	has thus found it neces - sary to include in his treatment of nature 's effects some of that science which accounts for them to the mind .

		In a word-picture of nature , there are two special limitations : it can give us only the idea of a scene , whereas a painting or the scene itself gives us a sensation of it ; and it must present the scene in a succession of images .

		We shall thus miss all of that great charm derived from the instant impression of its ensemble of color and form .

		Other terms than their own are incompetent to convey effects of color , for the reason that these , unlike the forms that mediate them , have no existence at all except for the eye ; and even could words be found to define the exact tints upon which the impression of harmony in nature depends , they would still be found a very poor substitute for the tints themselves .

		With this suggestion of the indescribable in it which is especially the painter 's reason , it may be said that Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	has seen nature '' as it is and without prejudice , '' and that his book shows throughout a rare justness of ob - servation , and a mind open to all impressions of natural beauty .

		He gives us a series of pic - tures of earth and sky that , both in detail and mass , are vividly impressive and true .

		First he shows us the beauty and significance of light , discriminating finely the effects produced by its different degrees and kinds , whether broken or shaded , pure or reflected .

		He then shows us the sky , as we knew it of old , when it touched our horizon , and we had no more thoughts about it than had the rivers and the seas and the grass blades and the flower petals , and answered to it as obediently as they .

		Clouds and cloud - forms are next treated , and though here , as in the following chapter on rain and snow , consid - erable attention is given to the causes of the various appearances and effects described , the impression is always more of what things seem than of what they are , and we are constantly persuaded that it is better to look at them than to know about them .

		And this is always felt to be so ; for , although there is considerable analysis of the scientific kind in all of the chap - ters , it is the perception of beauty , and never the spirit of inquiry , that is quickened in us .

		For purposes of orderly arrangement , the earth and its appearances and effects , as dis - tinguished from the sky and its phases , make up the subject-matter of the remaining chapters .

		We are never , however , permitted to lose sight of what is above , nor do we ever fail to realize that the pitch and key of the whole harmony is given there .

		The sea illustrates this best of all .

		Some accident , as of depth or density , or character of its shore , are seen to enter into the impression of color it gives , but this impression is found to be mainly determined by the color and light of the sky .

		Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	gives us a beautiful series of sea effects , closely and lovingly observed .

		He then takes us to still lakes bosoming their shores , and down rivers that sweep in long curves of beauty to the ocean .

		We see streams and rivulets and brooklets rip - pling to the breeze and dancing to the sunlight .

		Then he shows us the mountains and the hills , the plains and the lowlands , and finally their covering of grass and bush and tree , all with fine analysis , and a never-failing sense of the essential beauty in the effect or scene described .

		But why , it may be asked , is such a book writ - ten ?

		Why draw up such an extended category of colors and effects which we may all see for our - 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, selves ?

		It is because we do not see them , be - cause '' we have fallen upon days of reflection , '' and '' instead of looking without , our eyes are turned within while walking the new Garden of Hesperides . ''

		It must be remembered , fur - thermore , that the book is offered as an outline of something to be filled out later on , and does not purport to be in any respect a full treatment of its subject ; it must also be remembered that instruction , more than entertainment or literary effect , is the aim of the work .

		Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	has the gift of imparting his ideas pleasantly , and we may go to school to him without fear that our interest will be overtaxed .

		We shall welcome that fuller treatment of his subject which is promised for the future .

		`` BATTLES LONG AGO . ''

		* If timeliness which is said to be the chief merit of good newspaper articles , and has been the only merit of many a poor one may do as much for a book , then Mr.
Oman	PERSON	's bulky vol - ume on '' The Art of War , '' in spite of its 667 pages , ought to find many readers in
America	LOCATION	outside of the professional students of the art of war : for just now there are some fifty million amateurs among us pursuing this branch of study .

		The author has long been known as an inde - fatigable and successful worker in mediaeval history , as his standard history of the Byzantine Empire abundantly proved him to be ; but in the present undertaking he has begun what is evidently intended to be his magnum opus .

		If the other promised volumes take as much time and toil as have gone to the making of this , we can only admire the serene courage of a scholar who toils at the foundation of a monument whose cap-stone he may reasonably doubt of ever seeing .

		For our own sake , we will wish for Mr.
Oman	PERSON	the fortune of a
Ranke	PERSON	rather than of a Buckle .

		His field is nothing less than the history of the art of war , from Greek and Roman times down to the beginning of the nineteenth century .

		The work is planned as follows : Volume I. , classical antiquity ; Volume II .

		-LRB- the one before us -RRB- , from the downfall of the Roman Empire to the fourteenth century ; Volume III. , the A HUTTOBT OF THE ART or WAR .

		The Middle Ages , from the Fourth to the
Fourteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		fifteenth , sixteenth , and seventeenth centuries ; Volume IV. , the eighteenth century , including the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars down to
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		From 500 B. C. to
1815	DATE	A. D. is a wide sweep ; and as man may be defined as a fighting animal , the mass of available mate - rial might well threaten to overwhelm both the historian and his bravest readers .

		But the author carefully explains in his preface that the history of the art of war '' does not purport to give the complete military annals of the civil - ized world .

		Each section deals with the char - acteristic tactics , strategy , and military organ - ization of a period , and illustrates them by detailed accounts of typical campaigns and battles .

		There are also chapters dealing with the siegecraft and fortification , the arms and the armor , of each age . ''

		Thus defined , the subject assumes proportion and becomes attrac - tive .

		It will be observed that the present volume is the second in the series as planned ; and it may safely be assumed that Mr.
Oman	PERSON	wrote it first as covering the fields with which he has been especially familiar .

		Beginning with the last days of the legion , he describes the reor - ganization of the Roman army by
Diocletian	PERSON	and
Constantine	PERSON	, and traces the growing im - portance of cavalry .

		The end of this transi - tional period , after which the supremacy of cavalry was not questioned , he fixes at the year 378 , and that bloody day on the plains of Adrianople when the Roman army met its most crushing defeat since Cannae , and a Roman emperor , with forty thousand of his legionaries , lay dead upon the field of battle . ''

		The mili - tary importance of Adrianople , '' says Mr.
Oman	PERSON	, '' was unmistakable ; it was a victory of cavalry over infantry .

		The imperial army had developed its attack on the great laager in which the Goths lay encamped , arrayed in the time-honored formation of Roman hosts with the legions and cohorts in the centre , and the squadrons on the wings .

		The fight was raging hotly all along the barricade of wagons , when suddenly a great body of horsemen charged in upon the Roman left .

		It was the main strength of the Gothic cavalry , which had been foraging at a distance ; receiving news of the fight , it had ridden straight for the field of battle , and fell upon the exposed flank of the imperial host . ''

		The tremendous impact wedged legions and cohorts into one indistinguishable mass : they could neither fight nor fly , and were cut down where they stood .

		* Probably to his own surprise , the Goth found that his stout lance

		He had become the arbiter of war , the lineal ancestor of all the knights of the Middle Ages , the inaugurator of that ascendancy of the horseman which was to endure for a thousand years . ''

		The early Middle Ages are then examined , a chapter being devoted to the arms and tactics of the
Franks	PERSON	, Visigoths , and
Lombards	LOCATION	, and another to those of the Anglo-Saxons .

		Book III. , in seven chapters , covers the period be - tween 768 and
1066	DATE	dates which readers will recognize as standing for Charles the Great and William the Conqueror .

		Book IV .

		traces the development of the Byzantine army .

		Book V. is a deeply interesting discussion of the strat - egy , both grand and special , of the Crusades .

		The remaining three books treat of the art of war in
Western Europe	LOCATION	in the days when the long-bow was so effective in attack , and the castle so supreme in defense .

		Then came gun - powder and exploded , among other things , the whole fabric of military science and tactics .

		But that is another story .

		All these changes are fully set forth in de - tailed accounts of battles , not necessarily the politically '' decisive '' ones , but those which are regarded as typical by the military historian ; though some , like
Hastings	PERSON	and Crecy , are of both kinds .

		In most cases , the author describes and criticizes the strategy of both armies .

		His descriptions are graphic and almost always clear ; his style is never monotonous , though the subject lies dangerously that way .

		Though a scientific treatise , his work never would find place in
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's catalogue of biblia a-biblia : it is , throughout , for the reader as well as the student .

		The book is well supplied with care - fully prepared maps and plans , which leave the reader in no doubt as to the topography or ar - rangement .

		A NEW VIEW OF `` BLOODY '' JEFFREYS .

		* We commonly conceive of Judge
Jeffreys	PERSON	as the monster of bloodthirsty cruelty , blasphe - mous rage , and brutish intemperance , which
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	represents him to have been .

		The popular historian 's persuasive rhetoric easily carries the willing reader with him in his de - scription of the man whose depravity has passed into a proverb .

		Even to-day the assertion of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's contemporary is not without a measure of truth , that one has to agree with
Tom Macaulay	PERSON	in the end , and it is easier to do so at once .

		Yet it must be borne in mind that his picture of
Jeffreys	PERSON	's personality , graphic and masterly though it is , draws its colors chiefly from two prejudiced sources .

		Further char - acteristic of the uncritical nature of his work is his commendation of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's '' Lives of the Chief Justices . '' ''

		I scarcely need , '' he says , '' advise every reader to consult Lord
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's excellent book . ''

		It is interesting to conjecture in what light
Jeffreys	PERSON	's character and career would have been handed down to us had the Tories instead of the Whigs prevailed in
1688	DATE	.

		The maledic - tions of exultant foes might not indeed , could not have been displaced by the eulogies of friends , for warm friends he had none ; but at least a more accurate estimate of such abilities as he must have possessed would have found record .

		Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's '' Life of Judge
Jeffreys	PERSON	'' is a creditable attempt to attain historical accuracy in tracing the life of a most remarkable and , despite his infamy , most interesting man .

		Hardly a single source of information , however unimportant , seems to have been overlooked in this exhaustive study of nearly four hundred pages in length ; and the writer has treated his sources with that cautious discrimination , the importance of which has been so well empha - sized by
Freeman	PERSON	.

		The official reports of state trials are given the prominence which their authenticity as contemporary evidence merits .

		The successive stages in the evolution of
Jeffreys	LOCATION	's peculiar genius of turpitude are care - fully traced .

		His early domestic life seems to have been not discreditable , to say the least , and we are told that in return for that impul - sive act of generosity which led him , at nineteen years , into a matrimonial alliance with a poor clergyman 's daughter , the latter '' proved a good * THE LIFE OF JUDGE JEFFREYS .

		The intox - ication of early success and popularity , and the insidious influences brought to bear on one who easily made himself a favorite at court , could not fail to act injuriously upon the young
Welsh	PERSON	- man , possessing as he did all the excitability and instability of the true Celt that he was .

		Jeffreys 's character has been judged by suc - ceeding generations without due reference to the corruption of the age in which he lived , the profligacy of the court which he served , and the faulty and , to us , iniquitous , judicial sys - tem which he was called upon to administer .

		Even
Jeffreys	PERSON	himself and it is a circum - stance worth noting in his favor , though Mr.
Irving	PERSON	makes no mention of it exclaimed , at the trial of the Rev.
Thomas Rosewell	PERSON	, a dis - senting minister , that it was '' a hard case that a man should have a counsel to defend him for a twopenny trespass , and his witnesses exam - ined upon oath ; but if he steal , commit murder or felony , nay , high treason , where life , estate , honour , and all are concerned , he shall neither have counsel nor his witnesses examined upon oath . ''

		To be sure , the abuse and insults heaped upon helpless prisoners by Judge
Jeffreys	PERSON	, from his seat on the bench , pass all limits of moderation and decency ; but he was only adopting the usage of his times .

		Even Sir
Matthew Hale	PERSON	, self-contained and dignified though he was , '' thought nothing of calling a man , whose perjuries had excited his indigna - tion , a * devil . ' ''

		Moreover , it is probable that
Jeffreys	PERSON	, in his character of
Lord Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	, has been handled with somewhat excessive se - verity by historians .

		Lord
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's frequent recourse to what Mr.
Irving	PERSON	calls '' historical inspiration '' is properly censured by him .

		He farther says : '' It is , of course , striking from the point of view of the popular historian to represent
Jeffreys	PERSON	as a youthful Mephistopheles urging poor mortals to damnation by insidious counsels and lying hopes .

		But so much has been done in this way with
Jeffreys	PERSON	that it may be equally interesting to reduce him to his natural propor - tions again .

		And these , physically and morally , are more comely than has been popularly supposed .

		The quotations so far given from his public utterances are quite undeserving of the heated language that has been bestowed indiscriminately on all portions of his career , and hardly justify the historical misrepresentations it has been his privilege to enjoy from the lavish hands of a successor , whose historical injustice has not even that sense of humour which lightens the darkest passages of his predecessor 's misdoing . ''

		Despite a few exhibitions of something ap - proaching to warmth , as in the above , the writer has given us a work moderate in tone and care - fully considered in its views ; and while it can hardly be expected to modify greatly the ac - cepted estimate of Judge
Jeffreys	PERSON	's character , yet it deserves a thoughtful perusal and can not fail to meet with favor from students of English history .

		It certainly strikes a new note in the treatment of its theme , where others have been content to ring the familiar changes on the sub - ject of
Jeffreys	ORGANIZATION	's iniquities .

		Even Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- diner , probably the foremost English historian of the present day , appears not to question the correctness of the accepted opinion in the mat - ter . ''

		It is true , '' he says , '' that the law which he had to administer was cruel , but
Jeffreys	PERSON	gained peculiar obloquy by delighting in its cruelty , and by sneering at its unhappy vic - tims . ''

		Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, in writing of the
State Trials	ORGANIZATION	, says of
Jeffreys	PERSON	, '' He was , I dare say , as bad as he is painted . ''

		It is this unan - imity , on the part of writers treating of that period of English history , in accepting without question the popular estimate of
Jeffreys	PERSON	's de - gree of turpitude for base he certainly was that makes the present study of his career by Mr.
Irving	PERSON	a valuable contribution to history .

		The three portraits in the volume , after Knel - ler 's paintings , show , if at all true to life , that
Jeffreys	PERSON	was , to our surprise , a man of singu - larly handsome and prepossessing appearance .

		THE DIAL 105 students .

		And such an inference might be regarded as strengthened by observing that the Christian Literature Company exists for the purpose of sup - plying a popular demand for reading of this class .

		How this phase of the popular literary taste is to be accounted for , or how it is to be reconciled with seemingly contrary signs of the times , we shall not at present stop to consider .

		The books before us illustrate what seems even more remarkable , namely , the diversity of treat - ment of which ecclesiastical history is capable .

		This is nowhere more apparent than by a comparison of '' The Growth of Christianity '' by Mr.
Crooker	PERSON	with '' The Story of the Christian Church '' by the late Dr.
Crooks	PERSON	.

		It might be supposed from these titles that the two authors were attempting to cover the same historical ground .

		But to Mr.
Crooker	PERSON	, Christianity is merely one of the great religions of the world , perhaps superior in many ways to the others , yet growing out of the historic conditions and unfolding by the same general laws and forces which had operated in the production of Judaism , Islam , and Buddhism .

		It was evolved from the teaching of Jesus of
Nazareth	LOCATION	.

		Tbat teaching has never been understood and has been but partially applied .

		The teacher 's resurrection from the dead is by implication , and his claim to Divinity is ex - pressly denied .

		Hence , Christianity has grown up upon mistakes which were made or deceptions which were practiced in the early ages regarding these two fundamental points .

		But why call it Christianity ?

		To the mind of Dr. Crooks , on the other hand , Christianity was organized in the world , and its organization is the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Church is an ex - ternal , visible body ; a Divine institution , having a Divine Founder , Jesus Christ ; a Divine life , derived from the Holy Spirit ; a Divine body of truth , the Gospel .

		The events related by Dr.
Crooks	PERSON	as per - taining to such an organization are set forth as tend - ing generally to advance the determinate destiny thereof , which is to overspread the world .

		In the period covered by the second volume of Dr.
Dryer	PERSON	's '' History of the Christian Church , '' the difference between his work and that of Dr.
Crooks	PERSON	is chiefly one of style .

		Dr. Crooks is by no means deficient in that regard , though his book is the re - vision and enlargement of lectures delivered by him at
Drew Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, and it is hardly to be expected that a book could be prepared upon the basis of theological lectures that would justify the use of the title '' Story , '' with its popular meaning .

		Dr.
Dryer	PERSON	, however , treats the period he has under review with full regard to its picturesqueness and wealth of dramatic action .

		In this respect his sec - ond volume excels his first , which was reviewed some time ago in these columns .

		The period is one in which the growth of the
Papacy	LOCATION	is the centre of action , and this delicate subject is treated with great fairness .

		The breadth of the author 's reading is shown by the breadth of his treatment ; and his portrayal of the ages of preparation for the modern era is such as to awaken an interest in this subject in a class of readers for whom he writes .

		For this class of readers he has prepared a bibliography of the period that is complete .

		Of an effort to cover the field of ecclesiastical history in monographs upon its chief epochs , we have before us three of ten resulting volumes .

		Others have been already noticed in these columns .

		They all exhibit difficulties in the way of such a treatment of Church history .

		To tell what was required of them , Dr.
Wells	PERSON	and Dr.
Clark	PERSON	have each taken a hundred pages more than any of the earlier writers in the series , and two hundred more than some of them .

		The development of the
Papacy	LOCATION	was the chief characteristic of the Age of
Charle	LOCATION	- magne .

		It is treated by Dr.
Wells	PERSON	less dramatically than by Dr.
Dryer	PERSON	, but with greater attention to detail ; and as a consequence we have a more spe - cific account of the famous forged documents than is to be found elsewhere in books intended for gen - eral reading .

		To the history of the Renascence by Mr.
Paul Van Dyke	PERSON	, the Rev.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	adds an introduction , explaining why the woik was passed over to another after having been assigned to him .

		Had another hundred pages been added to this vol - ume , the reader might have been supplied with more facts regarding the development of
University	ORGANIZATION	life and some references to the artistic revival which was one of the chief features of that period .

		As it is , the book furnishes an outline sketch of the His - tory of the Papacy from the return from
Avignon	LOCATION	to the Sack of
Rome	LOCATION	-LRB- 1377-1527 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's treatment of this period is naturally brought into comparison with that of Dr.
Dryer	PERSON	.

		It has all the dramatic movement of the latter , but Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	appears to have derived his style and choice of terms partly from the journalistic literature of the day , which is not a style suitable for historical literature .

		In the '' Anglican Reformation , '' we find the pur - poses of the entire series of Epoch Histories revealed .

		Wise choice was made of Dr.
Clark	PERSON	for this work .

		His sympathies are well known and are by no means disguised .

		It was necessary , in order to write intel - ligibly of the English Reformation , for him to re - view the entire religious history of
England	LOCATION	; but he has done this so concisely as to retard but little the progress of the work .

		The Anglican Reformation was , on the part of those who participated in the work of bringing it about , the realization of an idea which had always , either explicitly or implicitly , been oper - ative in the history of the English Church and peo - ple .

		For
England	LOCATION	never recognized the right of the Pope to interfere in the government of her
National Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was only conditionally and within cer - tain restrictions that she had even allowed the mem - bers of the Cnurch to carry any appeal to
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The claims of the
Rome	LOCATION	See were hardly heard of anywhere before
the fourth century	DATE	.

		Hence , the state of the British Church that is , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	established in the British Isles probably in the sec - ond or even in the first century , and which had three Bishops at the
Council of Aries A. D.	ORGANIZATION	314 has no relation to the controversies of the Ref orma - 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	tion .

		It was with the introduction of Christianity among the Anglo-Saxons that the influence of the Roman See in
England	LOCATION	began , and that influence increased , hut without at any time absolutely de - priving the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	of its independent existence .

		Naturally one purpose of an Anglican Churchman in writing of the
Anglican Reforma	LOCATION	- tion is to place
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		in his proper relation thereto .

		The character of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	is such as to re - quire an impartial historian to deal with it .

		This Dr.
Clark	PERSON	proves to be . ''

		It is utterly absurd , '' he says , `` to suppose that
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's character reflects any disgrace or discredit upon the principles of the Reformation .

		He had no sympathy whatever with the reformation of doctrine , and though strongly anti-papal from self-interest , in his religious convic - tions -LRB- and we must credit him with having such in accord with the spirit of the age in which he lived -RRB- he was mediaeval and Roman . ''

		But the book sets forth much that is not new by any means , but apt to be overlooked by superficial readers who would dispose of the Anglican Reformation in a sentence or a paragraph , much that is essential to a right understanding of that which is to the Anglo-Saxon race the crowning epoch of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	's history .

		In the History of the
American Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, '' we find an old friend in a new dress .

		The popularity which this work won for itself when it first appeared
eight years ago	DATE	, and which it never lost , is evidenced by the fact that it went through six editions before it yielded to a demand for a revi - sion and an extension in order that it might include events subsequent to the Civil War .

		This popu - larity has been due to the captivating style of Dr.
McConnell	PERSON	.

		It has given to this book the advan - tage over two other histories of the American Epis - copal Church which have appeared since his .

		To be hypercritical , the use of a wrong name in the added chapters of this book may be pointed out , which makes a noted minister of the Episcopal Church Bishop of the Mexican Church , with which he prob - ably has but little sympathy .

		Dr.
McConnell	PERSON	's contribution to our American religious historical literature is the outgrowth of a desire to write a history of
American Christianity	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although there is a book before us bearing that title , it is but a preparatory and suggestive sketch of that subject , and but partially fulfils Dr.
McCon	PERSON	- nell 's purpose .

		Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	was evidently working upon an assignment and under the limitations of a '' space-filler . ''

		To reduce to a volume of 420 octavo pages the history of all the influences of the
Chris	PERSON	- tian religion in its many and varied forms in Amer - ica , is no mean achievement The author pricks an occasional historical bubble , and puts his finger upon some weak spots in our religious systems ; but he is generally free from the expression of prejudices , and of all the books before us this is the one that breaks up ground wholly new .

		It is a useful and suggestive book , deserving of wide reading .

		KIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Lord
Charles Beresford	PERSON	and Mr.
H. W. Wilson	PERSON	, both authorities on naval topics , have jointly written a spirited popular account of ''
Nelson	PERSON	and his Times '' -LRB-
E. & J. B. Young & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , that forms , all in all , the best and freshest as well as the most out - wardly attractive contribution to the literature of the Nelson revival , now ebbing , that has come to our notice .

		The volume is a spacious quarto , of lavish pictorial attractions , including a highly colored frontispiece showing , according to the artist 's fancy , the great admiral landing at
Copenhagen	LOCATION	.

		The plates , we are glad to say , serve for the most part the end of instruction rather than mere embellish - ment .

		They have been selected and annotated by Mr.
Edward H. Fitchew	PERSON	, and form a useful and suggestive pictorial commentary on the text .

		The caricaturists , among them
Gillray	PERSON	and
Rowlandson	PERSON	, have been freely drawn on , and the profusion of portraits and cuts of Nelsonian relics serve to lend the work the character of a memorial volume .

		The cover design , exhibiting a female figure with wings and a halo , and apparently pitching a laurel wreath like a quoit at the head of the unconscious admiral below , is scarcely happy ; but the material ensemble is pleasing on the whole , and the pictures are hand - somely reproduced .

		As to the raison d'etre of the work , the authors disclaim any intention of compet - ing with the masterly and philosophical volumes of Captain
Mahan	PERSON	recently published .

		They have written for the masses of their countrymen , to whom those volumes are largely inaccessible , '' for the millions of the great British democracy for whose prosperity and freedom , as for that of generations yet unborn ,
Nelson	PERSON	fought and died . ''

		The book has by no means , however , the flimsy and superfi - cial character which too often impairs or even de - stroys the usefulness of designedly popular histor - ical biographies .

		It is critical in spirit where criticism is called for ; and the writers , while paint - ing their hero in the glowing colors of patriotism and British pride in British achievement , have not failed to point out wherein and in what degree he showed himself fallible , nay , frail .

		The Lady
Hamilton	PERSON	episode is treated tactfully yet candidly , and the reader is finally adjured to forget the mis - takes and follies of the great seaman 's career , '' in the unbounded admiration , respect , and affection which are due to his glorious deeds . ''

		But the inci - dent nevertheless lends its inevitable touch of bathos to every frankly-told tale of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		Poster - ity , glorying in
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's priceless services and almost peerless valor , must be made to marvel at the sailor-like facility with which he walked into the net so openly spread for him by this coarse Delilah , who , whatever she may have been in her youth when
Romney	PERSON	painted her , was grown latterly , when
Nelson	PERSON	met her at
Naples	LOCATION	, a somewhat gross and bovine creature with '' charms '' suggestive of the

		THE DIAL 107 sirens of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	or Wapping .

		But how great
Nelson	PERSON	was , in plan as in action , professionally viewed !

		Perhaps his distinguishing trait as a sea - man was the swift judgment or prescience which enabled him on occasion when a subordinate to break or reverse the letter of a command in order to carry out more surely and fully its spirit conduct bril - liantly justified at
St. Vincent	LOCATION	and
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, but certainly not to be recommended to the service as a precedent .

		Nelson fought for victory and not for prize-money .

		Sir
Charles Beresford	PERSON	remarks : `` If he had devoted the same energy and forethought to acquiring prize-money as he did to destroying his country 's enemies , he would have become a million - aire . ''

		For popular reading there is no better book on
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	than this .

		From '' middy '' to admiral .

		Rear-Admiral Sir
Victor A. Mon	PERSON	- tague , a fine old sea-dog of a breed now vanishing , who retired from the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	in
1886	DATE	, has written from a rather retentive memory a lively account of his career as a '' midshipmite , '' entitled '' A Middy 's Recollec - tions '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Sir
Victor	PERSON	joined the
navy	ORGANIZATION	in
1853	DATE	, and his narrative takes us down to
1860	DATE	.

		His first ship -LRB- not technically -RRB- was the '' Princess Royal '' ; and his trials aboard this fine 91-gunner recall
Smollett	PERSON	.

		The fare was execrable , and one wonders how anybody could be expected to do any fighting on it .

		A day 's rations comprised '' a pound of very bad salt junk -LRB- beef -RRB- , or of pork as salt as Mrs. Lot , detestable tea , sugar to match , and a bis - cuit that was generally full of weevils , or well over - run by rats , or -LRB- in the hot climates -RRB- a choice retreat for the detestable cockroach . ''

		Thus did thrifty old
England	LOCATION	feed the chosen heroes of her national song and story the '' Hearts of Oak '' who manned her '' Wooden Walls '' !

		No wonder that ''
Jack	PERSON	'' ran a-muck of the proprieties when he got ashore with money in his pocket .

		On the '' Princess Royal '' Sir
Victor	PERSON	was of course dreadfully hoaxed and bullied by his salter messmates .

		But your young Briton , '' middy '' or public-school boy , submits to bullying as naturally as he resorts to it when his own turn comes .

		It is part of a system supposed to foster the sterner virtues ; and the old adage -LRB- pleasantly con - troverted by Lamb -RRB- that `` A bully is always a coward '' does not apply to
Young England	LOCATION	.

		Of actual sea-fighting there is not much recorded in Admiral
Montague	PERSON	's book , which is mainly a personal record , off-hand in style , though graphic and well - written .

		We should very much like to see a similar record from the hand , say , of our own Captain ''
Bob '' Evans	PERSON	, who has recently shown , to the admiration of the English press , that he can write almost as well as he can fight .

		Admiral
Montague	PERSON	saw some pretty exciting brushes , however , in the
Crimea	LOCATION	, in
China	LOCATION	, and during the Mutiny .

		But his naval pas - sages seem mere pop-gun work beside the recent terrible and dramatic doings at
Manila	LOCATION	and off
Santiago	LOCATION	.

		The book is neatly made and contains several plates , among them a brace of portraits of the author , the one showing him as a trim midship - man of fifteen , the other as an admiral of fifty or thereabouts , looking as taut as a backstay and as '' salt '' as Captain Cuttle .

		Though eminently fortunate in his dramas , Mr.
Wills	PERSON	, it is said , would have given all his dra - matic laurels for one success in painting or in that form of it which he elected .

		As an artist in pastel , he was successful , to the point of popularity and even to that of royal favor ; but in oil-painting , which he believed to be his gift and his ultimate career , he achieved nothing . ''

		I am , '' he said once , '' a poor painter who writes plays for bread '' ; yet it was by his plays alone that he attained distinction , though this will hardly reach the point of justify - ing the claim made for him by his biographer , Mr.
Freeman Wills	PERSON	, of the place of '' poetic dramatist of the Victorian era . ''

		He was the first among modern English playwrights to make familiar and popular such poetic work as his ''
Charles I.	PERSON	'' and ''
Olivia	LOCATION	'' ; and it was because of his genius for such work that he was commissioned by Mr.
Irving	PERSON	to write the memorable ''
Lyceum	PERSON	'
Faust	PERSON	' '' an adaptation which was awaited with much eagerness , received much praise and blame , and has been acted , we are told , a greater number of times than any modern drama .

		Here and there in the book is given without especial awkwardness some noteworthy opinion of his plays , the most interesting being a criticism , by
George Henry Lewes	PERSON	, upon '' The Man i ' Airlie '' '' a tragedy , '' the critic said , '' of which a great poet might be proud . ''

		The biographer , though admirably candid , is at times diffuse and at times sentimental ; however , he has written a readable book , dealing with subjects unhackneyed in the literary world , and showing the dramatist and painter as a very fine and lovable personality .

		Mr.

G. W. E. Russell	PERSON	.

		The book is a delightful one as good as
Greville	LOCATION	or
Lenox	LOCATION	; and if there be a dull page we have certainly failed to hit it .

		Its contents are as multifarious as rich .

		The author 's jottings range over a space of seventy-five years , and consist partly of traditions and anecdotes gath - ered from people and books , partly of matter of personal recollection .

		There is a pleasant leaven throughout of the shrewd , gently cynical philosophy of a good-tempered and still nnjaded man of the world .

Biglow Papers	ORGANIZATION	, ' I did not know their distinguished author even by sight ; and I was intensely amused by the air of easy mastery , the calm and almost fatherly patronage , with which this cultivated American overrode the indignant show-woman ; pointed out for the general benefit of the admiring tourists the gaps and lapses in her artistic , architectural , and archaeological knowledge ; and made mnllion and portcullis and armor and tapestry the pegs for a series of neat discourses on mediaeval history , do - mestic decoration , and the science of fortification . ''

		The writer goes on to say that in later years he found that his oppressively well-informed volunteer cicerone of
Durham Castle	LOCATION	, '' though an accom - plished politician , a brilliant writer , and an admir - able after-dinner speaker , was , conversationally considered , an inaccurate man with an accurate manner '' which is a rather neat characterization , whatever one may think of its accuracy in the par - ticular case .

		A good thing is recorded of Welling - ton .

		Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	once requested permission to dedicate a song to him , whereupon the alarmed war - rior refused , pleading that he had been obliged to make it a rule to decline all dedications , '' because , in his situation as Chancellor of
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	, he had been much exposed to authors '' Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- sell 's book -LRB- if his it be -RRB- is one of the freshest and raciest of its kind .

		tm Arktauaw The latest example of the current u the Rockut vogue of Western history is furnished by the new series of '' American Ex - plorers , '' edited by Dr.
Elliott Coues	PERSON	and published by Mr.
Francis P. Harper	PERSON	, of which No. 1 is entitled , for short , '' The Journal of
Jacob Fowler	PERSON	. ''

		It nar - rates an adventure , in 1821-22 , from Arkansaw through the Indian Territory ,
Oklahoma	LOCATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	,
Colorado	LOCATION	, and
New Mexico	LOCATION	, to the sources of
Rio Grande del Norte	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor , in his too short introduction , tells us who Major
Fowler	PERSON	was , and recites the history of his manuscript , which he entitled '' Merorandom of the Voige by land from fort
Smith	PERSON	to the
Rockey Mountains	LOCATION	. ''

		On this point it suffices to say that it belongs to the rich store of Americana collected by Col. II .


T. Durrett	PERSON	of
Louisville	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, the accomplished president of the
Filson Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Major
Fowler	PERSON	, born in
New York	LOCATION	in
1765	DATE	, came to
Kentucky	LOCATION	in early life to carry on the profession of a surveyor , and made his home in the neighborhood of
Covington	LOCATION	.

		His reputation was that of an accomplished surveyor , and he did much work in this line for the national government . ''

		His surveying , '' says Colonel
Durrett	PERSON	, '' extended to the great plains and mountains of the far west , before civilization had reached those distant wilds .

		He was there when wild animals and wilder sav - ages were the only tenants of the wilderness . ''

		The editor points out the Major 's place in the history of the exploration of the vast region extending from the
Missouri	LOCATION	to the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	.

		Wherever other American trappers and traders may have gone on the
Arkansas	LOCATION	, or even the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	, in those days ,
Fowler	PERSON	was the first to forge another sound link in the chain which already reached from Pike to Long . ''

		This he did just before the
Sante FY Trail	ORGANIZATION	became plainly marked , both on the face of the country and in
Southwestern	LOCATION	history .

		The book has a certain pedagogical value , as it shows that a man grossly ignorant of the language-arts can be a man of sound faculties and great practical talents .

		The poor character of
Fowler	PERSON	's literary education is shown by every sentence in the book .

		If Dr.
Coues	PERSON	had added to his introduction two or three pages more , stating what was
Fowler	PERSON	's equipment for his '' voige , '' and what was his object in making it , he would have done the reader a service , not leaving him to infer those things from the narrative itself .

		The editing and the mechanical execution of the volume are those with which the reader of the ex - cellent ''
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, '' ''
Pike	PERSON	, '' and
Henry	PERSON	and
Thompson	PERSON	'' volumes is already familiar .

		Tto legendary '' Hamlet in
Iceland	LOCATION	'' is the attrac - n.imiet of tive title of a work prepared by the the
Noremm	ORGANIZATION	.

		, , industrious scholarship of Mr.
Israel Gollancz	PERSON	, and published by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	as
Volume III	ORGANIZATION	.

		of the '' Northern Library . ''

		The two preceding volumes of the series are Mr.
Sephton	PERSON	's translation of '' The Saga of King
Olaf Tryggwa	PERSON	* en '' and Professor
York Powell	PERSON	's translation of '' The Tale of Thrond of Gate . ''

		All Shakespearian stu - dents know that the Hamlet story is to be found in the twelfth-century chronicle of the Danish his - torian
Saxo Grammaticus	PERSON	, but few are aware that even in
Saxo	LOCATION	's time Hamlet had for centuries been a legendary hero of the Norsemen .

		The first trace of the name that we have come upon is preserved in a fragment of verse quoted by
Snorri	ORGANIZATION	, and attributed to one
Snaebjflrn	PERSON	, who lived in the tenth century .

		Even in
Saxo	LOCATION	's time , a considerable mans of legend had grown up about the name of
Hamlet	LOCATION	, although nothing of this intervening literature has been pre - served .

		Saxo took up this material , and embodied it , with accretions from his readings in
Livy	LOCATION	, in the story with which all students of Shakespeare 's '' Hamlet '' are familiar .

		But in some lens sophis - ticated form the legend probably survived in the Icelandic consciousness down through the Middle Ages , for the seventeenth - century historian Tor - faeus , in his '' Series
Regum Danisa	PERSON	, '' wrote of it as follows : '' As regards
Sazos Amlethun	PERSON	, as a boy at home in
Iceland	LOCATION	I frequently heard the story of Amlode told by wretched old crones , but I regarded it as merely an old wives ' tale ; later on , however , when I came across Saxo 's noble account of the hero , I abandoned my boyish notion , and thence - forth left my friends no peace , but worried them to
1896	DATE	. -RSB-

		109 find out for me the old story I had once heard , yet without success .

		At last , a few years ago , they sent me a story of Aralode , but no sooner had I perused it than I cast it aside , as altogether worthless and quite modern .

		It actually makes Hamlet not a Dane but a Spaniard !

		It must have been composed after the time of the Scythian Tamberlaine , for some of the details are certainly derived from this history . ''

		The manuscript of which Torfaeus thus slightingly speaks is preserved in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, and is substan - tially identical with the '' Ambales Saga '' of which text and translation form the principal contents of the volume now before us .

		This work , dated circa
1600	DATE	is of great interest , and we are glad to have it printed , as it now is , together with extracts from a number of ballad-cycles and rhyming versions obviously based upon it .

		Mr.
Gollancz	PERSON	has done his editorial work very thoroughly , providing not only a lengthy and learned introduction , but also a mass of illustrative matter , such as the rhymed passages already mentioned , selections from several allied sagas , from Saxo in both Latin and Low German , and from the modern Icelandic translation of the Hamlet '' according to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		In '' The Evolution of the College Student '' -LRB- Cro - well -RRB- , a booklet by President
William DeWitt Hyde	PERSON	, we have '' no dry essay or discussion of abstract princi - ples , but a study in the form of imaginative letters pass - ing between a living college student and his family and friends .

		The hero ,
Clarence Mansfield	PERSON	, opens his heart to his father and mother , and his friend and sweetheart
Helen	PERSON	, at
Willoughby College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Religious life at college , literary studies , thoughtless pranks , athletics , philos - ophy , college settlements , choice of a profession , the relations of labor and capital , are the topics that the young man discusses from the varying standpoint of his onward growth . ''

Gorg Moritz Ebers	PERSON	, Egyptologist and writer of his - torical romance , died at his home near
Munich	LOCATION	on the eighth of this month , at the age of sixty-one .

		Born at
Berlin	LOCATION	,
March 1 , 1837	DATE	, the son of a banker , who died before the child saw the light , he was educated at first by his mother , and afterwards studied at
Gottingen	LOCATION	.

		He at first took up jurisprudence , but oriental studies soon claimed his attention , and , following
Lepsins	PERSON	and
Brngsch	PERSON	, he devoted himself to the history of ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	In
1865	DATE	he became a decent at
Jena	PERSON	, and in
1870	DATE	was called to a professorship at
Leipzig	LOCATION	, a post which he held until
1889	DATE	.

		A paralytic stroke in
1876	DATE	turned him from the more strenuous work of scholar - ship into the path of a writer of historical fiction , in which he had won fame as early as
1864	DATE	with ''
Eine Aegyptische Koenigstochter	PERSON	, '' which remains almost , if not quite , the best of his many novels .

		Other works of this class were '' Uarda , '' ''
Homo Sum	PERSON	, '' Die
Schwes	PERSON	- tern , '' Der
Kaiser	PERSON	, '' Serapis , '' Kleopatra , '' Die Xilbraut , '' Per Aspera , '' '' Die Gred : Roman aus dem

		His works of scholarship include the discovery and editing of the '' Papyrus E , '' Aegypten in
Wort	LOCATION	und Bild , ''
Durch Gosen	PERSON	und Sinai , '' and '' Palastina in
Wort	LOCATION	und Bild . ''

		His historical novels have been very popular , although they never succeeded in produc - ing a really vital reconstruction of the life and civiliza - tion with which they were concerned .

		The author 's powers of characterization were defective , and his ro - mances were unduly weighed down by their wealth of historical and archological detail .

CO UNT TOLSTO Y	ORGANIZATION	.

		We shall come , early in the present month , to the seventieth birthday of the great Kassiau whose name stands at the head of this article , and whose preeminence among the writers of his country now living is indisputable .

		More than this , we may say that his name could not fairly be omitted from a list of the half dozen greatest writers now living anywhere in the world .

		The other names in such a list would perhaps be those of
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Bjorn	PERSON	- son ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and
Carducci	PERSON	.

		Other names might possibly be substituted , with good reason , for one or two of these ; but , however such a list were constituted , it would illustrate in a strik - ing manner the shifting of the centre of intel - lectual gravity from the South to the North , from the Latin races to those of Teutonic and Slavonic origin .

		When Hugo and Renan were living , to name no others , the balance was more evenly held ; but now the great Italian poet alone stands in anything like the first rank , having for his peer no other Italian , no Span - iard , and even no Frenchman .

		Returning , after this brief digression , to our main subject , we feel bound to emphasize the opinion , often expressed in these pages , that Russian literature is adorned by one artistic personality even more important than that of
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the work of Tourguenieff the art of fiction seems to have made its longest reach towards absolute supremacy of achieve - ment .

		There is something almost despairing in the perfection , the finality , the triumph of the man who created * Spring Floods '' and '' On the Eve . ''

		From the structural point of view , the best work of
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, rich as it is in experience , in sympathy , in psycholog - ical truth and noble idealism , seems rude in comparison with those masterpieces .

		The gen - erous dying message of the elder novelist , en - joining the '' great writer of our Russian land '' to return to his literary labors , must not blind us to the fact that an even greater writer sent the message as he neared the close of his own career .

		As all the world knows , the plea was unheeded by its recipient ; for the same year -LRB- 1877 -RRB- had marked the completion of both Tourguenieff 's '' Virgin Soil '' and Count Tolstoy 's ''
Anna Karenina	PERSON	, '' that is , of the last significant 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, artistic production of each of the two great writers concerned .

		The younger man refused to carry on the torch that was offered to his hand , seeking instead lights that seemed to him more trustworthy , but that were destined to lead his steps far astray into the morasses of mysticism .

		We trust that this expression may not seem too harsh to those of his disciples whose lives have been lifted to a higher ethical plane by the example of his great renunciation ; but we believe that art , with its implicit teach - ing , acts more effectively upon conduct , in the long run , than do any of the devices of formal didacticism .

		Discerning readers of ``
Anna Kaienina	PERSON	'' could hardly escape the signs of a crisis in the life of its author .

		While a very deep sort of penetrative insight was displayed in the delin - eation of most of the characters of the novel , that of
Levine	PERSON	the most important ethically , although not the most brilliant seemed to exhibit a more complete sincerity than the others ; and it was evident that the story of his restlessness , his perplexity , and his provisional solution of the difficult problem of existence , must be taken in some sense as the author 's own spiritual autobiography .


Levine	PERSON	's last words are extremely significant . ''

		I shall probably continue to get out of temper with my coachman , to go into useless arguments , to air my ideas unseasonably .

		I shall always feel a barrier be - tween the sanctuary of my soul and the soul of other people , even that of my wife ; I shall always be holding her responsible for my annoyances , and feeling sorry for it directly afterwards .

		I shall continue to pray without being able to explain to myself why I pray ; but my inner life has won its liberty ; it will no longer be at the mercy of events , and every minute of my existence will have a meaning sure and profound which it will be in my power to impress on every single one of my ac - tions , that of being good . ''

		In giving these words to the character whose inner life most clearly reflected his own , the author made only too evident the preoccupations that were even then absorbing the greater share of his intellectual energies , and it was as a natural consequence of this state of mind that he set about the production of that remarkable series of religious writings studies in applied socialism and simplified Christianity that have been put forth during the past score of years , and have attracted a wider , if less dis - criminating , attention than was ever at the command of his books that really belonged to literature .

		It was at the same age , and under similar conditions of mental and emotional stress , that the greatest of living Englishmen turned his back upon a brilliant past , and determined henceforth to devote himself to the preaching of ethical truth , and the betterment , by effective practical example , of his fellow-men .

		In the case of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, as in that of
Count Tolstoy	LOCATION	, there was the same fervor of conviction , the same prophetic fire , the same iconoclastic zeal , and , we are regretfully constrained to add , the same essential futility of the means by which the regeneration of society was to be accom - plished .

		Neither the road-making of the one nor the shoe-cobbling of the other could cause more than a ripple upon the social waters that needed to be so deeply stirred , and in both cases there was inculcated the false notion that because the simplest things are worth doing well the rarest powers of genius are best em - ployed in showing how these simple things should be done .

		It is the earlier and not the later work of both men that will have the saner and more enduring influence , because , while no less fine in spirit than the later work , it is also done upon the terms of art and is allied with the everlasting power of beauty .

		There is , indeed , something almost blasphemous in the words with which both these men speak of the great work of their earlier life , in the lan - guage with which Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	scornfully char - acterizes as '' fine writing '' those pages of his own that first gave to so many readers the vis - ion of the world of natural beauty , in the vehe - mence with which Count Tolstoy , in the very latest of his books , rejects the ministry of the divinest forms of art that the ages have be - queathed to us .

		But , in spite of himself , and in spite of his own condemnation of the work done by him in the days that he now looks back upon as mi re - generate ,
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	has won a high place among the great writers of the nineteenth cen - tury , and won it by that work which now , en - gaged as he is in a futile religious and social propaganda , seems to his perverted vision so comparatively unimportant .

		When his living personality shall have passed from the view of men , when his tracts and his parables and his religious polemics shall have taken their place in the intellectual lumber-room which contains the vagaries of great souls gone astray , when his autobiographical writings shall be valued only as curious revelations of a mind out of joint , he will be remembered and admired and extolled as the author of '' War and Peace , ** that epic of the Russian people in the most tragic hour of its consciousness ; of ''
Anna Kardnina	PERSON	, '' that sincere and poignant portrayal 1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 123 of a group of intensely human souls ; by the slighter and earlier sketches of the Crimean War and the Cossacks and the
Caucasus	LOCATION	that exhibit in some respects a finer art than the two colossal productions by which he is best known .

		Recognition of the defects of these works will , in the long run , be fairly balanced by recognition of their power and their insight , and upon the world-wide fame that they have won during the last ten or twelve years will be set the seal of the approving judgment of posterity .

		Men will smile at the color-blindness of his sesthetic writings , and at the pathetic lack of the historical sense so characteristic of his social and religious philosophy , but they will have only respect and wonder for his achievements during the years before he set about the hopeless task of reforming the world .

		Even in the least permanently valuable work of so masterful a spirit there is , however , matter for reflection ; and a uniform English edition , by competent translators , of the entire writings of Count Tolstoy , would be a desirable under - taking for some enterprising publisher .

		Al - though most of his books have been put into English , the translations make a heterogeneous collection , both in appearance and efficiency ; their mechanical form at present too often arouses distaste , and their execution as trans - lations too often excites the suspicion that ideas have been inaccurately reproduced or omitted altogether .

		It would be very fortunate if the complete works of Count Tolstoy were made accessible in an English form above reproach as to their external parts , and deserving of full confidence as to their translation .

		TIME-GUAGE IN LETTERS .

		Homer 's
Chapman	PERSON	-LRB- to reverse the phrase of Keats -RRB- takes occasion , at the close of the Twelfth Book of the Odyssey , to remark , in the tongue most familiar to him , Opus novem dierum .

		This comment we are to understand as a mild and justifiable boast of good work done quickly .

		The Elizabethan period , to which the author just cited belonged , has long been accepted as the epoch of greatest mental activity known to English literature .

		Yet throughout that period , the affectation on the part of writers -LRB- if affectation there were -RRB- was that of inspiration rather than of plodding as though their motto had been
Currente Calamo	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of course , to primitive people there is something fascinating in the very fact of improvisation ; to them , in every man of genius not only is there an eye in a fine frenzy rolling , but the genius , to be consistent , must be instantaneously , rather than laboriously , creative .

		Even in the early part of the present century , it was the effort of the approving biographer to maintain that what his subject did he not only did well but did rapidly .

		Bis dat qui cito dat was then a motto of universal acceptance .

		O'ConnelPs definition of oratory , as the faculty of thinking on one 's legs , is in the same vein .

		This cultus of the off-hand and inspirational naturally had its dissenters ; hard-headed , practical observers , who with half-closed eyes would remind the tyro that there is '' no excellence without great labor , '' or , more briefly still , that '' easy writing is d d hard reading . ''

		Still , youthful enthusiasm , even in a biographer , was not to be denied ; and the minds of our ancestors were fed with tales of how
Lope de Vega	PERSON	wrote one of his thousand plays in a single forenoon , and was found watering his flowers at
midday	TIME	, declaring that this last exertion had tired him considerably !

		In earlier days , swift workmanship was part and parcel of the poet 's equipment .

		Hence we are gravely told , on the highest authority , that
Byron	PERSON	wrote '' The Corsair '' at ten sittings , the entire time scarce occupying three weeks .

		Of like marvellous celerity was the writing of '' The Siege of
Corinth	LOCATION	, '' achieved while dressing for a ball .

		Of '' The Bride of
Abydos	LOCATION	, '' disinterested biographers declared that the poet wrote it in a single night , without once mending his pen ; and , in proof thereof , that same un-mended pen was placed on exhibition in a glass case , among other curios !

		Macaulay , to whom we are indebted for these instances , goes on to remark that swiftness of execution , while it by no means furnishes an excuse for that which is done badly , does certainly give an added interest to a master - piece .

		When men attain notoriety , the public rushes to confirm that notoriety .

		Tales of the marvellous in illustration of the favorite 's prowess pour in from every source ; some from pure love of the subject , but most from absolute love of the marvellous for its own sake .

		Byron is only one of numerous instances in which the assumption of a miraculous gift of speed was used to quicken interest in an author 's work .

		In
France	LOCATION	the same influence was at work at the same period , and it probably reached its acme in the stories of the wonderful fecundity of
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Dumas	PERSON	.

		Not until suit was brought against the author of u Monte Cristo '' by various real or pretended collaborators , did the public awake to the fact of
Dumas	PERSON	's composite authorship .

		It then became notorious that he kept a corps of authors to work out his ideas .

		Thus , the author gained in rep - utation for astuteness , for business sagacity but the marvel was no more .

		This fad of superhuman velocity has had its reac - tion .

		Now-a-days , almost all interviews with cele - brated authors chronicle the fact that their subjects are hard-working men !

		In dealing with the latest production of that most sensational and voluminous of our authors , Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, publishers and 124 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, reviewers proclaimed not only the years of labor which the work had consumed , bat the fact that before being committed to the press the author had wholly rewritten the book , with painstaking correc - tions and amendments .

		Had the fashion of
Byron	PERSON	's day still prevailed , Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	is just the man to have written the whole of it , under oath , in forty - eight hoars !

		The prefaces of works published half a century ago almost always referred to the difficulties en - countered in their production by the author .

		Other avocations , political necessity , and even bereave - ment , were frequently cited as compelling a brief desultory period of industry , as when
Arthur	PERSON	apologizes for his '' Successful Merchant , '' its short - comings , even its etiology , by affirming a season of '' long involuntary leisure . ''

		When
Thomas Moore	PERSON	, in his preface to ''
Lalla Rookh	PERSON	, '' observed that in justice to his own industry he felt obliged to men - tion the long and laborious reading he undertook to secure the necessary local color , the critics con - temptuously remarked that the poet had better keep such details to himself !

		Nowadays , the author 's preface will usually give assurance of conscientious toil in which no pains have been neglected to achieve the requisite accuracy and finish .

		The minutiae of the workshop are unflinchingly set forth in maga - zines , of ton accompanied by pictures wherein the au - thors are represented as hard at work : Mr.
Howells	PERSON	glued to a desk driving his pen with great redund - ancy of cuff ; Mr.
Barry	PERSON	, in brown study , stands with his hands in his pockets ; while Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	stares superciliously at us through the largest spec - tacles that ever ornamented presbyopic genius .

		The author of former days said , in effect : '' Look at me .

		I pour forth my rhapsodies , from pure inspiration .

		And this is genius . ''

		The author of the present day seems to say -LRB- with an eye on the other -RRB- : '' Look at me .

		I pretend to no unusual powers .

		To me , as to
Lord Bacon	LOCATION	, Genius is pa - tience ; or , as another has put it , the art of taking pains . ''

		Of these two extreme methods as regulated by the time-gauge , one is the affectation of aristoc - racy in letters ; the other is the claim of affiliation with the proletarian order .

		Fortunately , we are not compelled to the adoption of either method ; but if we were , our choice would light upon the man who trusts to results , does not make us partners of his toil by a wearisome recital of past labors .

		The '' get-there stroke '' of a winning though much de - rided crew suffices , be the time long or short .

		A student displayed a thesis he had just finished , observing , '' That ought to be good , for it cost me trouble enough ! ''

		Does not the remark embody the sentiment of those who would apotheosize literary toil for its own sake ?

		A further instance : An emi - nent scientific man ,
Marshall Hall	PERSON	, who enriched the world of physics by the notable discovery of reflex action , did what he could to destroy some of the fine dramatic effect of his work ; for when he fell beneath the blandishments of the interviewer , at last , he stated numerically the exact number of hours consumed in this discovery .

		Captain
Barclay	PERSON	, who walked one thousand miles in one thousand hours , thereby striding into immortality , did a less ignominious thing than did our scientist , when he invented against time .

		The powers that come direct from
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, and cost us nothing , are alluded to as `` gifts . ''

		The word is a favorite one with
Natty Bumpo	PERSON	, and -LRB- to bring together extremes -RRB- we may also recall that the great British orator ,
Edmund Burke	PERSON	, when he wishes to offer the highest praise of chivalry , speaks of its possession as the '' nnbonght grace of life . ''

		Is it from a commercial sense of equivalents that our eulogists of labor value a work for what it has cost in effort ?

		But why should we rate the gifts of the gods as negotiable treasure ?

		CAPRICE OF THE MUSES .

		Of old the Muses sat on high , And beard and judged the songs of men ; On one they smiled , who loitered by : Of toiling ten , they slighted ten . ''

		They lightly serve who serve us best , Nor know they how the task was done ; We Muses love a soul at rest , But violence and toil we shun . ''

		If men say true , the Muses now Have changed their ancient habitude , And would be served with knitted brow , And stress and toil each day renewed .

		So each one with the other vies , Of those who weave romance or song : '' On us , O Muse , bestow the prize , For we have striven well and long ! ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I beg leave to acknowledge the receipt , through your kindness , of the new battle-song by Mr. .

		Mr.
Willcox	PERSON	's production , though not perhaps of a sort to greatly up - lift the soul , or to send a man rejoicing to the cannon 's mouth , is still fairly well rhymed and tuneful ; and I shall certainly sing it myself and recommend it to my friends .

		But I do not think it forms in itself a suffi - cient answer to the charge that the pott * of
America	LOCATION	did not rise to the occasion furnished by the late war .

		Some sparks of true lyric fire struck from the soul , say , of

		THE DIAL 125 Mr.

		Certainly had Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	been with us such deeds as
Hobson	PERSON	's would not have gone unsung .

		It is argued that the war with
Spain	LOCATION	was not , like our Civil War , one sanctified by principle , but that it was a mere fight -LRB- dare I say '' scrap '' ? -RRB-

		forced on the government by a morbid pop - ular craving for excitement ; and that therefore our poets were not likely to find much inspiration in it .

		But the plea is hardly a valid one .

		Whatever one may think of the war with
Spain	LOCATION	in its origin , or as a whole , it undeniably had its episodes of heroism as fine as ever fired the soul of bard .

		Even Professor
Norton	PERSON	must have felt at times like '' dropping into poetry . ''

		Then turn to the Crimean War one which few humane and intelligent Englishmen favored at the time , and which no Englishman not a Jingo and a rabid Russophobe pre - tends to justify now .

		It was certainly not a war '' sanc - tified by principle '' ; but it evoked the `` Charge of the Light Brigade . ''

		In reply to the statement in the press cutting you send me , that I either do not '' read the newspapers '' or else have '' set my poetry-gauge too high , '' permit me to say that I do , of sad necessity , read -LRB- or skim -RRB- the newspapers regularly cords of them ; and it was in the course of this pursuit that I was struck by the fact deplored in my first letter .

		As to '' setting my poetry-gauge too high '' for the occasion , I may safely leave that question to readers of THE DIAL .

		At all events , if the late war evoked one poem as good , or half as good , as ''

		It was with surprise as well as indignation that I read in your valued journal of last issue the querulous com - plaint of a correspondent who signs himself ''

		THE FOREIGN-LANGUAGE SCHOOL IN
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have already referred in your columns to the estab - lishment of a Foreign Language School in
Tokyo	LOCATION	for the purpose of advancing post-graduate study in certain foreign languages .

		The first year 's work of this insti - tution has been very successful ; and the prospects for its second year are most encouraging .

		Instruction has been given in seven foreign languages English , French , German , Russian , Spanish , Chinese , and Korean .

		Each of these languages has not only a capable Japanese teacher of translation and grammar , but also a native teacher of conversation and composition .

		The director of this school is
Naibu Kanda	PERSON	, a graduate of
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	in the class of '78 and now a prominent educator of this Empire .

		The principal Japanese teacher of English is
Eiji Asada	PERSON	, who is a graduate of the Northwestern Uni - versity -LRB- ' 91 -RRB- , and also has the honor of having received the first degree -LRB- Ph.D. -RRB- granted by the -LRB- new -RRB-
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the other Japanese teachers are as well qualified as these two , the school is well equipped .

		I am informed that the faculty meetings of this school are very interesting , not only because they are cosmo - politan but also because they are rather Babel-like .

		The German understands no language except his own ; the Korean is in the same condition ; the Chinese under - stands only English , and the Frenchman only German ; the Englishman understands French and a little German ; the Spaniard understands French and English ; while the Russian , the best scholar of all , understands French , German , and a little English .

		Each Japanese teacher generally understands only the one language which he is teaching .

		Hence , there is no common language , although French is said to be the most widely under - stood , with English and German next .

		An interesting story is told of the call which the director of this school made upon the German imme - diately after the arrival of the latter in
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Kanda	PERSON	could not use German , and tried both English and French in vain , but finally managed to make some communication by writing Latin !

		This foreign
Language School	ORGANIZATION	is organically con - nected with the
Higher Commercial School	ORGANIZATION	, which also boasts a very flourishing English-speaking Society .

		The annual exhibition of this society has just been held , and passed off very successfully .

		The native pupils ren - dered popular English songs , even negro melodies ; gave recitations from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Dickens	LOCATION	, Hood ,
Long	LOCATION	- fellow ,
Webater	PERSON	, and
Mark Twain	PERSON	; with an original debate in English , which was especially good .

		These things serve to illustrate the remarkable progress that has been made in a nation which fifty years ago was closed to the rest of the world .

		126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, -LRB- The ftcto GENERAL , MILES ix
EUROPE	LOCATION	.

		* In the
summer of 1897	DATE	, as will be remem - bered , General
Nelson A. Miles	PERSON	, the
Alcibiades	LOCATION	and Cominander-in-Chief of our now victorious army , went abroad in a semi-official way mainly with the purpose of observing the
Greco	PERSON	- Turkish war then in progress .

		The war ending shortly , he was called to
London	LOCATION	to represent us at the Queen 's Jubilee , whence he crossed over again to the Continent to attend the autumn military mano3vres .

		We were all pleased at the time over General M lies ' s appointments , for we felt that he was precisely the man who would appear well where appearances count for so much , and we reflected with secret satisfaction that no matter how gorgeous the '' function '' or how fine the assemblage at which he might be officially called upon to assist , his figure and equipment could not fail to win the approval of the critical .

		It is gratifying to learn now , from his lively and entertaining book , ''
Military Europe	LOCATION	, '' that the General not only had a pleas - ant and profitable time while abroad , but also that he was received in high places everywhere with the consideration due to his exterior and credentials .

		The question , however , here naturally arises whether , in case General Miles should revisit
Europe	LOCATION	officially in the near future , the '' con - sideration '' with which he was received last
summer	DATE	would not ripen into something a good deal more effusive , now that this country has shown that it can fight as well as trade , and has thereby signally upset a once current theory that , in the kind words of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	,
America	LOCATION	was a mere '' big , fat republic '' wallowing in dollars , and as easy a prey as
China	LOCATION	to the first European power -LRB-
Spain	LOCATION	not excepted -RRB- that might see fit to attack it .

		To the friend of true progress it is saddening to note the signs -LRB- man - ifest , for instance , in the changed status of
Japan	LOCATION	, in the rehabilitation of
Turkey	LOCATION	, and in the new regard , since Majuba Hill and the de - feat of
Jameson	PERSON	, for the rights of the little Boer republic -RRB- that , after all , Ability to Fight is the one virtue that commands substantial and un - equivocal respect in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Our own present case seems to be also one in point .

MoClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		and lo !

		of a sudden the name of our friends oversea is legion .

		Foreign powers that , so long as the issue of our quarrel with
Spain	LOCATION	was com - paratively doubtful , were cool toward us and even hostile , now tender us the hand of amity , and are not above assuring us confidentially that , though appearances were to the contrary , it was all along ''
Codlin	PERSON	that was the friend , not
Short	PERSON	. ''

		But we are forgetting
General Miles	ORGANIZATION	.

		Leav - ing
Washington	LOCATION	on
May 4 , 1897	DATE	, he visited in turn
Constantinople	LOCATION	,
Athens	LOCATION	,
Lamia	LOCATION	, where the contending armies were then facing each other ,
London	LOCATION	,
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, Peterhof , where he conversed with the Czar , Krasnoe-Selo for the Russian manoeuvres ,
Berlin	LOCATION	,
Essen	LOCATION	at
Krupp	ORGANIZATION	's invitation , Homburg for the German , and
St. Quentin	LOCATION	for the French , manoeuvres .

		General Miles was highly impressed with the good qualities of the Turkish soldiers , finding them '' among the most effective in the world , '' a fact for which there are several reasons .

		First , the Turks are a strong race , used to hard labor , and hence are good raw material physically ; secondly , their religion inculcates obedience , enforces simple and temperate habits , and guar - antees immediate entry into the joys of a very conceivable paradise to the believer who dies in battle .

		The term of service , too , required in
Turkey	LOCATION	is long -LRB- twenty years -RRB- , and a great deal of that service during the past century has been active .

		In fact , the
Turk	ORGANIZATION	is now seen to be , in respect of his army at any rate , by no means the Sick Man of
Europe	LOCATION	about to take leave of his neighbors and his estate .

		General Miles formed a high opinion of the Turkish commanders , notably of
Osman Pasha	PERSON	, who reminded him strongly of Grant : '' He is a man about sixty-six years old , well built , of medium height , strong in physique , and intellectually the peer of any of the field - marshals I subsequently met in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		... In referring to the success of the army , the rapidity with which it had been mobilized , and the universal success in the series of battles just ended be - tween the Turks and Greeks , he made a significant remark . '

		Persistency , ' he said , ' is the great secret of success in war .

		If an army is not successful one day , tenacity of purpose and persistency will in the end bring victory . '

		This was very characteristic of the man who commanded the government forces in the latter part of our great civil war . ''

		General Miles had an audience of the Sultan in the Imperial Palace , where he was cordially received by the Great Assassin , who led the conversation at once toward military topics : '' He manifested great interest in military matters , and was thoroughly posted on the equipment of armies , the use and effect of modern appliances of war , the use of heavy machinery in the movements of the heaviest
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 high-power guns , as well as the most intricate mechan - ism of small arms , and the use and effect of smokeless powder and high explosives .

		His small stature , sharp , dark eyes , prominent nose , of the Roman type , full beard , were not unlike the marked characteristics that I have noticed in some men of our country . ''

		Arrived at
Athens	LOCATION	,
General Miles	ORGANIZATION	found a very different state of affairs from that prevail - ing at the capital of the victorious Turks : '' I came to a city exposed on every hand , deficient in military resources , its government dejected by defeat , its people dissatisfied with their rulers and divided in their opinion of what had been done , or what course should be pursued in the future ... Many were defi - ant , and loudly argued for fighting to the bitter end ; others were hoping for an interposition of the powers , which , if it left their country humbled , still would pre - vent the Turks from appropriating it altogether . ''

		The officers of the Greek army seemed to General Miles to be an intelligent , patriotic body of men , though then naturally much de - pressed at the result of the campaign .

		The soldiers had endured hardship and disaster with fortitude , but were greatly disheartened , their only hope being that something might occur to end hostilities .

		There was a great want of proper equipment and supplies , and the army was badly demoralized , both by the lack of food and shelter , and by the presence of a multitude of refugees , numbering 50,000 perhaps , who had abandoned their homes carrying with them what little of their scant belongings they could transport upon their backs , in carts , and upon a few pack-animals .

		Clearly , the Greek army was doomed to certain disaster in the event of further fighting ; and the Turk , reeking from his Armenian exploits , had won a new lease of political life in
Christian Europe	LOCATION	.

		The author 's account of the Jubilee is graphic , but he tells us little that is new now in the his - tory of that splendid pageant which lent so powerful an impulse to the growing spirit of '' Imperialism '' in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Not since the days of
Rome	LOCATION	had the beck of a single sceptre brought together figuratively at an Imperial capital so imposing and motley an array of trib - utary peoples .

		The spectacle was not lost on
Russia	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	.

		General Miles attended the great naval review off Spithead , where , he notes , '' In the line of foreign vessels was a single warship of the
United States	LOCATION	, the '
Brooklyn	LOCATION	. '

		She was the only vessel in the line painted white , and the irreverent tars called her the ' cement factory . ' ''


Spain	LOCATION	, we remem - ber , was represented by the '' Vizcaya , '' a for - midable looking craft that easily outranked in foreign eyes the untried representative of our '' brand new dollar navy . ''

		But times change .

		General Miles 's account of the military man - oeuvres is interesting , and carries the weight of expert opinion .

		He tactfully steers clear of odious comparisons of armies that , rivals in point of efficiency and preparedness to-day , may possibly be rivals on the battle-field to - morrow .

		The Russian review at Krasnoe-Selo he considers one of the finest military displays he ever witnessed .

		Russian officers are '' skilled and accomplished , '' and their men are '' well disciplined and well-armed '' : '' The Russian army is , I think , capable of greater endurance in the field than any other in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The infantry and artillery are composed of strong , hardy men , and the cavalry are unexcelled .

		The Cossacks constitute perhaps the best of the mounted troops . ''

		The author was much interested , while watch - ing the combats at the German manoeuvres , in the effect of the smokeless powder : '' One heard the sound of cannon and the rattle of musketry , but saw nothing until the troops advanced or retreated across the country within his line of vision .

		Thus one formerly valuable means of judging of the whereabouts of an enemy and of the progress of a battle is taken from a commanding officer by the use of smoke - less powder . ''

		General Miles , as we all know , was to have a better opportunity of judging of the value of smokeless powder later on ; and he now doubt - less coincides fully with Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	's opinion in that matter as well as in certain other views of the plain-spoken Rough Rider 's of a like general tenor and bearing .

		Black powder and
Springfield	LOCATION	rifles are now , we trust , rated with ''
Brown	PERSON	Bess '' muskets and flint locks , so far as our troops are concerned .

		General Miles was favorably impressed , as may be supposed , by both the German and French troops ; but his cautious estimates afford little clew as to which of the two armies he would pick for the winner should hostilities again break out .

		To the Italian army he pays the compliment of saying that it is more serv - iceably and tastefully uniformed than most troops , and that , although it has seen some re - verses of late , it is now '' in a very high order of discipline , instruction , and equipment , and makes a creditable showing . '' ''

		During iny stay in
Rome	LOCATION	there was a review by the
King of Italy	ORGANIZATION	, accompanied by the
King of Siam	ORGANIZATION	, of some 12,000 of the best Italian troops .

		It would be hard to excel this body in uniform , military appearance , and general excellence of condition . ''

		General Miles 's book , while its magazine origin is evident throughout , is informing on military matters , and will prove pleasant and profitable reading .

		There are a number of good illustrations .

		E. G. j. 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, CHIPS FBOM A CRITIC 'S SHOULDER .

		* A distinguished writer for '' Literature , '' not long ago , endeavored , in his own charming way , to conceal from his readers the idea that there was at present an opportunity in American let - ters for a critic .

		I do not know just how I managed to catch his idea myself ; possibly I jumped at it because something of the sort had crossed my own mind .

		What Mr.
James	PERSON	thinks of the already established authors of the dozen or two volumes of essays on literary sub - jects which have appeared in the last twelve months or so , he does not say .

		It does not seem to me that they occupy , certainly they do not fill up , that '' room at the top '' in which the critic mentioned shall sit and consider the works of the world beneath .

		I have wondered why so few of them really fired the mind .

		For these reasons , I turned to Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's volume of essays with a feeling that here , per - haps , might be found the man who was sought .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	suggested the question , but left it open .

		Certainly we have in these essays more serious work than usually appears in such collec - tions , serious , not thereby dull and tedious , but worth considering .

		I should like to consider them all if there were space .

		But the essays on
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	and Whitman had already been more or less discussed before the book was published ; so that there will be reason enough for speaking only of the essays on
Browning	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Of these , the first seems to me admirable .

		It takes rather a simple but a perfectly main - tainable view , and keeps it before the reader clearly and well .

		It is a view which will open
Browning	PERSON	up to a good many people .

		To Browningites it may not bring much , not even pleasure .

		But not everybody has read
Browning	PERSON	yet ; there are a good many who are only now beginning the experience .

		Mr.
Chap	PERSON	- man says that the great mass of
Browning	PERSON	will in future be rediscovered by '' belated sufferers from the philosophy of the nineteenth century . ''

		I imagine that there are large numbers of these belated sufferers now-a-days , there are always many such , people in this case who are just awakening to the dangerous opinions of Kenan and
Strauss	PERSON	, are just becoming conscious of the hypotheses of
Darwin	PERSON	and
Spencer	PERSON	, who have lately been introduced to the paintings of Hume-Jones , and the music of
Wagner	PERSON	, and the writings of
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		These people have to accommodate
Browning	PERSON	somehow , and they are ' EMBBSOX , AXD OTHER ESSAYS .

		By
John Jay Chapman	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Charles bcribner ' i Sou .

		apt to find it difficult .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's essay ought to put them in the right way ; and this is proof of its excellence in another direction , a direction in which Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	was prob - ably aiming , unconscious of the particular use which I have suggested .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's idea was to show what had actually been the rela - tion of
Browning	PERSON	to the middle of the nineteenth century .

		He is a critic who studies the fact with disinterestedness , not a diff user of popular culture .

		Still , if Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	has arranged the standpoint so that approachers of
Browning	PERSON	see everything in right perspective , it is prob - able that he has clearly in mind the way the thing really was to contemporaries .

		So I ad - mire the essay on
Browning	PERSON	, although it does not .

		say much of one element in
Browning	LOCATION	's work which interests some people , namely , the '' literary side . ''

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	considers the philosophical and historical aspects , and also the diction and metre ; and as these are the things which are of interest to most people , he does well .

		I have an interest in the fact that we have in
Browning	LOCATION	, as in any author , life , emotion , passion , taking literary forms , and in the circumstances attending metamor - phoses .

		But these things do not occupy Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's attention very much : I imagine he thinks them rather trivial .

		The essay on
Stevenson	PERSON	, like that on
Brown	PERSON	- ing , is an explanation of the nature of the man and of his `` relation to his time , '' or , practically , what he really has in him that is worth while .

		Here I can not feel that Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	repeats his success .

		It seems to me that he offers a facile explanation born rather from his own mind than from any especial knowledge of
Stevenson	PERSON	's work .

		He thinks that
Stevenson	PERSON	was devoted to Art , that he thought that the way to write with art was to write as other great men had written , that he therefore imi - tated all sorts of people , and that the things written in this way looked so much like real literary things that people who did not know any better were quite taken in by them .

		He thinks that Americans were well pleased with
Stevenson	PERSON	's stories and things , and were fas - cinated to see that what they liked had the characteristics which reminded them of stand - ard authors , and therefore seemed literary .

		Hence
America	LOCATION	urged
Stevenson	PERSON	to write twenty thousand dollars ' worth a year , and praised him to the skies .

		This process Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	sums up under the genial epigram , It is
Chicago	LOCATION	making culture hum . ''

		It must be said at once that there may have
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 129 been something of this , though I can not say that I think there was much .

		But , further , I suppose it must occur to most people that it is rather a curious assumption that what the American people as a whole recognized and liked in
Stevenson	PERSON	was style , and also that there could not have been anything else in his work which the American people as a whole -LRB- those crude , half-baked , distressing y earners for culture -RRB- really did like , and perhaps with - out recognizing it .

		Of course there were and are those who are always talking of style and
Stevenson	PERSON	, but I would bet a large apple that about nine-tenths of those who delight in
Stev	PERSON	- enson have no suspicion that he '' has style , '' and would regard it as a blemish if the notion occurred to them .

		And on the other hand , where there is a perfectly obvious characteristic of
Stevenson	PERSON	, a thing peculiarly delightful to the present time and peculiarly adapted to gain affection and popularity , it seems curious not to mention it .

		As to the matter of style , I can not say enough just here to present all the difficulties that I seem to see in Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's work .

		I must content myself with noting that I think he does not at all understand the attitude of a writer to what he writes , nor the attitude of
Stevenson	PERSON	to what he wrote ; and also I can not feel that he has any particular acquaintance with the way
Stevenson	PERSON	did write .

		I mean he does not seem to have read his books carefully with a view to style a matter which is of slight interest to him .

		If I am right here , it is necessary that Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	should be wrong ; and he does not get on better by misrepresenting various things , through negligence or what not .

		It would be uninteresting to go over minor errors , but of course a number of confident assertions of things that are not so , even if they be not im - portant , does much to weaken one 's confidence in the foundation of a critic 's views .

		But not only is Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	often wrong as to what he regards as the fact , but also he neglects what seems to me the real reason why people did like
Stevenson	PERSON	, the real thing characteristic of the man and the time , which in the case of Browning Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	did get .

		If this were an essay on
Stevenson	PERSON	, I would go into this matter in detail ; but as it is really about Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	I must be content to say that in this essay he has seized , distorted , and exaggerated a detail , and not mentioned the main point at all .

		He has not shown any espe - cial reason why people who really know what is good should find in
Stevenson	LOCATION	anything worth while .

		The things that I have said about these two essays might also be said of the essays on
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	and Whitman .

		That on
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	is as good as the
Browning	PERSON	essay , or even better , and in the same way , with the addition that
Emerson	PERSON	really was primarily a social force as Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	considers him , whereas
Brown	PERSON	- ing was primarily a poet .

		The essay on Whit - man , however , is as wrong as the essay on
Stevenson	PERSON	, and in just the same way , too ; it does not mention the main point , but devotes itself to exaggeration of minor matters .

		The reason for this rather peculiar matter is inter - esting .

		It lies partly in a circumstance and partly in a characteristic of Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	.

		The
Emerson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	cults are now accepted : they are no longer annoying .

		It is a matter of course that people will read
Emer	PERSON	- son and
Browning	PERSON	if they want : nobody is sur - prised any more than they are nowadays at people smoking , or eating tomatoes .

		But the
Whitman	PERSON	cult and the
Stevenson	PERSON	cult are not accepted ; they are still on the offensive , so far as they are cults at all .

		The great bulk of the reading public , which is satisfied to have
Emerson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	classics , is also sat - isfied to leave Whitman unread and to regard
Stevenson	PERSON	as a pleasant story-teller .

		So those devoted to these writers must speak up .

		This they occasionally do in public or in private , but not very much , to tell the truth , and certainly not enough to annoy seriously a nor - mal temper .

		One of Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's characteristics , how - ever , seems to be that he is annoyed at such things .

		He hates to have people blundering round and saying foolish things about literature , even in an unobtrusive manner ; and so he be - comes enraged with the Whitmaniacs and the Stevensonians .

		These two essays are really a little behind the times : as controversial docu - ments they are good ; as critical judgments , failures .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	is like Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	in `` The New Republic , '' who was crazy to shatter a faith no longer held by the company in which he found himself .

		This may seem a trivial thing to mention .

		It is really the most important thing to note about Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	as a critic .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	is too apt to be irritated at current popular opinion and feeling , contemptuous of it , unsym - pathetic , uncomprehending .

		He is quite willing to utter the truth , and to have people take it or leave it .

		But as for any real human interest 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, in the people he U writing for , he has not a cent 's worth .

		He can not think of the Amer - ican literary public with interest , or even with equanimity ; he can not speak of it without cold sarcasm .

		Now all this is probably well enough .

		The American people
Chicago	LOCATION	making culture hum , magazine editors ordering new Pulvis et
Umbras	LOCATION	, mill-hands and so on reading Long - fellow , the general reading public which kills Foe and creates
Bryant	PERSON	-LRB- to use Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's epigrams -RRB- is rarely much in flue need by such attitudes ; it is too apt to go on its way , often without knowing that it is scorned .

		Mr.
Chap	PERSON	- man 's way is probably not a good way to influ - ence
America	LOCATION	; nor for himself , in the long run at least , is the result likely to be good .

		In the first place , with his lack of feeling for his coun - trymen he will probably fail ever to say much that is important to them ; and in the second , with his own disposition he will often be irri - tated by harmless fallacies or fancies into ebullitions which will send him a long distance from the right road .

		Still , it will be thought by no one that such an element in a man 's work is ineradicable .

		It may be or may not be a permanent factor .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	, as everyone is aware by this time , has enough power to carry a good deal of weight .

		As has been often enough said , he is delicate , keen , strong , clever , and full of courage .

		The disposition which I have noted may render a good deal of his work of slight effect ; on the other hand , he may find out how to use it to good purpose , to make it telling .

		Certainly for the time being , it makes his essays rather more amusing to people who do not get vexed at them .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		THREE CHARACTERS FROM FRENCH HISTORY .

		* Mr.
H. C. MacDowall	PERSON	's volume of biograph - ical essays presents portrait-studies of the great
Duke of Guise	ORGANIZATION	,
Agrippa d'Aubigne	PERSON	* , and Cath - erine of
Navarre	LOCATION	.

		The first of the three studies is the most elaborate , occupying more than half of the volume ; the last is little more than an episode .

		The dark and troublous centuries of French history after
St. Louis	LOCATION	reached their romantic , if not their political , climax in the days when HKKBT or GCISE , and Other Portraits .

		Bj H. C. M * c -
Dowmll	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The MaomilUn Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Huguenot and Catholic fought and plotted for the supremacy ; when Terror was already , as in
1793	DATE	, `` the order of the day '' ; and when , if ever , a man 's foes were they of his own house - hold .

		It was this sixteenth century , with its Charles IX .

		and its
Henri IV.	PERSON	, its
St. Bartholo	LOCATION	- mew and its Edict of
Nantes	LOCATION	, that produced the three characters whom Mr.
MacDowall	PERSON	has so brightly and so darkly set before us .

		His account of the Guise family , their tra - ditions , ambitions , and achievements , follows well-known historical lines , and is generally free from prepossessions and polemics .

		He recognizes in
Henry of Guise	ORGANIZATION	a master-spirit of his time , noble with its nobleness of soul , cruel with its cruelty , superior in strength of char - acter to all his friends and most of his foes .

		The murder of Coligny is described at some length , as befits that bloody prelude to the
St. Bartholomew	LOCATION	.

		We hear
Guise	ORGANIZATION	's impatient question to the assassin , '' Is it done ? ''

		and when , sixteen years later , Guise met from a faithless king the same fate he had prepared for the great Admiral , we are ready , with Mr.
MacDowall	PERSON	, to recognize that poetic justice was wrought . ''

		The King , hearing the sound of the fall , came fearfully to the door of the cabinet and looked out from under the curtain . '

		Is it done ? '

		he asked ; and if the Duke 's fine ear were not yet deaf to every mortal sound , he surely must have caught that faint , awful echo of his own voice , floating to him across the space of sixteen troubled years . ''

		On the vexed question whether the St. Bar - tholomew was a crime of impulse or premedi - tation , Mr.
MacDowall	PERSON	briefly states , without arguing , his own view , namely , that the mas - sacre was a desperate and sudden resolve of Catherine de ' Medici , occasioned by the failure of the first attempt to kill Coligny .

		Guise 's unexpected holding aloof from the massacre and his rescue of many Huguenots are attrib - uted by his biographer to primary motives of humanity .

		`` Henry of Guise was naturally as kindly as his father , and in a cruel age no act of cold-blooded cruelty is proved against him , either before or after the
St. Barthol	LOCATION	- omew .

		In any case , the fact remains that when every way of escape was closed to the Hugue - nots , the doors of Guise 's house stood open to them . ''

		To Agrippa d'Aubigne * , the soldier-poet , the devoted adherent of
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	, the grandfather of Mme. de Maintenon , are given about a hundred pages of graphic narrative , in which , as was inevitable , the complex character
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 131 of the
King of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	receives about as much attention as is bestowed upon the titular subject of the essay .

		In
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's fascinating person - ality the chief defect was careless ingratitude toward the men who had given their lives and fortunes to his cause ; his motto , '' Je veux tout pardonner , tout oublier '' was bitterly inter - preted to mean that he forgave his enemies and forgot his friends .

		In this unkind fate d'Au - bigne had full share ; he had loved much , and he was assuredly much forgotten .

		As an historian d'Aubigne is best remem - bered by his
Histoire Universelle	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Mac	PERSON	-
Dowall	PERSON	emphasizes his cool and impartial atti - tude toward the burning issues of the times . ''

		He refuses to speak of the crimes committed by the Spaniards in
America	LOCATION	' because I can not enter upon this discourse in a spirit of modera - tion ' '' ; a statement which may find modern application to the flaming indictments drawn against the Spaniards of
1898	DATE	.

		D'Aubigne takes his place among the poets as the author of the epic
Les Tragiques	ORGANIZATION	.

		Begun when he was twenty-five , continued through many years of blood and fire , the poem de - scribes the miseries of the civil wars , and traces their origin to the vices and follies of those in authority .

		The apostrophe of Catherine de ' Medici is worth quoting , even in translation , if only for one impaling epithet .

		The poet imag - ines her a witch , performing her hideous incan - tations and brewing her potions ; and he bids her not to waste her strength in these painful , unnecessary rites . ''

		Toil not to win the aid thou canst compel ; What need hast thou of charms ?

		Within thy hand Thou holdst a spell more potent and more swift Than all the drugs they bring thee from afar .

		Oft have the demons triumphed by thy means , Now is thine hour , triumph thon over them ; Vivandiere of Hell , put forth thy power I Recount what thou hast done , say what thou seest , The victories of thy dark Florentine wiles ; Point to thy handiwork ; show
France	LOCATION	in ruins ; Show all the souls , depraved , despairing , damned , Who curse their God and thee , say ' t was thy craft Which sent these legions marching down to Hell ; It will suffice ; at that imperious word The infernal host shall move to do thy will . ''

		The third of these essays is a sketch of the unhappy
Catherine	PERSON	of
Navarre	LOCATION	, whose life was spent in trying to avoid marriages arranged for her by her brother ; a life which finally '' beat its music out , '' after she had been forced into a union with the
Duke of Bar	ORGANIZATION	, in steadfast refusal to be coerced from her faith for the sake of her husband and his family .

		AN AUTHORITATIVE BOOK ON
MEXICO	LOCATION	.

		*
Senor Matias Romero	PERSON	, the author of '' Notes on
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' is the Minister from
Mexico	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Twice a cabinet member in his own country , he is thoroughly informed in re - gard to Mexican affairs .

		The first part of the book grew out of a talk given , by invitation , to a '' travel club '' in the city of
Washington	LOCATION	; later , this talk was expanded into a paper read before the
American Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	and published in its Bulletin ; this in turn has been considerably increased for publication in its present form .

		It is a plain , straightforward statement of things Mexican Physical Features , Geology , Climate ,
Flora	LOCATION	, Population , Condition .

		Everyone but the spe - cialist will be likely to find here just about what he wants to know regarding our sister republic .

		Part II .

		consists of
Statistical Tables	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is very difficult to secure reliable Mexican statistics extending over a long period .

		At many times in
Mexico	LOCATION	's national history , careful collec - tion and recording of facts has been impossible .

		What can be done
Senor Romero	PERSON	has done ; the data he presents are the best that can be secured .

		The financial statistics for the last few years are reliable , but the fluctuation in the value of the currency makes comparison difficult .

		The statistics given cover a wide range : revenues and expenses , state and municipal finances , foreign trade , trade between
Mexico	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, coinage , gold exports , railways , public debt , postoffice and telegraph service , banks , public lands , education , manufacturing interests , navigation , agricultural products , are all discussed .

		In an appendix , besides some geographical notes , are presented tables of alti - tudes and a capital description of the great engineering feat just completed in the works for draining the Valley of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Such is a brief outline of the work .

		One thought instantly strikes the mind of the reader at all acquainted with
Mexico	LOCATION	: here is a book in capital English written for English readers by a Mexican foreign Minister .

		How many for - eign Ministers has the
United States	LOCATION	ever sent to
Mexico	LOCATION	who could talk good Spanish , let alone write books in that language ?

		Have we ever had one who could add a volume worth reading to Mexican-Spanish literature ?

		We have had some men in our diplomatic service in
Mexico	LOCATION	who could write books , e. g. ,

Waddy Thompson	PERSON	, and

		132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, none who ever wrote what would greatly profit Mexican readers .

		Sefior
Romero	PERSON	's book is crowded with valu - able information .

		Very interesting are his con - cise notes regarding products of the country .


Mexico	LOCATION	can produce the plants of almost any land .

		Wheat , maize , coffee , india-rubber , sugar cane , ginger , and tobacco are among the most notable at present .

		The brief statements as to needs , opportunities , and methods of cul - tivation are practically important .

		One notices with a smile that the
United States	LOCATION	takes the bulk of the chicle crop .

		Our importation rose from the value of
$ 156,402	MONEY	to
$ 1,527,838	MONEY	be - tween the years 1885-1895 .

		And what is chicle f The gum of a tree used for the making of chewing-gum .

		Sefior
Romero	PERSON	pleads for the planting of the mulberry and the raising of silk in
Mexico	LOCATION	, as if such culture were an expe - riment .

		It is not , however , so .

		At times in the past silk culture was an important industry ; and in one of his charming essays , the eminent Mexican historian ,
Sefior Icazbalceta	PERSON	, fully dis - cusses it .

		Mexican resources are great ; knowl - edge of them is still but meagre ; important discoveries are being constantly made .

		Thus , recent as is
Romero	PERSON	's book , and up-to-date , it does not mention one of the greatest copper mining interests of
America	LOCATION	located in the state of
Guerrero	LOCATION	and operated by a recently organ - ized French syndicate with an enormous capital .

		No writer can produce a book on Mexican progress which will be complete at the time it appears from the press .

		Sefior Romero fully realizes the opportunities presented by his country to foreign settlers and foreign capital .

		His book itself is calculated to lure Americans to
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		There are many opportunities for making wealth there , cer - tainly ; but there are few Americans so consti - tuted as to happily and profitably use them .

		Of all foreigners in
Mexico	LOCATION	, in Central Amer - ica , and in
South America	LOCATION	to-day , the German is the most successful , the most influential , and the most at home .

		It is because he takes things as he finds them and does not try to make over the conditions around him .

		The English and American must always do business in their own way , and insist upon others doing as they do .

		They do not adjust themselves .

		Sefior
Romero	PERSON	says : `` It will be very difficult for the fun-loving , self - indulgent , Anglo-Saxon Englishman of
America	LOCATION	to com - pete with these self-denying Spaniards , capable of living with the nose to the grindstone twenty , twenty-five , or thirty years , eating always sparingly , drinking wine , but in moderation , spending no money , dressing poorly , and ever with a fortune accumulating .

		The American wants to cut a dash and so does the Englishman , else the English would have maintained their commercial supremacy in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		They lost it to the more frugal and economical Germans . ''

		FREDERICK
STARR	PERSON	.

		RECENT AMERICAN POETRY .

		* More than a score of volumes of American verse received during the past few months show that we have as many poets as ever , if moat of them are minor .

		We have selected for brief comment about a dozen of these thin volumes , and have sought , as usual , to represent each writer by at least one example of his best work .

		The most conspicuous place on the list clearly belongs to the two Canadians whom contin - ued residence in the
United States	LOCATION	permits us to claim as at least half our own .

		Mr.
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	, whose pure lyric note was first welcomed by THE DIAL many years ago , has just published a collection of ``
New York Nocturnes	LOCATION	, and Other Poems , '' which is distinguished by both delicacy of sentiment and unusual perfection of form .

		We think that Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	is more poetical when he has Tan - traraar for his theme rather than
Manhattan	LOCATION	, but his nocturnes of the great city have little of what is called local color , and are really outpourings of a spirit oblivious to its surroundings except in their larger and more obvious aspects .

		There is a sug - gestion of
New York	LOCATION	, but no more , in such verses as these : '' The street is a grim caflon carved In the eternal stone , That knows no more the rushing stream It anciently has known . ''

		THE DIAL 133 '' The emptying tide of life has drained The iron channel dry .

		Strange winds from the forgotten day Draw down , and dream , and sigh . ''

		The narrow heaven , the desolate moon Made wan with endless years , Seem less immeasurably remote Than laughter , love , or tears . ''

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	is not completely himself until he gets into full communion with nature , and then he strikes the full chord of beauty , at once sensuous and spir - itual , as in this all but perfect poem , '' The Falling Leaves '' : '' Lightly He blows , and at His breath they fall , The perishing kindreds of the leaves ; they drift , Spent flames of scarlet , gold aerial , Across the hollow year , noiseless and swift .

		Lightly He blows , and countless as the falling Of snow by night upon a solemn sea , The ages circle down beyond recalling , To strew the hollows of Eternity .

		He sees them drifting through the spaces dim , And leaves and ages are as one to Him . ''

		The thin volumes of verse occasionally put forth by Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	have a unity not often found in such collections .

		Each volume is a careful selec - tion from a considerable mass of material , and brings together pieces of the same general class .

		Thus , '' By the Aurelian Wall '' is a book of elegies , all in the same minor mood , and all filled with the sense of man 's kinship with nature , with the feeling that to die is simply to be merged once more into the being of the Great Mother from whom we draw the fleeting breath of individual life .

		These elegies are wind-blown songs rather than reflective and reminiscent utterances , and the vivid imagina - tion which fills and thrills them atones in large measure for the defect of a lack of polish in the technical sense .

		Among their subjects are
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Blake	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Lovelace	PERSON	, and
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	.

		We quote two stanzas from the song inscribed to
Shelley	LOCATION	's memory . ''

		Thou heart of all the hearts of men , Tameless and free , And vague as that marsh-wandering fire , Leading the world 's out-worn desire A night march down this ghostly fen From sea to sea ! ''

		Through this divided camp of dream Thy feet have passed , As one who should set hand to rouse His comrades from their heavy drowse ; For only their own deeds redeem God 's sons at last . ''

		We can not help wondering why Mr.
Carman	PERSON	should have failed to include in this elegiac sheaf the poem which seems to us , on the whole , the finest that he has ever written that '' Death in
April	DATE	'' which commemorates the passing of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		It has not , we believe , been included in any of his previously published volumes , and must still be hunted out in the pages of '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	'' where it first appeared .

		Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	's '' Shapes and Shadows '' are lyrics of the sort with which his several preced - ing volumes have made us familiar , lyrics of nature and love a nature tropical rather than polar , a love sensuous rather than spiritual .

		Their lilt and their passion often carry the reader away , and yet there is a false note in many of them that mars the effect .

		The sonnet '' Can I Forget ? ''

		is one of the most nearly faultless of these pieces . ''

		Can I forget how Love once led the ways Of our two lives together , joining them ; How every hour was his anadem , And every day a tablet in his praise !

		Can I forget how , in his garden place Among the purple roses , stem to stem , We heard the rumour of his robe 's bright hem , And saw the aureate radiance of his face !

		Though I behold my soul 's high dreams down-hurled .

		And Falsehood sit where Truth once towered white , And in Love 's place , usurping lust and shame ... Though flowers be dead within the
winter	DATE	world , Are flowers not there ?

		and starless though the
night	TIME	, Are stars not there , eternal and the same ? ''

		There is nothing distinctive about the '' Poems '' of Mr.
Philip Becker Goetz	PERSON	, nothing to set their writer apart from a hundred of his fellow devotees of the minor muses .

		A favorable example is the poem called '' Religion . '' ''

		If you have built your soul upon a God Whose being starts to shade at skeptic breath No halo of all saints who there have trod Shall raise you higher than your body 's clod . ''

		Some day , as hot your ardor leaps to song Upon your choir chill Truth will stretch a hand , And riotous will burst a million strong Through empty aisles and chancels Ruin 's throng . ''

		Be then your God no god of yesterday , And be your temple open to the air , Fear not dark conflict , greet the doubtful fray ; Not one sun but a host will light your way . ''

		The chief faults of Mr.
Goetz	PERSON	are unmelodionsness and the sort of semi-obscurity that comes from the failure to embody concepts in a logical framework before adorning them with the embroidery of verse .

		Mr.
Henry Johnson	PERSON	's pieces , collectively styled '' Where Beauty Is , '' run the familiar gamut of Art ,
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, and Love .

		Since Art appears to be the tonic of this chord , we will make our selection from '' The Prayer of Pericles '' upon the dedication of the
Parthenon	LOCATION	to
Athene	LOCATION	.

		`` We bring thee but ourselves ; our mother 's breast , Our own Pentelicus , we wrought to enshroud Thy majesty , nor deemed our eager crowd Unwelcome to the council of the blest . ''

		No longer our defiant citadel , This hill be sacred to thine ordered peace , Throne of thy spirit where all murmurs cease , And beauty mirroring thy thought shall dwell . ''

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	aims only at simple effects that are well within his powers , and thus achieves a measure of relative success .

		The lesson is one that minor bards might well take to heart .

		In commenting upon Mr.
C. F. Johnson	PERSON	's volume , strangely entitled '' What Can I Do for
Brady	LOCATION	, and Other Verse , '' we fear that we can say nothing more encouraging than to repeat the criticism of the 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, writer 's youthful son , who is quoted aa having said that '' papa 's poetry was dethidedly amateurish . ''

		Brady is a labor agitator and fanatic , his discourse being after the following fashion : '' Again I 'm forced to disagree - I 're been on strike Fire time * as man , and twice M manager .

		First let me My , we do not loae more than We gain by strike * , whichever way it ends . ''

		Such glaring absurdities -LRB- from the standpoint of poetry -RRB- as these lines exhibit occur throughout Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's pages .

		Still , lest we do the author injus - tice , we are bound to represent him by his best as well as his worst , and such a sonnet as '' History and Poetry '' is at least sober , thoughtful , and reg - ular in form . ''

		Three men seem real aa living men we know : The Florentine , whoee face , careworn and dark ,
Ronetti	PERSON	drew ; the Norman dnke , ' so stark Of arm that none bnt him might bend his bow ' ; And ' gentle Shakespeare , ' though enshrouded so In his own thought , that some men can not mark The soul his book reveals , as when a lark Sings from a cloud , unseen by all below . ''

		Bnt still more real than these seem other three Who never walked on earth : ' Hamlet the Dane , ' The ' noble Moor , ' the cruel Scottish thane Ambition 's thrall .

		How strange that they should be , Though naught bnt figments of the poet 's brain , Instinct with life , and yet more real than he . '' ''

		Morrow-Songs '' is numbered three among the volumes of Mr.
Koopman	PERSON	's verse , published and unpublished .

		Mr.
Koopman	PERSON	is best when he is briefest , a remark which we make without satirical intention , and illustrate by '' Appreciation . '' ''

		We crowned with thorns the living hero 's brow ; Bnt see , we deck his grave with roses now . ''

		Now , while the very stones from which he bled Climb to a monument above his head . ''

		`` Two Poets , '' affords another illustration of the author 's compact way of saying things . ''

		He had a straight Greek brow , which sculptors loved , And clear and pure his classic measures rang .

		Men hailed him bard by all the gods approved , And snowy maids his star-cold numbers sang . ''

		Look now on this face .

		Mark the bulging brow , The shapeless mouth , the torn and twisted ear , The seams of riot .

		Nay , who marks them now ?

		He fired men 's hearts to win our Golden Year . '' ''

		Love 's Shrine , '' by Mr.
L. V. Rule	PERSON	, is a sonnet - sequence that might be styled the sentimental auto - biography of a prig .

		In wooden and commonplace measures we read the outpourings of one who loved not wisely bnt too well for his happiness , until a worthier idol took the place of the faithless one .

		The former maiden mnsfe have been much edified by the upbraidings of her whilom thrall , who addresses her through many pages in such scornful strains as these : '' Thou hast no heart ; So centred in thy petty self thon art , That ' t is delight to thee to cast a slur At humbler ones whom thou shouldst bow before .

		Blue-blooded 1 Ah , the billows on the shore Are not more empty than thy boast . ''

		We should say that the bard had done better to suffer in silence .

		Mr.
Rule	PERSON	's other poems are lyrics of love , '' and sonnets on current politics
Armenia	LOCATION	,
Crete	LOCATION	,
Cuba	LOCATION	, and the like .

		We have come across many luckless misprints in our time , but none , we think , quite so unhappy as the following : '' At last the lands have wakened ; freedom 's cause Which seemed abandoned , cries aloud no more ; And sweet the strains that from the classic snore -LRB- tic -RRB- Of Hellas come . ''

		A note of indignant passion , a note almost of re - volt at the conditions of a life that our own supine acquiescence leaves as petty and sordid as we find it , thrills through the poems in Mrs.
Stetson	PERSON	's vol - ume . ''

		In This Our World '' there is , indeed , much that might be bettered had men only the will to overcome their moral inertia , and realize the higher life of which most of them are content idly to dream .

		The expression is somewhat rough , but the energy is unmistakable , in such lines as these : '' Why friends !

		God is not through !

		The universe is not complete in yon .

		Yon 're just as bound to follow out his plan And sink yourself in ever-growing Man As ever were the earliest crudest eggs To grow to vertebrates with arms and legs .

		Society holds not its present height Merely that you may bring a child to light ; Bnt yon and yours live only in the plan That 's working out a higher kind of man ; A higher kind of life , that shall let grow New powers and nobler duties than you know . ''

		Much better in form , and none the less energetic for that , are the lines called '' A Man Must Live . '' ''

		A man must live .

		We justify Low shift and trick to treason high , A little vote for a little gold To a whole senate bought and sold , By that self-evident reply . ''

		Bnt is it so ?

		Pray tell me why Life at such cost you have to buy ?

		In what religion were you told A man must live ?

		`` There are times when a man must die .

		Imagine , for a battle-cry , From soldiers , with a sword to hold , From soldiers , with the flag unrolled , This coward 's whine , this liar 's lie , A man most live ! ''

		We wish that the large and scornful utterance of such a piece as this might be wedded to more me - lodious verse , and that it did not so often as it does when the gospels of socialism and the rights of women possess the consciousness of the speaker turn shrill and into mere scolding .

		Mrs.
Stetson	PERSON	comes nearest to writing poetry when she turns from man to nature , and writes of the West that she knows so well .

		Here , for example , is an etching that could not well be improved upon .

		It is called '' A
Nevada Desert	LOCATION	. ''

		`` An aching , blinding , barren , endless plain ; Corpse-colored with white mould of alkali , Hairy with sage-brash , shiny after rain .

		Burnt with the sky 's hot scorn , and still again Sullenly burning back against the sky .

		THE DIAL 135 '' Dull green , dull brown , dull purple , and dull gray , The hard earth white with ages of despair , Slow-crawling , turhid streams where dead reeds sway , Low wall of sombre mountains far away , And sickly steam of geysers on the air . ''

		It is not cheerful , certainly , but it has the visible impress of truth .

		The '' Poems '' of Miss
Florence Earle Coates	PERSON	are reasonably correct in form and pleasing in expres - sion .

		Many of them deal with the abstractions of thought that young poets so dearly love ; others embody aspirations of the soul or simple experiences of contact with nature and the works of man .

		The sonnet ''
India	LOCATION	'' is one of the best examples . ''

		Silent amidst unbroken silence deep Of dateless years , in loneliness supreme , She pondered patiently one mighty theme , And let the hours , uncounted , by her creep .

		The motionless
Himalayas	LOCATION	, the broad sweep Of glacial cataracts , great Ganges ' stream All these to her were but as things that seem , Doomed all to pass , like phantoms viewed in sleep .

		Her history ?

		She has none scarce a name .

		The life she lived is lost in the profound Of time , which she despised ; but nothing mars The memory that , single , gives her fame She dreamed eternal dreams , and from the ground Still raised her yearning vision to the stars . ''

		Dr.
Charles Woodruff Shields	PERSON	, of
Princeton Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , has discerned in the history of
Calvin	PERSON	and Servetus the elements of a historical drama , and has shaped the tragedy into a five-act play in blank verse , entitled '' The Reformer of
Geneva	LOCATION	. ''

		The constructive skill displayed by the work is consid - erable , and in its strictly historical aspect minute accuracy has been observed .

		Of its diction , the best example is found in the last words spoken by
Calvin	PERSON	after
Servetus	PERSON	has been disposed of , and the triumph of the Reformation in
Geneva	LOCATION	is complete . ''

		Mingle no praise of man with this high work Of God .

		Even
Israel	LOCATION	's law-giver , Because he smote the rock of Meriba In sinful anger , could not enter Canaan , But only viewed it from far
Pisgah	LOCATION	's top And died nnhonored in its sepulchre .

		So have ye seen like vehemence untam 'd In him ye call the leader of your cause .

		For this he craves forgiveness of you all , In sight of God , of angels , and of men .

		Millions for this may call him tyrant , who Shall owe to him their liberty ; and though All Christian lands should be his monument , Let no man know his grave .

		The glory is Not ours .

		We are but shadows that o'ercloud it This living scene , and all that it portends , The earth and sky around us , and the pomps Of rising morn and sinking eve , are but The pageantry of one Creative Mind , Upheld and moved by one Eternal Will The glory give to One alone ! ''

		If the work were kept at this elevation of expression throughout , it might pass muster as poetry ; unfor - tunately , it is for the most part mere prose , cut up into convenient lengths , and not even preserving mechanical regularity of form .

		In writing his '' Trialogues '' of the four seasons , Mr.
William Griffith	PERSON	has evidently been inspired by the '' Fleet Street Eclogues '' of Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	, although both may doubtless point to an Elizabethan model .

		This is the sort of thing Mr.
Griffith	PERSON	does , although not often as neatly as in the quoted passage .

		NORMAN .

		`` Nay ; come , pour out the ruddy ale , While foaming there the billow breaks : GILES . ''

		And while the distant boscage shakes With long clear whistle of the quail .

		If duty has been reckoned least , A song is nobler never sung .

		I gaze from
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's lowest gate Adown Her vasty , starlit hall : I watch the nations rise and
fall	DATE	, Like shadows , at the whim of Fate . ''

		A moment near , a moment gone .

		Beneath ten thousand watching eyes , One thunderous rush rings out and dies And still the world moves on and on ; 11 While sweeping down each azure road With banners fading one by one , The cohorts pass and here alone , I dream the solitude of God . ''

		The writer has also read Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	's later poems , a little too attentively , it would seem , when we come upon such phrases as '' those simple warrior lords '' and `` the ruined dream of
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	. ''

		Mention of two volumes of trifles may close this review of recent American verse .

		Mr.
Tom Hall	PERSON	's '' When Love Laughs '' is made up of such things as '' Going with
Jack	PERSON	'' a typical product of comic journalism . ''

		The dressmaker 's late And she 's going with
Jack	PERSON	I Ah me !

		Such is Fate I The dressmaker 's late There 's the gown at the gate !

		The smile has come back Though the dressmaker 's late She is going with
Jack	PERSON	. ''

		Of '' Summer '' Mr.
Hall	PERSON	tella us , '' It is the season , filled with joy , When office boys ' relations die ; While he who doth his kind employ Spends sleepless nights awondering why . ''

		If these are trifles light as air , those contained in '' La Santa Yerba , '' by Mr.
W. L. Shoemaker	PERSON	, are even lighter , for their substance is of the smoke of the '' Great Plant . ''

		For example : '' In Shakespeare 's plays I think you '11 search in vain For any notice of tobacco ta'en , When in the theatres 't was smoked , and when It had been praised by many learned men , And love of poets had begun to gain . ''

		Did he the inspiring Indian weed disdain As impotent to aid his mighty brain ?

		Lo !

		all things else are spread before our ken In
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		Mr.
Shoemaker	PERSON	has not exactly the lyric gift , but the heart of the smoker will warm to him none the less .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYXK	ORGANIZATION	.

		A current etlinuite f
Scott	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Professor
Salisbury	PERSON	's '' little book , '' as he calls it , on
Walter Scott	PERSON	, in the '' Famous Scots '' series -LRB- imported by
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is not different from what one would expect It must have been rather a task to compress that very full life into 150 fair-sized pages , but
Professor Saintsbury	LOCATION	is a veteran , and he has done his work with ease and even with a bit of room here or there to turn himself about a little .

		Of course it is the estimate of
Scott	PERSON	's genius , or rather of his especial power , that is chiefly interesting .

		There is no denying that
Scott	PERSON	has not of late quite held his literary position .

		Not that he is not read , that he has not been popular , that there have not been countless editions of the poems and the novels .

		But in the hundred years , almost , between
Scott	PERSON	and ourselves there has come a change in poetry and in novel writing , so that what we think of as the highest poems and the greatest novels are very different from
Scott	PERSON	's poems and novels .

		The work of the great men , of the Scotts and the Byrons of our own day , is very different , and hence many have felt that
Scott	PERSON	's work was not great work .

		Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	recalls to mind many things that we shall remember , and suggests their importance .

		He is right in pointing out
Scott	PERSON	's chief power : a large and sane knowledge of people and of life , a wonder - ful feeling for character , for nature , a thorough appreciation of humor and romance .

		In
Scott	PERSON	's poems and in his novels we are struck by the same things : brilliant descriptions of scenery , remarkable fulness and exuberance of character , hurrying ac - tion and incident , romantic episodes ; if we turn to the poems or the novels , we shall always find these things in any one of them .

		Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, however , does not especially mention some of the characteristics which
Scott	PERSON	did not have , and one of these , it seems to us , was a thing which we have of late got to value a good deal : we mean the real - ization of the human soul in a tragic or pathetic situation .

		That was something that
Scott	PERSON	rarely attempted .

		He often created the situations , but he rarely realized his character in them .

		Take Con - stance de Beverley : the situation would give a won - derful chance to a modern , but
Scott	PERSON	does not realize the character at all .

		Then , as it may not be fair to take an example from a poem , take
Lucie Ashton	PERSON	.

		Again we have a powerful situation -LRB- in this case not invented by
Scott	PERSON	-RRB- , but here again
Scott	PERSON	does not bring us to a realization of her tumult of heart .

		He tells us how Constance and
Lucie	PERSON	looked and dressed , what they said and did , and so he does of
Effie Deans	PERSON	, and
Madge Wildfire	PERSON	, Clara Mow - bray ,
Amy Robsart	PERSON	,
Hugh Redgauntlet	PERSON	,
Roland Graeme	PERSON	at
Loch Leven Castle	ORGANIZATION	, and many , many others who , either tragic figures or merely human beings in situations of keen human interest , rarely do more than look and dress and say and do .

		They rarely feel , or at least if they do we do not feel with them .

		Scott was great in his pictures of things that happen and places that we see , he had a won - derful power of appreciation and sympathy with humorous character , and sometimes even of the pathetic .

		But although he often conceived situations in which human nature must have been stirred to its depths , he rarely makes us realize the passion of which he speaks .

		Now this realization of intensity of life or of passion we have come to value greatly in the years between the '' Waverleys '' and ourselves .

		We have in many cases placed a value on absurd or grotesque manifestations of it .

		But at any rate we have valued it , and have accustomed ourselves to it .

		It may not be the greatest thing in the world , but we like it ; and when we read
Scott	PERSON	we do not get it .

		It is perhaps too much to say that one is the looking at people from the outside , and the other is feeling with them as they are within .

		No one would entirely deny to
Scott	PERSON	the power of sympathy with his creations ; but certainly he did not enter into their being at the moments of the crises of their fate , or at least he does not make us feel them thoroughly .

		We make a mistake if we allow this lack to discourage us in the presence of the other wealth which
Scott	PERSON	has , of incident , character , de - scription , humor , romance .

		These things are cer - tainly the positive things about him , and Professor
Saintsbury	PERSON	is not wrong in his very limited space in confining himself to them . ''

		French Literature of To - day '' .

		-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- was apparently designed by the author ,
Madame Yetta Blaze	PERSON	de Bury , for persons not already much acquainted with the subject matter .

		This was wise on the whole .

		Others would find in the book a lack of several things that they might expect We will note a few points on the essay on
Pierre Loti	PERSON	-LRB- chosen because it comes first in the book -RRB- .

		His name is not
Pierre Viaud	PERSON	; his first book was not '' Manage de Loti '' ; '' Les Pecheurs d'Islande '' is not the correct name of the novel discussed ; he was not elected to the Academy '' in the full powers of youth , '' but at the age of forty-one ; '' Fleurs d'Ennui '' is not one of his last -LRB- sic -RRB- books , it is one of the earlier ones .

		These are not important mat - ters , but they are sufficient to put
Madame Blaze de Bury	ORGANIZATION	out of the category of those who are thoroughly acquainted with the subjects on which they write , or who at least desire to present the matter as it really is rather than as it may well enough be .

		Such slips prepare one for looseness , such as the description of
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 137 Fatou-gaye 's costume and coiffure , which , in spite of the '' writes Loti , '' is not accurate ; for the fancy that Loti hears of
Rarahu	ORGANIZATION	's death on returning to
Papeete	LOCATION	; for the views ascribed to
Gaud	ORGANIZATION	in thinking of
Yann	PERSON	which , in spite of the quotation-marks , are very free recollections of the original .

		And this general mental attitude prepares one also to find at the end of the essay , '' We pointed out ... resem - blance between certain characteristics of his style and that of The'ophile
Gautier	PERSON	, '' where what was said at the beginning was , '' The analogy between
Gautier	PERSON	and Loti , however , lies in the sestlietical temperament of both ; in their common worship of the sun , '' which is not a characteristic of style .

		These trivial matters would amount to nothing in work of real power and critical insight , but of such qualities we must confess we find here little trace .

		There are plenty of '' modern ideas , '' but all hazy , vague , jumbled , and much as they might exist in the mind of one who had heard of them but had never thought them .

		The other essays seem like this on
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, and the book therefore comes down to being the easy prattle of a lady who has read some of the French authors of the present day , who has heard a great deal of talk about '' modern ideas , '' and who , somehow , has had opportunity to publish what she was inspired to write for some at least of these papers appeared in the English reviews .

		The book is interesting , but sadly unsound .

		The authors themselves are not accurately presented ; the ideas which furnish the standpoint from which they are viewed are not clearly conceived .

		We have no doubt that many may like to read these essays , for they are written in a rather sprightly mood ; but we doubt seriously if those who know the writ - ers discussed will find their ideas at all modified , or if those will come to know them who are not at present acquainted with them .

		Each
summer	DATE	has its pet golf-book .

		First , it was the
Badminton	LOCATION	;
last summer	DATE	,
Willy Park	LOCATION	's book ; and this
summer	DATE	we think Mr.
Whigham	PERSON	's '' How to Play Golf '' -LRB-
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has supplied the vade mecitm , the book that lies on every golf - club table and in the study of every enthusiast .

		It is true that this
summer	DATE	, just as laws become silent in the midst of arms , so also has the golfer retired from the front of public interest in favor of the soldier .

		Even Mr.
Whigham	PERSON	himself , we have heard , put away his clubs and went to see the fighting .

		But now that the war is over , the turn of the golfer will come again .

		The papers , no longer full of exciting war-news , will be more carefully searched for news of the links .

		And as autumn comes on the real golfing season with us there will be more and more persons who want a golf-book .

		To them Mr.
Whigham	PERSON	's treatise may be commended , for it is as good as another , and in some respects it is rather better .

		We do not think that anyone will be able to '' learn the game '' out of it much more easily than out of any other book .

		But the average man This
summer	DATE	'' !

		golf-book .

		who already plays a little will find a great deal that will be useful to him .

		There are photographs of players in action , for one thing , a dozen pictures each of the ways half-a-dozen champions drive , instead of one picture of the way you ought to drive yourself .

		The teaching of the game is on the whole made simpler and more practical , and is better and more fully illustrated in this book than in any other we know .

		The history of the game in this country and the sketch of amateur players abroad make good chapters .

		Golfers , perhaps more than most other kinds of '' old gamesters , '' are much given to the gossip and the history of the game ; there are few sports so provocative of talk as golf .

		The chap - ter on laying out a course will be most easily made available by any club which means to spend a
million dollars	MONEY	a hole .

		Others will have to do a good deal of contriving to make both ends meet .

		Still , there is really nothing recommended that is not good , though the book has perhaps a slightly discouraging effect on those who regard golf as a recreation rather than a highest duty .

		In fact , though it may seem a work of impertinence to commend a work by the amateur champion , we shall presume to say that golfers will here find the most useful book of the
summer	DATE	.

		Gladstone , '' When a great man dies the nation the Man and mourns '' ; and that section of it which the Publicist .

		writes and makes books for the rest thriftily turns the occasion of mourning into one of profit .

		What we may term , we trust without dis - respect , the ''
Gladstone	PERSON	boom '' is now on with a vengeance ; and among the more ephemeral and catch-penny manifestations of it is Mr.
David Will	PERSON	- iamson 's '' Gladstone the Man '' -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	:
M. F. Mansfield	PERSON	-RRB- .

		For the reader , if such there be , who knows nothing or next to nothing of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, Mr.
Williamson	PERSON	's book may be said to contain a fair amount of information of the superficial and personal order which is , it is fair to add , all that its author proposes to furnish . ''

		While other pens , '' he says , '' have been busy recording and criticising the political acts of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, mine will be the more grateful task of portraying him ... as the man whose personal character is esteemed by polit - ical friend and foe alike . ''

		But the book , however looked at , is a slight thing at best , bearing the ear - marks of hurry and scant preparation .

		There are a few illustrations , mainly from photographs that have already done service in the pictorial journals .

		A solider book than Mr.
Williamson	PERSON	's , though still a biography of the merely descriptive and laud - atory sort , is the new edition , revised and brought to date , of Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	's ''
W. E. Gladstone	PERSON	,
England	LOCATION	's Great Commoner '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Unlike Mr.
Williamson	PERSON	, Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	deals for the most part with
Gladstone	PERSON	's public career which is , of course , the side of his life we are most concerned to know about .

		Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	is extremely chary of venturing an opinion of his own as to anything his hero did or wrote so chary , indeed , that he may seem to the 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, ir/are .

		reader to stick to mere recital from prudential mo - tives .

		We are likely , however , to have enough criticism and even depreciation of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	ere long , when the inevitable reaction against the current flood of overcharged laudation and lamenta - tion seta in .

		Fortunately , we shall always have Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's fine study -LRB- already noticed in our col - umns -RRB- to appeal to as a standard of appreciation .

		Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	's book contains a liberal sprinkling of wood-cuts , and it may be read with profit and en - joyment by those in need of an elementary sketch of ''
England	LOCATION	's Great Commoner . ''

		It is much to be hoped , from the pop - ular as well as the professional point of view , that some such works on the various campaigns undertaken by the American forces in the Spanish war shall be published as Mr.
Lionel James	PERSON	's '' The Indian Frontier War , 1897 '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and Mr.
Winston L. Spencer Churchill	PERSON	's ``
Malakand Field Force	ORGANIZATION	, 1897 '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		These books are to be taken together as furnishing a complete and minutely detailed account of the operations of the British armies last year in
India	LOCATION	, against the hill tribes , Pathans and others , during their turbulence as a result of Moslem fanaticism .

		The fact that the heathen were armed with modern rifles , in some respects inferior to those of their more civilized foe , is in striking contradiction to the relative positions of the Spanish and the American volunteers ; but some exceedingly inter - esting parallels are to be drawn between such a charge as that of the '' Gay Gordons '' at
Dargai	LOCATION
last October	DATE	, and the storming and capture of
El Caney	ORGANIZATION	and
San Juan	LOCATION
last July	DATE	by the American regulars , black and white , and the '' rough riders . ''

		Both must serve to assure Mr.
H. W. Wilson	PERSON	that his fears lest the fighting qualities of the race have deteriorated are unfounded .

		Now that the fighting is fairly over , it will be worth while to study the means by which Englishmen on the extreme frontier of the Empire are provided for under the super - vision of trained officers and men , it may keep the
United States	LOCATION	from sending their men out with some expectation that the deficiency in rations is to be made up by a superfluity in clothing .

		In any event , the frankness of Messrs.
James	PERSON	and Churchill in disclosing all the weaknesses developed during the campaign , and the means taken to remedy them , is worthy our emulation , not less than the clearness of the narratives .

		In The Cheverels of Cheverel Manor '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , we have a d manner * .

		| -RRB- u jg e j ; o f eighteenth-century letters , written , for the most part , by
Hester	PERSON	, Lady
Newdi	PERSON	- gate , and addressed to Sir
Roger Newdigate	PERSON	, of
Arbury	ORGANIZATION	in
Warwickshire	LOCATION	.

		The volume is so named from the fact that in
Arbury	LOCATION	we may find the original of
George Eliot	PERSON	's
Cheverel Manor	PERSON	, Sir
Roger	PERSON	and his wife being the models for Sir
Christopher	PERSON	and
Lady Cheverel	LOCATION	, while their protfyS ,
Sally Shilton	PERSON	, was the Caterina of '' Mr.
GilfiTs	PERSON	Love-Story . ''

		The Arbury history was well-known in the
Evans	PERSON	family , for
Robert Evans	PERSON	, the father of the novelist , was bailiff on the estate , and his first wife not
George Eliot	PERSON	's mother had been a u friend and servant '' of the household .

		The bailiff 's little daughter , accom - panying him on his business errands , had constant glimpses of the great house , and heard , doubtless , much gossip of the great people ; what with recol - lection and with tradition , therefore , she possessed ample material , in later years , for her charming and pathetic story .

		The interest of the letters , however , lies not at all in their testimony to the novelist 's truth , but in the details which they give of eighteenth - century life and manners , and in their portrayal of that sprightly and sensible woman , the writer .

		One may read here of
London	LOCATION	,
Buxton	PERSON	, and
Brighton	LOCATION	, as they existed a hundred years ago ; of English lodging-houses and inns and country roads of the same period ; of long journeys by coach and of short ones by chair ; and of some characteristic dinners and suppers , described in all leisure and simplicity .

		One may read also of a lady of quality , who takes the world with much wisdom and no little wit , who manages her affairs with a firm hand , and who makes to Sir
Roger	PERSON	a very tactful and comfortable wife .

		The book is edited by Lady
Newdigate	PERSON	-
Newdegate	ORGANIZATION	, and the illustrations are from family portraits , which number among them two Romneys and a
Reynolds	PERSON	.

		For frontispiece there is the fine figure of the old baronet an English gentle - man and scholar , to whom , we may suppose , the publication of these letters was an unimagined indignity .

		It is in complete accord with history as we are accustomed to read it , that Miss
Katharine Prescott Wormeley	PERSON	should have republished her letters from the head - quarters of the
United States Sanitary Commission	ORGANIZATION	during the peninsular campaign in
Virginia	LOCATION	in
1862	DATE	, should have prefaced the work with a somewhat detailed account of the beginnings of the
Sanitary Commission	ORGANIZATION	and the good it did , and have placed the whole at the disposal of her countrymen in time to be useful in the recent war with
Spain	LOCATION	, only to have the mistakes she would have taught them to avoid repeated with such additions as incompetence could invent .

		It is this , and not the human charity and wholesome lack of morbidness in the book -LRB- ' < The Cruel Side of War , ''
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- that makes it such sorrowful reading .

		True , the fevers and wounds of the War of the Rebellion were not the fevers and wounds of the war with
Spain	LOCATION	; but the means provided for the care of the sick and wounded in the former case would have saved many lives and infinite suffering had there been the same awaken - ing to the needs of the gallant men who have with - held nothing from their duty to the country during these last few months .

		Apparently , it is becoming the settled policy of the nation to prepare those entering its service for the reception of pensions .

		THE DIAL The first volume of a new series of biographies entitled American Men of Energy '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is the life of
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, from the pen of Mr.
Edward Robins	PERSON	.

		Excellent judgment is shown in the space allotment for the different portions of Franklin 's diversified career , and the treatment is both fair and accurate .

		Although designedly a '' popular '' biog - raphy , it has decidedly more merit than such books commonly possess .

		The author knows his
Franklin	PERSON	, and he tells the facts forcefully , although at times in language a little frothy .

		The lessons to be derived from the Autobiography , the only case in which a self-made man has left us the recipe of his mak - ing , are not overlooked in the summary of his character .

		Franklin was an ideal '' man of energy , '' and it is to be hoped his successors in the series may be as wisely chosen and as well handled .

Jenkins	PERSON	-RRB- , a sort of phrase-book edited by
M. F. Julien	PERSON	. ''

		Romance and Realism of the
Southern Gulf Coast	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Miss
Minnie Walter Myers	PERSON	, is a very brief and pop - ular history and description , published by
Messrs. Robert Clarke & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It contains much more romance than realism in its sketches and stories of the Indians , the explorers , the Creoles , the Acadians , of
New Orleans	LOCATION	and Beauvoir .

		Though scrappy and amateurish , the book will probably interest many , especially those famil - iar with the scenes and characters described . ''

		Applied Physiology , '' by Dr.
Frank Overton	PERSON	-LRB- Amer - ican
Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is published in two parts , respectively intended for primary and intermediate grades .

		As is usual in books of this sort , an obtrusive amount of atten - tion is devoted to the effects of alcohol upon the human system .

		As an example of the writer 's style we make one quotation : '' While alcohol is harming a man , it makes him feel good . ''

		LITERARY NOTES . ''

		A Brief Course in Qualitative Analysis , '' by Professor
Ernest A. Congdon	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

Albert H. Smyth	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their series of '' Standard En - glish Classics . ''

		A volume of '' Selections from the Prose and Poetry of Walt Whitman '' has been edited by Dr.
Oscar L. Triggs	PERSON	, and published in very attractive style by
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Life and
Administration	ORGANIZATION	of Sir
Robert Eden	PERSON	, '' governor of
Maryland	LOCATION	from
1768	DATE	to
1776	DATE	, by Dr.
Bernard C. Steiner	PERSON	, is published as a '' University Study '' by the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Press . ''

		Armazindy , '' with other and shorter poems , may be found in Volume IX. , just issued , of the uniform edi - tion of Mr.
J. W. Riley	PERSON	's writings , now nearly com - pleted by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons . ''

		A Book of Verses for Children , '' compiled by Mr.
Edward Verrall Lucas	PERSON	, is a happy selection of classified poems and fragments , from a great variety of good au - thors , published in exceedingly tasteful form by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Sir
Benjamin Collins Brodie	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Timothy Holmes	PERSON	, and ``
William Stokes	PERSON	: His Life and Work , '' by Mr.
William Stokes	PERSON	, his son , are two additions to the '' Masters of Medicine '' series , published by Messrs.

Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A Mechanico-Physiological Theory of Organic Evo - lution '' translated from the German of
Herr Carl von Nageli	ORGANIZATION	by Messrs.
V. A. Clark	PERSON	and
F. A. Waugh	PERSON	, is issued by the
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their '' Re - ligion of Science Library . ''

		The

		All Messrs.
Bentley	PERSON	's present publications , and those heretofore issued , will hereafter be published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in
London	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
Luzac & Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us a translation of the Singalese '' Ummagger Jataka '' -LRB- The Story of the Tunnel -RRB- , made by Mr.
T. B. Yatawara	PERSON	, a native Indian official .

		It is a fourteenth century work , rich in human interest , and presenting a vivid picture of the customs , manners , and institutions of a bygone age in
India	LOCATION	. ''


Cuba	LOCATION	at a Glance '' -LRB-
R. H. Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is a pamphlet compilation , historical and descriptive , by Miss
Emma Kautt	PERSON	` man and Miss
Anne O'Hagan	PERSON	, issued under the auspices of the Cuban Junta .

		It is a vehement and now somewhat futile attack on Spanish rule .

		As appendix it has war maps of
Cuba	LOCATION	,
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, and
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Portraits of Turgue ` nieff and
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	appear as the respective frontispieces of two new volumes , Scandinavian and Russian in contents , of the series en - titled '' Stories by Foreign Authors , '' published by Messrs.

		It is the result of over 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, thirty yean of labor , undertaken after a long period of collaboration with Dr.
Spiers	PERSON	in the same line of work .

		Pronunciation ia not indicated except in a few special CMOS , because the author considers it only a lure , and '' entirely out of place in a serious and conscientious work like mine . ''

		Th work is compactly but clearly printed , and may be recommended as one of the best of its kind .

		Under the general title of '' The Churchman 's Library , '' the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish a series of volumes , designed rather for the laity thau for clerical readers , upon subjects '' occupying the attention of church people at the present time . ''

		Over twenty vol - umes have already been arranged for , of which four are now almost ready for publication . ''

		Appletons ' Dictionary of
Greater New York	LOCATION	'' comes to us for
1898	DATE	with the revisions made necessary by the enlargement of the city with which it deals .

		The '' dic - tionary '' plan is probably better than any other for such a guide-book , and we wish that every large city in the country might be provided with so useful and conven - ient a book for the information of visitors .

		The change of the '' Critic '' from a weekly to a monthly leaves THE DIAL in practical possession of the field of distinctively literary jour - nalism in this country .

		From the THE DIAL has absorbed all that the

		... Some will regard the transaction as a surrender of the claims of '' decadent '' literature to the more robust and healthful spirit of lit - erary journalism .

		Others will expect to see THE DIAL clothe itself in dilet - tanteism and bloom forth in paroxysms of rainbow literature .

		We feel quite sure , however , that this last will not happen .

		The editor of THE DIAL prob - ably knows what his readers will toler - ate .

		People are obviously tired of quaint conceits in critical writing ; they desire to have their news and criticism of books presented in as simple and conscientious a form as ... the news of the stock market .

		It further aims at tracing The stream of literature from its Roman fount to the channels of the Gothic period ; at defining the limits of Arabic and Hebrew influence on Spanish letters ; at refuting the theory which assumes the existence of immemo - rial romances , and at explaining the interaction between Spanish on the one side , and Provencal and French on the other .

		It was a true insight which led Professors Foster and
Ray Lankester	PERSON	, the editors of these memoirs , to undertake the work which , begun in this large volume of over six hundred pages , is expected to extend to four volumes in all .

		No fitter memorial to Huxley could be imagined , no more appropriate attempt to uncover to general view the broad foundations upon which his claim to fame and reputation must rest in the future could be conceived , than to publish in collective form the papers which , for well-nigh half a century of scientific activity , he con - tributed to scientific societies and scientific periodicals ... These memoirs have left us with a very decided impression : we have been introduced , as it were , afresh to Huxley the specialist , Fellow of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	at twenty-six , its Royal Medallist at twenty-seven , a mind-producing work of the first order , a figure which looms large and impressive on the imagination . ''

Story of American Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
EDWARD N. WESTCOTT	PERSON	.

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		It has been often pointed out that the most successful American novels have been local studies , genre pictures of particular types and places , like those of
New Orleans	LOCATION	by Mr. Cable , of
New England	LOCATION	by Miss
Wilkins	PERSON	and
Miss Jewett	PERSON	, of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	Oar - land , and the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	.

		Now and then it has happened that a new writer has appeared and has gained general recog - nition by the vividness and force of one local study , like Mr.
Howe	PERSON	with `` The Story of a Country Town . ''

		In the case of `` David Harum '' the conditions have been similar .

		The author has saturated himself with local atmosphere , and he has observed the quaint and delightful type presented in his book until he has been able to offer a picture so vivid , true , and irresistibly humorous that we recognize at once the addition of a new figure to the permanent genre studies in American fiction .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		185 BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		A few months ago , there was widespread dis - cussion concerning the probable effects of the then impending war with
Spain	LOCATION	upon the produc - tion of books in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Arguments were adduced in plenty upon both sides of the question , and it was stoutly maintained , on the one hand , that bookmaking would receive a new stimulus from the clash of arms , and , on the other , that the energies of the public would be diverted from the reading of books , that the activities of authors and publishers would be to a considerable extent paralyzed by the moral and economic shock of the conflict .

		The question thus warmly debated is now by way of getting answered , and the list of forthcoming books , compiled from the announcements of American publishing houses , and printed in the present issue of THE DIAL , settles the debate most emphatically in favor of the contention that book production would be increased rather than lessened by reason of the newly awakened self - consciousness of the American people .

		Had the outcome of the war been less favorable to our arms , or had the strife been unduly prolonged , a different answer might have been given to the question , but the answer which we actually have to record is in the highest degree satisfactory , and it is evident that a season of almost unpre - cedented activity in book-publishing awaits us , and is , indeed , close at hand .

		The list that we published in our announcement number of a year ago was the most extensive that we had ever brought together , comprising , as it did , well over a thousand titles ; but even that list is this year exceeded to the extent of two or three hun - dred additional titles .

		We are justified in con - gratulating all concerned authors , publishers , and readers upon this showing , and in pre - dicting that culture as far as it is affected by the statistics of book-production is about to '' hum '' as it never did before in what Whitman called '' these States . ''

		With so rapidly growing a list to choose from , it becomes every year increasingly difficult , in such a prospectus as this , to single out the few works of greater importance to mention of which we are necessarily restricted .

		The invidiousness of such a selection becomes more and more 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	t evident , and every reader of this brief forecast will doubtless find in the full list as it appears further on in our pages some titles more inter - esting to him personally than those that are mentioned just here ; while the coming year , no less than the years past , will be sure to have its surprises in the shape of the important books that will appear almost unheralded .

		For one thing , we may say that no one book in prospect is entitled to be styled '' the book of the year , '' in the sense in which that name has been deserved , in past years , by such works as the
Life of Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Letters of Lowell	ORGANIZATION	or
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Yet , in spite of this state - ment , there are doubtless many individual read - ers who will find in this list the titles of books which to them personally are of the first im - portance .

		Having said this much in the way of general observation , it remains for us to pick out a few titles that seem particularly deserving of special mention .

		In the department of biography , there is probably no more important work announced than Professor
Knapp	PERSON	's long-heralded '' Life of George Borrow . ''

		The authorized life of
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	, by his son ; the study of
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's life , by Mr.
G. H. Ferris	PERSON	; the '' Life and Character of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Ham	PERSON	- lin
Garland	LOCATION	; and Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's rambling remin - iscences of ``
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	and his Friends , '' are surely among the books that will be awaited with the greatest interest .

		In his - tory , Mr.
Henry Cabot	PERSON	Lodge 's '' Story of the Revolution '' will command a wide audience , as will also the late
C. A. Dana	PERSON	's ''
Recollec	PERSON	- tions of the Civil War . ''

		An announcement of peculiar interest is `` The Underground Rail - road from Slavery to Freedom , '' by Mr.
W. H. Siebert	PERSON	, which will be the first exhaustive account of that movement .

		As for books about the recent war , about the new territories over which the
United States	LOCATION	is to assume control , and about the achievements of the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	they are almost legion , and it would be invidious to a few to the exclusion of the rest .

		In the more serious walks of literature , we have , furthermore , many other titles of great attractiveness .

		Prof
essorGoldwin Smith	PERSON	's '' The United Kingdom , '' Mr.
Benjamin Kidd	PERSON	's -LRB- < The Control of the Tropics , '' Mr.
H. J. Ford	PERSON	's 44 The Rise and Growth of American Politics , '' and a translation of Gneist 's '' History of the English Constitution , '' are a few titles in one department .

		Mr.
A. H. Savage Landor	PERSON	's 4 < Our Expedition to
Tibet	LOCATION	'' will probably take the lead among works of travel and exploration , followed closely by Mr.
Sven Hedin	PERSON	's '' A Jour - ney across
Asia	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Edward Fitzgerald	PERSON	's '' In the Highest Andes , '' Mr.
Eivind Astrup	PERSON	's 44 With
Peary	PERSON	near the Pole , '' and , with a flavor more of literature than of learning , A Cruise under the Crescent , '' by Mr.
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	, who at last breaks a too prolonged silence .

		In philosophy , there will be a four - volume work upon `` The Metaphysics of Expe - rience , '' by Mr.
Shadworth H. Hodgson	PERSON	, and a translation of Professor
Paulsen	PERSON	's '' Ethics . ''

		In theology , two new series , 4t The Churchman 's Library '' and New Testament Handbooks '' occupy the forefront of the field , to say nothing of Dr.
Cheyne	PERSON	's great 4t Dictionary of the Bible , '' in four volumes .

		In music , an announcement of marked interest is the series to be called 44 The Music Lovers ' Library , '' to include vol - umes by Messrs.
Henderson	PERSON	,
Krehbiel	PERSON	,
Finck	PERSON	,
Apthorp	LOCATION	, and others .

		The category of literary history and criticism offers a bewildering array of promising titles .

		There are volumes of essays by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, Mr.
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	, Professor
Kuno Francke	PERSON	,
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	,
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	, and many others .

		A few titles of unusual interest are these :
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and the Lloyds , '' a volume of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's unpublished cor - respondence ;
M. Rostand	PERSON	's 44 Cyrano de Ber - gerac , '' in two translations ; a '' Manual of the History of French Literature , '' by
M. Brune	PERSON	- tiere ; and ''
Petrarch	PERSON	,
First Modern Scholar	ORGANIZATION	and Man of Letters , '' edited by Messrs.
J. H. Robinson	PERSON	and
H. W. Rolfe	PERSON	.

		The important series of 4t Periods of European Literature '' will be carried rapidly on , no less than seven new volumes being announced .

		Turning now to literature in the stricter sense , a word may first be said of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's reprints , which will be as interesting as in past years , or even more so , since they will include so not - able a production as 44 The Germ , '' the four parts reproduced from the rare originals of
1850	DATE	.

		In new poetry , there is nothing as yet promised that is noteworthy , an opinion which hope - less Meredithians will probably think heretical , since the Odes in Contribution to the Song of French History '' is marked for early appear - ance .

		Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	, Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	, Mrs.
Perry	PERSON	, and
Miss Guiney	PERSON	, are among the verse-writers included in the list .

		When it comes to naming works of fiction , we are tempted to throw up our hands in despair .

		A few titles , selected almost at random , are 44 The Day 's Work , '' by Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	, 44 Wild Eelin , '' by Mr.
William Black	PERSON	; Sie -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161 lanka , '' by Mr.
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	; '' The Battle of the Strong , '' by Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	; '' Her Memory , '' by ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	'' ; ''
Gloria Mundi	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	; and '' The Castle Inn , '' by Mr.
Stanley Wey	PERSON	- man .

		The announcement that ''
Alwyn	PERSON	, a
Poetic Romance	ORGANIZATION	, `` written many years ago by Mr.
Theo	PERSON	- dore Watts-Dunton , is at last to be published , will probably arouse in a few persons a more intense interest than is caused by any other book in the long list of works of fiction .

		But we must bring this summary to a close , conscious of the fact that entire departments have been ignored , and the others most inade - quately discussed .

		We say nothing at all of the books in sumptuous garb promised for the holi - day season , partly because the announcements are far from complete , and partly because a mere enumeration of titles is even less fitted to do justice to works of this class than to others .

		For such further information as has thus far been collected , we must refer our readers to the ten or more compactly-printed pages to be found later on in this issue , and trust that they will find many things to their taste beyond what it has been possible to mention in the present rapid survey .

		ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .


London	LOCATION	,
Sept. 3 , 1898	DATE	.

		Since I last wrote to you many things have happened here which seem to me to be fraught with large poten - tialities of change for the future .

		In the first place , the
Committee of the House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, sitting on the question of Copyright , has gathered together a mass of expert evidence which is likely to alter materially com - ing legislation .

		I should not be at all surprised , if we established here a complete bureau for the registration and regulation of all matters relating to copyright with regard to books , prints , photographs , newspapers , criti - cisms , and the rest .

		It has been suggested that regis - tration should be compulsory , and that non-registra - tion shall carry with it the penalty of loss of copyright .

		The manager of the '' Times , '' in his evidence , gave strong expression to his opinion that copyright in news should hold for twenty - four hours ; while a music publisher complained of damage due to piracies from the street piano-organs !

		However , all these matters are , no doubt , to be made plain in the new Copy - right Bill .

		In the second place , we have had launched at us the new three-penny illustrated magazine , from the house of
Messrs. Harmsworth & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Following on this , came a truly lively controversy between these pub - lishers and our largest distributors ,
Messrs. W. H. Smith & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter complained that the terms at which the magazine was supplied did not admit of a profit , if sold at threepence .

		Messrs.
Harmsworth	PERSON	re - torted that they did , and said a few words which hurt .

		The result , however , bears out Messrs.
Smith	PERSON	's conten - tion , for the magazine is now published at threepence halfpenny .

		Even the ordinary bookseller found that the difference between the cost price and selling price barely covered his working expenses .

		That a three - penny magazine , well produced , is appreciated , may be gathered from the fact that of the first number of
Harmsworth	LOCATION	's venture , over 800,000 copies were sold .

		But the new '' monthly '' is not to have the field all to itself Messrs.
Pearson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce the `` Royal Magazine '' for
October	DATE	.

		I understand it is to out - shine its rival , and will be a genuine threepenny maga - zine ; that is to say , it will be retailed at threepence .

		What to us , here , is the startling part of the announce - ment , is the information that the issue is to be of one million copies .

		In the third place , we have lost one of our oldest publishing houses .

		Messrs.
Bentley & Sons	ORGANIZATION	have vanished in the larger maw of Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	, who have bought up the older house plant , stock , and staff .

		All kinds of speculations have been discussed for the cause of this disappearance , but none seem to me to have hit upon the right one .

		Without a doubt , the
Bentley	LOCATION	house disappeared naturally , for the firm was never one to change with the changing condition of things ; and it speaks for the wisdom of its head , in that he saw his own limitations , and recognized that the times were touching him ungently .

		Not that the busi - ness was not a very excellent one .

		On the contrary , it must have realized large profits , right up to the date of the transfer .

		No , it was simply the fact that it lived and had its being in traditions long out of date .

		You , on your side of the water , can not altogether ap - preciate what an old English publishing house is ; but if you can imagine a man-of-war of the old three - decker type of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's day , fighting one of our modern ironclads , you will get some idea of what com - petition has done for the English publishing business .

		I may say that there are further rumors of other amalgamations even more startling , if true , than this of the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-
Bentley	LOCATION	settlement .

		It all comes to this , that the magazine has almost ousted from the attention of the reading public all books , other than those which the public acknowledge of first importance .

		I am of opinion , that the future of publishing , in this country at any rate , will be widely different from what it is now .

		It seems to me that it will be in the hands of a very few larger syndi - cates , and the small publisher , like the small trades - man , will be compelled to go to the wall .

		And this applies , also , to our second and third-rate writers , particularly novelists .

		So long as the libraries recog - nized the three-volume novel , so long was the small publisher assured of a definite , if not princely , income ; and so long did the second-rate writer find a market for his wares .

		But the disappearance of the `` three decker '' has resulted in disastrous effects .

		Six shillings is too much to pay for ephemeral reading , and the libraries have not increased their orders proportionately to the decrease in price .

		Moreover , the magazine gives all the reading that is wanted , and there are enough of them , in all conscience .

		The small pub - lisher must give up publishing , and the second-rate author must take to journalism .

		So much for history and speculation thereon .

		What - ever they may not do in the future , it is very certain publishers are not idle in the present .

		Already , our journals devoted to literary matters are crowded with 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, '' gossip '' and announcements .

		But such news may be stale to you ; and I will , therefore , confine myself to telling yon what you may not have heard .

		Neither Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	nor Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	will publish any book this autumn .

		The former has almost finished a story dealing with
Rome	LOCATION	, but this will not be issued until next
autumn	DATE	.

		You may have beard that his next book is to be called `` The Drunkard , '' and to be published in monthly shilling parts .

		Neither of these statements is true .

		Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	will have ready a volume of short stories , probably early next year .

		Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's new novel , to be called `` The Linnet , '' and of whieh he thinks very highly himself , will be issued this season by Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	.

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, who is much improved in health , has set to work finishing a story on which he was engaged before he became so ill .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	will issue through Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	, a companion volume to '' Pickle the Spy , '' to be called '' The Companions of Pickle . ''

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's volume of short stories will come to us this year through Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Pearson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will have ready very shortly Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	's '' The Phantom Army , '' and the same firm are on the eve of publishing Mr.
Cutcliffe Hyne	PERSON	's `` The Adventures of Captain Kettle , '' Mr.
David Christie Murray	PERSON	's `` Despair 's Last Journey , '' and new volumes by
Bret Harte	PERSON	and Mrs.
L. B. Wai	PERSON	- ford .

		For Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	's new story no pub - lisher has , as yet , been found .

		It will probably not see the light this year .

		So much for fiction .

		In biography , we are prom - ised , `` Life of Prince
Charles Edward	PERSON	, '' by
Andrew Lang	PERSON	; Life of
William Morris	PERSON	, '' by
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	; Reminiscences , '' by
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	; '' Memoirs of the Life of

		Mr.
Stanley Lane-Poole	PERSON	has finished his '' History of
India	LOCATION	under the Mogul Dynasty , '' and Professor Camp - bell his '' Religion in Greek Literature . ''

		I notice that
Pollock	PERSON	's monograph on '' Spinoza '' is to be repub - lished , as well as a cheaper edition of Lady
Burton	PERSON	's biography of her husband .

		Of the few art books which are to be published this season , the first to mention is Mr.

		Then come an illustrated sketch of '' The Pre-Raphaelite School , '' and cheaper editions of Mr.
Malcolm Bell	PERSON	's '' Sir

Leighton	PERSON	. ''

		Both these last works will be published by
Messrs. George Bell & Sons	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	, of the
Department of Prints	ORGANIZATION	, in the British Museum , has finished an excellent study of '' The Masters of Mezzotint , '' which Messrs.
Bell	PERSON	will also issue .

		It is to be illustrated by about sixty examples , reproduced in collotype .

		Of collected editions we are to have in addition to the handsome series of the novels of
Jane Austen	PERSON	, the '' Works of the Sisters Bronte * '' -LRB-
Downey & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; the novels of
Henry Fielding -LRB- Constable & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and a new issue of the complete stories of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	-LRB-

		The biographical edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	is still running , as is also the
Albany	LOCATION	edition of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		An entirely new edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works is announced by Messrs.
Bell	PERSON	.

		It is to be in small pott size , with illustrations by
Byam Shaw	PERSON	,

		Publishers seem unprepared with information .

		I may , however , give you more detailed information later .

		At present , it is more than one 's head is worth to worry busy managers , who have returned from holiday-making , only to find themselves plunged in a ver - itable sea of arrears of work .

		I am glad to say that Mr.
James Garner	PERSON	's version of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	's '' Rubalyat , '' is to have an English publisher .

		I think , when yon see the little book in its English dress , you will feel that we have done it justice .

		I am even gladder to find that Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	's variorum edition of Omar is to be issued here also .

		I can assure yon that the few copies which have reached us , have proved of inestimable value .

		During the present stir about
FitzGerald	PERSON	and his translation , I do not know what three-fourths of our critics and writers on the subject would have done without it .

		Mr.
Dole	PERSON	's `` breviary '' edition , when I have shown it to any publisher , has turned him green with envy .

		The Author 's Society , the
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Booksellers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	have had some more con - fabulations .

		They tell us now that they have arrived at a modus oivendi .

		I do n't believe it .

		They none of them know what they want , or how to get it , if they did .

		Probably , before they meet again , they will have found out some flaw in their arrangements , and the whole scheme , so elaborately prepared , will vanish into thin air .

		The three bodies could , if they were permitted , each bite the heads off the others ; for assuredly , judged by the twaddle , they must have maws big enough .

		How is it possible to discuss to advantage if they do not meet on a common ground of mutual trust ?

		I think it is about time we took them all with a grain or two of humour .

		They M be much more profitable to us thus taken .

		At any rate , we should have a hearty laugh .

		Some day , there '11 be a terrible rumbns , and authors , publishers , and booksellers will then find that they have been beating air all this time .

		CHINA IN TRANSFORMATION .

		* Readers in search of a comparatively short cut to a fair general comprehension of the
Far Eastern	ORGANIZATION	question in its present aspects will find in Mr.
Archibald R. Colquhoun	PERSON	's ''
China	LOCATION	in Transformation '' a book well suited to their needs .

		The author has , it must be premised , very pronounced and definite views of his own on that '' question , '' and he has made up his mind thoroughly as to the course
England	LOCATION	ought to pursue in regard to it .

		The '' Russian Bogy '' haunts Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	's fancy to a degree that makes him something of an alarmist ; and his book , when we regard it on its doctrinal or theo - retical side , may be fairly described as a tract -LRB- and a very plausible one it is , if we admit the author 's premises -RRB- in support of the view which has gained ground somewhat rapidly of late that
Russia	LOCATION	's impending advance from the north toward the cynosural Yang-tsze region must be anticipated and countervailed by a corres - ponding move on
England	LOCATION	's part from the south , if
Asia	LOCATION	and eventually the whole world are to be saved from the ultimate dominion of the Slav .

		In other words , Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	is a stalwart advocate of the '' forward policy , '' at least so far as
England	LOCATION	's Burman-Chinese frontier is concerned .

		Palmerstonian methods are what he sighs for to safeguard
Britain	LOCATION	's markets in the
East	LOCATION	.

		How far his views may be modified now that the Czar of all the Russias would seem to have thrown up the role of Genghiz Khan -LRB- which Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	in so many words im - putes to him -RRB- for that of Anacharsis Clootz , it would be interesting to know ; but we venture to say he will view the disarmament manifesto as only another instance of Muscovite cunning , compared with which the slyness of Major Bag - stock were candor itself .


Russia	LOCATION	, he will proba - bly argue , comes forward with a proposal to the Powers for a scaling down of military budgets all round at a time when she is rather '' hard up '' herself , and needs a breathing-space to recruit her credit , to push her strategical railways to completion , and to settle and strengthen her - self in the territory she has already wrested from
China	LOCATION	.


Russia	LOCATION	, he may point out , is ex - plicitly anxious that everybody should stop building warships for a while , just after her great rival has out - trumped her by voting thirty *

		millions for naval purposes .

		In fine , as it will be easy for him to show , a season of assured peace will redound just now especially to Rus - sia 's advantage ; therefore she proffers the olive branch .

		But Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	will undoubtedly dread the Russians , et dona ferentes ; and while he may possibly -LRB- as we trust he will -RRB- recognize the personal sincerity of the Czar in proposing to relieve the peoples of the burdens of militarism , he will nevertheless see behind that humane and benignant yet pathetically isolated figure the Ignatieffs ,
Pavloffs	LOCATION	,
Mura	LOCATION	- vieffs the true exponents of those fundamen - tally fixed quantities , Russian statesmanship and ambition .

		As he says : `` Russian ambition is a permanent plant , with its roots struck in the sentiments of over one hundred millions of people .

		It requires no originality in states - manship , but proceeds like a cosmic movement , by its own laws working automatically , the particular men who seem from time to time to be guiding it being but the accidents of the movement ... To parley with such a force is like parleying with the tidal wave .

		Only a sea - wall of solid construction can set bounds to its inflow . ''

		It is time now to say that our author 's inten - sity of conviction as to what ought to be done in the East does not materially affect his clear and concise picture of what is .

		He naturally tends to dwell most on and perhaps slightly overcolor such facts as make for his own views ; but his book is a fair one in the main , presenting just such an account of the actual
China	LOCATION	as will interest the general reader , and be helpful to men of business , politicians , and travellers .

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	brings to his task exceptional qualifications for it .

		Many years of service in
Burma	LOCATION	, first as an engineer , and later as Deputy - Commissioner ; repeated visits to
Siam	LOCATION	, in an official as well as a private capacity ; prolonged stays in
China	LOCATION	as explorer , special correspond - ent of the '' Times , '' and , recently , in connec - tion with important negotiations concerning railway questions such experiences certainly warrant his claim to speak with some authority .

		The volume opens with two preparative chap - ters , the first one setting forth what is necessary for the reader to know of the geography of
China	LOCATION	of to-day , the second outlining the history of
China	LOCATION	's foreign relations .

		Thence Mr.
Colqu	PERSON	- houn passes on to consider in separate chapters the Economic Question , the Question of Com - munications ,
England	LOCATION	's Objective in
China	LOCATION	,
Commercial Development	ORGANIZATION	, Diplomatic Inter - course , the
Native Press	ORGANIZATION	, the Chinese People , Chinese Democracy , the Political Question , etc. .

		It is important for the general reader of Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	's book to grasp at the outset 164 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, the perhaps imperfectly realized fact that the once colossal Chinese Empire , which not long ago covered an area of some four and a half million square miles , is now virtually shrunk to the eighteen provinces of
China	LOCATION	Proper a populous region measuring about one and a half million square miles , and being thus about half the size of
Europe	LOCATION	, or seven times that of
France	LOCATION	.

		The vast tracts lying outside this region are still almost terrce incognita , and are -LRB- except
Manchuria	LOCATION	-RRB- beyond the radius of profitable trade for
England	LOCATION	though still of strategical importance .

		Tibet , for instance , will eventually be occupied by the Russians unless
England	LOCATION	takes steps betimes to prevent it .


Manchuria	LOCATION	is already practically Russian ;
Mongolia	LOCATION	, Hi , and
Kashgaria	PERSON	are the Czar 's whenever it pleases him to occupy them ;
Corea	LOCATION	no longer belongs to
China	LOCATION	, and her ultimate fate still hangs in the balance .

		When we discuss
China	LOCATION	of to-day , then , we mean the eighteen provinces of
China	LOCATION	Proper which , speaking roughly , is bounded on the east by the Yellow and
China	LOCATION	seas , reaching from
Corea	LOCATION	to the
Tongking Gulf	ORGANIZATION	; on the west by Kokonor and
Tibet	LOCATION	; on the south by Tongking and the Shan States ; on the north by
Mongolia	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	reckons the inhabitants of this country at 350,000,000 , a population by no means excessive , being only twelve times that of
England	LOCATION	, while the area which subsists it is thirty times greater .

		It is in its distribution , then , rather than its numbers , that the popula - tion of
China	LOCATION	is remarkable , the pressure on the eastern seaboard and the great water-ways being unparalleled elsewhere , while away from these centres it decreases rapidly .

		About half the area of the eighteen provinces , an acreage of 400,000,000 , is good cultivable land .

		Owing mainly to the infiltration from
Turkestan	LOCATION	, the
Mohammedan	DATE	element in the population is large , even Peking containing some twenty thousand
Mohammedan	PERSON	families .

		Altogether the Moslem population numbers about thirty millions ; and this class , from its numbers and character , must be accounted an important factor as regards the future of
China	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Colqnhoun	PERSON	observes that '' while Christianity , an exotic , seems to be waning in
China	LOCATION	, the change of religion gives to the Chinese convert of Islam the qualities he lacks namely , independence , courage , and devotion . ''

		Passing to the economic question , the author agrees with
Richthofen	PERSON	that '' the slumbering factors of an immense industrial production all exist in
China	LOCATION	. ''

		The soil is eminently rich in the raw material of wealth ; while the do - cile , frugal , incredibly industrious , and supple - fingered Chinaman meets in the highest degree the ideal of an intelligent human machine .

		What is lacking to transform Cathay into a vast hive of the most multifarious industry is primarily the magic impulse of improved com - munications .

		Penetrate to the heart of
China	LOCATION	by rail and water ; force the products of the west into the marts of the interior , so that the Chinaman may see , and covet , and be impelled to work and save in order that he may buy , and the era of a new and awakened
China	LOCATION	is begun .

		In his interesting chapter on Chinese De - mocracy the author touches on the question of the causes of the nation 's longevity .

		Why is
China	LOCATION	an apparent exception to the law that nations , like individuals , must run their allot - ted cycle of youth , maturity , and decay ?

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	does not venture on a full explana - tion of this national vitality that has vanquished all conquerors , but he assigns as a contribu - tory cause of it `` the faculty of local self - government which runs in the Chinese blood . ''

		The Chinese polity is , like our own , broadly and perhaps roughly speaking , a dual one ; but the dualism is with them , in fact if not in theory , far more pronounced than with us .

		The Imperial government plays a small part in the domestic affairs of
China	LOCATION	at large .

		The average Chinaman knows little of it and cares little about it .

		He is conscious of it mainly when it annoys him or fleeces him fiscally ; but he is conversant with his local affairs and knows how to manage them .

		He is mildly interested in the politics of his province , and an active participant in those of his village .

		Thus , amid all their dynastic convulsions the people of
China	LOCATION	have remained unchanged , mainly because they are , in spite of their in - stinct of self-government , a non-political peo - ple , indifferent to affairs of state , and intent on their home concerns and their own business .

		Theoretically ,
England	LOCATION	, in shaping her course in
China	LOCATION	, has her choice of these alternatives : either the '' open door '' policy , which means the upholding by her at all hazards of the integrity of the Chinese Empire against the aggressions of the protectionist powers ; or the '' spheres of influence '' policy , which means that she must tacitly acquiesce in the looming partition of
China	LOCATION	into '' spheres of influence '' and ''
Hin	PERSON	- terlands , '' by joining in the race herself and seeing to it betimes that her own u sphere '' shall be as large and as rich as possible , and also
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 165 that it shall be so situated as to be of strategical advantage to her Indian Empire .

		But , practi - cally , of these alternatives the `` open door '' policy now seems to be illusory .

		England can - not single-handed hold
China	LOCATION	open to the trade of the world and , indeed , the door of Man - churia has already been shut '' with a slam , '' as someone indignantly says in reply to
Lord Salisbury	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	does not distinctly state that the '' open door '' theory must be aban - doned ; but the drift of his argument seems to be that if
England	LOCATION	can not keep open the whole , she must strive to keep open as much as she can ; and that her paramountcy in the rich and popu - lous regions watered by the Yangtsze-Kiang is absolutely essential to the maintenance of her
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	interests .

		This end , which is a matter of life and death for
England	LOCATION	, can only be attained by an effective occupation of the
Upper Yangtsze	ORGANIZATION	, and by developing communications , along that main artery , and by the
West River	LOCATION	, from
Hongkong	ORGANIZATION	, and by railway connection between
Upper Burma	LOCATION	, and through that pro- vince between
India	LOCATION	and central
China	LOCATION	.

		The
Burman Irawaddy	PERSON	may be thus joined by rail with the navigable headwaters of the splendid Yangtsze , and continuity of British territory and influence be established from
Cape Comorin	LOCATION	through
Hindostan	PERSON	,
Burma	LOCATION	, and south-western
China	LOCATION	, up to the future Russian line .

		There will be established the '' solid barrier '' to
Russia	LOCATION	's advance Indiawards through
China	LOCATION	Proper .

		Nor will the '' resolute forward policy '' here outlined redound , Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	urges , to
England	LOCATION	's advantage alone .

		It is high time , he thinks , and rightly , that the
United States	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Australasia	LOCATION	set themselves diligently to study these Far Eastern movements .

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	does not suggest directly how the tremendous railway and kindred opera - tions he advocates are to be financed ; but we may assume that he means that the British government must take the initiative , and thus embark upon the , for it , novel function of as Lord Salisbury recently expressed it '' trac - ing out plans for railways in foreign countries , constructing railways in all directions , finding capital and capitalists , and so forth . ''

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	's book tells the reader concisely what is most necessary to be known of the present situation in
China	LOCATION	, and it tells him ex - plicitly how the best informed of the `` for - ward '' school would like to deal with it indeed we may say , now that Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	has gone out to
India	LOCATION	as viceroy , how it is not unlikely to be dealt wifh .

		A NEW BOOK ON AN OL.D THEME .

		* There are two ways of writing history , as there are two ways of telling a story .

		The first way is for the historian to write what he has to say just as though it had never been written before .

		It may , indeed , have been written before ; but if so he does not know the fact , or at least does not appear to know it .

		His air is that of a man who is making an important communication that is wholly new and original to his readers .

		The other way assumes that the history has been actually writ - ten but not correctly written , that the reader is familiar with this earlier form and has been influenced by it , and that it is the business of the writer not merely to tell him the truth , but so to tell it as to displace the false history that is in the reader 's mind .

		The writer is thor - oughly conscious of the fact that he is not making a new or original contribution to the knowledge of his readers ; on the other hand , he is conscious of the contrary at every step .

		Again , he may show this consciousness in two different ways .

		He may go on with his narra - tive without formal criticism of the history that he is all the time seeking to destroy , but still keep this history all the time in mind ; or he may engage in such criticism , and so become a con - troversialist .

		These are all legitimate methods of writing history under certain conditions , and we have no right , prima facie , to find fault with a writer because he uses any one , or indeed all , of them .

		He must adapt his method to his work .

		These two ways of writing his - tory may be called the narrative method and the critical method .

		Mr.
Alexander Brown	PERSON	's '' First Republic in
America	LOCATION	'' falls under the controversial form of the critical method .

		He all the time has an antagonist in mind .

		We do not say that he holds a brief , but we do say that he writes to maintain a thesis , or rather two theses , a major and a minor .

		The major thesis touches the character of the government of
Virginia	LOCATION	pre - vious to the quo warranto of
1624	DATE	; the minor affects the character and the services in Vir - ginia of Captain
John Smith	PERSON	.

		The first thesis is suggested by the title of the book :
Virginia	LOCATION	was the first republic in
America	LOCATION	, or , more definitely , the
London	LOCATION	Company was a semi - nary , not of '' sedition , '' as the Spanish minis - * THE FIRST REPUBLIC IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		An Account of
the Origin of this Nation	ORGANIZATION	, written from the record , then -LRB- 1624 -RRB- concealed by the
Council	ORGANIZATION	rather than from the histories then licensed by the Crown .

		By
Alexander Brown	PERSON	, D.C.L.
Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		166 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ter said , but of popular rights .

		In the author 's own words : The
London	LOCATION	Company of 1609-24 ... had been a cradle of civil and religious liberty ; in it were fostered the ideas which were the germ of the
Commonwealth of England	ORGANIZATION	and the genesis of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		As respects
John Smith	PERSON	, the contention is not that the Pocohontas tale is a myth ; on this point little is said but that
Smith	PERSON	was a fac - tious , vainglorious adventurer , the apologist and eulogist of
James I.	PERSON	, and corrupter of the very sources of our national history .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	does not doubt that
Smith	PERSON	was a brave man , or deny that he is deserving of some praise for gome things which he did in
Virginia	LOCATION	; but `` He was not a hero nor a saint ; he was not the founder of
Virginia	LOCATION	, nor the father of
New England	LOCATION	.

		Inspired by his controlling trait , vanity , he provided for his present and future fame by catering to the ideas of the king ; by furnishing his own eulogy in the various tracts and books published by himself , and in the notes , etc. , supplied by him to others ; and by leaving -LRB- in his will -RRB- 20 -LRB- more than twice as much as his contribution 9 to
Virginia	LOCATION	-RRB- , to be disbursed in his own funeral expenses .

		Ue would really have been more deserving of our respect if he had been guiltless of doing some of these things ; yet he has been regarded as ' the only man in
Virginia	LOCATION	' because he was the only man who did these things .

		Vanity of vanities , all is vanity . '

		Very many more modest and more worthy men lie unhonored and unknown beneath the sacred soil of the Old Dominion .

		... Our first history , founded on the vanity of
King James	LOCATION	and Captain
John Smith	PERSON	, is a shame , and we can - not mend the matter by canonizing its author , or by defending its errors .

		We must correct its wrongs and render justice to our real founders . ''

		This is Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's task : he undertakes to write our early history as it should be written , and so to write it as to displace the false his - tory that has so long found acceptance .

		Merely to pronounce upon the important questions that he raises , would be stale and unprofitable ; and to traverse the ground with him , would take us too far afield .

		So we must be content with offering some remarks on two or three of the more interesting features of the book .

		As to
John Smith	PERSON	, it is the same with him dead that it was with him living : he still sets men by the ears .

		He was a prisoner in irons when he reached
Virginia	LOCATION	, was engaged in quarrels nearly all the time that he was there , and while at the head of the government insisted on governing alone .

		Smith may have been right in all these transactions , and everybody else wrong ; but it must be said of this hypoth - esis , as of so much else in his career , possi - ble but not probable .

		We see no prospect of men ever agreeing about
Smith	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	, for example , differs from Mr.
Alexander Brown	PERSON	respecting him toto celo .

		Smith 's writ - ings remind Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	's '' Memoirs '' by their stamp of honesty upon every page , and he considers him one of the noblest and most lovable characters in
Ameri	LOCATION	- can history .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's theory of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	is really a part of his theory of
Virginia	LOCATION	and the
London	LOCATION	Com - pany .


Virginia	LOCATION	was the first republic in Amer - ica , and if it has not so appeared to men it is because Smith falsified the early history .

		But how could he do this ?

		The great promoters of the colony were men of grand ideas and noble spirit ; they sought , while keeping the institutions of
Virginia	LOCATION	in conformity with the laws of
England	LOCATION	, to advance civil and religious liberty in the plantation , and they were finally balked , in so far as they were balked , by the mean , narrow , and oppressive policy of James I. No one familiar with the facts is likely to ques - tion this view of the matter .

		In particular , no one who reads Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's pages is likely to question the high character and noble ideals of Sir
Edwin Sandys	PERSON	.

		The facts , too , seem to show that
Smith	PERSON	was ranged on the King 's side rather than the founders ' side .

		The great ques - tion is simply whether the government under the Company was so bad , and the history of the colony so disastrous , that the King was justified in forcing
Virginia	LOCATION	, by means of the quo war - ranto , out of their hands .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's theory is that
Smith	PERSON	and the King were virtually in collusion ; that his accounts of things in Vir - ginia forwarded the royal purpose ; while the destruction of one part of the Company 's record and the long concealment of another part left
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's accounts mainly unchallenged .

		On this point we are bound to think the author has been somewhat carried away by his enthusiasm for the Company and his detestation of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of the most interesting passages in the volume relate to the origin and propagation of the ideas that
Sandys	PERSON	and his associates sought to plant in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	is a Church - man , but over and over again he points to Gen - eva as theybns et origo of the republican move - ment .

		Still Mr.
Brown	PERSON	appears anxious that the Church of
England	LOCATION	shall have due meed of praise for the good work done in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Although civil and religious liberty was planted in
America	LOCATION	under the inspiration of the liberal ideas then budding in
England	LOCATION	, which were largely derived from an admiration impressed on the minds of English stu - dents for the form of government established for
Geneva	LOCATION	by
Calvin	PERSON	and the Reformers , the accomplishment of these ' popular ' ideas was due to the popular charters of the
Virginia	LOCATION	Company of
London	LOCATION	drafted by Sir

Edwin Sandys	PERSON	, ' a Church of
England	LOCATION	man ' and a son of one of the heads of that
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		For it was under these charters that the seed was planted both in
South	LOCATION	and in
North Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Sufficient honor rightly belongs to the Pilgrim Fathers to make it unnecessary to take for them any honor which rightly belongs to others ; and , after giving all due credit to others , it must be confessed that civil and religious liberty in the new world owe their first debt to broadminded Churchmen , and to the liberality of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	, which was also the great factor in holding
America	LOCATION	for the Anglo-Saxon against the Church of
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		Here is matter for a dissertation , but we have space only for the reflection that in distributing the honors of the period of 1606-1624 , it is easy to make quite too much of such words as '' pilgrim , '' '' puritan , '' and '' churchman . ''

		Puritanism was not separated from Anglican - ism by a flash of lightning , while there was sometimes little difference between the Pilgrim and the Churchman except the external fact that one was out of and the other in the Estab - lishment .

		We have barely space left to speak of the valuable service that Mr.
Brown	PERSON	rendered his - torical scholarship by his '' Genesis of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The present work is an out - growth of that one .

		The earlier work was a compilation of historical documents , with pref - ace , introduction , and annotation ; the later one purports to be history itself .

		It is not an easy book to read .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's style tends to heavi - ness , while the great number of quotations that he introduces , sometimes whole documents , re - inforces the tendency .

		He has prepared a val - uable book for his purpose , the more valuable because it is heavy ; but his most ardent ad - mirer need not hesitate to admit that he will hold his place in literature as a purveyor of historical material rather than as an historian .

		His patience in search of documents seems to be tireless , and his judgment as to their value is commonly sound ; but the historian 's art he has not B. A.

		morality , and especially upon
Darwin	PERSON	's evolu - tionary scheme as sketched in his '' Descent of Man . ''

		The author describes '' full half '' of his book as being '' a detailed expansion of the fourth and fifth chapters of the ' Descent of Man . ' ''

		Mr.
Sutherland	PERSON	maintains that the moral instinct originates and grows with sym - pathy , and that sympathy is implied in the pa - rental care which springs up quite early in the evolution of life as a more advantageous method than careless fertility .

		He shows clearly how from fish , which without parental care require a million eggs a year to keep up the species , the number of offspring is steadily diminished in succeeding types till in apes and man one in two years is the average . ''

		The connection between this decline in the numbers of offspring and the general rise of intelligence is very clear , when we reflect that in the stupendous engulf - ment of life which the world 's daily history presents , only the development of remarkable faculties could save a race from destruction if a single young one each year from each female was its sole reliance .

		And there is no sort of progress more essential in this regard than that advance of parental care which serves to carry the feeble young ones over their initial dangers . ''

		A large part of the first volume is taken up with a careful and interesting study of the progress of parental care in fishes , amphibians , reptiles , birds , mammals , and mankind ; and a like study is made of conjugal and general so - cial sympathy .

		Both conjugal and social sym - pathy awaken and are developed in connection with parental sympathy , and perform the great - est service in the advancement of the species .

		u The quality of sympathy whose origin was so hum - ble that in fish and reptile its function was merely to facilitate the hatching of the better type in a world of ceaseless struggle and destruction , has risen by perfect continuity to form the basis of the most beautiful of all things that earth contains : a moral nature swayed by impulses of pure and tender sympathy . ''

		The second volume discusses the four forms of morality to which sympathy gives rise .

		First of all , primitive simple sympathy is itself a natural morality . ''

		The man who never fails of kindliness in his rela - tions as father , husband , brother , friend , or citizen , is a good man .

		There are three higher stages he may yet attain .

		There is the morality of duty , the morality of self-respect , and there is the morality which springs from an ideal of the beauty of goodness .

		But these by themselves are weak and pretentious things when they want their natural basis , a true and warm-hearted sym - pathy .

		Sympathy , or , as it is there called , love , is the basis of morality ; indeed , is morality in the religions of Jesus and Buddha . ''

		The feeling of duty Mr.
Sutherland	PERSON	derives from the social pressure on the individual of the average sympathy of the race .

		Men every - 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, where are restrained and impelled by the stand - ard of their community and nation .

		`` Morality assumes a very noble aspect when , to sympathy and a cheerful compliance with duty whose auction is external , there is added a complete surrender to that sense of self-respect which is only duty with an internal sanction ... Morality appears in all its noblest guise , when upon these three there is superimposed an u-sthetic glow ; when the sense of right conduct awakens all the enthusiasm that kindles within us at the aspect of aught that is beautiful . ''

		Later in his work , Mr.
Sutherland	PERSON	takes up the subjects of responsibility , right and wrong , and the psychology of sympathy .

		In ignorance of the James-Lange theory , he elaborates for himself a thoroughgoing physiological theory of emotion , that all emotions are due to '' changes of vascular tone . ''

		So '' maternal affection is connected fundamentally with a change of vas - cular tone which causes the yearning tender - ness experienced by the mother at sight of her babe . ''

		The whole process is physiological from the very beginning . ''

		But suppose that in the slow succession of monot - onous ages a slight advance in nerve organization should happen to synchronize with a small tendency on the part of parents to guard their eggs or their offspring , the higher type might , and probably would , thereby escape the effects of its prolonged immaturity .

		And if so , it is very plain that when , under this sheltering con - dition , it did in fact attain its adult state , then would its quicker sense , its subtler brain , its more deftly co - ordinated powers , give it ascendancy over all its fellows . ''

		The main criticism we have to offer on this book is a psychological one .

		The author takes too readily for granted that parental care always implies sympathy , and he nowhere closely de - fines and analyzes sympathy .

		He describes sym - pathy as '' only a general term we give to that subtle susceptibility of nerve which renders one individual ready to catch the contagion of the emotions of another individual . ''

		But surely the mere catching of an emotion from another does not of itself constitute sympathy .

		For instance , panic is contagious fear , but sympathy is usually absent .

		Sympathy is not a mere partaking of the emotions of others , but is a particular kind of an emotion at the emotion or experience of the others , a feeling of pity and a desire to aid .

		Sympathy is , then , a rather advanced and com - plex emotion , and so unlikely to be found in animals unless in slight measure in highest types .

		Offspring are primarily a part of one 's self , or are one 's possession , the primitive prop - erty , and thus parental care in earlier stages may imply only the simple self-conservative emotions , like anger and fear .

		The male stickle - back shows great activity in protecting his young , great rage against their enemies , not necessarily out of sympathy for the young , but because they are of him and his .

		He shows the same spirit as when he defends his captured food against invaders .

		Of course only thor - ough scientific psychological investigation can decide the matter , but the presumption is against sympathy .

		Parental care even in man - kind is largely based on selfish emotion .

		Thus , strike a child and the father 's anger blazes against you for injuring his child ; the pure sympathy comes in if a stranger standing by interferes on the child 's behalf .

		On the whole , while we think this work a con - siderable contribution to the biology of the sub - ject , in its psychology it has effected but little .

		Just what sympathy is , and where it begins in animal life , and how it progresses , can not be solved in any off-hand manner , but only by par - ticular scientific psychological observations and experimentation which have yet to be made .

		In psychology the author shows little aptitude , training , or information .

		While this book dis - plays considerable merit and ability , it exploits a system too dogmatically without consideration of difficulties to be thoroughly convincing ; and its vast range makes it in some respects , despite the author 's industry , rather superficial and cursory .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		A SCHOLARS ' HISTORY OF
GREECE	LOCATION	.

		* The fourth and concluding volume of the English version of
Holm 's History of Greece	ORGANIZATION	has finally been issued , and this important work is now as a whole in the hands of English and American readers for examination and use .

		That it will take high and permanent place as an authority is not to be questioned ; though this has for some years been true of the Ger - man original , which scholars have of course consulted .

		But it is doubtful whether
Holm	PERSON	's history will be widely read or intelligently esti - mated by many outside of professional students .

		In no sense can it be expected to be '' popular '' ; the narrative lacks charm , and the inevitable condensation in treatment makes hard reading in these days of episodical surveys , '' stories of the nations , '' and war sketches .

		Holm has something of the caustic humor and homely telling phraseology of
Mommsen	PERSON	; but his book will remain a brilliant piece of laboratory work rather than literature .

		The translation of the first three volumes has THE HISTOBT OF QKKKCE .

		By

New York	LOCATION	:

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 already been noticed at some length in these columns ; the fourth , now before us , must be briefly considered .

		Its range is '' the
Graeco	PERSON	- Macedonian age , the period of the Kings and the Leagues , from the death of Alexander -LRB- B. C. 323 -RRB- to the incorporation of the last Macedonian monarchy in the Roman empire , '' which took place in the year B. C. 30 .

		This pushes far past the limit -LRB-
Alexander	ORGANIZATION	's death -RRB- set by
Grote	PERSON	, and even beyond the usual 146 B. C. , the terminus of most histories of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Holm 's reasons for this extension of dates are tersely stated in the preface : '' My decision not to end with the year 146 , as I orig - inally intended , will be justified by the narrative .

		It is precisely the larger compass , both in point of time and space , thus given to my history which has enabled me , as I believe , to approximate more closely to an import - ant result ,
viz.	LOCATION	, a proper estimate of the character of the Greek world in this period and in particular of the civic life of the independent cities .

		The relations be - tween
Rome	LOCATION	and the Greeks also seemed to me not to have been always correctly appreciated ... finally , I may point out that the self-government of the Greeks under the supremacy of the Kings and the Romans , on which I have laid stress , is a historical fact of some importance ; and that consequently the study of this section of ancient history may be more profitable than some authorities of our day seem to think . ''

		It is precisely the novelty of these varied chapters on the civilization of the kingdoms set going by the Diadochi that will compensate the thoughtful student for the apparently scattered effect of the volume as a whole .

		When a world - empire like that of Alexander breaks to pieces , the task of its historian , hitherto simple , be - comes distracting ; and a dozen scholars may more profitably produce monographs than any one of them may attempt to cover the ground .

		Holm has coordinated , digested , and sometimes opposed the conclusions of his predecessors ; he has read to confute , in many instances ; but his views will command the respect , if not the ac - ceptance , of all scholars .

		At any rate , here is a clear and well-balanced summing-up of one of the most perplexing portions of ancient history .

		The fourth volume continues the excellent features of the other three ; and adds the long - awaited index , which might be somewhat more minute .

		We learn , also , the name of the trans - lator : it is
Frederick Clarke	PERSON	, formerly Tay - lorian scholar in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The full and accurate lists of authorities ap - pended to each chapter are as valuable as ever ; and the references to revisions of great stand - ard works , such as the Pauly-Wissowa Real - encyclop ` ddie , are quite up to date .

		We may note the frequent mention of an American scholar , Professor
Sterrett	PERSON	of
Amherst	LOCATION	as an ac - cepted guide in the archaeology of
Asia	LOCATION	Minor .

		The translation seems more carefully done than in the preceding volumes : the English style is well considered ; and there are very few slips in grammar or proof-reading to offend the eye . ''

		Memmon '' -LRB- p. 94 -RRB- for Memnon , the omission of the historian
Freeman	PERSON	's first initial -LRB- p. 269 -RRB- , '' North America '' -LRB- p. 270 -RRB- for the
United States	LOCATION	, and an inexcusable '' was de - feated like Dionysius had been at
Gela	LOCATION	, '' nearly complete the tale ; and there are a few minor inconsistencies in spelling .

		On the whole ,
Holm	PERSON	's History of
Greece	LOCATION	will be immensely prized by the world of scholars for whom it was written .

		PAPERS FROM THE WORLD 'S FAIR FOLK-I ^ ORE CONGRESS .

		* Long delayed , but none the less welcome , is the Report of the
International Folk-Lore Congress	ORGANIZATION	held in
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1893	DATE	one of the most successful of the long series of Congresses held at the time of the Exposition .

		The papers read were of more than usual popular as well as scientific interest .

		This success was in large part due to the energy and able management of Lieut.
F. S. Bassett	PERSON	, who was chief interpreter and translator of the Exposition and at the same time chairman of the Folk-Lore Con - gress .

		Mr.
Bassett	PERSON	died in
October of 1893	DATE	.

		Very fittingly , a notice of his life and work appears in this volume .

		Mythical and traditional beliefs , native songs , peculiar customs and institutions which have survived from the past that is , folk - lore are to be found in every land .

		As wide in range as the subject itself were the papers read at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and now published in the first volume of the archives of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fifty-six papers were presented by students of folk-lore from all parts of the world .

		Some of them , as now printed , are very brief , or are merely collections of folk-tales or accounts of popular practices ; while others are careful interpretations and studies of myths and tales .

		Detailed reference to them all is of course impossible .

		One or two which seem of especial interest and importance may be noticed .

		170 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, pages , discusses '' The Northern Trolls . ''

		Scan - dinavia is a country rich in mythical lore .

		These trolls , or dwarfs , have been looked upon in re - cent times as mythical beings existing only in the stories of the people .

		There seems , how - ever , good reason to believe that there did live in
Northern Europe	LOCATION	at one time a people small in stature , dwarfs or pigmies , smaller than the Lapps and occupying the country before them .

		Scandinavian traditions describe these dwarfs in considerable detail .

		Mr.
MacRitchie	PERSON	, fol - lowing Professor
Nilsson	PERSON	, draws an interesting parallel between these people and the Lapps a parallel so striking that there seems little dif - ficulty in identifying them , at least in part , and so making the dwarfs a real people .

		Mr.
Mac	PERSON	-
Ritchie	PERSON	goes further , and shows that the
Norse	ORGANIZATION	- men for several centuries '' applied the three terms ,
Lapp	PERSON	, troll , and pigmy , to one people on the western shores of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		Here in
America	LOCATION	, then , it appears a small people was living when the Norsemen landed .

		They may have been the
Eskimo	LOCATION	; or , since there are tra - ditions among the
Eskimo	LOCATION	, as among the Lapps , of a still smaller folk who lived in caves under ground , it may be that the Eskimo were pre - ceded on the American coast by a race of dwarfs .

		The trolls of
Northern Europe	LOCATION	and the dwarfs of
America	LOCATION	, Mr.
MacRitchie	PERSON	sug - gests , were the ancestors of the
Ainu of Eastern	ORGANIZATION
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Several characters , notably the shaggy skins , point to a connection between them .

		While this does not seem to be proved , few will hesitate to accept the pigmies of
Scandinavia	LOCATION	as a reality , and no one will fail to see the value in ethnological study of attention to mythical and traditional lore .

		As Mr.
W. E. Griffis	PERSON	points out in his discussion of the folk-lore of
Japan	LOCATION	, `` The folk-lore is often a distorted shadow of real history , while also it is true that the events of prehistoric times are brought before us by means of the folk-tales handed down to us from ages older than writing in
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		Somewhat incidentally , one gains from these papers a considerable knowledge of various peoples , aside from their folk-lore .

		In
Western Russia	LOCATION	, on the shores of the Baltic , live the Lithuano-Latavian people , numbering a little less than five millions .

		They are very interest - ing in themselves , and especially in that it has been claimed for them , with much reason , that they are the nearest representatives , in their speech , of the original Aryans .

		The Latavian branch of this once important people , better known as Lettonian or Lettish , numbers to-day about a million and a half .

		A lover of the Latavians Dr.
Henry Wissendorff	PERSON	has written a brief sketch of them , their history , industry , intelligence , and progress .

		As might be expected in a people as old as they , there is to be found among them an abundance of tales , traditions , and peculiar customs , which , when carefully studied , are certain to yield much of value to European history and ethnology .

		From the two papers discussed , some idea will be gained of the contents of this volume .

		While the papers are valuable in themselves , a still greater value it is believed will be found in the lines of study indicated and in the incen - tive to further investigation which they will prove .

		The book contains illustrations of ob - jects of ethnologic interest , and portraits of some members of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	whose papers are here published .

		THE DIAL 171 enough in the narrative to have warranted its use upon the title-page .

		It is a powerful work of fiction , imbued with the Nietzschean scorn of conventional morality that sweeps like a wind-storm through so much of recent German literature .

		Stagnant waters need to be stirred at times , in literature as else - where , but whether the philosophy of the
Ueber	PERSON	- mensch and the Umwerthung oiler Werthe is likely to stir them to healing effect is at least doubtful .

		Its sweep has a bracing effect , at any rate , and its strength is undeniable , whether associated with poe - try , as in '' Die Versunkene Glocke , '' or relying upon no such ally , as in the uncompromising and almost brutal novel now under consideration .

		The period is that of the War of Liberation , but the problem is rather of the present era than of the year that witnessed the last gigantic struggle against the Corsican brigand .

		The hero is an East Prussian
Junker	PERSON	who has sought to wipe out , by fighting for the Fatherland , the stain left upon his name by the treachery of his father .

		He finds all society leagued against him , in spite of his own heroic deeds , and is thrown back upon the sole companionship of the woman who had been his father 's associate in more kinds of sinful conduct than one .

		Abhorring her at first , he comes in time to tolerate , recognizing that she , at least , had sinned through ignorance , and believing a dangerous sophistry that she had remained pure in soul .

		Finally , when she has died to save his life , his volte-face is completed , and one can not easily forget the scene in which he buries her with his own hands , and sets a broken statue of Diana above her grave as a tombstone .

		The pastor appears and offers Christian burial for the deceased . ''

		Many thanks , your reverence , but I have already buried her with Pagan rites . ''

		This is the note of final revolt , and clearly what the author would have us take as the essential moral of the whole action .

		It is an ideal that will never win permanent accept - ance , but its influence will be hard to combat , and the strife will be sharp .

		Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	, in the romance completed shortly be - fore his death , has left the mediaeval Germans of Nuremberg and returned to the Greeks in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The hero of `` Arachne '' is the sculptor Hermon whose descendants made
Pergamon	LOCATION	famous in the history of art , and wrought the gigantic works that are the wonder of the
Berlin	LOCATION	museum .

		All this , however , is merely suggested at the close of the romance , just as the career of
Erasmus	ORGANIZATION	is suggested at the close of '' The Cloister and the Hearth . ''

		The substance of '' Arachne '' is a tale of jealous passion , ending in a tragedy for the heroine , and all but wreck - ing the life of the hero .

		It is stiff and wooden in con - ception , although rather less so than the later works of this writer have been wont to be , and the interest , both romantic and archaeological , is considerable .

		Readers of '' The Keds of the Midi , '' as trans - lated from the Provencal of
M. Felix Gras	PERSON	by Mrs.
Janvier	PERSON	, will welcome a continuation of the narrative done into English by the same skilful hands .

		The vividly picturesque story of the march to
Paris	LOCATION	of the famous Marseillaise batallion offers one of the most truthful pictures in romantic fiction of the stirring scenes of the early revolutionary days , when mankind seemed to have recovered a long lost birth - right , and when the deepest and most generous instincts of the human soul were endowed with a new life .

		Those days of fine enthusiasm were , as history sadly relates , followed by days so dark that it seemed for a time as if the Revolution had set back the hand upon the dial of human progress instead of moving it forward , and in '' The Terror ''
M. Gras	PERSON	depicts for us the horrors of the Year One of the Republic .

		Pascalet does not figure in this sequel , but the winsome
Comtessine Adeline	PERSON	whom he loved , and who remained through all vicissitudes true to his memory , is ever present as the centre of interest , and her pursuit by , and final escape from , the scoundrels who were seeking her life forms the substance of the tale .

		It is essentially an intimate and even homely view of the Terror that we get from these pages , not the unmixed sensationalism of most works of the sort , although lurid scenes are not lacking , and although blood flows profusely upon many occasions .

		But peace follows the storm at last , and sunset light falls upon the closing scenes in
Avignon	LOCATION	.

		There is no excuse for such a publication as '' The Red Lily . ''

		It pretends to be a translation of '' Le Lys Rouge , '' by
M. Anatole France	PERSON	, and , as trans - lations go , it is no worse or more reckless than hun - dreds of others .

		But it is almost sacrilege to treat
M. France	LOCATION	in this brutal fashion , and the book clearly appeals to the sensuality rather than to the artistic interest of its readers .

		The wonderful style that makes its original so beautiful that we half excuse its unashamed utterance has disappeared utterly in the present version , and little is left us save a vulgar tale of passion .

		No wonder that the translator is ashamed to set his name to the thing .

		`` The Fire of Life , '' by Mr.
Charles Kennett Burrow	PERSON	, is a remarkably well-written and pleasing work of fiction , compounded of the elements that are most familiar to novel-readers , yet made fresh and charming by skilful treatment .

		It is true that '' the fire of life , '' as it appears to the author , is a sentimental glow rather than a volcanic outburst of passion , and the book might safely be admitted to a
Sunday	DATE	School collection .

		But it deserves a wider audience than it could secure in that way , for , within its limitations , it is a successful produc - tion , sweet , wholesome , and almost strong . ''

		The Millionaires '' is a story of English society by Mr.
F. Frankfort Moore	PERSON	, who has done work so much better in the past that we hardly recognize his hand in the present case .

		In his effort to show how appallingly clever he can be he makes all of his characters speak a language as unlike that of rational human beings as could easily be imagined .

		If the novel were frankly put forward as a burlesque like '' The Londoners '' of Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	it might pass muster ; but there is unfortunately only too much evidence that the author expects to be taken seriously , which it is quite impossible to do .

		172 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	,
John	PERSON	of Strathbourne '' is an unusually satis - factory romance of adventure in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	during the stirring days of the early sixteenth cen - tury .

		It is the kind of story that Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	and others have told so many times , hut no hotter , to our thinking , than the comparatively unknown pres - ent writer .

		There are perils and escapes without end , and the usual haughty and high-born maiden who scorns the hero at first , and throws herself into his arms at the close .

		We can heartily commend it for entertainment with a modicum of instruction .

		Mr.
Frank Savile	PERSON	, who by way of childish mysti - fication spells his name backward , is the author of ``
John Ship	PERSON	,
Mariner	ORGANIZATION	, '' a reasonably stirring tale of the Spanish Armada .

		The hero is an English youth who runs away from home , sails to
Guinea	LOCATION	with
Hawkins	PERSON	, is captured by Spaniards and falls a vic - tim to the Inquisition .

		Forced to sail as a pilot with the Armada , he escapes in the storm and lands upon the
Faroe Islands	LOCATION	, where he wins both love and fortune , the latter in the shape of the treasure contained in a sunken Spanish galleon .

		The story is like a hundred others of the sort , told in the first person for the sake of the hero 's children , and well managed as to its episodes and its outcome .

		In '' The Making of a Saint '' we have a story of fifteenth-century Italian life intrigue , amorous adventure , and assassination being its chief elements .

		The scene is
Forli	LOCATION	, and the action relates to the con - spiracy against a tyrant , who is murdered , and the revenge taken upon the murderers by his vindictive widow .

		Somewhat abruptly , we learn at the close that the narrator and principal figure became a monk , but this is not enough to account for such a title as is given to the romance .

		There is nothing to indi - cate the '' making , '' in any psychological sense , of '' a saint '' out of the swaggering adventurer who tells the story , nothing , in fact , anywhere in the book , to make it more than an artificial surface chronicle of such incidents as made up the substance of aristo - cratic life in every Italian state during the age of the despots . ''

		When Knighthood Was in Flower '' is a histor - ical romance of
England	LOCATION	in the sixteenth century , having for its theme the love of
Charles Brandon	PERSON	, later
Duke of Suffolk	ORGANIZATION	, and the Princess
Mary Tudor	PERSON	, sister of
King Hal	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is written in the familiar manner of affected archaism , and makes , as most such productions do , the impression of a group of moderns in historical masquerade .

		But the heroine is delineated in a very winsome way , and both plot and incident are skilfully managed .

		Read without too exacting a mind , there is much entertainment to be got from this story .

		One of the characters in '' The Moral Imbeciles '' is an admitted lunatic , and most of the others would seem to be promising candidates for an asylum .

		Things are all topsy-turvy in this farcical perform - ance .

		The hero is a reformed forger who becomes a street-car conductor , and makes desperate love to the ugly heroine a woman with an aggressive sense of duty who is yet morally as imbecile as any of the queer people with whom she is associated .

		There is another heroine , described as beautiful , who always contrives to have her own way , and ends by marrying a country bumpkin .

		The most amusing figure in this gallery is that of the lunatic , and he at least does not keep us puzzled in the attempt to fit his words and acts into any kind of rational scheme .

		Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	, whose strong novel , '' The Descendant , '' attracted much attention a year or so ago , has published a second story with the strange title , '' Phases of an Inferior Planet . ''

		What this means we hardly venture to say .

		Mercury and
Venus	PERSON	are the only inferior planets known to astron - omy , and
Miss Glasgow	LOCATION	's story is distinctly one of this mundane sphere .

		Probably the title aims to suggest the faultiness of earthly existence , an impression fortified by perusal of the novel , which tells us of human lives turned awry in the most perverse fashion .

		We can hardly wax sympathetic over a hero who learns nothing more from suffering than to make his career a living lie , and the heroine , winsome as she is in the earlier chapters , loses hold upon our interest when she deserts her husband for a life of ease such as he is unable to secure for her .

		The book has alternations of vivacity and sombre strength that make it undeniably interesting , but seems to be based upon no controlling idea except that of two mismated people , and the wretchedness that invades the life of husband and wife when neither of them can possibly understand the tem - perament of the other .

		Everybody is praised and en - couraged and helped .

		The precise rela - tion to their originals of the several stories of which the book is made up does not wholly appear , but the book has as a whole a good deal of the charm of the true peasant legend of
France	LOCATION	.

		For now neo-Celticism , having struck the lyre of
Taliesin of Wales	LOCATION	, of Garselit '' the Irishman whom it is safe to follow , '' of de-Macphersonized
Ossian	PERSON	, proceeds as it were to strike hands across the sea and arouses the legendary romance of Brittany ; nor is the re - sult unworthy .

		These tales are some ancient , some modern , but all worth reading , for each one has written in it much of charming old-time fancy or thought suffused in something of the old-time atmos - phere .

		There may also be some mystic message , as is common in Neo-Celticism ; but if there is , we content ourselves with Mr.
Gleeson White	PERSON	's remark on the same element as possibly existing in Mr.
Herbert McNair	PERSON	's Celtic designs for furniture : '' If it be present there , '' said he , '' it is too subtly indi - cated to be apparent to a mere matter-of-fact South - erner . ''

		This is as it should be : so long as there is no danger of their being infected with Neo-Celtic doctrine , we are glad that our readers should have the pleasure they may get from this very attractive book . ''

		Essays , Mock-Essays , and Charac - ter Sketches '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of a volume of reprints from the `` Journal of Education , '' that needs no apology .

		With a few exceptions , the papers are worth pre - serving .

		They are mainly of an educational cast , but they are untechnical and appeal to lay as well as professional readers .

		The group of '' Mock - Essays '' seems to call for special comment .

		It con - sists of a group of six brief papers selected from a mass of compositions sent in to the publishers in response to an offer of prizes for the best imitations of the standard essayists .

		Of the specimens given in the volume one is after Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, one after Lamb , and four are after
Bacon	PERSON	a long way after him , we must say , though the Baconian sententious - ness is cleverly parodied in some cases .

		Mr.
C. Law	PERSON	- rence Ford 's '' On the Shaking of Hands '' -LRB- after Lamb -RRB- strikes us as rather the best paper of the lot , considered as an imitation ; while Mrs.
Tolle	PERSON	- mache 's '' The Sparrow Colonel '' -LRB- after Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	-RRB- is a pretty thing in itself , delicate and pathetic , though it savors , to our thinking , but faintly of the '' Autocrat . ''

		Other notable essays in the volume are '' Mental Culture , '' by Prof.
James Ward	PERSON	; `` Art in Schools , '' by
Dean Farrar	PERSON	; `` What is a Col - lege ? ''

		by
Mark Pattison	PERSON	; ''
Jowett	PERSON	and his Per - sonal Influence , '' by the Hon.
L. A. Tollemache	PERSON	; '' Head-Masters I have Known , '' by
C. S. Calverley	PERSON	.

		All in all , the papers in point of pith and sound intention worthily represent the useful publication they were written for .

		Completion of B 7 the publication of a third volume , a masterpiece one of the most important works of of science .

		An Illustrated Flora of the
Northern United States	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, and the British Possessions '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Dr.
Nathaniel Lord Britton	PERSON	and the Hon.
Addison Brown	PERSON	, is the only work of its kind that provides illustrations , drawn carefully to scale , of every species of flowering plant known to exist in the vast territory included be - tween
Newfoundland	LOCATION	and the southern boundary of
Virginia	LOCATION	, between the
Atlantic Ocean	LOCATION	and the 102d meridian .

		The concluding volume , now before us , is devoted entirely to the Gamopetalae not brought within the scope of the preceding volume , and nearly one-half of its contents are taken up by the Com - positse alone .

		The number of species figured in the whole work is 4162 , comprising 177 families and
1103	DATE	genera .

		Of these species , eighty-one are either new discoveries or new determinations , and are given in an appendix .

		Two elaborate indexes , of Latin and English names respectively , fill the closing pages of the volume .

		The latter of these indexes is the most thoroughgoing catalogue of popular plant - names in English that has ever been made , and is invaluable for purposes of identification by those who do not know how to use the analytical keys also provided .

		It is difficult to find words of praise high enough for the three volumes of this magnificent work , which is commended alike by its scientific thoroughness , the speed with which it has been pushed to completion , and the moderate price at which it is offered to the public .

Alfred C. Haddon	PERSON	is already statin known to the general reader by his culture-history .

		To the anthropologist he is known for important explorations in
New Guinea	LOCATION	, and for works upon craniology and New Guinean arts .

		He is also a popular lecturer and teacher .

		He is well qualified to write a little book for popular reading in order to show the methods pursued in '' The Study of Man , '' and to exhibit some of the results of such study .

		In the book before us -LRB- Vol .

		I. of '' The Science Series , '' Putnam -RRB- he first discusses work in Physical Anthropology .

		A general statement is given concerning measurements and their import - ance . ''

		Hair and Eye-color , '' '' Value of Head - form in Anthropology , '' and '' The Nose '' are discussed and examples are given of their practical value .

		In the chapter on '' Ethnography of the
Dordogne District	LOCATION	, '' an illustration is given of the way in which such physical data , when carefully gathered and properly handled analytically and synthetically throw light on the movements and ethnic elements of populations .

		Two chapters then are devoted to the evolution of the cart and the origin of the Irish jaunting-car , in order to show the character of the data used in culture-history and the mode of dealing with them .

		In a con - 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, nected series of eight chapters , Mr.
Haddon	PERSON	next studies the toys and games of children .

		That these are material for study is vaguely admitted by many persons who can not at all see just how or why they are important .

		Mr.
Haddon	PERSON	tries to show this .

		In his concluding chapter the author brings together a considerable mass of practical suggestions for conducting ethnographical investi - gations in the British Islands .

		These are largely taken from the various circulars sent out by the
Ethnographical Survey of the United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are of course of value outside of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		One point greatly emphasized in Mr. H addon 's book is that every one can find work in the anthro - pological field .

		So exceptional a career as that of the late Rev. diaries
Haddon Spurgeon	PERSON	must needs find an exceptional chron - icling .

		Accordingly it is with little surprise that we pick up the first of four formidable volumes containing his `` autobiography as compiled from his papers by his wife and private secretary . ''

		The size of the undertaking is nothing short of appalling ; yet it must have been no slight task to reduce it to its present dimensions .

		Spurgeon himself says that his life was so replete that he could have constructed a three-volume novel from the doings of any single day within its compass making him a potential and ecclesiastical
Crawford	PERSON	, so to speak .

		This pre - cise literary feat remained unaccomplished , but he came perilously near to it , as the labors of the edi - tors here indicate .

		It must be confessed that there is nothing in this first volume , which carries the story on through thirty-three chapters to the chol - era years -LRB- 1866 -RRB- in
London	LOCATION	, to remove the im - pression of Spurgeon which prevails generally .

		Just as his methods lacked fineness , but not results , just so the character he discloses through the writ - ings which he designed to serve as his memorial before the world shows force , not culture , persist - ency , not subtlety , aggressiveness , not suppression .

		A man of many graces in the theological sense of the word , he lacked the grace that makes for literary ease , bearing out the frequently repeated phrase that speeches and sermons which sound well seldom read well .

		The book is published by the
Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a form that must make a popular appeal .

		< ^ ^ ta Whether speculation is a good or an of ipc * iatio * .

		ev ' l thing on the whole , has been a difficult question for the economists , perhaps because there is so much to be said on either side .

		Dr.
Henry Crosby Emery	PERSON	has certainly found a great deal to say in favor of purely speculative transactions in his essay entitled '' Speculation on the Stock and Produce Exchanges of the United States '' -LRB-
Columbia University Studies	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		After de - scribing the organization and business methods of the exchanges , discussing the economic difference between speculation and gambling , and briefly sketching the historical development of trade , the writer explains how speculation performs an im - portant economic function by regulating prices and shifting the burden of risk from producers and dealers proper to a distinct speculative class .

		It appears that this shifting of risks is accomplished by means of a systematic practice of hedging , '' now indulged in so generally by those who handle the actual grain and cotton that the large dealer who does not buy and sell at the same time has come to be considered a reckless speculator .

		There is a chapter on '' Some Evils of Speculation , '' de - voted mainly to manipulations of the stock market ; '' corners '' are regarded as of little importance be - cause of their temporary character .

		The author apologizes for devoting so little space to this side of the question , but says that while the evils of specu - lation are more widely appreciated than the advant - ages , they are really not so simple of comprehension or so easily described .

		In the Exchange be finds the essence of both the good and the evil of the modern commercial system .

		Early partiet and politic * in the Nort/ncett .

		Volume VI .

		of the '' Harvard His - torical Studies '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- con - tains a history of the Liberty and Free Soil parties in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, written by Mr.
Theodore Clarke Smith	PERSON	, Instructor in the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	.

		The paper gained the Tappan prize for
1896	DATE	.

		The period considered begins with the anti-slavery struggles in
1830	DATE	and extends to the organization of the Republican party in
1854	DATE	, cov - ering the rise and fall of the semi-parties known as Liberty , Free Soil , and Free Democratic .

		These organizations '' stirred up the Western conscience , kept the subject of slavery constantly before the public , powerfully affected the policy and public expressions of the old parties , and by their spokes - men in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	played an influential part in national politics . ''

		They further trained men in political methods , hardened young men to self - abnegation , and accustomed voters to a steady ad - herence to a great principle in the face of opposition , contempt , and abuse , to do right for right 's sake .

		The investigation in local sources has been most exhaustive and painstaking , and forms a complete r6sum of political life within the period and the region under consideration .

		Appendices of biblio - graphy , tables , and charts of votes , etc. , complete a very scholarly volume in a very scholarly series .

		An etiay oneriticim . ''

		The Principles of Criticism , '' fur - ther described as '' an introduction to the study of literature , '' is an essay by Mr.
W. Basil Worsfold	PERSON	, recently published in
London	LOCATION	by Mr.
George Allen	PERSON	.

		Its purpose '' is to present an account of the main principles of literary criticism and to illustrate these principles by passages from great writers . ''

		It may be said at the outset that , while Mr.
Worsfold	PERSON	's discussion of his subject is sober and scholarly , being at all points both read - able and interesting , it breaks no new ground , and is content with an exposition of the orthodox prin -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 175 ciples of criticism as they have been received from the past and amplified by a few distinguished writers of our own time .

		The author does not for a moment doubt that there are such things as principles in this matter , and does not seem to think the opinion of the subjective and impressionist critics deserv - ing of refutation or even of consideration .

		In this , it need hardly be said , we are in agreement with Mr.
Worsfold	PERSON	, and his discussion seems to us emi - nently sound and well arranged .

		His chief service is perhaps in the bringing together of what he lightly calls '' a collection of noteworthy critical utterances . ''

		This marshalling , with appropriate comment , of sig - nificant passages from the writings of
Plato	LOCATION	, Aris - totle ,
Addison	PERSON	,
Lessing	PERSON	,
Cousin	LOCATION	, and
Arnold	LOCATION	, to name the six critics chiefly singled out for treat - ment , is a performance for which the author has our warmest thanks , although the attention given to
Addison	PERSON	and Cousin is possibly disproportional , and although we would gladly have seen the list less restricted .

		Special chapters upon poetry , the drama , and the novel , follow this general setting forth of criti - cal principles , and a chapter upon `` Authority in Liter - ature and Art '' closes the essay .

		Judged by such books as Mr.
Spencer Cask	PERSON	's `` Bowling Green '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , Americans are still a long way off from taking their newly discovered ances - tors as a matter of course .

		It is an interesting and skilfully put together little volume about an essential feature in old
New York	LOCATION	life , historically faithful so far as it goes , and of a certain consequence to all who look upon that sort of thing as consequential .

		It is a remarkable thing to notice how much the early days improve with age ; all the disagreeable features of life , unless they can be charged to
Great Britain	LOCATION	during the two wars , disappear .

		It was no unusual thing for convicts and other undesirable persons to be sent to
America	LOCATION	by the ship-load ; yet the only descendants they appear to have left be - hind them are those '' poor whites '' in the South who have no spokesman before the world to deny it .

		Still , the book serves a useful if a limited pur - pose .

		But what does Mr.
Trask	PERSON	mean by calling Broadway '' the longest street in the world '' ?

		This western country is full of highways that run from the great lakes to the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, and bid fair to be continued on to
Terra del Fuego	ORGANIZATION	with the national expansion .

		Animal Psychology is just now a much cultivated department , and Mrs.
E. L. Baldwin	PERSON	's translation of the pioneer monograph of Professor Groos , '' The Play of Animals '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is very timely .

		The work opens with a criticism of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's theory of play ; in the second chapter it discusses play and instinct ; and following chapters treat particular plays under a classification into '' experimentation , movement plays , hunting plays , fighting plays , con - structive arts , nursing plays , imitative play , curi - osity , love plays . ''

		The concluding chapter deals with the psychology of play .

		Professor
Groos	PERSON	holds that play has been evolved as instinct acting in a manner to prepare for the work of mature life ; in short , that play is nature 's school .

		The pappy play - ing with his brother , chasing and biting not seri - ously , thereby practises for the mature life when he must chase and bite in earnest .

		This theory is en - forced by many stories of animals , as reported by travellers , naturalists , and others .

		The psychic basis of play the author finds in make-believe as implying the joy of power and freedom .

		While the work is not always clear in its construction , and is greatly overcharged with quotations and foot-notes , yet it is a useful and suggestive volume .

		The editor , Pro- fessor
J. M. Baldwin	PERSON	, contributes a preface , and also an appendix on Organic Selection .

		The trans - lation is in good readable English .

		A handbook of practical taxidermy .

		For a number of years the exhibits of the taxidermist 's art in the Amer - ican
Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	in
New York City	LOCATION	have excited the admiration of vis - iting naturalists .

		Representations of animals , not only in their natural attitudes but also in their nat - ural surroundings , have been successfully made by Mr.
John Rowley	PERSON	, the chief of the department of taxidermy in the above-mentioned institution .

		He has put into print an excellent handbook of his art -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which will be welcomed by everyone interested in the artistic development of public mu - seums .

		The book is not an elaborate treatise upon the abstract principles which lie at the foundation of artistic taxidermy , but is rather a compendium full of practical hints and suggestions , recipes , and formulas for the working taxidermist .

		The outfit necessary for a collecting trip and the routine of field work are discussed in the opening chapter , while succeeding ones deal with tools and material ; casting in wax , papier-mache , clay , and plaster ; the mounting of birds and mammals ; of fishes , reptiles , and crustaceans ; the preparations of skeletons ; and the reproduction of foliage .

		A valuable appendix gives the sources from which the various materials may be obtained .

		The abundant illustrations en - hance the utility of the work , and render it a most complete and reliable handbook of the subject .

		The voluminous work on '' The Cross ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in Tradition , History , and Art and history .

		-LRB- Putnam -RRB- , from the pen of the late Rev.
William Wood Seymour	PERSON	, is confined chiefly to the Christian uses and significance of this important symbol .

		It has not been noted that one reason why the cross is so widely diffused , in its uses as a symbol and an ornament over the face of the earth , is be - cause of the great ease with which it is arrived at .

		Wherever a man has been able to make marks the cross is found for precisely the reason that it is still used by the illiterate instead of a signature because any two lines in the same plane must , if they are not parallel , form a cross either actually by contact or potentially by extension .

		The claim of phallicism 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, to be heard in the matter is dismissed in this ex - ceedingly ponderous work with a single contemptu - ous sentence .

		The author practically suppresses all attempt to deal with what is certainly a much vexed subject , apparently oblivious to the fact that in
this year of grace 1898	DATE	there are probably more human beings who attach a phallic significance to the cross than there are members of any other religion who hold it as a sacred symbol .

		Only less conspicuous is the failure of the book to recognize the enormous growth of superstition , in all religions , about this as other ancient symbols .

		There is a lack of ability to discriminate between authorities of the most various weight , and a fatal facility for taking up obsolete views for discussion , which prevent the book from attaining any considerable importance as a philosophical or historical treatise , notwithstanding that its size and manner are scarcely less than encyclopedic .

		The early life of
Orestes A. Brown	PERSON	- 8on tnat extraordinary American who was in turn Congregationalist ,
Universalist	LOCATION	,
Unitarian	LOCATION	, Nothing-in-particular , and
Roman Catholic	ORGANIZATION	, and in this last capacity succeeded in making permanent contributions to the philosophy of a Church which has always owed much to her adopted children , has been set forth with loving care and all reasonable inclusiveness by his son , Mr.
Henry F. Brownson	PERSON	, who publishes the volume pri - vately in
Detroit	LOCATION	.

		So long a distance is it from Brook Farm to Mother Church , that many must lag by the way it would really seem as if none could follow to the goal without an understanding of and sympathy with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	which has not often been given to the American of ancient descent There is no doubt of the accuracy of Channing 's charitable statement that
Brownson	PERSON	's many changes were in the nature of an orderly and logical progression ; like Professor
Silliman	PERSON	, he tired of the burden of his own individuality , so strongly was it marked , and gladly reposed it upon shoulders which deem them - selves broad enough for an entire world .

		Many another of his countrymen has trod the same path for the same reason , and it is to them that ''
Brown	PERSON	- son 's Early Life '' will make its chief appeal .

Edward Arnold	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by her son , Mr.
Bernard Holland	PERSON	, serve further to remind the reader that there is coming to be no end of book-making as a result of this feminine facility .

		Mrs.
Holland	PERSON	's husband was the Rev.
Francis James Holland	PERSON	, chaplain-in-ordinary to the Queen and for many years a canon of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		To Mrs.
Holland	PERSON	it was therefore given to meet many persons notable in diverse walks of life .

		Such sketches as are inev - A iurar * guide-book itable , when a bright woman so placed has a number of correspondents , follow , as the night the day ; and this inevitability lasts quite up to the point of pub - lication .

		This seems to be a filial duty conscien - tiously discharged , and in that view not amenable to criticism either respecting manner or matter . ' '

		u ' excellent example of combining the charm of literary workmanship w ; th the eg8e ntial8 of a guide book , which may possibly be traced to Sir
John Maunde	PERSON	- ville and certainly to Mr.
Augustus J. C. Hare	PERSON	, has been satisfactorily followed by Miss
Margaret Sy	PERSON	- monds , whose collaboratorship with her distinguished father , the late
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	, has here been transferred to Miss
Lina Duff Gordon	PERSON	.

		Jointly these two capable women have woven '' The Story of

J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	with all the care that marks their little books generally , and imported by the

		In commenting upon the
1898	DATE	volume of '' The Ref - erence Catalogue of Current Literature , '' we are com - pelled to resort to the first principles of reviewing , and describe the work as being twelve inches in thickness and weighing about the same number of pounds .

		This year it is for the first time divided into two volumes .

		As all booksellers know , it consists of the catalogues of about a hundred and fifty English publishing houses , alphabetically bound together , and provided with an index classified according to subjects , titles , and authors .

		This index fills between five and six hundred pages , and contains nearly one hundred thousand entries .

		The work is issued by
Messrs J. Whitaker & Sons	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and supplied in this country through the agency of '' The Publisher 's Weekly . ''

		Under the editorship of Professor
Shailer Mathews	PERSON	, a series of '' New Testament Handbooks '' has been planned by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They will be small volumes , not too technical for the general reader , and will enlist the services of such careful scholars as the editor himself , and Professors

		THE DIAL 177 ANNOUNCEMENTS or FAL.I / BOOKS .

		THE DIAL 'S list of books announced for Fall issue by American publishers , which has become an important annual bibliographical feature of the paper , contains this year
1350	DATE	titles , very much the largest list THE DIAL has ever before given its readers , being nearly twenty-five per cent , ahead of that given a year ago .

		Seventy-one publishers are represented , the average thus being nearly twenty books to a firm .

		Book readers are certainly to be congratulated on this liberal provision for their entertainment , and the showing is one that reflects great credit on the energy of the American publishers in being amply prepared for the opening of what promises to be the greatest period of prosperity ever known in this country .

		The List has been prepared in all cases from advance information procured especially for the purpose .

		The department of Juveniles is deferred until our next number .

		All the books here given are presumably new books new editions not being included unless having new form or matter ; and the List does not include Fall books already issued and entered in our regular List of New Books .

		Nevertheless , she is a woman too , and feminine interest and curiosity so quicken her wits that she is able to piece together ' the high encounter with life , the large and complicated game ' of her customers .

CLINTON Ross	PERSON	says in The Chap-Book : '' The proof of a long book is in the reading of it .

		... The author , an artist , never once obtrudes her personality .

		The life of the actors is cleverly real , but the high distinction of ' Free to Serve ' is its realization of humanity .

		It is a notable book so much better than
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	' that if the publishers ' claim for that book be true this novel is greater it is certainly one of the American novels of the year .

		And Dutch America has no better presentation than
E. Rayner	PERSON	's in Free to Serve . ' ''

		The
Boston Transcript	ORGANIZATION	says : '' The book is not the work of a novice ; it is fascinating , strong , and of the highest moral tone ... The characters are finely delineated , the varied and rapidly shifting scenes are pictured with the skill of an artist , and the pure moral tone is carried through the whole like a golden thread .

		We advise all to read the book . ''

		The
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Call says : `` It does for the life and fashions of Old
New York	LOCATION	what
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	' did for
Philadelphia	LOCATION	... There is plenty of action in the transition from chapter to chapter , some strong-drawn character etching , and an intense vein of human interest .

		A LITERARY ACHIEVEMENT OF HIGH RANK . ''

		In
Husch	PERSON	's pages the figure of the famous Chancellor rises with lifelike vigor and color and the surroundings and historical background are skilfully drawn .

		Consid - ered merely as a biography , the specific aim of which is to impress indelibly the traits of the subject 's personality , this diary would con - stitute a literary achievement of high rank , even if its hero were a purely fictitious char - acter , and not the most powerful individuality among the great politicians of our century ... Whether the great German Chan - cellor left memoirs is uncertain ; he began them , but whether he com - pleted them is unknown ; even if such documents exist in manuscript , it is extremely doubtful whether they will see the light , at least for some years to come .

		Meanwhile we have a substitute for them in the two capacious volumes published by the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	... The Prince , indeed , may be said to have been a collaborateur with Dr.
Busch	PERSON	in the preparation of the earliest manuscript forthe press . ''

		Dr.
Busch	PERSON	is an admirable raconteur , and you get from his notes a vivid impression of
Bismarck	PERSON	, who was the really great man of the

		EMINENTLY WORTH READING . '

		Altogether , these excep - tionally delightful memoirs afford a picture of Bismarck that can never be rivalled .

Europe	LOCATION	, can not now be written without it . ''

		ABSOLUTELY FEARLESS . ''

		We must accept these Memoirs , '' says the
New York	LOCATION	Tribune , '' as at any rate authoritative .

		In everything that relates to the personality of Bismarck he is emi - nently worth reading ; when he speaks only the words that the Chancellor pats into his mouth we must give his pages high rank .

		If his Boswellian adoration were less in evidence , he would be invaluable .

		As it is , the gigantic figure of Bismarck imposed itself upon him with such force that we gain , in spite of the indefatigible reporter , a powerful impression ... He writes like one accustomed to deal with political events in a vein of free , forcible , and popular exposition .

		He is skilful and clever , a great special pleader .

		He is a German , and hence he is fond of details , setting them all forth with admirable patience ... He was in the fullest possible sym - pathy with the Chancellor . '' ''

		By far the most important con - tribution yet made to
Bismarck	LOCATION	's life during this period , and to his character , both as a man , as a states - man , and as a diplomat .

		Bismarck knew that the author had prepared this diary , and gave him full permission to publish it the minute he -LRB- Bismarck -RRB- should be un - der ground .

		It will probably never be surpassed as a revelation of the character of Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	, and this makes it especially interesting at the present time . ''

		233 RICHARD
MALCOLM JOHNSTON	PERSON	.

		In a contribution to one of the late issues of '' Literature , '' Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	discusses the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	literary product of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	, saying of Mr.
Harris	PERSON	and Mr. Cable that they are '' certainly the best known '' of our recent Southern writers , and supposing '' there can be no question but they are the first . ''

		The task of arranging writers according to their rank is always invidious and usually unprofitable , but in this case the death , a few days ago , of Colonel
Richard Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	, makes it necessary to question the dicta of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, and to assert that no list , however narrowly restricted , of our foremost Southern writers can be accepted if it does not include the name of the novelist , scholar , and gentleman , whose grievous loss we now mourn .

		The omission by our eccentric critic of Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's name may , however , be attributed to a strange mis - conception .

		In the same article , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	speaks of '' a school of Southern humorists be - fore the war , '' and , after describing their work as '' atrocious , '' says that he wishes '' distinctly to except from this censure the ' Dukesborough Tales ' and the other sketches by the same au - thor , which have a whimsical grace and are simple and often sweet , with a satisfying air of truth . ''

		We infer from this that Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	is reckoned among the antebellum writers , whereas the `` Dukesborough Tales '' made their first collected appearance in
1883	DATE	, and their author had done nothing at all in the way of literary production until four or five years pre - viously , when the publication of a few tales and sketches in the magazines first directed atten - tion to his name .

		Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	is given a unique position in our literature by the fact that he was nearly sixty years old before he began to be a writer , and that back of his literary period there lies nearly a lifetime of activity as a lawyer and a professor of literature .

		He was , then , an ante - bellum writer only in the sense that his fiction dealt almost exclusively with a period long ante-dating the Civil War , and restored for a new generation a past that had vanished from the memory of most living men .

		The period was that of the thirties and forties , and the 214 THE DIAL -LSB-

		place
Middle Georgia	LOCATION	, a time and a region of which the '' form and pressure '' are preserved to us in Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's books with a faith - fulness of delineation and a geniality of con - ception barely equalled and certainly unsur - passed by the best of the younger school of '' local '' writers whose work forms so import - ant a part of recent imaginative literature in this count ry . '

		The
Middle Georgia	LOCATION	of the novelist 's youth and early manhood is made so interesting a subject for our contemplation that a few quo - tations from him , in his character as historian of his native section rather than as story-teller , may fittingly be reproduced upon this occasion .

		In a paper written only three years ago to be read before the
Twentieth Century Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	said : '' If ever there was a man who felt himself to be ab - solutely a freeman , it was the rustic of
Middle Georgia	LOCATION	.

		... The poorest white man had no apprehension of falling into the lower scale , and so his ambitions were the freer and the more cheerful to lift himself higher .

		... In my own immediate neighborhood , some seventy - five miles west , not one grown man in five had ever been to
Augusta	LOCATION	, then a town of some six thousand .

		... Sometimes in an argument between two rural per - sons one , who might be on the verge of defeat , if by some sort of chance , not enjoyed by his adversary , he had been to
Augusta	LOCATION	, might look upon him with such con - tempt as was possible to feel , and say : ' Now look here ,
John	PERSON	, has yon ever been to Augusty ? '

		On the sad ac - knowledgement in the negative , he might add : * Well , then , do n't try to talk to me about sech matters , because they is matters as can ' t be complete understood except by them as has been to Augusty . '

		... To one who remem - bers the conditions and incidents of such a society it seems difficult to overpraise its neighborliness , the healthful - ness , the confidence , the warm affectionateness which except among mean people , and mean people are in every community generally obtained .

		None were very rich and none very poor , but rich and poor , especially among men , intermingled with the freedom of intercourse that was productive of results most beneficial to all ... Aristotle taught that leaders in societies should think like wise men , but talk like the common people .

		That was just what was done by leading citizens of
Georgia	LOCATION	three-quarters of a century ago ... The noble
Georgia	LOCATION	dialect savored in much affectionate sweetness .

		Much of it , as I have been told in letters from eminent phil - ologists , is a relic of English as spoken three and four centuries ago ... The greatest lawyers and politicians and even divines loved it to the degree that they habit - ually spoke it , if not at home before their wives and children , at least in social intercourse among their neighbors . ''

		Such was the almost idyllic social life , and such the dialect , of the people who live for us in Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's fiction .

		No phase of local American society has received more faithful and loving depiction anywhere in our literature , and the peculiar value of Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's stories is in their application to a comparatively early period of the realistic methods of recent liter - ary art .

		The older writers neglected their opportunity , or did not know how to make effective use of it , but the facts were recorded upon the sensitive plate of Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's memory and given fresh vitality in the alembic of his genius .

		There is dialect in profusion in his books , but it gives no offence , for we easily distinguish it from the spurious effusions of dialect that have caused an eruption in our fic - tion of recent years .

		It is the genuine thing , the inevitable garment of the thought which it clothes ; it is not adventitious , written for a wanton satisfaction in the misspelling of words .

		It is , moreover , carefully studied and conscien - tiously reproduced , combining the scholar 's instinct for exact truth with the artist 's instinct for effective expression .

		The following list includes the more import - ant of Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's works of fiction : ''
Dukes	PERSON	- borough Tales , '' '' Old
Mark Langston	PERSON	, '' '' Two Gray Tourists , '' '' Mr.
Absalom Billingslea	PERSON	, '' ''
Ogeechee Cross-Firings	PERSON	, '' '' Widow
Guthrie	PERSON	, '' '' Old Times in
Middle Georgia	LOCATION	, '' '' The Primes and Their Neighbors , '' '' Mr.
Billy Downs	PERSON	and His Likes , '' and ``
Pearce Amerson	PERSON	's Will . ''

		Of these works , '' Widow Guthrie '' is the long - est and the most serious , but the peculiar gifts of the author appear to better advantage when he works within narrower limits , and one is apt to recall most vividly some of the ''
Dukes	PERSON	- borough Tales '' or some of the sketches con - tained in '' Old Times in
Middle Georgia	LOCATION	. ''

		In addition to his fiction , he published a life of
Alexander H. Stevens	PERSON	-LRB- in collaboration with Mr.
W. H. Browne	PERSON	-RRB- , and two volumes of `` Studies , Literary and Social . ''

		The latter volumes are excellent reading , and deserve a high rank among books of essays , although it takes some effort so to readjust the mental focus as to think of the author 's discoursing seriously upon such subjects as '' Belisarius , '' or '' American Philosophy , '' or '' The
Minne	PERSON	- singer and Meistersinger , '' or '' Shakespeare 's Tragic Lovers . ''


Richard Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	was born in
1822	DATE	, on a plantation in
Middle Georgia	LOCATION	.

		When a boy he removed with his family to
Powell	PERSON	ton -LRB- the Dukesborough of the tales -RRB- .

		He studied at
Mercer University	ORGANIZATION	,
Macon	LOCATION	, and fitted for the bar .

		A law partnership with
Ltnton Stephens	PERSON	, a younger brother of
Alex	PERSON	- ander
H. Stephens	PERSON	, lasted for about ten years , when he became a professor in the
University of Georgia	ORGANIZATION	, at
Athens	LOCATION	.

		From this time on , his
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 215 occupations were teaching , lecturing , and writ - ing .

		In middle life he became a member of the
Koman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Married at an early age , his domestic life was singularly happy , and the death , a little over a year ago , of the woman who had been the devoted part - ner of his joys and sorrows for over fifty years left him , to take his own pathetic words from a letter to a friend '' poor indeed and lowly prostrate . ''

		But he added : `` Yet I feel no diminution of willingness to do the work of the remainder of my time , and hope for continuance of the strength necessary for it . ''

		A year after these words were written he lay dying in the hospital at
Baltimore	LOCATION	, the city with which he had been identified during the latter period of his life .

		On the 23d of
September	DATE	he breathed his last , bequeathing to American literature a body of work that will not soon be forgotten , and to those who enjoyed the privilege of his friendship the memory of a fine spirit , gentle in the truest sense of the term , the soul of cor - diality , courtliness , and chivalry .

		He was dear to all who knew him , and will be remembered as we remember only those for whom our affec - tion is the deepest .

		On the contrary , words very often mean more than their author intended .

		I can imagine
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	reading something he had written over-night and wondering how in the world he came to do anything so good .


George Eliot	PERSON	says somewhere that a young girl 's beauty has a meaning and significance of which the young girl herself is not aware .

		Similarly , combinations of felicitous words and rhythms have implications and perspectives and pregnancies which could not all have occurred to their writer during the brief mo - ment of composition .

		The mortal has brought forth immortality , has given birth to something which is approximately perfect and imperishable .

		Whence comes this gift , this lucky inheritance of an estate outside the blood ?

		I know not what to attribute it to but inspiration .

		There are writers who go about to reduce expres - sion to an exact science , who believe we can arrive at verbal perfection by laborious toil .

		They hunt through dictionaries and obsolete books , and track the shy , wild animal , the mot propre , to its secret lair .

		And some of them ,
Flaubert	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	for instance , spend half their days in confiding to their friends the horrors and dangers of the chase the difficulties incurred in acquiring a good prose style .

		The older writers who used words reason - ably well
Pascal	PERSON	or Swift or
Goldsmith	PERSON	, for ex - ample never seem to have had so hard a time .

		There is a fashion in these things .

		In
Sheridan	PERSON	's days it was the proper pose for an author to dash off the brilliant act of a comedy in one night over a bottle of claret .

		Now the genesis of every word must he established , and the public made a witness of the parturition of every sentence .

		The facts were probably always the same .

		Skill and labor were required to cut and pile the faggots for literary bon - fires , hut the sparks which lit them had to fall from above .

		Lacking any magnetic connection with the source of fire , the beacons would fail to burn .

		As for the mot propre , it is surely as fabulous a wild fowl as the phoanix or the roc .

		With the ex - ception of a few words which accommodate the sound to the sense , there is no natural or logical connection between language and life .

		The former is purely arbitrary , and to suppose that for every fact of nature or experience there stands ready a sole and unique verbal mate like the ticket num - ber , and the prize in a lottery drawing is a wild fancy .

		Besides , the facts of existence are , after all , limited in number ; while the combinations and views and opinions of them in the minds of men are inexhaustible .

		One cause of style is individuality the affixing of a different label to a fact from that which any other human being would attach to it .

		No two writers make the same report of a subject .

		The songs of
Burns	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	have largely the same theme ; but in rhythm , vocabulary , quality , timbre , they are as the antipodes .

		Like the monads of
Leibnitz	PERSON	, poets are sent into the world with vary - ing velocities , and each one attracts words to him - self in a different fashion from his fellows .

		Eight virgins were used as models by an ancient sculptor for a single statue .

		This fact seems de - rogatory to the charms of the young women .

		But where did the sculptor get the standard which au - thorized him to reject their parts of being ?

		Where did Pheidias get his conception of the Olympian Zeus ?

		What is the reason that the
Parthenon	LOCATION	or the
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	are superior to the ordinary
City Hall	ORGANIZATION	or Post Office Building ?

		Why are the great figures of fiction so universal that living men and women seem merely bad imitations of such crea - tions so that we speak of people whom we know as Quixotic or Pecksniffian ?

		There is something more than a mere imitation of life implied in arts that can give laws to life .

		But this ideal element , where does it come from ?

		The modern theory would be that it is merely a selection of the best of the real .

		But leaving out of question how we are to recognize the best , the fact remains that this ideal element is strongest in the infancy of art , before the races amid which it rises have developed their character or worked out their destiny .

		Homer was the school - master of
Greece	LOCATION	; and we probably can not measure how much
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has affected English char - 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, acter .

		There seems to be a matter of '' pare antici - pated cognition '' in the case .

		The artist does some - thing , unknowing how , which can stand up against the world and draw the world to it .

		We are driven to the Platonic Ideas for an ex - planation .

		It would really appear as if the arch y - typal forms , of which the images and appearances of the world are merely mutilated copies , do appear to the artist in certain heated conditions of his mind , and translate themselves through him into adequate language or other art media .

		And not only the beautiful and good , but the evil as well .

		Plato himself , in one of his dialogues , comes to this point , and , with that urbane open-mindedness which is his great charm , seems to think it a check to his theory .

		The ideal bad smell , for instance , which must be accepted if his theory is carried out in full , is some - thing he can not stomach .

		But if the created figures of the artist which make for good are superior to ordinary men and women , so are his projections of evil more portentous than anything in real life .

		People of opprobrious repute cluster about him to have their portraits painted or their figure sculp - tured ; but the artist looks them over and says , '' My dear fellows , you are well enough as far as you go .

		But you are not the best expression of your own tendencies .

		You are minor .

		The dross of little - ness and incompetency encumbers you . ''

		And then he turns to the vision of the proper Platonic Idea , and forges out the pure gold of an lago or a Mephis - topheles .

		The work of the poet is always , therefore , a revelation , and each poet brings anew one .

		Noth - ing is more remarkable than the way the presum - ably fixed facts of human nature shift and alter under the various colored lights poured upon them by the poets .

		Chaucer will give us mankind rosy and solid , shaking the earth with its tread , robust in vice and virtue .

		Shakespeare will transmute the same people to beings of air and fire , irradiate as a sunset dream .

		Dickens will give them to us as a grimy , grotesque , touchingly human mob the procession of Shakespeare after having gone through a coal-hole .

		Yet each aspect will be true .

		The highest revelation which the poet can give is probably concerned with the goodness of beauty , whereas the highest revelation of the prophet is in regard to the beauty of goodness .

		The two roles , however , are hardly distinguishable , and to forbid the poet the use of ethical motives is simply to cut off one of his wings .

		True , the province of litera - ture is to delight But to delight whom ?

		To the Covenanter , sleeping in caves and meeting , at the risk of his life , to worship the ideas of duty and God were the most delightful imaginable .

		Indeed , beauty , grace , and charm the qualities usually appropriated to poetry are in a measure luxuries .

		We can hustle through life without them .

		But duties and morals are necessities , the plain bread of everyday life .

		And they are the main stuff out of which literature is built
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	was the rare instance of a great critic and admirable poet who was incapable of philosophy .

		Speaking of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's '' Intima - tions of Immortality from the Recollections of Childhood , '' he says that the central idea is a pleas - ing play of fancy of no solid value .

		To dismiss as valueless an idea which is seriously mooted in more than one great system of philosophy , and which , in the form of reincarnation , is the basic principle of Hindoo thought , is , to say the least , confident dog - matism .

		It is a fact that children do exhibit some - thing like inspiration .

		The awakening of the intel - lect in childhood is in itself one of the great miracles of life , and at no other stage of existence is the pure play of thought so vivid or the happiness which comes from knowing and imagining so great .

		Every - one has noted the genius-like characteristics of child - hood , and , conversely , the child-like nature of the mature genius .

		The latter , like the child , concen - trates himself on his game of imagination , and is more or less irresponsible in the outward relations of life .

		The child is protected in his beautiful dreams until they naturally fade from him ; but the world is at war with the genius , because it does not like to have its wretched result of failure brought in comparison with his easily perfect work of imagina - tion .

		Why do we teach children absolute truthful - ness , high-mindedness , and unselfishness , when we know that such qualities are the worst possible ones to fit them for the struggle of life ?

		The intuitional and inspirational character of woman relates her even more closely with the pure world of ideas than childhood .

		Woman 's character is more intense and simple in both extremes than man 's .

		So far as we have got in the history of the world , her share of genius itself has not amounted to anything very great .

		But man has always seemed to regard her as an intermediary between the world of pure ideas and himself , if she be not those pure ideas in proper person .

		He has always evinced a touching willingness to be inspired or damned by her .

		Certainly in literature she has been the one inspirational force , beating Nature or Patriotism , or even Religion , outright There remains to touch on the subject of frenzy as connected with inspiration .

		The Indians think a madman inspired ; but it does not follow that genius is mad .

		Mankind is always in danger of falling into a lumpish , inanimate , indistinguishable mass .

		Genius has the office which the repulsive force in Nature electricity , magnetic ether , what - ever it may be has in its struggle with gravita - tion .

		The poor , lumpish human atoms hate to be hounded to their task kept in tune , kept drilled and serviceable , and they think it madness that genius should take upon itself such employment It would be interesting to have those people who are clamoring about the madness of genius define and draw us a type of what they consider a sane and normal human being .

		It would neceiwarily be a thing of negations a thing cold , selfish , and dull ; for the least touch of enthusiasm , the least lift of spirit , the least devotion to an idea , the least

London	LOCATION	,
Sept. 18 , 1898	DATE	.

		There has just been published , in three volumes , the great work by Dr.
Moritz Busch	PERSON	on '' Bismarck '' and the secret history which his career furnishes .

		No doubt you will hear plenty of it on your side of the water , so that I need not trouble you with any remarks .

		We are , however , very anxious to learn what it is that Dr.
Busch	PERSON	has to say which has already not been known . ''

		Once I am dead , '' said the late Chancellor to his biographer , `` you can tell absolutely everything you know about me . ''

		It is for this '' absolutely everything '' that we are waiting .

		I am much concerned about a branch of the publish - ing business with which few people seem ever to have troubled themselves .

		I mean the publication of '' art books , '' so called .

		Has it ever struck you that the mod - ern English art-book is a terrible falling-off from those we associate with the names of
Ackermann	PERSON	,
Boydell	LOCATION	, Major , Virtue , and the rest ?

		And yet our facilities for making beautiful books are far more ready and numer - ous than those at the service of our grandfathers .

		If one asks a publisher now-a-days why he does n't produce a really fine book , he tells one that the expense is too great .

		And yet the expense of such books as
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Italy	LOCATION	, '' the `` Stafford Gallery , '' the `` Boydell Shake - speare , '' the great tomes on
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	which
Ackermann	PERSON	issued with colored lithographs , the string of books by '' Froggy ''
Dibdin	PERSON	, the famous ''
Walton	PERSON	'' of
Pickering	ORGANIZATION	, the expense on these , I say , must have been enormous , far greater than the cost of any of our modern works , excepting , perhaps , such a catalogue as that of the Spitzer Collection .

		There must have been buyers for such books in the `` twenties , '' `` thirties , '' `` forties , '' and `` fifties '' : surely there would be found buyers for the excellent productions of the '' nineties '' !

		But where are they ?

		I am afraid they are not even with
Hans Breitmann	PERSON	's `` barty , '' in `` de lofely clouds '' ; for they never had an existence .

		For these fine old illustrated books there are , to-day , hundreds of eager collectors .

		Who ever dreams now of treasuring bound pages of half-tone blocks or dirty reproductions of wash draw - ings ?

		And rightly , too , say I .

		The modern art-book , where it is found , proves to be nothing more nor less than a fattened and extended sixpenny magazine .

		All that a publisher who seeks distinction in this branch of his business needs to do is simply to get a wretched hack to scrawl off some wretcheder text on any special subject , and print this stuff on fine thick paper .

		With this for an excuse , he pads the rest with sheets of pro- cess reproductions , flashes a gilt binding with a deco - rative -LRB- ! -RRB-

		design , forsooth , and your '' art-book '' is made .

		A fig , say I , for such '' art-books . ''

		A year or two ago there was issued a great work on Velasquez , or Van - dyke , I forget which ; but compare it with what was once done for
Gainsborough	PERSON	,
Morland	LOCATION	, Constable , and others .

		The modern book is not a patch on the older ones .

		We confess this when we pay as much for one print torn out of a collection of the engravings of
Reynolds	ORGANIZATION	's pic - tures as we do for a dozen complete copies of examples from
Leighton	LOCATION	or Burne-Jones .

		The truth is that mod - ern process work does not make for art as did the old process .

		I had rather even have a collection of repro - ductions of line drawings than I would a whole gallery choked with the photographer-tampered work of '' toned '' and '' gravured '' stuff called '' art . ''

		In the line draw - ing , I do at least get the artist 's work .

		The deuce alone knows what the '' process '' maker does to get his effects in the other work .

		And yet good '' art-books '' may be made as well to-day as ever they were .

		But I am not writing to give advice to publishers .

		I simply record a fact worth making a note of .

		It is possible that what I have said may be especially timely for Mr.
Harry Quilter	PERSON	, who , I hear , is about to turn publisher in the art line .

		He may know a great deal about art , but un - less he knows how to publish it , it will go hard with his business .

		I wish him every success , he may turn out to be the right man .

		Publishers , it seems to me , take about as much time to find their particular metier as do other mortals .

		Car - lyle , I think it was , said that a man spends forty years of his life trying to find out the work for which he was best fitted .

		Publishers , on the other hand , spend forty thousand pounds doing the same thing , and fail in the end .

		Now , if I wished to turn publisher , which the Fates forfend , and I had the money wherewithal to indulge my whim , I 'd cultivate my whim , and run it for all it was worth .

		At any rate , I 'd have a run for my money .

		The professional publisher , however , does nothing of the kind .

		He runs other people 's whims , not knowing what the deuce will come of it ; and winds up surprised to find that they swallowed up all his capital without giving him any return .

		If he can ' t find any whims , he steals other publishers ' clients , pays more money to them , and balances on the wrong side of his ledger .

		Hence , ruinous competition , and the many Jeremiahs filling our ears with noisome waitings of bad times .

		I have hardly left myself any space to tell you of news .

		Not that there is much ; still , I must not omit to inform you of the forthcoming publication of Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- kin 's letters to
Rossetti	PERSON	, between the years
1852	DATE	and
1862	DATE	.

		The book which will contain them will be pub - lished here by Mr.
George Allen	PERSON	, and is to be a sort of history of the Pre-Raphaelite movement .

		Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	and the Rev. ''
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	'' have each a novel nearly ready ; they will be issued late in the autumn or early in the
spring	DATE	.

		A very important work on the
Post Office	ORGANIZATION	is being prepared by Mr.
Henniker Heaton	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, but this will not be ready for some months to come .

		Our bards are also busy , and we are to have volumes of poems from Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	, Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	, and one or two others .

		Just now books of travel are having a vogue , and attention is divided be - tween Lhassa and
Chitral	LOCATION	.

		When Sir

		Mr.

		Mr.

		CONCERNING VERSE OF THE LATE WAR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL , i When an anthology of the verse of the late war comes to be prepared , it will be found that it is also an anthol - ogy of international love , BO far as
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	are concerned .

		And it will not con - tain many examples of verse of any kind , if its purpose be a literary one ; if , on the other band , the work be intended for popular use , it will have thousands .

		I have in my possession some hundreds of newspaper clippings , each holding a '' poem '' related with more or less inti - macy to the
Hispano	LOCATION	- American conflict .

		Many of them fall under the distinctly American class of '' funny , '' which almost invariably means a source of real grief to the judicious .

		The most famous of these is probably Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	's amusing '' Change of Am - bitions , '' ending : '' The grammar ' bad ; but oh , my son , I wiah I M did what
Dewey	PERSON	done t '' Of the more serious , many are in dialect , notably the '' Together '' of Mr.
Frank Stanton	PERSON	, which has had the greatest newspaper vogue , and rightly , since he sings of the real union which this war has effected between
the North and South	ORGANIZATION	.

		Before the outbreak of hostilities there was little to be found in English or American verse respecting
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	, Mr.
Frank Putnam	PERSON	, and Mr.
Charles H. Crandall	PERSON	had published books , that of the first-named having also a glowing poem on Anglo-Saxon union which did not gain the attention it deserved ; while Miss
Caroline Duer	PERSON	, Miss
Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	, and , later , Mr.
Lucien V. Rule	PERSON	, have sent out booklets celebrating
England	LOCATION	as well as
America	LOCATION	.

		Many more will follow , probably of a more popular and less literary type , like the '' Songs of War and Peace '' from the facile pen of Mr.
Sam Walter Foss	PERSON	.

		But the actual poetry of the day , the verse contained in these clippings of mine , to be taken as typical of the whole , is at two extremes .

		There is simply nothing whatever to combine literary quality with proper popu - larity in the manner of Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	's '' Bat - tle Hymn of the Republic . ''

		There is nothing by way of narrative to rank with
Henry Howard Brownell	PERSON	's River Fight '' or '' Bay Fight '' of our Civil War , though the victories of
Dewey	LOCATION	and
Schley	PERSON	need cele - bration .

		There is no single poet who comes from the war period with a reputation greatly enhanced , as Mr.
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	's was enhanced in the ` six - ties .

		But there is some really admirable workmanship , technically very high , as in the two poems published by Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	, and two , an ode and a qnatorzain , by Mr.
Richard Hovey	PERSON	, equal to anything from the Civil War in manner , with two by Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page and one by
Miss Thomas	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	has also been heard from .

		There are some others , chiefly women ,
Miss Madeline S. Bridges	PERSON	and Mrs.
Margaret E. Sangster	PERSON	among them , who have succeeded in giving their product something more than catchiness and sentimentality ; but they are few .

		Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	heard `` A Voice from the West , '' and Mr.
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	answered it most successfully , making the punishment really fit the crime .

		Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	kept still , as he always does when given his choice be - tween silence and saying something pleasant about the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	has caught the Kipling manner quite as successfully as Mr.
Owen Sea	PERSON	- man ; though Mr.
Seaman	PERSON	published his '' Rhyme of the Kipperling '' as parody , and Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	takes his '' Songs of the Ships of Steel '' very seriously indeed .

		Now these , either through merit or pretence , are at one end of the literary ladder .

		All the rest , the '' real thing , '' the '' hot stuff , '' whether it has to do with glo - rious victory or the horrors of war , is generally to be included in what Mr.
Arlo Bates	PERSON	so happily termed the chewing-gum school of verse '' though , to do him justice , he apologized for the phrase , however vulgarly necessary .

		England and
Canada	LOCATION	had a multitude of examples of the same genre in their papers , but they were of better design and much better execution , even to the verses in cockney dialect in the ''
London Chron	LOCATION	- icle , '' which suggested that evil communications might there have broken through .

		The songs that celebrate the rapprochement of Brit - annia and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	are better than those which have to do with
America	LOCATION	alone , by a great deal .

		Mr.
Edward McQueen Gray	PERSON	's '' Vision of Reconcilement , '' Mr.
Wal	PERSON	- ter
Malone	PERSON	's sonnet to this end in ''
Leslie	PERSON	's Weekly , '' and the poem of Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	Eastman which was praised in a recent number of THE DIAL , together with many another which space does not permit to mention , .

		- ill show qualities of which we may very well be proud .

		Contrasted with those called out by purely national circumstances , and intended solely for domestic con - sumption , there is a whole heaven of differences .

		The inference is inevitable :
England	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	will not print rubbish , even if it is written for their periodicals ; but
America	LOCATION	wants it bad , very bad , and plenty of it , it is unnecessary to add that wanting it stands in an adverse ratio to needing it .

		THE WOMAN FACTOR IN
CHINESE GOVERNMENT	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB Dm * -RRB- Now that speculation is rife as to the cause and prob - able consequences of the recent stepping aside of the Emperor of
China	LOCATION	in favor of the Empress-Dowager , the following characterization of the lady in Mr.
Colqu	PERSON	- houn 's ''
China	LOCATION	in Transformation '' -LRB- reviewed in THE DIAL of
Sept. 16	DATE	-RRB- is of peculiar interest .

		Mr.
Colqu	PERSON	- houn is the best English authority on the points in ques - tion .

		He says -LRB- p. 191 -RRB- : `` The woman factor is a potent one in Chinese government , but never in a worthy sense ... How much the present collapse of
China	LOCATION	may be due to the personal qualities of the real but illegitimate ruler , the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	- Dowager , may not be known ; but there seems to be no doubt that every surrender made to foreigner * since she held the reins was dictated by her and her personal convenience .

		... A threat of the inva - sion of Peking if believed in has always been sufficient to bring her to terms .

		When the present Emperor waa prepared to abandon the capital during the Japanese War and resist to the bitter end , it waa that imperious lady who insisted on peace at any price ; and it is chiefly on her sensitive feelings that Russian threats take effect , and deprive the Sovereign of the will and the power to resist their demands . ''

		If such be the case , it seems clear that the statements of the Chinese representative at
Washington	LOCATION	, to the effect that the Empress-Dowager 's accession to power means a general bracing-up of
China	LOCATION	as against foreign encroachments , must be taken cum grano .

MR. FORBES	PERSON	'S NAPOLEOX THE THIRD .

		* Mr.
Archibald Forbes	PERSON	's new Life of Na - poleon the Third is a popularly written book , well adapted to the wants and tastes of the average reader .

		The chequered career of Hor - tense 's scheming son is told in a plain way ; without parade of sentiment or show of pro- fundity .

		The author takes a sensible view of his rather tawdry hero , and his estimate of him , while we think it in general too lenient , is impartial and rational in the main .

		The mis - fortunes of the man of Sedan have naturally made the world disposed to condone or pass over lightly the iniquities of the man of the Coup cVEtat ; and much has been written of late tending to show
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	in a favor - able light .

		It has been pointed out , with truth , that he was an amiable and a passably respect - able man in private life ; that he was a fairly faithful husband , as French husbands of his rank and opportunities go ; that he did won - ders in the way of renovating and beautifying
Paris	LOCATION	; that he evinced , in the intervals between his chronic enterprises for shoring up his pre - cious '' dynasty , '' a decent -LRB- and politic -RRB- regard for the higher welfare of the nation .

		But when , that is said , the truth remains that impartial history shows
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	to have been essentially a plotting , restless , mystifying self - seeker , who , to gain his personal ends , did not scruple to trample the rights of humanity under foot and shed its blood like ditch-water .

		When he destroyed the
Second Republic	ORGANIZATION	he was asked if he should not find it difficult to rule
France	LOCATION	: '' Oh , no ! ''

		he replied , '' nothing is easier .

		H leurfaut une guerre tons les quatre a/is . ''

		That was his theory of governing
France	LOCATION	, and he acted up to the spirit of it .

		Thousands of lives were taken and tens of thousands of lives made deso - late during the Imperial regime in order that this paltry adventurer might keep the throne he had stolen .

		He was only dwarfed by the great name he bore .

		He was as wax in the hands of men like
Cavour	PERSON	and
Bismarck	PERSON	, who quickly saw through the flimsy veil of his Delphic affectations .

		There was always a touch of the impostor about him , and the bitter gibes of Rochefort in '' Figaro '' and the '' Lanterne '' provoked inextinguishable laughter because they hit a palpable mark .

Windsor	LOCATION	.

		There was , Prince
Albert	PERSON	thought , a certain '' flavor of the canteen and the barrack hanging about the Emperor and his suit . ''


Louis Napoleon	PERSON	was a morbidly selfish man who would sacrifice anything or anyone to gain a political end : witness his base desertion of
Maximilian	PERSON	.

		He could hazard the life of his own flesh and blood to win some paltry scrap of political eclat .

		When he left
Paris	LOCATION	in
1870	DATE	, to join his army on the frontier , he took with him the young Prince Imperial in order that the ill-starred lad might undergo his '' baptism of fire , '' or , in plain terms , might be shot at by the Germans , a cheap and cruel piece of theatricality in which the Empress joined .

		Napoleon the Little was a mean and crafty fisher in troubled waters .

		He exploited his neighbors ' necessities through arts worthy of
Chatham	LOCATION	Street .

		When they were at war he went between them , plying '' his policy oipour - boires , as
Bismarck	PERSON	called it , and seeking to extort from the embarrassments of one or other of them a scrap of territory or other douceur in return for his favor or neutrality , .

		At this small diplomatic game he was easily beaten by the big Prussian , who , in
1866	DATE	, did not hesi - tate to cajole him with the prospect of a hand - some '' tip '' which he had no intention of bestowing in the end .

		In sum , the most re - spectable thing about
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	was , to our thinking , his dignified bearing in the hour of misfortune , when all was irretrievably lost and the shadow of death was upon him .

		A Prince , says
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, should combine the qualities of the lion and the fox .

		The vulpine qualities
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	certainly possessed in no small measure ; but there was nothing at all about him of the lion save -LRB- in his palmy days -RRB- the skin .

Italy	LOCATION	, the preliminaries of which , as is now known , had been arranged just before
Bismarck	PERSON	gave a timely fillip to hostilities he saw were inevitable , is interest - ing .

		General
Lebrun	PERSON	's Memoirs prove con - clusively that a coalition against
Germany	LOCATION	had actually been formed , and that in case of its success
Italy	LOCATION	was to get
Rome	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	was to have restored to her
Silesia	LOCATION	, while
France	LOCATION	was to receive
Belgium	LOCATION	and the left bank of the
Rhine	LOCATION	.

		The treaty was drawn up , and awaited only the signatures of the Three Powers ; but it was not signed when the war broke out in
July	DATE	.

		Prince
Jerome	PERSON	has told us that the chief cause of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's hesitation in the matter was the intense feeling manifested by the
Cler	PERSON	- ical Party in
France	LOCATION	against handing over
Rome	LOCATION	to the lay power in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Prince
Jerome	PERSON	's explanation is the commonly accepted one .

		Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	offers another theory .

		The diffi - culty about
Rome	LOCATION	was not , he thinks , the chief reason why the treaty that might have saved
Napoleon	PERSON	his throne was not ratified .

		41 The Emperor
Napoleon	PERSON	had calculated he was no strategist that by rapidity of concentration he might gain some advantage over
Germany	LOCATION	and perhaps even win an important battle .

		If so , he would offer peace to the
King of Prussia	ORGANIZATION	on terms of alliance against En - gland , assistance for the conquest of
Belgium	LOCATION	, and the cession to
France	LOCATION	of the left bank of the
Rhine	LOCATION	;
Prussia	LOCATION	in return to receive a perfectly free hand in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The governing idea of the Emperor was the formation of a strong alliance against
England	LOCATION	.

		This is proved in actual documents ; and the diary of the Emperor Fred - erick II .

		shows that
Napoleon	PERSON	did not abandon it even after Sedan .

		One might commiserate his downfall even if he had been an unscrupulous man ; but to be plotting coolly against the nation in which he had found cordial sympathy , friendship , and a free asylum , was a baseness from which the most cynical of men might recoil . ''

		Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's style is easy and animated , if a little slipshod at times .

		His book is by all odds the best popular life of
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, in that it is the most solidly instructive one on its historical side and the least misleading one on its biographical .

		The volume is a comely one , containing many portraits .

		Unfortunately , it lacks an index .

		THE L.AW8 AND THE LIFE OP A PEOPLE .

		* The influence of the comparatively recent interest in the study of political science , as dif - ferentiated from that of history , is illustrated by the two handsomely printed volumes , en - titled A Constitutional History of the Amer - ican People , '' which have just appeared from the work-room of Mr.
Francis Newton Thorpe	PERSON	.

		An examination of a vast amount of material in the form of state constitutions , legislative enactments , and treaties and conventions , has been made to show the truth of a suggestion of Emerson in his '' Essay on Politics '' : '' The form of government which prevails is the ex - pression of what cultivation exists in the population which permits it .

		... The history of the
State	ORGANIZATION	sketches in coarse outline the progress of thought and follows at a distance the delicacy of culture and aspiration . ''

		In the constitution of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	of
1780	DATE	, the state is declared to be a contract , that the government '' may be a government of laws , and not of men . ''


William Penn	PERSON	conceived of the state as a compact , but the government was to be '' a government of men , and not of laws . ''

		The evolution of these two ideas is taken as the history of American politics , and the history of Democracy in
America	LOCATION	is the record of the contest between laws a conventional system of politics and men struggling for industrial freedom .

		The conditions prevailing in
1776	DATE	are essentially different from those of
1850	DATE	.

		Environment , racial and social relations , the expansion of territory , the movements of pop - ulation , all have important bearing upon the development of ideas of government , as the problems connected with the closely intertwined and often opposing interests of state and na - tional sovereignty are worked out in
America	LOCATION	.

		The expressions of the popular mind are the state constitutions and legislative enactments ; in careful examination and comparison of these expressions one is enabled to trace the efforts of the people to secure desired ends ; and it is these efforts which make up constitutional his - tory , because a constitutional history deals pri - marily with persons and not with documents .

		This seems to be the thesis which is expanded by Mr.
Thorpe	PERSON	.

		The study divides itself into several pretty clearly defined parts .

		One con - sists of lectures of a more or less philosophical nature , which treat abstract propositions about government .

		Another is a comparative study of state constitutions at various periods down A CONSTITUTIONAL HISTOBT or THB AM '' * A * PEOPLJC , 1776-1880 .

		A third comprises an examination of selected typical constituencies , found in
Louisiana	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, and Califor - nia , which constituencies are believed to illus - trate the phases of civil evolution in the North , in the South , in the
Border States	LOCATION	, and in the
Far West	LOCATION	.

		Certain essays on special themes , which , while interesting , do not seem to fit into the general scheme , are interpolated , and the result is `` A Constitutional History of the American People . ''

		There must be decided difference of opinion as to the title .

		Is this a constitutional history of the `` American people '' ?

		Somewhere the author uses the words '' States-united '' in con - tradistinction to '' United States , '' and the ex - amination and comparison of state constitutions and legislative enactments which he has made suggests '' A Constitutional History of States - United '' as a preferable title instead of the ambitious one used by him .

		Those portions of the work which compare and contrast state constitutions are both inter - esting and valuable .

		Popular ideas are shown as reflected in the state papers prepared by constitutional conventions , and the growth of Democracy is well indicated by the same doc - uments .

		The various tables which show the changing qualifications of governor , senator , representative , elector , make a suggestive study .

		A large mass of material was sifted in the pre - paration of these chapters , and the results seem satisfactory .

		A just criticism could not be made except by one who had had the same advan - tages of material and had given the same pains - taking care to the investigation .

		Specific criticism can be made , however , of the other parts of the history .

		The arguments of a philosophical nature make difficult reading .

		The sentences are labored , and are too concise to be easily followed .

		There are frequent allu - sions to '' now , '' the '' present time , '' the '' fu - ture , '' which detract from the value of what is labelled history .

		In a transition period , such as that through which we are passing , what may be true in
1898	DATE	may be radically false in
1905	DATE	.

		The style is argumentative , as though the writer had certain propositions to prove .

		Two sentences will illustrate : '' It is doubtful whether a convention called at the present time to make a national Constitution would pro- vide for annual sessions of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. '' ''

		The fate of the
State Senate	ORGANIZATION	is a problem for the future . ''

		The value of the history is still further re - duced by expressions of opinion , which suggest the tricks of the platform and the bracketed newspaper comment , or else , being unsupported by evidence , carry no particular weight in oppo - sition to long-standing notions .

		Three or four such opinions are selected : '' The Revolution bred innumerable lawsuits and an army of lawyers ranging in ability from
John Marshall	PERSON	to
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	. '' ''


John Adams	PERSON	was the father of the public school , the
State University	ORGANIZATION	, the
State College	ORGANIZATION	, and the normal school . '' ''

		Clergymen were disqualified from civil office , not so much to separate
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	as to improve the profession . ''

		The latter statement is clearly discredited in other chapters where the privileges of the clergy under new constitutions are fully discussed .

		The opinion expressed in connection with the discovery of the
Columbia River	ORGANIZATION	by
Robert Gray	PERSON	, that it established our claim to
Oregon	LOCATION	, and that '' the law of discovery gave the Ore - gon country to the
United States	LOCATION	, '' can have little weight when it is recalled that
Robert Gray	PERSON	was not an authorized representative of the
United States	LOCATION	, and that only after many years of joint occupation and after long nego - tiation did the
United States	LOCATION	and Great Brit - ain reach an agreement which recognized the
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	country as part of the territory of the former .

		The governor , who is now an executive instead of a military character , is described in the words , '' In popular fancy he was the man on horse - back ; to-day he is the man with the quill , '' a rather strange way to put a contrast between former days and the present , and this infelicity of language is accompanied by a declaration , which is not generally true , that whereas in other times the governor 's message was a docu - ment which commanded respect , now it is '' con - signed to a committee and forgotten . ''

		The chapters which are devoted to a study of the special constituencies mentioned have much of interest in them , and , despite the ad - verse criticisms which may be made , the history is a suggestive one , many problems of our social development being comprehensively treated in it , as nowhere else in convenient form .

		The widening of the suffrage , the disturbing influ - ence of the '' free negro , '' the development of the frontier , the modification of ideas of gov - ernment brought about by the conditions in '' the West , '' and similar subjects , furnish food for much thought .

		In some respects the work is a real contribution to the literature of Amer - ican social and political life , although the faults indicated and the apparently unfortunate title 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, will probably deprive the author of praise which might otherwise be given for his pains - taking deductions from a study of a vast amount of special material .


FRANCIS W. SHEPARDSON	PERSON	.

		A GREAT HISTORIAN 'S TREATMENT OP
CROMWELL	LOCATION	, .

		* The promptness with which Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's second volume on '' The Commonwealth and Protectorate '' the sixteenth upon the Stuart period makes its appearance is a striking evidence of the systematic and business-like methods of the author .

		The volume opens with an account of the new opinions that were get - ting hold of the popular mind in the last days of the Parliamentary government .

		In the general unrest , bred of reaction from the religious - ness of the Puritan , together with the awaken - ing of materialistic motives in the nation , Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	sees the seeds of the Restoration already bursting into life .

		This prepares for the consideration of the various projects of re - form which early thrust themselves upon the attention of the
Long Parliament	LOCATION	, and the increasing evidence of the inability of that body to acquit itself of the new and vast responsi - bilities of its position .

		In the account of the completion of the re - duction of
Ireland	LOCATION	, there is little to interest the reader .

		Police court records are always tame reading , after the war correspondents have had their say .

		In passing , however , it is to be no - ticed that Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	does not favor the Irish policy of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, though he stops to say a good word for
Ireton	PERSON	.

		The plan of union with
Scotland	LOCATION	hardly meets with more favor .

		Yet it is difficult to see what other policy could have been adopted .

		Both countries were hotbeds of royal ism ; they had been re - duced by the sword , and only by the sword could they be held , and the possibility of future insurrection , or actual invasion of English soil , be forestalled .

		As it was , it must be admitted that , for the times , the concessions of
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment , and later of the Protector , were remark - ably liberal .

		Stern necessity forced the policy of Imperialism upon Parliament ; and if Impe - rial at all , its authority must be supported by a strong hand .

		Self-preservation demanded the subordination of both countries to the
Comraon	LOCATION	- HMTOKT OF TH COMMONWEALTH AND PROTECTORATE , 1649-1660 .

		wealth , and the denial of rights within the em - pire equal to those of
England	LOCATION	.

		Here was both the strength and the weakness of the Common - wealth .

		With the outbreak of the Dutch War and the consequent breaking down of what little prestige there still remained to the Long Par - liament , the interest of the reader is thoroughly awakened .

		The cause of the war , as presented by Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	, is not to be found in the Navigation Act , but in a far more serious griev - ance .

		The English insisted upon the right of searching Dutch vessels for the goods of an enemy .

		They also insisted that all foreign ves - sels , when within the narrow seas , should strike their colors in recognition of the authority of the English flag over these waters .

		The effort to enforce these obnoxious measures upon the high-spirited Dutchmen brought on the first clash of arms .

		Other causes more remote had irritated either country and prepared it for re - sistance : particularly the ambition of certain of the English leaders for the absorption of the
Protestant Netherlands	LOCATION	in the new English Imperial system , together with no slight fear of the return of the
House of Orange	ORGANIZATION	to power , thus threatening to give an additional support to the Stuart influence on the continent .

		This is somewhat different from the commonly ac - cepted view , which perhaps has given overmuch weight to the Navigation Act of
1651	DATE	, a very mild and inoffensive measure compared with the later act of Charles II .

		The chapters following give a detailed account of the events of the war , and are the first attempt to treat of this subject with any fulness or completeness .

		It is inter - esting to notice that Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	agrees with Professor
Laughton	PERSON	in rejecting the fable of Admiral
Tromp	PERSON	's famous broom .

		The dissipation of the lingering respect of the nation for the
Long Parliament	LOCATION	is closely associated with this Dutch War .

		The leaders of Parliament were apparently dazed by the new responsibilities which the success of En - glish arms had thrust upon them , and were rendered nerveless by their knowledge of the corruption of the members and the growing contempt of the army .

		The war was the doing of neither
Cromwell	PERSON	nor the army , and from the first had been unpopular with the people .

		It was contrary to all the traditions born of the bitter struggles of the past century that two Protestant nations , especially two so closely allied as the English and the Dutch , should seek to destroy each other .

		So , when at last the bankruptcy of the government compelled
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 223 the Parliament to turn again to confiscation for relief , its doom was sealed .

		The act of dissolution made
Cromwell	PERSON	a military dictator .

		But for the moment he shrank from the logical consequences of his audacity .

		Englishmen were not used to the idea of a dictator .

		They were familiar with a dictating
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		So at least the shadow of a
Parliament Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	must have , in order to give the appearance of legality to the new government .

		But how should the new Parlia - ment be brought into being ?

		A new election by the people would naturally suggest itself to every Englishman .

		But
Cromwell	PERSON	dared not trust the people .

		The reaction against
Puri	PERSON	- tanism was already too strong .

		So , soldier-like , he went straight at his mark , and named his own
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of course , such a body could not be called a Parliament in any legal sense ; and the members , when they came together , seem to have been fully conscious of their am - biguous position .

		Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	attempts to impart some dignity to the body by calling it the '' Nominated Parliament . ''

		The name is apt enough , but we confess to a liking for the old familiar '' Barebones '' a name which lacks dignity ; but then , that is what the '' Bare - bones Parliament '' lacked first and last .

		For a time ,
Cromwell	PERSON	let them have the leash .

		But when a real party of progress began to show itself , for all Englishmen were not as dead as
Charles I.	PERSON	, and some dared to have an opinion different from that of the
Lord General	ORGANIZATION	, in a word , proposed to abolish state support of clergy and do away with the Court of Chan - cery ,
Cromwell	PERSON	saw that it was time to lay the spirit which he had called up .

		When the abdication of his spurious
Parlia	PERSON	- ment was announced , with a fine show of sur - prise , hard to explain by his admirers who be - lieve always in the honest simplicity of their hero , he told the messengers that it was '' a heavy responsibility '' they were laying on his shoulders .

		Then followed the
Instrument of Government	ORGANIZATION	and the appointment of the Lord General as Protector of the Realm .

		This docu - ment , for once a written constitution for En - gland , and upon which
Cromwell	PERSON	held his brief , Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	has analyzed , and shows that , contrary to the prevailing opinion ,
Cromwell	PERSON	was by no means absolute , but was compelled to share his authority with the
Council of State	ORGANIZATION	; and suggests that the inability of the Protector always to bring the
Council	ORGANIZATION	to his way of thinking may account for some of the vacillation of the Protectoral government , so hard to tally with the view of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	which presents him as '' a man of supreme ability and iron resolution . ''

		This is the most unsatisfactory part of the volume .

		Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	has an ill-disguised fondness for the old hero , and can not break entirely with the traditional English interpre - tation of the administration of the Protector .

		He still sees in him the founder of
England	LOCATION	's foreign policy , of her navy , and of her
Ocean Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whereas it may be questioned whether
Cromwell	PERSON	ever caught more than the vaguest glimpses of any great foreign policy .

		He was surrounded by visionaries of the most radical type .

		In the popular mind , moreover , there had taken shape a very definite policy , inherited from the struggle of the generation past : that
England	LOCATION	should cast in the weight of her great military prestige with the Protestant nations against the Inquisition .

		Cromwell 's training had prepared him for the adoption of such a policy .

		Hence he did not favor the Dutch war , but leaned rather toward a league with
Sweden	LOCATION	and the Dutch against
Spain	LOCATION	and the Empire .

		But
Cromwell	PERSON	first and last was a practical man .

		There was little of the poet in his nature , and sentiment received little con - sideration in the making of his plans .

		From his loftier point of view he could see what few Englishmen of his day saw , that the issues of the Thirty Years War were dead , and that the new material interests of
England	LOCATION	were rapidly drawing her into currents where poor old
Spain	LOCATION	and her Inquisition would have no more influ - ence than the rotting hulks of her ancient Ar - mada .

		To
Cromwell	PERSON	, the maintaining of the great military state , which he had done so much to build up , and of which he was the sole head , was of far more importance than any partition of the colonial world with Protestant power or the building up of an anti-papal league .

		His motives were undoubtedly pure .

		He honestly believed , simple-hearted old soldier , that he was necessary to
England	LOCATION	; and only as existing conditions could be preserved could the rights of Englishmen be maintained , or the fruits of victory be saved against the plotting of exiled Stuarts , the smoldering hostility of
Ireland	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, or the numerous factions at home .

		Here , then , was
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's policy ; very differ - ent from the vast combination , the far-reaching planning of colonial empire , which is ascribed to him .

		The
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	had been estab - lished by the sword ; it could be maintained only by the sword .

		To that end
England	LOCATION	must keep up her present military establishment .

		224 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, ii - .

		however , was not such an easy matter , now that the open foes of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	had been crushed or driven over-seas , and the direct demand for an army was no longer felt .

		The people wanted peace , and were unwilling to go on contributing of their means for the support of the old war footing .

		In other words , like
Napoleon	PERSON	under somewhat similar circum - stances ,
Cromwell	PERSON	could not afford to remain long without war .

		He was as hard put to it for money as any beggar of a Stuart .

		What he needed was a profitable , self-supporting war .

		So , with the shrewdness of the soldier rather than of the statesman , regarding his own im - mediate needs rather than any remote conse - quences , he proposed that
France	LOCATION	or
Spain	LOCATION	, one or both , should furnish the money , and he apparently did not really care which , though Englishmen generally would have preferred to fight
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The political conditions of
Europe	LOCATION	at this time were extremely favorable for the plans of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	.

		The long duel of
Spain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	had reached a most critical point .

		In
1653	DATE
Mazarin	ORGANIZATION	had again returned to power , '' as om - nipotent as God the Father at the beginning of the world . ''

		But the government was weak - ened by a powerful revolt of its nobles , and the field of battle was in the heart of
France	LOCATION	.

		Yet
Spain	LOCATION	also had her troubles .

		Her ocean empire was declining rapidly , and financially she had been long since exhausted .

		Both parties seemed to feel that with
England	LOCATION	lay the decision of the long quarrel .

		Cromwell was evidently will - ing to interfere , but the side which he should support must be determined by the price paid .

		Now to Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	the great Protector seems here '' vacillating , weak , and fickle . ''

		It is because
Cromwell	PERSON	's real policy was not the policy which Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	thinks he ought to have espoused .

		There is in reality no fickleness , no weakness , no vacillation .

		On the contrary , he goes straight at his mark with a directness and bluntness and consistency which is almost brutal .

		Hence ensues the long series of nego - tiations with the two Catholic courts of the west , which Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	follows through to the end with characteristic patience .

		The posi - tion of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	is not one of dignity ; yet he has no doubt in his own mind concerning the object which he seeks to gain .

		He is like nothing so much as a camel-driver haggling for back - shish .

		Yet , like a camel-driver , he knows ex - actly what he wants : it is money .

		He does n't care which party rides his poor beast ; he knows they ca n't both ride at once , so he proposes that the one who secures the prize shall pay him well .

		Spain raised her bid at last to fifty thousand crowns a month .

		Some members of the Spanish council urged that as the whole fortune of
Spain	LOCATION	was at stake , even a hundred thousand crowns would be no exorbitant subsidy .

		Mazarin offered four , then five hundred thousand crowns a year .

		He also dangles
Dunkirk	LOCATION	before the eyes of the Protector , and offers to give him a free opportunity in the
Indies	LOCATION	, where he may enrich himself further upon
Spain	LOCATION	's treasure fleets .

		Still
Cromwell	PERSON	hesitated , that he might force a still higher bid from the one party or the other .

		Now , this may be statesmanship , but it looks too much like business , and business , too , of a low order : blackmail , in fact , for there was always the covert threat of punishment to the unsuccessful bidder .

		War at best is a bad business , and civilized nations are accustomed to regard war as justified only when great prin - ciples are at stake .

		But here is your great
Oliver	PERSON	, '' founder of British foreign policy , '' as cool as a huckster , offering the blood of En - glishmen in open market to the highest bidder : the one , the traditional foe of
England	LOCATION	, the harborer of the exiled Stuarts ; the other , the relentless foe of Protestantism and the land of the Inquisition .

		At last
France	LOCATION	would go no further , and
Cromwell	PERSON	was forced to close with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		But when
Spain	LOCATION	urged him to fulfil his contract and declare war against
France	LOCATION	, he hedged and postponed action .

		Two days later it transpired that he was again bargaining with the emissa - ries of
Mazarin	PERSON	and offering to betray
Spain	LOCATION	if
France	LOCATION	would raise her figure .

		It is said in justification of this double-dealing that
Oliver	PERSON	wanted
Dunkirk	LOCATION	, and he did n't care how he got it .

		But in the partial agreement of
June 18 , 1654	DATE	,
Cromwell	PERSON	expressly stipulated that
Dunkirk	LOCATION	was to be held only as a security for the payment of the annual subsidy which
France	LOCATION	was to give him for his support .

		Nor can it be said that
Oliver	PERSON	, in thus seeking at the last moment to ally with
France	LOCATION	against a power to which he had just solemnly pledged himself , was making a last effort to shelter the Huguenots ; for , in his anxiety to secure better terms than
Spain	LOCATION	had offered , he had ceased altogether to ask for any formal guarantee for the toleration of the French Protestants .

		Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	, with characteristic candor , is at last compelled to throw up in despair his task of finding ' * a policy '' for the Protector . ''

		Thus

		THE DIAL 225 far , '' he concludes , '' a study of the foreign policy of the
Protectorate	ORGANIZATION	reveals a distracting maze of fluctuations .

		Oliver is seen alternately courting

		After all allowance ... much remains only to be accounted for by
Oliver	PERSON	's own changeableness , '' a conclusion of the whole matter unworthy of an author as astute and penetrating as Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	usually is , and entirely out of keeping with what else we know of the great Protector .

DIC	ORGANIZATION	`` WORK ON
INDIA	LOCATION	.

		*
Abbe Dubois	PERSON	is among the most interesting characters in the history of Christian missions in
India	LOCATION	.

		Born in
1770	DATE	, dying in
1848	DATE	, he spent thirty-one years in
India	LOCATION	, chiefly in the Dekhan and
Madras	LOCATION	Presidency .

		While in
India	LOCATION	he adapted himself to the people among whom he lived , adopting the native dress , speak - ing a native tongue , eating the food of the country , respecting the recognized rules regard - ing ceremonial cleanness and caste .

		So intimate was his acquaintance with
Hindu	PERSON	life and char - acter that his opinion and advice were often important to English officials .

		In fact , the earlier manuscript of the work before us the only one heretofore translated and printed in English was purchased by the
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	and printed at their expense .

		After his long service in the mission field , the Abbe returned to
France	LOCATION	in
1823	DATE	, and lived there quietly until his death
twenty-five years later	DATE	.

		Remembering the Abbe 's exceptional oppor - tunities , it is interesting to notice some state - ments which he makes in a work -LRB- '' Letters on the State of Christianity in
India	LOCATION	'' -RRB- printed soon after his return to
France	LOCATION	.

		He says : '' Let the Christian religion be presented to these people under every possible light , ... the time of con - version has passed away , and under existing circum - stances there remains no human possibility of brinerinsr it back . ''

		Again , in speaking of his own work , so wisely conducted , he says : '' During the long period I lived in
India	LOCATION	in the capa - city of a missionary , I have made , with the assistance of a native missionary , in all between two and three hundred converts of both sexes .

		Of this number , two - thirds were Pariahs or beggars ; and the rest were com - posed of Sudras , vagrants , and outcasts of several tribes , who , being without resource , turned Christians in * HINDU MANNERS , CUSTOMS , AND CEREMONIES .

		These details and quotations are taken from a biographical sketch prefacing the present work , and written by
Henry K. Beauchamp	PERSON	, the translator .

		Mr.
Beauchamp	PERSON	's biography is interesting , and probably as complete as can be made , the Abbe having been a modest and re - tiring man .

		Mr.
Beauchamp	PERSON	also is supposed to have annotated the work ; but his annotation is worse than none .

		His notes are few in num - ber , trivial in importance , and captiously criti - cal ; they neither elucidate the author nor tend to increase the reader 's respect for him or his work .


Max Miiller	PERSON	's prefatory note is almost as bad : it damns by faint praise .


Dubois	PERSON	's work , however , is most important .

		The fact that it was written so long ago but makes it the more valuable ; many things , then commonplace , have now passed away forever .

		The Abbe 's mode of life and his simplicity of character gave him exceptional opportunity to see and know .

		It is true that much of his description of the life and practice of the Brah - min was drawn from ancient writings rather than from experience , and was probably no more actual usage in his time than it is now ; but he also did know much even of high-caste life from personal knowledge , and gives many data of great importance .

		As for his statements regarding other castes , they are almost entirely based upon careful personal observation .

		The work is divided into three parts ''
General View of Society	ORGANIZATION	in
India	LOCATION	and General Remarks on the Caste System , '' '' The Four States of Brahminical Life , '' '' Religion . ''

		The first two of these is discussed in the minutest detail ; the sketch of Hindu religion , while less detailed , is still a significant and fairly sym - metrical discussion .

		The work may be said to be almost encyclopaedic for its field .

		The older English edition has been , ever since its appearance , a veritable mine of material for students .

		The present translation , based upon a later , enlarged , corrected , and everyway much improved manuscript , should be even more use - ful to the students now entering the field .

Shanghai	LOCATION	, etc. , and also tells of a trip amongst the aborigines of For - mosa and of an expedition to the upper Yangstze .

		His description of a cheap and curious method the natives about Yen-Ping had of warming themselves is worth quoting . ''

		Many of the men hereabouts appeared deformed , but the deformity was due to the small charcoal fur - naces which they carried concealed beneath their dress , and used to keep their bodies warm .

		As there are no fireplaces in the houses , these portable furnaces prove very convenient substitutes .

		At first , when I saw so many humps about , I supposed that some special dis - ease must be common in the place , or else that the suf - ferers had gathered themselves together from different parts of the empire to test the efficacy of some curative
spring	DATE	, like the hot wells near
Foochow	LOCATION	, where I had seen crowds of feeble and infirm folk bathing in the healing vapours .

		But the little copper furnaces encased in basket-work supplied a less melancholy explanation of the mystery . ''

		This is a good popular descriptive hook , and is handsomely manufactured .

		It lacks a map , but has an appendix of Fonnosan words which may be of service to the philologist .

		To the numerous books on Thibet , Captain
M. S. Welby	PERSON	makes a notable and interesting contribution in his `` Through Unknown Thibet . ''

		Starting from
Srinagar	LOCATION	, he with a small party travelled due east across central and unexplored Thibet for
2000	DATE	miles to Tankar on the confines of
China	LOCATION	.

		For many hun - dreds of miles he traversed the dreary '' Roof of the World , '' 16000 feet above sea-level , entirely unin - habited , hut near the occasional fresh-water lakes , abounding in wild yak , antelope , and other game .

		He tells of seeing marmots '' as large as men . '' ''

		The holes down which they must have hidden were so large that I could have crawled down them myself . ''

		Captain
Welby	PERSON	's journey was in the highest degree adventurous , and lovers of adventure will read his narrative with absorbing interest .

Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		afar from our seething civilization into another world , an isolated and desolate region , which even in the author 's plain prosaic account powerfully stirs the imagination .

		The meeting with the Thib - etan caravan and the subsequent adventures with nomad Mongols are graphically told .

		Though Captain
Welby	PERSON	's record shows no special literary quality , nor such close observation of men and things as we should desire , yet we are thankful for the modest , simple narrative of a notable exploit .

		The work is provided with elaborate and valuable maps , and it contains many illustrations , some of which are very good .

		`` Halcyon Days in
Norway	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and the Dolomites , '' by Mr.
W. M. Lent	PERSON	, is a fairly well writ - ton account of commonplace experiences in common touring trips .

		The enthusiastic descriptions of scen - ery are too prolix and frequent .

		The sketches in the second part of the book are extremely brief , and too often the book has the air of an itinerary .

		The paragraphing and literary structure show little care .

		The portion on the
Dolomites	LOCATION	has some value and interest , hut as a whole the work has little ralson d'etre .

		The illustrations are hackneyed , but are clearly executed .

		``
Canada	LOCATION	and its Capital , '' by the Hon.
J. D. Edgar	PERSON	, is a popular summary , historical and de - scriptive , designed primarily to enlighten Canadians in general '' about
Ottawa	LOCATION	, and the doings of the people there . ''

		The writer , who is Speaker of the
Canadian House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, naturally enlarges on political history and life , but he also gives attention to Ottawan literature and sport .

		He regards the question of annexation to the
United States	LOCATION	as '' not a live one in
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		The book has a number of interesting illustrations .

		In The
Rainbow	ORGANIZATION	's End :
Alaska	LOCATION	, '' Mrs.
A. P. Henderson	PERSON	gives her impressions of a trip , in
1897	DATE	, from
Chicago	LOCATION	to
Dawson	PERSON	by way of the
Yukon River	LOCATION	route .

		The narrative is distinctly feminine in its point of view , and is written in pleasant en - tertaining style .

		The author has also gleaned infor - mation from miners and others , on the animals of
Alaska	LOCATION	, particularly reindeer and dogs , on the In - dians , on the resources of
Alaska	LOCATION	, on the miner 's outfit , etc. .

		While giving little that is exactly new , the book is an intelligent and readable account .

		The photographic illustrations are of much interest .

		Mr.
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	, whose recent book on ' The Conquering Turk '' was lately reviewed in these col - umns , has followed up that work by a summary on
Egypt	LOCATION	, entitled ``
Egypt	LOCATION	in
1898	DATE	. ''

		He deals capably with English rule and influence , though sometimes in an over-glorifying strain .

		He also describes in a breezy way a
Nile	ORGANIZATION	trip and a visit to the Coptic monastery of
St. Mark	ORGANIZATION	; and in connec - tion therewith he gives a capital little chapter to
Cook	ORGANIZATION	, the mighty tourist agent .

		The hook is bright and incisive , with occasional undue straining for effect The guests at
Shepheard 's Hotel	ORGANIZATION	,
Cairo	LOCATION	, he characterizes as '' the people who live in their boxes and grand hotels , who know all lands but no Ian -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 227 guages , who have been everywhere and done noth - ing , looked at everything and seen nothing , read everything and know nothing , who spoil the globe by trotting on it . ''

		Again , remarking on an - cient Egyptian art , he says : '' The civilized idea of producing fine art is to make it beautiful : the bar - barous idea is to make it large . ''

		Mere obiter dicta are these expressions , but striking and suggestive .

		The illustrations are , unfortunately , rather blurry .

		Mr.
J. E. Stevens	PERSON	, as commercial resident at
Manila	LOCATION	for a
Boston	LOCATION	firm , in 189496 , has written down his experiences and impressions in lively manner in a book entitled '' Yesterdays in the
Phil	LOCATION	- ippines . ''

		The volume is particularly devoted to describing social life and to a record of holiday excursions .

		In the light of recent events , it is interesting to notice that in celebrating the
King	PERSON	's birthday one of the set pieces of fireworks was '' a royal representation of a full-rigged man-of-war carrying the Spanish flag , and she was shown in the act of utterly annihilating an iron-clad belonging to some indefinite enemy . ''

		Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	does not favor the possession of the
Phillippines	LOCATION	by the
United States	LOCATION	.

		While this book has not the thoroughness or competence of
Foreman	PERSON	's comprehensive work , it is much more entertaining and popular , although its vivacity sometimes comes a little too close to flip - pancy and vulgarity .

		It contains a map and some interesting illustrations .

		The Rev.
Francis E. Clarke	PERSON	, well known as the founder and president of the
Christian Endeavor Union	ORGANIZATION	, described his recent world-trip in the inter - ests of this organization in a series of articles to various periodicals , and these he has now collected in a volume entitled '' Fellow Travellers . ''

		The book contains sketches of mission work and impres - sions of countries and peoples , and is written in a simple , direct , modern style , which will recommend it to many other than the constituency primarily addressed .

		There are a few serviceable illustrations .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Economic aspects Dr :
Cunningham	PERSON	's
Western Civili	LOCATION	- ty ` ancient zation in its Economic Aspects '' civilization , .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an examination of the main economic features in the growth and dif - fusion of civilized life in
Western Europe	LOCATION	; and is therefore part of that reform in the writing of his - tory which insists that the life of the people , in ancient and mediaeval times , is at least as well worth studying as the battles and deaths of kings .

		Pro- fessor
Cunningham	PERSON	considers , in well-ordered suc - cession , the commercial and industrial conditions which made or marred the prosperity of
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Judaea	LOCATION	,
Phoenicia	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and
Constanti	PERSON	- nople .

		The temptation to diverge into excursus on other attractive features of ancient life must have been great ; but the author has adhered stead - ily to the path marked out , and , for this time at least , archaeology , art , and military annals have re - mained ancillary to their sister of to-day political economy .

		What strikes us most in this instructive essay is the fact that it approaches each of these ancient civilizations at the epoch of its greatest industrial or commercial prosperity , so that its spe - cial contribution may be extracted under the most favorable conditions ; instead of the traditional trac - ing of growth , culmination , and decay .

		Thus , the Phoenicians are studied at the time when they sailed , colonized , and traded over the whole
Mediterranean	LOCATION	; the bloom-time of Greek history the age of Peri - cles is selected ; and
Rome	LOCATION	's industrial conditions are described as they existed in the best days of the Republic and the Empire .

		Cause and effect are clearly discriminated ; and in general the conclu - sions reached commend themselves to students of political history .

		On economic grounds , the author condemns the magnificent art-structures reared by Pericles on the
Acropolis	LOCATION	; and the verdict , as one not often heard , is worth producing here : '' The treasure was exhausted once for all , and there was no means of replacing it , such as arises with capital employed in industry or trade ; it was locked up in forms that are artistically superb , but economically worthless .

		There may be sentimentalists who are shocked at any such philistine efforts to appraise the economic importance of the grandest works of architectural art .

		But after all , we may appreciate them better if we know what they cost ; we may still feel that they were well worth the cost , but at least let us recognize what it was .

		A heroic action may cost a man his life , and we may hold it was a deed that was well worth dying for .

		So , too , it may be that the buildings on the Acropolis were well worth the strain they caused ; it is none the less true that they helped to exhaust the energies of
Athens	LOCATION	... They proved to be a mere drain on the accumulated wealth of the present , while they gave no help of any sort for producing more wealth in the future .

		The wealth of Miletus was continu - ally circulating , and gave the means for an indus - trial community to grow and flourish ; the wealth of
Athens	LOCATION	and her allies was sunk , once for all , in creations of marvellous beauty . ''

		The origin , '' The Founders of Geology '' -LRB- Mac - and founders in ill an -RRB- is the title of a volume con - of geology .

		taining a course of six lectures deliv - ered at
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	by Sir
Archibald Geikie	PERSON	, Director-General of the
Geological Survey of Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The work presents a history of geology , which had its germs in the writings of the cosmogonists ,
Leibnitz	PERSON	and
Buffon	PERSON	, and in the labors of Guettard , who studied miner - alogy , palaeontology , and physiography , from about the middle of the
last century	DATE	, but whose name , even , is nearly forgotten .

		A science of such intrin - sic interest soon aroused votaries .

		Desmarest studied the mountains of
Auvergne	LOCATION	; De Saussurc penetrated the fastnesses of the Alps ; then came 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	,
Werner	PERSON	, with his Neptunian theory , assuming that all rocks were deposited under water .

		The origin of basalt was the bone of contention in those days : was it born of water or fire ?

		The Neptunists out - numbered the Vulcanists .

		After a time ,
Hutton	PERSON	entered the arena .

		He distinguished between sed - imentary and igneous rocks , holding that granite and basalt were erupted from the interior of the earth .

		The discussion was long and bitter .

		The disposition to generalize upon an inadequate knowledge of facts was unavoidable .

		Both parties knew a little truth and imagined a great deal of error .

		About the beginning of the present century appeared Cnvier and
Brongniart	PERSON	, who laid the foundation of stratigraphic geology , illustrated by palaeontology , zoology , and comparative anatomy .


William Smith	PERSON	, their contemporary , made the be - ginnings of a geological survey of
England	LOCATION	.

		The work , having now assumed the outlines of its true proportions , was further aided in
England	LOCATION	,
Scot	PERSON	- land and
Wales	LOCATION	, by
Sedgwick	PERSON	and
Murchison	PERSON	, who developed the classification of the Devonian ,
Silu	PERSON	- rian , and Cambrian systems .


William Allen Logan	PERSON	showed how the outlines of European geology were applicable to explain the geological conditions found in the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Adding a dis - cussion of glacial geology as studied in
Switzer	PERSON	- land , the British Isles , and
America	LOCATION	by
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, of petrography by
Nicol	PERSON	,
Bryson	PERSON	, and
Sorby	PERSON	, the lecturer closes with a brief account of the labors of
Charles Lyell	PERSON	and
Charles Darwin	PERSON	.

		The interest and value of the course of lectures lies in the com - prehensive view given of the progress made by geol - ogy in the past century and a half to its present commanding position in the circle of the natural sciences .

		Tto lot ** The volume entitled '' Light , Visible jactt and iheoriet and Invisible '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is made about Ltgiu .

		U p Q f rgpQjtg o f B j x lectures delivered by Professor
Sylvanus P. Thompson	PERSON	, at the
Royal Institution	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	.

		Lectures presented , as were these , to large and popular audiences , must be cast in a style addressed to the intelligent layman ; must present the latest phases of discovery and of theory , abreast with the most advanced science ; and must be profusely and aptly illustrated .

		In each of these respects these lectures display the skill of one who is master both of his subject and of the methods of its presentation .

		The fertility of invention which has devised new forms of experiment , and the skill of manipulation in presenting illustrations new and old , show the same aptness which gave
Tyndall	PERSON	his fame as an exponent as well as a discoverer of sci - ence .

		The lecturer has not attempted to cover the entire field .

		Geometrical optics is necessarily avoided .

		and with it the theory and construction of optical instruments , together with spectrum analysis and most of the subject of color vision .

		The theory of light-waves is plainly elucidated ; so are polari - zation , the spectrum visible and invisible , and the later discoveries as to the kathode or Rontgen rays .

		The method of producing pictures for commercial uses , in which every conceivable hue , tint , and tone may be reproduced by printing successively yellow , red , and blue pigments upon white paper , is simply and clearly explained .

		The crucial phase of the process is that before the light from a multi-colored object is allowed to fall upon a sensitized plate in a camera it has been made to pass through a filter that has arrested all rays but those of one potency , yellow , red , or blue .

		One negative is thus made with yellow rays only ; another with red only ; an - other with blue only , and from each a corresponding positive is made , or a half-tone plate is prepared .

		From the half-tone plate made by yellow light a print is made with yellow ink ; on this the plate from the red superposes a print made with red ink ; on this the plate from the blue adds its contribution printed with blue ink .

		The result is a picture of a perfection hitherto unknown .

		Another work on the
American Navy	ORGANIZATION	serves to show the remarkable revival of interest felt by the people of the
United States	LOCATION	in that single institution of theirs which has always been both ornamental and useful .

		The
Navy Department	ORGANIZATION	informs the public that the personnel of the men seeking to enlist for service on the sea has been changed very much for the better since the victory at
Manila	LOCATION	taught the infant Amer - ican mind that it , too , could learn to shoot ; and Mr.
Charles Morris	PERSON	, with '' The Nation 's
Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , emphasizes the fact that five years have hardly elapsed since Mr.
Edgar Stanton Maclay	PERSON	gave Americans the first history they had ever had an opportunity to read for instruction in respect of their ships and sailors .

		Since then ,
Roosevelt	PERSON	,
Barnes	PERSON	,
Spears	PERSON	, and others , have pub - lished histories ; Captain
Mahan	PERSON	has risen to the first eminence , at home and abroad ; two or three men and one woman have written cheerful historical novels , mostly for the young , in which the interest is both American and nautical ; several admirals in our service , notably Trenchard and
Franklin	PERSON	, have added memoirs of much interest ; and a bushel or so of poets have celebrated the deeds of the sea - fighters of
America	LOCATION	, who in this respect had there - tofore been sadly neglected .

		Among all these there is still room for such a book as Mr.
Morris	PERSON	has de - vised .

		He opens with a brief account of what has been done in the past to make the Stars and Stripes respected on the seas , and he concludes with the tale of the ''
New Navy	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		There are few omissions of consequence , the most serious of them being in respect of the recent rebuilding of certain ships ; and an excellent handbook results .

		Hawaii ourf more .

		Numerous as have been the books about
Hawaii	LOCATION	of late , Miss
Mary H. Krout	PERSON	's ''
Hawaii	LOCATION	and a Revolution '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- offers much that is new and varied .

		As the title indicates , the book contains considerable descriptive matter , which , however , is not confined
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 to the theme , but includes a visit to
Samoa	LOCATION	-LRB- and
Stevenson	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Australia	LOCATION	, and
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		The author did not travel extensively through the Islands , hence her treatment of the unique natural phenomena there presented is not so complete as that of some of her predecessors .

		She is happy in describing people , places , and institutions which came to her notice , and her anecdotes and personal incidents give a strong local color to the book .

		Po - litically , the author is frankly on the side of the party which successfully carried through the revo - lution , though she acknowledges that she went to the Islands with strong sympathy for the natives as a people who had been unjustly defrauded of their rights .

		The dealings of the
United States	LOCATION	with the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	are treated at length , with outspoken criticism of the president , cabinet officer , commissioner , and minister who conducted them .

		At times her statements pass the point of guarded expression and become captious fault-finding .

		The author apologizes for the frequent recurrence of the personal pronoun .

		The brave spirit in which she did her work in the presence of much personal suffering deserves commendation , but undoubtedly the repeated reference to private inconvenience mars the result from a literary point of view .

		Wild life infield and wood .

		Very entertaining tales of the wild animals of the woods and meadows and brooks of
New England	LOCATION	are to be found in Mr.
F. Schuyler Mathews	PERSON	's '' Familiar Life in Field and Forest '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		A true student of nature , the author has succeeded in making the acquaintance of such uncanny folk as '' our ancient enemy the ophidian , '' and of '' that famous essence - peddler '' and much slandered friend of the orchard and garden .

		Frequent references to the best Amer - ican authorities upon all points of scientific import - ance are supplemented by the writer 's own obser - vations and abundant drawings ; while a series of pho - tographs of wild animals , by Mr.
W. L. Underwood	PERSON	, add much to the interest in the book .

		A popular account is given of the common frogs , salamanders , snakes , a few of the birds , and most of the mammals , of the
Eastern States	LOCATION	, and the story is told in such a pleasing manner that every lover of Nature will be charmed with this new glimpse at these shy little people of the woods .

		The preface contains a plea for their preservation that every boy -LRB- and many would-be sportsmen -RRB- should read and heed .

		The story of the
Franks	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Lewis Sergeant	PERSON	's work on '' The
Franks	PERSON	, from their Origin as a Con - federacy to the Establishment of the Kingdom of
France	LOCATION	and the German Empire '' is a compact volume of about 350 pages in the '' Story of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The limits of the nar - rative are dimly defined at the beginning , sharply at the end .

		The author recognizes the difficulty of sepa - rating what is historically authentic '' from that which at best has but a dubious origin . ''

		That he has well discharged the task will be conceded by most read - ers .

		From the middle of the
third century	DATE	, when the
Franks	PERSON	are first mentioned in history , down to 987 , when
Hugh Capet	PERSON	was acknowledged King of
France	LOCATION	, is an ample space to cover ; but Mr.
Ser	PERSON	- geant has gone patiently , even briskly , over it all .

		He has made good use of his authorities , from Tac - itus to
Palgrave	LOCATION	, and gives us results rather than citations .

		Legends are generally discarded , but the story is none the less attractive for that .

		Of helps to make the book useful as a manual of reference there is no lack , such as genealogical tables , terri - torial maps , and two indexes , one being of Roman names with their modern equivalents .

		The volume is handsomely illustrated , the frontispiece being an excellent wood-cut from
Durer	PERSON	's famous painting of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	.

		In the matter of spelling , Mr.
Ser	PERSON	- geant very sensibly adheres to the popular forms , and writes Clovis instead of Hlodowig or Chlodo - vech .

		But he would have done better to spell the name of the eastern kingdom
Austrasia	PERSON	-LRB- with
Kitchin	PERSON	and others -RRB- instead of
Austria	LOCATION	, if only to avoid confusion with the later great empire of the Hapsburgs .

		A Yankee There are two good reasons why Professor Prof .

		Moses Coit Tyler should repub - in
England	LOCATION	.

		jjg ^ e8sav8 written during a sojourn in
England	LOCATION	, ending in
1866	DATE	, at just this time : one is the unusual interest felt in British affairs since the two nations learned , a month or two ago , how to be reasonably polite to one another ; the second is the increased interest felt in anything Professor
Tyler	PERSON	has written , by reason of his recent praiseworthy services in behalf of American letters .

		The little papers which make up the contents of '' Glimpses of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- are popular in treatment , good-natured in manner , and interesting in sub - stance .

		The traditional attitude of
America	LOCATION	toward the English intellect is humorously upheld , and with it such a real appreciation of all that has made En - gland the envy of the European world as should be expected from such a writer .

		The period covered is the exceedingly interesting though provoking one of the Civil War and its close , and the veering senti - ment of the ruling classes abroad receives adequate attention .

		Some of the tales have been worn thread - bare by the lapsing years , but their repetition is the more readily pardoned since Professor
Tyler	PERSON	was their original discoverer in most cases .

		A student 's
Motley	ORGANIZATION	.

		Any condensation of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's '' Rise of the Dutch Republic '' necessarily destroys much of the charming style and eloquent language of the original work , and Dr.
William Elliot Griffis	PERSON	's attempt in this direction , in his '' Student 's Motley '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , proves no exception to the rule .

		Persons who are inclined to historical reading , and presumably '' students '' also , will still prefer to read
Motley	ORGANIZATION	himself ; while for those , if there are any such , who desire to avoid the philosophy of history , and to garner only a series of facts , the book is not suited , inasmuch as THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, the original matter in the work is reduced bat a little more than a third by this condensation .

		In Part VII. , which continues the history of
Holland	ORGANIZATION	from the death of
William	LOCATION	the Silent to the present time , Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	has given us his own interpreta - tion of historical events , and his work is marked by scholarly care and excellent writing .

		The chap - ten devoted to Dutch history in the seventeenth century are especially valuable , and constitute in some respects a distinct contribution to historical writing , because of their clearness and accuracy of statement and fine characterization .

		In fact , one is led to regret that the author did not devote more time and space to a history of later
Holland	LOCATION	instead of attempting a condensation of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is noteworthy for the numerous excellent portraits of the men and women of importance in the polit - ical and religions history of the nation .

		It contains a map of modern
Holland	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	, and has a good index .

		TtoPUorimti * Another book by the same author their th % ?

		hL * t. '' Th Pilgrims in their Three Homes , '' issued in very attractive form by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Aside from the chapters on
Bradford	PERSON	and firewater , which are interesting , and might be collected in entirety from scattered pages of the '' Student 's Motley , '' the book has little that is attractive save to the stu - dent of genealogies .

		While there are many evidences of the author 's study and of his familiarity with the conditions which existed in the historic places he has undertaken to describe , the narration is so dis - connected , as where he jumps from the discussion of the constitution of the early English hundred in one paragraph , to an account , in the next , of the coal production in
Nottinghamshire	LOCATION	, that the reader receives no clear picture of the life or sur - roundings of the Pilgrims ` in any one of their three homes .

		The impression received from the book is that it was written to utilize numerous odd ends of information gathered in preparation of other and more scholarly works .

		The fifth monthly volume in the new biographical edition '' of Thack - eray -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- contains the '' Sketch Book , '' Irish and Parisian , together with the '' Jour - ney from Cornhill to
Cairo	LOCATION	. ''

		Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	's intro - duction is extremely interesting for its intimate revelation of the novelist during the years of his early struggle for a fame just beginning to be achieved .

		Here is a bit of rollicking pessimism from a letter of
1841	DATE	: '' Please when you write not to give me any account whatever of any gaieties in which you indulge , or any sort of happiness falling to the share of you or anybody else .

		But if any - body meets with an accident , is arrested , ruined , has a wife run away with , if C. falls ill and is marked with the smallpox , do be so kind as to write me off word immediately , and I will pay the post cheerfully .

		... Despair , madam , is the word .

		Byronish , I hate mankind , and wear my shirt-collar turned down . ''

		Bioyraphical edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		It is now nine years since the appearance of Professor
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	's '' The State , '' and they have been years of increasing appreciation of the admirable quali - ties of that text-book of political science .

		It represented to a large extent a breaking of new ground in the field of college work , and won for itself from the start so firm a foothold that we wondered something of the sort had not been done before .

		But the political world moves not a little in a decade of these modern times , and a revision was needed .

		Such an improved edition has just been published -LRB-
Heath	LOCATION	-RRB- , embodying the latest arrangements of the political kaleidoscope , both in this country and in
Europe	LOCATION	, and the stout volume of over six hundred pages is made more valuable than ever be - fore by the timely revision to which it has been subjected .

		Rear Admiral
Franklin	PERSON	, in bis '' Memories '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , gives a running picture of his life in the
U. S. Navy	ORGANIZATION	, from
1841	DATE	till his retirement from active service in
1888	DATE	.

		Many are the changes which he describes in the evolution of the ''
New Navy	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		His narrative is very informal , going into many personal details , giving im - pressions as made upon his mind , and describing places and persons with great interest .

		We confess that we sometimes feel a lack of dignity in the book ; and yet perhaps this contributes in a way to the piquancy of the narrative .

		The Sixteenth Annual Report of the
Dante Society	ORGANIZATION	, published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has for its chief fea - ture a discussion , by Mr.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	, of Professor
Rajna	PERSON	's critical text of the '' De Vulgari Eloquentia . ''

		Mr.
T. W. Koch	PERSON	carries on , for the two years 1895-97 , his list of additions to the
Harvard Dante	ORGANIZATION	collection , which now numbers over two thousand volumes .

		New subjects for the
Harvard Dante	ORGANIZATION	prize are announced , and an increase in the membership of the Society is re - ported by the secretary , Mr.
Arthur Richmond Marsh	PERSON	.

		There are nearly a hundred living members , a number which should be at least doubled during the coming year .

		We might almost think that we know all that is nec - essary of the Sepoy Rebellion ; but those most familiar with that event will most keenly enjoy the record of '' Daily Life during the Indian Mutiny , '' by Mr.
J. W. Sherer	PERSON	, who , in his civic relationship , was intimately associated with the English leaders .

		Mr.
Sherer	PERSON	does not intend his work as an independent history , but as a supplement to other larger works , giving in familiar form many facts that the more pretentious historians would not include .

Pennell	PERSON	add to the enjoyment of the reader , and the appendix on the route will be useful to the intending traveller .

		To one who knows
Princeton	LOCATION	merely through its ex - ploits celebrated in the daily papers , such a book as Mr.
James W. Alexander	PERSON	's ''
Princeton	LOCATION	, Old and New ** -LRB- Scribner -RRB- seems to supply a little touch of final beauty which the university itself appears to lack in a degree .

		The book U handsomely printed and bound , and the contents , though brief , are filled with just such gentle dignity at serves to tone down the crudity of under - graduate life .

		It is , in brief , a book for the Princeton man to live up to .

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 231 LITERARY : NOTES . ''

		Beauchamp 's Career '' and '' The Adventures of Harry Richmond '' have just been added to the new edi - tion of Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	's novels .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are the publishers .

		The awakening of interest in the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	has occasioned the bringing out of a new and cheap edition of Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's series on '' The
Navy	ORGANIZATION	in the Civil War , '' the three volumes issued being by Professor Soley , Admiral
Ammen	PERSON	, and Captain
Mahan	PERSON	.

		`` The Plan of an
Ethical Sunday School	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
W. L. Sheldon	PERSON	, describing the work done by the
Ethical Society	ORGANIZATION	of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, is published in pamphlet form by Mr.
S. Burns Weston	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		It is a sugges - tive little book , and offers a reasonable solution of an increasingly difficult religious problem .

		The series of '' Stories by Foreign Authors , '' published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, is now complete in ten volumes , like the corresponding series of '' Stories by English Authors '' and '' Stories by American Authors . ''

		The three series taken together , in thirty neat volumes , offer a liberal selection of the best modern fiction in minia - ture .

		The average is about six stories to the volume .

		`` The Story of
Gladstone	PERSON	's Life , '' by Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	, is perhaps the best of the popular biographies of the great politician who died a few months ago , and in the new edition , just published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the story is finished with chapters upon the last year of
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		It now makes a handsome volume of more than five hundred pages , abundantly illustrated , and printed in large type upon heavily glazed paper . ''

		Kant und
Helmholtz	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
Ludwig Goldschmidt	PERSON	, is the title of a study in popular science published by
Herr Leopold Voss	PERSON	, of
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		After an introductory chapter upon the general points of comparison between the two great thinkers , and a brief analysis of the
Kant	PERSON	- ian doctrine , the treatise reaches the special subject of '' Die Raumfrage , '' with which the work is chiefly con - cerned , and which carries on the discussion with special reference to the non-Euclidean forms of geometry .

		Dr.
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	's `` An Old English Grammar and Exercise Book '' -LRB-
Allyn & Bacon	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has just been reissued in a new and enlarged edition .

		At the same time , we have from
Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	an '' Anglo-Saxon Prose Reader , '' prepared by Professors
W. M. Baskervill	PERSON	and
James A. Harrison	PERSON	.

		There are only about forty pages of selections , but a number of texts are included that have not generally been used in elementary books of this sort , thus giving the reader a certain degree of freshness .

		A journal that should have an extended circulation in this country is '' The National Review '' of
London	LOCATION	, both for the large space which it gives to American affairs , and for the tone and spirit friendly but not patronizing , frank but not fatuous in which they are treated .

		A nation , like an individual , likes to be under - stood ; and the editor of `` The National , '' and those of his contributors who are permitted to write on Amer - ican affairs , show in the main that they understand Americans better often than they understand them - selves .

		The comments of the editor , Mr.
Maxse	PERSON	, in the admirable department of '' Episodes of the Month , '' are forceful and informing ; there is also a well-written regular department of ''
American Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
A. Maurice Low	PERSON	; while the special articles on military and naval events , by such expert authorities as Mr.
H. W. Wilson	PERSON	and Admiral Colomb , are not excelled in value by anything printed anywhere . ''

		The National '' ` is de - voted largely to political affairs of universal interest ,
Lord Salisbury	LOCATION	, Hon.
George Curzon	PERSON	, Hon.
A. J. Bal	PERSON	- four , among others , being contributors in this field ; while literature proper is represented by Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	,
Sidney J. Low	PERSON	, and other names as well known in this country as in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The National '' should have an American office and a substantial American constituency .

		VIII. , SELF CULTURE was greatly enlarged in size and scope , its price reduced from 82.00 to 81.00 a year , and illustrations introduced .

		While the pictures are the best half-tone work , they are designed to really illustrate the text , and not for purposes of embellishment .

		The maga - zine also now appears in a new and attractive dress .

		Every number will contain 128 double-column pages of text , printed on fine paper , from clear type .

		It is intended to have from three to five articles every month of the same high character as the best discussions of The Forum ,
North American Review	ORGANIZATION	, and
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, while the remaining articles will be of a more purely literary , historical , and instructive character .

		No effort will be spared to make SELF CULTURE an ideal periodical for the best homes , and it will be the constant study of its publishers to have each number so made up as to secure the attention of every member of the family old enough to take any interest in good literature .

		We pledge our best efforts to make the magazine always , and in every way , wholesome , stimulating , and helpful .

		Editor of SELF CULTURE : When I read of your intended change of price and form , I was sorry ; but the
September	DATE	number assures me that SELF CULTURE is still to be worth six of those magazines which busy workers and students look over and lay down , finding life is too short for such diluted indulgence .

		SELF CULTURE has been a stimulus and a help to me in my work , and I wish it the highest success .


MARGARET C. GILMORE	PERSON	.


Columbus	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Sept. 21 , 1898	DATE	.

		Gentlemen : The change in your magazine is a great improvement , although it was good enough before , and will no doubt meet with a great success .

		I like it because its pages are not filled with the gaudy pictures of the goddesses of the stage , and there is no cheap fiction in it , nothing of a light and transient character , but everything that appears in it can be '' pinned in the hat '' and remembered .

		It is refreshing to read it after wading through the chaff of the '' popular '' magazine .

		So long as it sticks to the line it has been pursuing , it will certainly continue to grow .

OMAHA	LOCATION	EXPOSITION .

		When the World 's Fair at
Chicago	LOCATION	ceased to exist , it was supposed we should ne'er look upon its like again .

		However , the
Trans-Mississippi Exposition	ORGANIZATION	at
Omaha	LOCATION	has effectively reproduced in similarity all of the build - ings which made the
White City	ORGANIZATION	so attractive in
1893	DATE	.

		It does not now take weeks to wander through grounds and structures and then be compelled to go away with a jumble of ideas , for the
Omaha Exposition	ORGANIZATION	people have profited by past experience , and have so improved the arrangement of exhibits that no more than two or three days of time need be consumed in admiration and inspec - tion of the marvellous resources of the West , collected together in the chief city of
Nebraska	LOCATION	.

		Even the new Midway is a reproduction of the far - famed Street of All Nations of
1893	DATE	, with many improve - ments upon the original .

		The electric lighting of the buildings , grounds , and lagoon at night makes a scene of enchanting beauty , alone worth traveling a thousand miles to see .

		The means of communication between the city and the grounds are ample , and the distance to be traversed is short .

		The ways of reaching
Omaha	LOCATION	are innumerable , but chief among them is the direct
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Omaha	LOCATION	short line of the
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Milwaukee & St. Paul Rail	ORGANIZATION	- way , with its electric-lighted , vestibuled trains , leaving

		The Battle of the Strong .

		By
GILBERT PARKER	PERSON	, author of The Seats of the Mighty , '' etc. 12mo , s 1 .

		.

		- > < .

		Few novelists now writing in
America	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	reach a larger or more attentive audience than that which welcomes a new story by
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	.

		The scenes of '' The Battle of the Strong '' are principally in the
Isle of Jersey	LOCATION	.

		The story opens early in
1781	DATE	, when a company of French soldiers is sent to capture the island from the British .

		Without giving the plot , it may be said that the time is one of great historical significance ; the French Revolution casts its strong , fierce light on the scene ; and war , loyalty , treason , love , and devotion lend a most truthful and often tragic variety to the tale .

		The story is of ingrossing interest , and is told with a power and mastery which will add even to Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's already great reputation as a novelist .

		This last , argued and affirmed in wonderful variety of form , Dr.

Oct. 16	DATE	, DOUBLEDAY & McCLURE COMPANY PUBLISH THE BOOK OF THE YEAR RUDYARD KIPLING 'S NEW BOOK 3d Edition Printed \ `` THE DAY 'S WORK . ''

		| Before I TNQUESTIONABLY the most noteworthy event of
1898	DATE	in the world of books is this new ^ volume containing twelve stories by Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		Not only is it the product of his most mature genius thus far , but its range is extraordinary from the delicate dream quality of '' The Brushwood Boy , '' for instance , to those stirring tales in which he voices the monstrous throbbings of the marine engine and the American locomotive .

		The volume has been making for three or four years , and is the best work of an author who stands easily at the head of contemporary writers .

		The extraordinary advance demand necessitated the printing of three large editions to supply the booksellers ' first orders .

		SPECIFICATIONS : Size , 5 -LCB- x8J ; Binding , green cloth ; Pages , 431 ; Type , 10 point ; Illustrations , 8 full-pages bj

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	fills in the educa - tional firmament a place similar to that occu - pied in the actual heavens by those novce that flash out from time to time , perplexing the astronomer with the question as to the probable endurance of their brilliancy .

		No university has ever had more advertising , or kept itself more conspicuously in the public eye .

		The success in this case has been for the most part legitimate ; for the foundations of a solid insti - tution of learning have been laid , and the essen - tials have been well provided for .

		Nor is there any reason to anticipate for this university the fate that might be suggested by our introduc - tory trope , since the large endowments already in hand , and the further endowments almost sure to follow , insure for the institution a place among the fixed stars .

		But its most serious friends have more than once had occasion to question some of the extensions of its activity , and to feel that even its great store of reserve energy might be taxed too heavily ; that by reaching out in too many directions at once , by lending itself to educational experiments in such great variety , by seeking to exert its influ - ence in so many fields of intellectual activity , it might incur the danger to which the higher education in a democratic age and country is peculiarly exposed the danger of cheapening the ideals that should always be associated with the name of
University	ORGANIZATION	, of stooping too low to conquer a kind of success that is not worth conquering at such a cost , and that may well be left to such popular agencies as '' Chautauqua '' assemblies and '' Cosmopolitan '' enterprises .

		An examination of the '' Annual Register '' of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	reveals the exist - ence of a system of educational machinery so complex as to bewilder the reader , and fill him with a kind of awe at the spectacle of so varied an exhibition of miscellaneous activities .

		Be - sides the work proper to a university , there are such developments as extension lectures , and class - study exercises , and correspondence courses , and experimental schools , and affiliated schools , and cooperating schools not affiliated , and what not .

		All of these things demand much time and energy , and all , however useful they may be absolutely , do not seem to com - 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, mend themselves as adjuncts of university work .

		Directly or indirectly leading up to degrees , as most of these ingenious devices do , one can not escape the suspicion that they somehow lower the price that should be paid for university honors , and give encouragement to the notion that the higher education is not so serious a matter after all .

		There is no harm in sugar - coating the pill , but there is harm and grave harm in making its contents of homoeopathic weakness .

		We doubt very much if the uni - versity credit obtained by students in these col - lateral ways represents anything like the equiv - alent of the credit to be got by attendance upon regular university courses .

		Whether the newest experiment of the Uni - versity will prove an unmixed blessing to edu - cation in
Chicago	LOCATION	, is something that remains to be seen .

		But the originality of the plan justifies us in giving some account of it , and , pending the declaration of results , for which we must wait patiently for some years , in per - mitting ourselves a few a priori reflections .

		A private benefaction , coupled with an appropri - ation by the
University	ORGANIZATION	itself , has made it pos - sible to establish in the heart of
Chicago	LOCATION	a college designed expressly for the education of such teachers in the public schools as may feel the need of carrying on their scholastic work without an interruption of their teaching .

		The faculty of this
College for Teachers	ORGANIZATION	is selected from the faculty of the
University	ORGANIZATION	proper , and includes a number of its ablest men .

		To meet the special needs of its clientele of public-school teachers , the hours of instruction are arranged for the whole of
Saturday	DATE	and the afternoons and evenings of the other week-days .

		The work of this
College	ORGANIZATION	is planned to fill six months of the year , and leads to the baccalaureate degree of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The unit of work is what is technically known as a '' major , '' and con - sists of four hours a week for three months .

		Thirty-six of these '' majors '' are taken as the equivalent of the four years of regular univer - sity work .

		Thus , two hours of work daily , continued for six years , will make the student a graduate of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and permit him to write after his name the magical letters that may mean so little or so much , according to the spirit in which his work has been performed .

		A slight reduction from the regular university fees is made to teachers who avail themselves of these new opportunities .

		The experiment thus outlined is one of great interest , and the underlying idea of the plan is wholly admirable .

		In the first place , it empha - sizes the fact that education of the academic type is the real preparation for successful teach - ing , and not the sort of training that is so sadly overdone , and so largely futile , in the so-called '' normal '' schools .

		In the second place , it brings instruction of the good type within reach of a host of young women comparatively few of whom have had any real education of the higher sort .

		There are something like five thousand women engaged as teachers in the public schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	, most of whom ended their own life as students when they left the high or normal school , and some of whom did not so much as complete a high-school course .

		Of this number , many , no doubt , have by their own efforts gained a discipline quite as good as that to be got from college work , and to them the cachet of a college degree would now be the most meaningless of honors .

		But there must remain many others to whom the new oppor - tunity will prove a real boon , and it can not be doubted that this latest educational departure of the
University	ORGANIZATION	was well worth the making .

		On the other hand , there are a few obtrusive considerations that can not be ignored in the discussion of this subject , and that must serve to temper in some degree the outburst of en - thusiasm and sanguine forecast with which the new College was dedicated to the public on the first of this month .

		There are the fees , for one thing , which must be a serious matter for the teachers whom the work will most benefit .

		For it is the younger teachers , whose stipends are the smallest , that are chiefly in need of this supplementary education ; the older ones , for the most part , have either gained the offered discipline in other ways , or have lost the plas - ticity of mind which must be brought to the work of academic education to make it worth undertaking .

		We are inclined to think that it would be proper for the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	to defray the tuition fees of such of the younger teachers as may wish to do this work of self - improvement , provided always that this might be done without prejudice to the interests of those who feel that they have got , or are get - ting , in other ways the same sort of educational development .

		This is a delicate question , for there are many paths to culture and mental discipline , and the one that leads through the college may be more direct , but it is no more certain of its goal , than the others .

		What we may call the arrogance of the degree is one of the worst forms of intellectual snobbery .

		The consideration which does the most , how - ever , to make us discount the promise of this
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 experiment , is based upon the fact that neither faculty nor students can be expected to do their best work under such conditions as are alone possible in the new
College for Teachers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Col - lege work of the best type requires freshness of mind on the part of instructor and instructed : and this is just what it is impossible to secure under the proposed conditions .

		The teachers will be men who are already doing full work in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and their energies can not fail to flag when it comes to supplementing that work by the peculiarly exigent task of con - ducting extended class-exercises in the after - noon and evening .

		To say this is merely to recognize the essential limitations of human strength .

		Still more must this consideration be taken into account with the students , who will come to their studies jaded with five hours of the most exacting brain labor , labor that makes such a demand upon the mental energies that it leaves a man and much more a woman completely fagged out , and incapable of the sort of alert attention and reaction to intellec - tual stimulus that is required for college work of anything but an inferior type .

		This rule is bound to obtain in the majority of cases , although there will doubtless be some excep - tions .

		Bearing these things in mind , then , it is useless to hope that the work done by teacher - students in the new College will be the real equivalent of work done under the proper academic conditions .

		No amount of earnest - ness and good-will can make the sluggish mind respond as it should to the efforts of the instructor , and even these efforts must be made sluggish by a similar cause .

		We believe , in short , that the type of education represented by the average university extension entertainment will tend to be approached in the new institu - tion ; and this , useful as it may be , is not the sort of thing aimed at , and not the sort of thing that the too sanguine forecast of the
University	ORGANIZATION	authorities appears to expect .

		We do not wish to be thought of as throwing any colder water than is necessary upon an enterprise planned with so admirable a purpose ; but the funda - mental facts of human nature have to be faced , and they seem to have been at least partly ignored in the optimistic deliverances with which the work of the new College has just been inaugurated .

		The experiment is , nevertheless , of the greatest interest ; and if its promise has been somewhat magnified , we still hope for it a considerable measure of success , and shall be happily disappointed if the results exceed our anticipation .

		CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS .

		This heading may be understood in two ways .

		It may mean the organization of studies , books , teaching , and discipline found in one of our cities , or the organization of political functions and agents that stand behind these educational powers and make them possible .

		The one view brings before us the superintendent and his teachers , the other the board of education and its administrative organs .

		The first view will find no recognition in this article , except that we shall not lose sight of the fact that the system in the educational sense is the end for which the system in the political or institutional sense ex - ists .

		We might at once say city boards of educa - tion , only that we wish to take a broader view of the subject than this language would suggest .

		It will be admitted that our subject is now prom - inently before the public .

		The constant criticism of existing systems that one hears , and the many changes that are made or proposed , point unmistak - ably to the strong unrest of the public mind .

		Crit - icisms and plans may differ , but they all lead up to the same fact .

		No deep insight is required to enable one to per - ceive that these critics and reformers do not always , if indeed generally , see their way clearly .

		They wish to improve the schools , and they see clearly enough that to accomplish this end the business organization must be reformed .

		So they resort , or propose to resort , to the legislature to get the system changed , assuming that the evil to be rem - edied will be removed by substituting a new board of education for the old one .

		But what is the use of taking trouble to get rid of the present board , if things are left in such shape that in a few years , if not indeed at once , the new board will turn out to be as bad as the old one ?

		It can not be too strongly asserted that the immediate trouble , where there is trouble , is with the men who constitute the board .

		If the board consists of good men , you are pretty sure in the long run of good administration , regard - less of the system .

		Not that one system is as good as another , or that the organization is unimportant .

		This rather is the idea : a system is practically good or bad according as it tends to bring the right kind of men into the public service and keep them there .

		There may be an exception now and then , here or there , but in general this is a safe rule to follow .

		Accordingly , the first question for the reformer to ask , as he scans a reform scheme , is not whether it is theoretically perfect , or logically consistent throughout , but whether , under the conditions ex - isting , the scheme will probably accomplish the end just stated .

		Will it bring to the service of the schools competent men ?

		Having emphasized this point sufficiently , we shall next consider the business involved in carrying on a system of schools in an American city .

		Ob - viously , there are three functions to be performed , one legislative , one executive , and one judicial .

		It would be hard to say whether the legislative 252 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, function or the executive function is the more im - portant of the two ; bat experience shows conclu - sively that more evil originates in the organization and relations of these two powers than in all other parts of the educational machinery put together .

		Let us look into the nature of the mechanism .

		The germ of the American city school board is found in the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	town or township board called the Selectmen , which is as old as the Com - monwealth .

		This board originally carried on the town schools just as it carried on the other parts of the town government , subject , of course , to the ac - tion of the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	and the Town Meeting .

		This board built the schoolhouses , examined and employed the teachers , and , together with the min - ister of the parish , supervised the schools .

		In the course of time there appeared in the board a com - mittee on schools , as there appeared committees on other subjects ; and this committee , still further on , became detached from the board and assumed a separate place in the government of the town .

		Sometimes the members were appointed by the Selectmen , and sometimes elected by the Town Meeting .

		Sometimes the committee was dependent upon the Selectmen for funds , and sometimes directly upon the freemen .

		But the main fact is this : This committee now carried on the schools , just as the selectmen has been in the habit of doing .

		It was at once a legislative , executive , and judicial body .

		Such , in substance , is the local school sys - tem to-day in the towns and townships where the town system of school organization prevails .

		The
Massachusetts	LOCATION	town school committee , in its essential features , became the city school board , or board of education , and is still generally found in cities without material modification .

		This committee was well enough in the town , and with little change it answered the purposes of the city while the city remained small ; but when the city became large some changes in the organization were found to be absolutely necessary .

		One change was the employ - ment of a professional superintendent of the city schools , to relieve the board of that responsible duty .

		This proved to be such a decided advantage that the small cities and the villages soon followed the example .

		Another change , and this one on the business side , was the employment of a salaried clerk or secretary , who was not a member of the board , to keep the records of the board and to per - form other similar business .

		Sometimes other minor changes have been made , but in general the essen - tial features of the old organization still remain in most of our cities .

		The board of education is a legislative , executive , and judicial body , all in one .

		First , subject to the
State	ORGANIZATION	law , the board legislates on a variety of subjects , as courses of study , rules for governing the schools , revenues and appropria - tions .

		Secondly , its field of administration is equally large .

		It appoints teachers , its own clerk and other employees , chooses books , provides supplies , builds and repairs schoolhouses , and the like .

		Thirdly , it exercises disciplinary powers over pupils , teachers , and employees ; but , generally speaking , this latter function cuts no great figure .

		The first vice of this scheme is the vesting of the legislative and administrative functions in the same hands .

		To be sure , in large cities the board has been compelled to divest itself in a considerable degree of the administrative work .

		This it has done , rather reluctantly , by creating executive depart - ments or offices , as those of finance , instruction , and supplies .

		Now let it be noted , first , that these de - partments or offices are the sole creation of the board ; and , secondly , that the incumbents are ap - pointed by the board and are wholly dependent upon it The board can abolish or change departments and remove officers at any time .

		The same may be said , for the most part , of the superintendent of instruction .

		Save in a few cities , he has no status in the school law ; his office exists at the pleasure of the board , and he is elected by the board .

		The only advantage that the superintendent enjoys is that he is commonly elected for the term of a year , some - times for a longer period , and so can not be turned out of office over-night This is bad enough , but it is not the worst Not only has the board imme - diate oversight of the executive department , but it continues to retain a large body of administrative powers in its own hands .

		These powers it exercises directly through its committees .

		How numerous these committees are , a glance into the common board manual will show .

		Generally , there are at least enough committees to give every member of the board a chairmanship , no matter whether there is anything for the committees to do or not This system is open to two or three serious ob - jections .

		One is , that the board of education , by its very nature and organization , is about as fit to do the administrative business of a large system of schools as the
State	ORGANIZATION	legislature or city council is to do the executive work of
the State	ORGANIZATION	or the city .

		A second objection is that the blending of the legisla - tive and executive duties opens the door to numer - ous abuses .

		Practiced observers of such matters know that this is the source of much of the corrup - tion found in school boards .

		Such observers know how eagerly the memberships , and especially the chairmanships , of certain committees are sought for by a certain class of board members ; for example , the committees on construction , repairs , books , and supplies .

		And finally , the system is not in accord with the American principle and usage , that large legislative and executive powers should not be thus mixed together .

		What shall be done to mend matters ?

		The first thing to be done is to effect a much greater degree of separation than at present between the legislative and administrative powers of the system .

		The princi - pal function of the board should be to legislate , while administration should be confided , as far as possible , to independent administrative officers .

		The board 's hands should be taken off from a multitude of things that they are now on .

		The executive officers should make reports to the board , furnishing it with infor -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 253 niation and making recommendations ; they should be amenable to the board in some process equiva - lent to impeachment , but they should derive their powers from another source and be responsible in another quarter .

		These remarks of course have no reference to the clerk or secretary of the board .

		At the very least , the law should throw around all the executive officers of the school system , on both sides , safeguards that will protect them against the en - croachments of the board .

		This is the first step that needs to be taken in the direction of thoroughgoing reform .

		The new board will have committees , of course , but they will be legislative not executive committees .

		Nothing that has been said touches the question of method .

		How shall the step just described be taken ?

		This question is an important one , and by no means free from difficulty .

		It is not the purpose of this article , however , to enter into details , but to insist that school reform in the cities , to be worth much or to last long , must be much more thorough than simply to produce a new scheme for electing board members .

		Other questions that arise are , How large should the board be ?

		How should the members be elected ?

		How long should they hold their offices ?

		etc. .

		We have not here space for their consideration .

		The question will be asked , How will the plan outlined work to bring better men to the service of the schools ?

		The question is a fair one , and the answer obvious .

		In the first place , a rational business-like plan is far more attractive to business-like men than an irrational and absurd one .

		In the second place , if the work of the board were practically confined to legislation the meetings of the board might be much less frequent than they are now , and the amount of business to be done reduced in volume .

		As a result , the demands upon the members ' time would be re - duced and the kind of work to be done be made more congenial .

		Nothing is more likely to disgust a real business man than an unbusiness-like pro- cedure ; and if anything is unbusiness-like it is the setting of a city board of education to perform ad - ministrative duties , small in themselves but import - ant in the aggregate , that proper executive depart - ments can perform much better .

		Still , it must be said that no system of itself will bring good men into the service ; no matter how good the system may be , bad men will get hold of it if they are allowed to do so ; but one system ex - cels another in tending to produce good men and exclude bad ones .

London	LOCATION	,
October 3 , 1898	DATE	.

		The autumn lists of the publishers are at last prac - tically completed .

		Of them all , that issued by Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	looks the most imposing ; but whether he will publish all he announces this season , is a pertinent question .

		First in this list comes Mr.
Savage Landor	PERSON	's much-discussed journey in
Tibet	LOCATION	, which is to be called now '' In the Forbidden Land . ''

		It is to be ready by the time this letter reaches you , and will be handsomely produced , with all the necessary accessories of illustra - tions , maps , and plans .

		Its price , however , is to be pretty high , and this must be put down to the large amount paid to the author for his manuscript .

		A novel title for an old-fashioned series is that given by Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	, or its editor , Mr.
H. J. Mackinder	PERSON	, to the twelve volumes which are to deal with the various im - portant divisions of the world .

		It is to be called '' A View of the World in
1900	DATE	, '' and will consist of the following works : ''
Britain	LOCATION	and the
North Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' by the editor ; ``
Scandinavia	LOCATION	and the Arctic Ocean , '' by Sir
C. R. Markham	PERSON	; '' The
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, '' by M. Elise'e Reclus ; ''
Central Europe	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Joseph Partsch	PERSON	; ''
Africa	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
J. Scott Keltie	PERSON	; `` The Near East , '' by
D. G. Hogarth	PERSON	; `` The Russian Empire , '' by Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	; `` The Far East , '' by Mr.
Archibald Little	PERSON	; ``
India	LOCATION	, '' by Col. Sir
Thomas Holdich	PERSON	; `` Aus - tralasia and
Antarctica	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
H. O. Forbes	PERSON	; and '' North and
South America	LOCATION	, '' by authorities from your side of the water .

		Of the '' Literatures of the World '' series you have already heard last season ; and the same may be said for the '' Great Educators . ''

		In fiction , we are promised `` The Two Magics , '' by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	; `` Tony Drum , '' by Mr.
Edwin Pugh	PERSON	; ``
Gloria Mundi	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	; '' Red Rock , '' by Mr.
T. N. Page	PERSON	; `` The Widower , '' by Mr.
W. E. Norris	PERSON	; and new stories by Mr.
Stephen Crane	PERSON	, Mrs.
F. A. Steel	PERSON	, and Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	.

		An important announcement is the translations of all
Gabriele d'Annunzio	PERSON	's novels .

		The series of articles which the editor of '' The
Satur	PERSON	- day Review '' has , during the past few months , been writing for his journal , are to be included in a volume , and published with the title '' The Man
William Shake	PERSON	- speare . ''

		You may already have had almost enough of the newspaper talk of Captain Dreyfus and his `` affaire '' and the supposed part
M. le Commandant Esterhazy	ORGANIZATION	has played in it .

		But all that you have heard is nothing to what you will read in
Esterhazy	ORGANIZATION	's own account which Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	will publish here on the first of Nov - ember .

		I need hardly tell you that what has already appeared in print is largely made up of conjecture ; and I speak from personal acquaintance with the syllabus of contents of the coming story , when I tell you that it will be well worth reading .

		An American publisher has already secured the copyright for the States , and the work will be published simultaneously here and on your side .

		A considerable number of the '' announced '' books have already appeared .

		Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's ponderous tomes on
Bismarck	LOCATION	, which were ushered in with a mighty pother of advertisements and newspaper reviews , are settling themselves quietly on the shelves of our subscription libraries .

		Those who care for
Bismarck	PERSON	and his doings will now look for his personal '' Reflections and Recol - lections '' which the Cotta publishing house of
Stuttgart	LOCATION	254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, is preparing .

		The manuscript of this work , I under - stand , was corrected by
Bismarck	PERSON	himself ; but it is to be issued under the care of Dr.
Uorst Khol	PERSON	, and the first part will be ready in
November	DATE	.

		In
Germany	LOCATION	, Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's work has been condemned , not so much for any indiscreet revelations he made as for the actual histor - ical value of what he said .

		Mr.
Merriman	PERSON	's ''
Roden	PERSON	's Corner '' is another of the expected which has arrived .

		It is proving but a succe d'estime , and critics are agreed in considering it a falling-off from that writer 's previous work .

		On the other hand , Mr.
Neil Munro	PERSON	's ''
John	PERSON	Splendid '' is likely to be the novel of the year .

		Another story which is attracting very much attention is '' Phases of an Inferior Planet , '' by
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	; it is an exceed - ingly striking book .

		If you want to enjoy an excellent piece of biographical study , you should read Mr.
Augustine Bin-ell	PERSON	's sketch of Sir
Frank Lockwood	PERSON	.

		It is full of good things and most racily told .

		Before I forget it , let me mention that Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	will be again to the fore , on
October 17	DATE	, with '' The Red Axe '' another of his regulation yarns .

		So will be Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	with '' The Castle Inn , '' a story which has been running its serial course in '' The Cornhill Magazine . ''

		Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's book , however , will not be published until the first of
November	DATE	.

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's new volume of short stories will already be out by the time this letter reaches you ; I understand that it will also form the thirteenth volume of the edition de luxe of his collected works .

		Shelleyites have for many years searched in vain for a volume of M Original Poetry , by
Victor	PERSON	and Cazire . ''

		Since
1860	DATE	, when Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	first informed the world that such a volume was once printed , collect - ors have searched high and low for it .

		Now , at last , a copy has turned up , and a facsimile reprint of it will be issued by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	.

		It was in last
October	DATE	that Mr.
Lane	PERSON	received a letter from Mr.
V.	PERSON	.


G. Hussey	PERSON	, of
Dorchester	LOCATION	, asking him if he would be inclined to undertake '' the republication of some early original poems by
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, of which my mother , Mrs.
J. F. Hussey	PERSON	, is in possession ... The work in question is entitled ` Original Poetry , by
Victor	PERSON	and Cazire , ' the production of
P. B. Shelley	PERSON	and an anonymous collab - orator .

		The book was published at
Horsham	ORGANIZATION	in
1810	DATE	, and consists of about sixty octavo pages . ''

		In Dr.
Gar	PERSON	- nett 's opinion the collaborator was
Elizabeth	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	's sister .

		It is interesting to learn that Mrs.
Hussey	PERSON	's father was the Rev.
Charles Henry Grove	PERSON	, brother to
Harriet Grove	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	's first sweetheart .

		Of the work itself , not much is expected ; but everybody interested in English poetry will be curious to know its contents .

		It seems that
Shelley	PERSON	, in order to extricate himself from the
Horsham	ORGANIZATION	printer 's debt , went to
Stockdale	PERSON	, a dealer in '' remainders , '' and arranged with him to take over the remaining copies ,
1480	DATE	in number , in liquidation of the s 11 in owing .

		This was done , but
Stockdale	PERSON	afterwards found a poem in the collection which he knew to be by '' Monk ''
Lewis	PERSON	, and wrote to
Shelley	LOCATION	about it .

		Shelley , according to
Stockdale	PERSON	's own account of the matter , ex - pressed the '' warmest resentment at the imposition practiced upon him by his coadjutor , and entreated me to destroy all the copies , of which about one hundred had been put in circulation . ''

		This was in
1810	DATE	, and now the only copy known is this of Mrs.
Hussey	PERSON	's .

		I hear that Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	is about to change bis publishers once again his collected works are to be issued in two volumes by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and that for the present he is to devote himself to prose , to the writing of literary criticisms and critical essays .

		The new edition of ''
Pepys	PERSON	* Diary , '' upon which Mr.
H. B. Wheatley	PERSON	has been engaged for so long a time , is to be finally completed in
January	DATE	next by the addition of a ninth volume of Index , and a tenth entitled ''
Pepys	PERSON	- iana . ''

		This last volume is to contain notes and illus - trations of
Pepys	PERSON	' life and Diary , and various appendices explanatory of the man and his times .

		The new edition of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	, '' with illustrations , to the number of over one hundred , by Mr.
E. J. Sullivan	PERSON	, will , I am sure , prove a very agree - able surprise .

		The pictures are the cleverest things I have seen for many a day .

		The book will not be ready before the end of the month .

AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Professor
B. A. Hinsdale	PERSON	, in his very kind review of my work , '' The
First Republic	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, '' in THE DIAL ,
Sept. 16 , 1898	DATE	, says : '' Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's theory is that
Smith	PERSON	and the King : were vir - tually in collusion ; that his accounts of things in
Virginia	LOCATION	forwarded the royal purpose ; while the destruction of one part of the Company 's record and the long concealment of another part left
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's accounts mainly unchallenged .

		On this point we are bound to think the author has been some - what carried away by his enthusiasm for the Company and his detestation of Smith . ''


James I.	PERSON	allowed the royal portraits to be engraved on the title-page of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's history , and permitted the author to present him with a copy of his history through the hands of the Duchess of
Richmond	LOCATION	and
Lenox	LOCATION	, who was then aspiring to the hand of the King -LRB- pp. 635 , 636 -RRB- .

		I do not believe that such royal endorsements as these acts imply would have been made if the account as written had not forwarded the royal purpose ; but , further than this , I have no theory of collusion between the
King and Smith	ORGANIZATION	, and I am sorry to have produced such an impression .

		The matter is of too great historic importance to be misunderstood , and I wish to state the facts of the case more clearly .

		I .

		The press was under the control of the Crown .

		If any history had contained an account of anything in
Virginia	LOCATION	which did not forward the
King	ORGANIZATION	's purpose , the item or items would have been censored and erased before the book could have been licensed .

		Smith 's his - tory as licensed and published contains no such matter ; it conforms in all important particulars to the royal pur - pose as outlined in the verdict of the royal commission - ers -LRB- pp. 541 , 542 -RRB- .

		II .

		The Company records were taken possession of by order of the Crown , and were so completely concealed forever thereafter that , so far as I can learn , not a single one of them has ever been found .

		Save for the forethought of
Arthur Wodenoth	PERSON	,
John Ferrar	PERSON	,
Nicholas Ferrer	PERSON	, Sir
John Danvers	PERSON	, and a few other patriots -LRB- who feared that the records would be destroyed -RRB- , and save for the providential preservation of sundry extras and copies of documents in
Spain	LOCATION	,

		That
James I.	PERSON	endeavored to suppress the true his - tory of the great popular movement which gave birth to this nation is as well established as such a fact could well be .

		That the Crown concealed the Company rec - ords , and had accounts published which conveyed false ideas , is certain ; and it is of the greatest historic import - ance that this fact should be well understood .

		THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ORIENT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The reviewer of Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	's ''
China	LOCATION	in Trans - formation , '' in your issue of
Sept. 16	DATE	, placidly assumes that to '' transform Cathay into a vast hive of multifari - ous industry '' through the process of making it '' covet '' a thousand things of which it now knows nothing , and which the few attain through the toil and enslavement of the many , is to bestow upon it an unmixed blessing .

		Permit me to say that we Orientals think otherwise .

		We dread the contagion of your unrest .

		We love that '' Sleep of Centuries '' from which you desire to awaken us , for its dreams are sweet and its pillow is content - ment .

		We abhor that idol of progress which you would roll through our ancient civilizations like a Juggernaut ; for progress means change , and the parent of change is discontent , and discontent is the negation of happiness .

		Your view of the world as a mere workshop , and of the elements of the universe as primarily the raw material of the '' wealth '' of traffic , we do not understand .

		We reverence what you despise the old ; and our ears are open to the oracles of sages who spoke in the dawn of days , and closed to the passing babble of venders of novelties .

		Your mania of '' improvement '' is a puzzle to us .

		How well and wisely , to our view , spoke that deputation of senators to the great
Napoleon	PERSON	, after the fever of revolution had burned itself out in the veins of exhausted
France	LOCATION	: `` Sire , the worst malady that can torment the human race is the desire of perfection . ''

		We are the
East	LOCATION	, you are the
West	LOCATION	.

		Our view is not your view , for our eyes are not your eyes .

		The life of the Orient , which to you seems a stagnant pool choked with weeds and foul with the rotting growth of centuries , seems to us a broad and tranquil river , starred with the lotos , and flowing into the slumbrous sea of eternity .

		Nay , think of him but as the interpreter Of the sacred hieroglyphics of the soul , Love 's Druid , with his runic staves writ o'er With mystic legends that all hearts control .

		His songs are dateless , after as before : They register the passions that rejoice Or plague men ever ; they are music 's score , Waiting the player 's hand , the singer 's voice .

		BISMARCK AND HIS BOSWEI/L .

		*
Bismarck	PERSON	probably had , as he often professed to have , a sovereign contempt for newspapers .

		In fact , there would seem to have been few things or men in the world he moved in for which or for whom he had not more or less contempt .

		But he was always cynically indifferent as to the general character of the tools he used , provided only they were useful ; and it is now clear that in point of fact no statesman of his time '' worked the press '' more assiduously or less scrupulously than did this professed despiser of journalism .

		When the full history of his great political achievement comes to be written it will be seen that a third ingredient , printers ' ink , will have to be added to his celebrated formula of '' Blood and Iron '' in order to make it a true summary of the means employed in the carrying through of the Bismarckian policy in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It is hardly too much to say , as a recent competent witness f has shown , that the great Chancellor was himself in effect a jour - nalist a virtual member of the fraternity he used to style in his pleasant way , '' quill-cattle . ''

		He was a busy writer of political leaders long before he went prominently into administrative office .

		His journalistic career was in full swing in
1848	DATE	, and it lasted with scarcely a break to the day of his death a half-century later .

		Dur - ing the twenty odd years of his chancellorship he virtually '' ran '' the influential press of Ger - many .

		His monopoly of official news , his com - mand of the '' reptile fund , '' and his organized corps of press writers and '' workers , '' enabled him to do this .

		His dismissal from office in
1890	DATE	by no means checked his journalistic ac - tivity , though it materially narrowed its area .

		Of the five hundred '' organs '' which he con - trolled while in power , one only , the Ham - burger NachricJiten , stood by him after his fall ; and a great portion of his not very dig - nified retirement at Friedrichsruhe was spent in concocting well-spiced matter for this faithful sheet .

February , 1870	DATE	, and he soon displayed such shining aptitude for its duties that his advance - ment in favor was rapid .

		He followed the Chancellor to the war in
August	DATE	, and was with him at
Metz	ORGANIZATION	, Sedan , and
Versailles	LOCATION	.

		After peace was concluded he returned with him to
Berlin	LOCATION	, and resumed his round of journalistic duties , acting as the Chancellor 's special liter - ary henchman and man-of-all-work up to the date of his patron 's dismissal from office in
1890	DATE	.

		After that date his intercourse with
Bismarck	PERSON	was more desultory ; but he was up to the last a frequent and favored visitor at
Friedrichsruhe	LOCATION	, and his really Boswellian ac - count of these visits and of his confidential chats with the deposed statesman , whose natural venom towards the objects of his dislike or jealousy increased with ripening years , forms not the least racy and interesting portion of his book .

		Of Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's unsparing , let us add fatal , veracity there can be no question .

		That is his crowning , and , under the circumstances , singu - lar merit . ''

		Once I am dead , ''
Bismarck	PERSON	said to him in
1879	DATE	, '' you can tell everything you like , absolutely everything you know '' ; and the Doctor took him at his word in a way that must have made even the Iron Chancellor wince , could he have seen the result .

		As we have already shown , Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's official rela - tions with
Bismarck	PERSON	were such as to enable him to unveil completely the least creditable phase of his patron 's statecraft his dealings with the press .

		His was usually the hand employed to let fly the poisoned shaft shot in the dark - ness ; he was the trusted go-between who se - cured for an occasion the venal columns of the influential but unofficial journal ; or who , when the work in hand was too dirty or dangerous for a decent paper to touch , hired the services of '' some obscure , disreputable sheet '' -LRB- `` irgend ein entfemtes Schandblatt '' -RRB- . ''

		Morality , '' Bis - marck used to say , `` has absolutely nothing to do with the business of politics '' ; and that this axiom was with him no mere hardy flour - ish of cynical paradox , the tale of his relations with journalism , as told by his literary facto - tum , amply shows .

		We can not enter into the tortuous details of this story here .

		The nar - rator tells it apparently with the most naive unconsciousness that he is degrading for all time the memory of the man he worshipped .

		In this regard Dr.
Busch	PERSON	is unique among biographers .

		His blindness to the ludicrous dis - crepancy between his idolatrous attitude toward his hero , and the squalid truths he tells of him , is not the least remarkable thing about his book .

		He is like the lover who mingled rap - turous apostrophes to his mistress with a start - ling catalogue of her personal defects .

		Perhaps Dr.
Busch	PERSON	means to prove the depth and sin - cerity of his devotion by showing us the obsta - cles it could overcome ; but at all events , his readers can not fail to wonder at him as he goes on placidly enumerating instance after instance of his hero 's duplicity and brutality , and then unctuously tells how he used to address him to his face as ''
Mein Heiland	PERSON	'' -LRB- my Savior -RRB- and My Messiah . ''

		Once he is not ashamed to compare the unscrupulous old minister , looking back on his political achievements , to '' God the Father on the seventh day regarding the world he had made '' !

		Naturally , the course of Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's devo - tion to
Bismarck	PERSON	did not always run smoothly .

		Sometimes he was roughly snubbed by the big man for instance , at the battle of Sedan , when , a movement of the troops being under discussion , he rashly ventured a mild strate - gical suggestion of his own .

		But in general he was decently and even civilly treated ; and to his credit be it said that he clung to the heels of his imperious master with dog-like fidelity , through sunshine and shade , till the end .

		Occasional scraps of gruff praise that were tossed to him he received with joy and records with pride .

		`` Bilschlein '' -LRB- little
Busch	PERSON	-RRB- was the friendly diminutive the Chancellor latterly came to call him by .

		When the big man was angry , `` Buschlein 's '' attitude was humble and conciliatory as we judge , like that of
Sterne	PERSON	's donkey , whose look seemed to say , '' Do n't beat me , but if you will you may . ''

		That this meek - ness of bearing toward his Chief was not due to a lack of spirit , or of personal courage in general , is plain .

		Dr.
Busch	PERSON	shows himself in his book the fearless and outspoken partisan of
Bismarck	LOCATION	; and if we are not much mistaken there is more than one passage in the closing
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 257 chapters , wherein he grows warm over the griev - ances of the exile of Friedrichsruhe , that may yet cost him dear say a twelvemonth in jail for Majestatsbeleidigung .

		Once , in a transport of nettled partisanship , he does not scruple to sneer pointedly and on his own account at the '' narrow and mediocre mind '' of the
Conse	ORGANIZATION	- crated One himself !

		We tremble for Dr.
Busch	PERSON	.

		As was to be expected , the book abounds in quotable passages is made up of them , one may almost say .

		To convey here by examples anything like a fair notion of its richness in this regard is out of the question .

		A good story illustrative of the Chancellor 's rather malicious humor , and of his habit of poking fun at qual - ities he was pleased to term '' professorial , '' is that told by him of Humboldt .


Bismarck	PERSON	said : '' Under the late King I was the sole victim when Humboldt chose to entertain the company in his own style .

		He usually read , often for hours at a time , the biography of some French savant or architect in whom nobody in the world but himself took the slightest inter - est. .

		He stood by the lamp holding the paper close to the light , and occasionally paused to make some learned observation .

		Although nobody listened to him , he had the ear of the house .

		The Queen was all the time at work on a piece of tapestry , and certainly did not under - stand a word of what he said .

		The King looked through his portfolio of engravings , turning them over as noisily as possible , evidently with the intention of not hearing him .

		The young people in the background enjoyed themselves without the least restraint , so that their cackling and giggling actually drowned his reading , which , however , rippled on without break or stop , like a brook .


Gerlach	PERSON	, who was usually present , sat on his small round chair , which could barely accommodate his voluminous person , and slept so soundly that he snored .

		The King was once obliged to wake him , and said , ' Pray ,
Gerlach	PERSON	, do n't snore so loud ! '

		I was Humboldt 's only listener , that is to say , I sat still and pretended to listen , at the same time following my own thoughts , until at length cold cake and white wine were served .

		It put the old gentleman in very bad humor not to have all the talk to himself .

		I remember once there was somebody there who managed to monopolize the conversation quite naturally , it is true , as he was a clever raconteur and spoke about things that interested everybody .

		Hum - boldt was beside himself .

		In a peevish , surly temper , he piled his plate so high -LSB- pointing with his hand -RSB- with pate de foie gras , fat eels , lobsters ' tails , and other indi - gestible stuff a real mountain it was astounding that an old man could put it all away .

		At last his pa - tience was exhausted , and he could not stand it any longer .

		So he tried to interrupt the speaker . '

		On the peak of
Popocatapetl	LOCATION	, ' he began , but the other went on with his story . '

		On the peak of
Popocatapetl	LOCATION	, seven thousand fathoms above , ' but he again failed to make any impression and the narrative of the other maintained its easy flow .

		On the peak of
Popocatapetl	LOCATION	, seven thou - sand fathoms above the level of the sea , ' he exclaimed in a loud and excited tone , but with as little success as before .

		The talker talked on , and the company had no ears for anybody else .

		That was something unheard of , outrageous !

		Humboldt threw himself back in morose meditation over the ingratitude of mankind , and shortly afterwards left . ''

		Dr.
Busch	PERSON	records many uncomplimentary things said by
Bismarck	PERSON	of foreigners , espe - cially the French and the English .

		To Amer - icans he was partial thanks , perhaps , to his intimacy with
Motley	ORGANIZATION	.

		Bancroft , too , he par - ticularly esteemed , pronouncing him a model diplomat .


Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		he flatly styled '' a muddle-headed fellow , '' and he had a poor opinion of
Gladstone	PERSON	`` Professor
Gladstone	PERSON	, '' he ironically styled him .


France	LOCATION	, he observed in
1870	DATE	, '' is a nation of ciphers a mere herd . '' ''

		The French are wealthy and elegant , but they have no individuality , no consciousness as individuals , but only as a mass .

		They are like thirty million obedient Kaffirs , each one of whom is in himself featureless and worthless , not fit to be compared with Russians and Italians , to say nothing of ourselves .

		You can give a Frenchman twenty-five lashes , and if you only make a fair speech to him about the freedom and dignity of man of which those lashes are the expression , and at the same time strike a fitting attitude , he will persuade himself that he is not being thrashed .

		... If you peel the white hide off a Gaul you will find a Turco under it . ''

		Comparing the Latin with the Germanic races , in
1871	DATE	,
Bismarck	PERSON	was drawn into some interesting general observations . ''

		The Germanic race is , so to speak , the male prin - ciple throughout
Europe	LOCATION	the fructifying principle .

		The Celtic and Slav peoples represent the female sex .

		That principle extends as far as the
North Sea	LOCATION	and then across to
England	LOCATION	. '

		I ventured to add -LSB- says Dr.
Busch	PERSON	-RSB- , and also as far as
America	LOCATION	and the
Western States of the Union	LOCATION	, where some of our people form the best part of the population and influence the manners of the rest .

		Yes , ' he replied , ` those are their children , the fruit they bear .

		That was to be seen in
France	LOCATION	while the
Franks	PERSON	still had the upper hand .

		The Revolution of
1789	DATE	was the overthrow of the Germanic element by the Celtic .

		And what have we seen since then ?

		And this held good in
Spain	LOCATION	so long as the Gothic blood pre - dominated .

		And also in
Italy	LOCATION	, when in the north the Germans also played a leading part .

		When that ele - ment exhausted itself , there was nothing decent left . ''

		Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's pages are well salted with pithy and characteristic Bismarckiana . ''

		I am of opinion , '' he once said , `` that to prevent mis - chief the Jews will have to be rendered innoc - uous by cross-breeding . ''

		Discussing projects for
State	ORGANIZATION	aid to the poor , he asked : '' Why should those who have in battle become inca - pable of earning a livelihood be entitled to a pension , and not also the rank and file of the army of labor ? '' ''

		The kindlier affections , '' he averred , '' have as little place in the calcu - lations of politics as in those of trade . ''

		But we must take leave of Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's ex - tremely interesting memoir .

		Its basis , it should be added , is a diary ranging over the twenty 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, odd years of the author 's intercourse with
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck , the conversational portions of which were in most cases jotted down within an hour after the words recorded were spoken .

		That
Bismarck	PERSON	was aware of his
Boswell	PERSON	, and ap - proved of his proceedings , is clear . ''

		Biisch - l > ln , '' he remarked in
1891	DATE	, '' will one day long after my death write the secret history of our time from the best sources of information . ''

		Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's '' secret history , '' as we now have it , does not tend to enhance our admiration , still less our liking , for the puissant Chancellor .

		But its author has rendered a great service to the cause of impartial truth .

		His book is , in its class , of the very first importance the one book of the season that the student of our cen - tury 's political history should read , whatever else be neglected .

		The volumes are handsomely made and they contain some striking and well executed portraits ; but we must complain of the very insufficient index .

		.

		G. J. FIRST OF
THK	ORGANIZATION	WAR HISTORIES .

		* The first of the war histories , the leaves of which are soon to be as those of Vallambrosa for multitude , is upon us in the form of advance sheets of '' The Fall of
Santiago	LOCATION	. ''

		This record flows from the facile pen of Mr.
Thomas J. Vivian	PERSON	, whom his title-page announces as the author of '' With Dewey at
Manilla	LOCATION	. ''

		It pays the penalty of its timeliness by cumulative evi - dences of haste in letter-press , illustrations , and proof-reading .

		It also appears to be rather the raw material of history than history itself .

		Possibly the first thought which the book induces is one of satiety .

		We are desperately tired of the war and its malarial atmosphere ; and , after all the praise poured upon us by critics of more or less competence for our fight - ing , and the dispraise we seem to be heaping upon ourselves for nearly everything else , it requires something strong , either by way of flattery or objurgation , to rouse our jaded intel - lects .

		Such being the fact , the faults of this book are doubtless more prominent than they will appear to be in the ensuing years .

		A style which is as of that of the newspapers , though without the advantage these possess of careful copy-reading before publication , is the most apparent of these .

		Next come the pictures , some of them the ordinary process cuts of mod - ern journals , others half-tone reproductions of
THK	ORGANIZATION	FALL or
SANTIAGO	LOCATION	.

Thomas J. Viruui	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
R. F. Fenno & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the admirable photographs done for Mr.
W. R. Hearst	PERSON	, but neither of them quite suited for serious history .

		So much for manner .

		A digression may be pardoned in respect of the original sources of information which have been at the historian 's disposal here .

		Aside from the official reports , many of them avail - able through the daily press , the war corre - spondents themselves seem to speak with the highest authority , due to their having been eye - witnesses of nearly all the facts to be chronicled .

		And for this we are largely indebted to the so - called '' yellow journals . ''

		Whatever else these deleterious adjuncts of our civilization may be , they are not parsimonious in their expenditures for news .

		When their arrangements for giving the people of the
United States	LOCATION	the last infor - mation from the seat of hostilities had been completed , it was found that they had sent to the front men of approved skill as writers and pictorial artists in such profusion that all the papers , whether daily or weekly and whatever their color , must engage themselves in similar extravagance or be hopelessly behind in the purveying of news .

		This has made the war one of correspondents in good part ; and there is no doubt that there were so many of them that they would have become an insufferable nui - sance had they not developed the most versatile talents as warriors , scouts , nurses , and every - thing else that brave men can be .

		What news - paper men have long known has now been demonstrated to the world at large : that the papers are able to command a service which for absolute devotion to the duty before them ranks next to that called forth by patriotism .

		But , owing to the censorship , this service was uneven .

		Up to the fall of
Santiago	LOCATION	, which covers the entire time allotted to the book in hand , the telegraphed reports were not particularly full or satisfactory in any respect , while all their deficiencies were more than made up , except in point of mere timeliness , by long and well - written letters transmitted through the mails for the purpose of avoiding the censorship .

		After the fall of
Santiago	LOCATION	, especially during the operations in
Puerto Rico	LOCATION	-LRB- the official spelling , and a deplorable one -RRB- , the censor was dismissed , and in consequence the telegraphic reports were much more detailed and were not supplemented by the still better letters of the weeks before .

		Another source , which could have been de - pended upon in former wars to a much greater extent , is found in private letters written by the soldiers and sailors .

		These overflowed the papers , and have proved to be curiously un -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 trustworthy in many instances .

		One of these may be cited from the book before us , where the credit of being first to descry the approach of
Cervera	PERSON	's squadron when opening the battle of
July	DATE	the third off
Santiago	LOCATION	is awarded to a young man whose chief claim to the honor lies in the fact that he wrote home and told them there that he did it : at least , a letter addressed to his captain ,
Evans	PERSON	, of the
Iowa	LOCATION	, elicited the reply that neither he nor anyone else on board the battleship had been awarded the prize men - tioned for his alleged vigilance , that no such prize had been offered , and that the article of discovery was in any event rather joint than several .

		A number of similar incidents might be given here if they were of any applicability .

		It will be observed that all these sources are exclusively American , and that history , like so many other things , has two sides to it .

		In the book now written by Mr.
Vivian	PERSON	this lack is quite apparent .

		Some of the messages of the Spanish generals appear in the wonderful trans - lations that lead a reader to infer that the
United States	LOCATION	had no Spanish scholars in all their broad domain .

		The log-book of the '' Colon '' has been drawn upon , with excellent results .

		But , generally speaking , the Spanish are not given the credit they deserve for their courage in the fighting about
Santiago	LOCATION	, though it is to be feared it was the miserable slanders respecting American cruelty rather than char - acter which sustained them .

		Other defects follow from lack of information from the ene - my 's camp .

		There is a commendable frankness in Mr.
Vivian	PERSON	's account of the taking of
Santiago	LOCATION	which we trust will prevent the annals of the
Hispano	LOCATION	- American war being disfigured with the gross inaccuracies that characterize the histories of the land operations during the War of
1812	DATE	.

		The larger it is writ that politics is not suited to field operations , and that , however necessary trained soldiers may be found in times of peace , they are still more essential in periods of war , the surer the nation will be enabled to avoid the drubbing otherwise in store for it at the hands of some enemy in future .

		However mortifying to our sense of pride , the truth will make us free : an observation which makes an appeal to statesmen , and none whatever to mere politicians .

		Among minor defects in Mr.
Vivian	PERSON	's work , the use of types which lack the Spanish diacrit - ical marks is most annoying .

		The Spanish spelling is more nearly orthoepic than any other in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Any deviations from the two sim - ple rules of accent are indicated . ''

		N '' with and '' n '' without the circumflex are different letters .

		Here , not even the cedilla is used for the '' c '' soft before '' a , '' o , '' and '' u. '' Surely it is not asking too much of the linotype to have these additional types provided .

		What is chiefly commendable in the book is a certain pictur - esqueness and vehemence that carry the narra - tive over many discouragements ; while the facts are in the main closely adhered to , as we understand them .

		* Besides the interest which every scholar must feel in Sir
Henry Rawlinson	PERSON	as the
Champol	PERSON	- lion of cuneiform decipherment , the general reader can not fail to find entertainment as well as instruction in
Canon Rawlinson	ORGANIZATION	's account of his brother 's long life covering the years from
1810	DATE	to
1895	DATE	which was devoted as much to travel , adventure , and military and diplomatic service , as to philological and geo - graphical research .

		He seems to have been a second , or rather an earlier , Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	, in his love of adventure spiced with danger , and in the facil - ity with which he acquired the languages of the
East	LOCATION	.

		The sacred city of
Kutn	PERSON	and the renowned shrine of
Fatima	LOCATION	, said never to have been entered by a European , possessed attrac - tions for him , when he was serving as a young lieutenant in
Persia	LOCATION	, too great to be resisted .

		Instant death menaced the audacious infidel who should be discovered intruding upon the holy precincts , and it was only by assuming the disguise of a Persian Pilgrim that the young Englishman gained admission to the temple . ''

		The guardian gave him the customary form of words , and he repeated them ; but shortly afterwards his eye was attracted by some magnificent suits of steel armour which hung upon the walls , and be found with a thrill of alarm , that while curiously contemplating them and speculating upon their age and origin , he had almost turned his back upon the sacred spot where the saint lay the cynosure of all the eyes of ` true believers . '

		Fortunately for him , his lapse was not remarked it had been little more than momentary otherwise , in all probability , a promising career would then and there have been cut short , and a light lost to philological , geographical , and diplomatic science with which they could ill have afforded to dispense .

		260 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, a novel road race ridden by him in
India	LOCATION	in
1832	DATE	shows still farther the spirit and nerve of the young man .

		He rode , with an occasional change of mounts , from
Poonah	LOCATION	to
Panwell	ORGANIZATION	, seventy-two miles , for a stake of one hundred pounds .

		The wager required him , in order to w \ n , to cover the distance in four hours one hundred rupees to be forfeited by him for every minute over that time , and the same amount to be paid to him for every minute saved .

		After several mishaps and hairbreadth escapes , the rider reached his goal , fifty-three minutes ahead of time !

		In this connection two other instances of narrow escape from death may be noted .

		On one occasion he was descending the Tigris on a raft , when he and his attendants were attacked by a band of Arabs , who opened fire on them from the bank .

		Rawlinson chanced to be writ - ing at the time , and was holding the ink-bottle in his left hand , when a bullet struck it from between his fingers .

		One of his escort was killed , and he only prevented farther loss by landing with a few men and driving off the assailants .

		Some years later , during his resi - dence at Candahar as political agent , at the time of the great Affghan War , he barely es - caped assassination by a lucky accident .

		For three successive days he was detained in the courthouse dispensing justice to all complain - ants , much beyond his usual hour of leaving , and was thus prevented from taking his cus - tomary evening ride .

		A fanatic one of a band of forty who had sworn on the
Koran	LOCATION	to accomplish the assassination of the Great Fer - inghee , as
Rawlinson	PERSON	was called lay in wait for him for three evenings where he was wont to mount his horse , having pledged himself neither to eat nor drink until he had done the deed .

		On the
third evening	TIME	, as the
Great Feringhee	ORGANIZATION	still failed to appear and the would-be murderer was nearly crazed with thirst , he was forced to content himself with stabbing the secretary of his intended victim , whereupon he was imme - diately arrested and taken before the latter to receive sentence of death .

		Such indications of a hardy and daring tem - perament gain an added significance when we turn to consider
Rawlinson	PERSON	's achievements as a geographical explorer and a discoverer of cuneiform inscriptions .

		The trilingual inscrip - tion on the great rock of Behistun the
Rosetta Stone	ORGANIZATION	of cuneiform decipherment would never have yielded up its secret to a man of less physical activity and persistency of pur - pose .

		Nor could the geography of certain dis - tricts of interior
Asia	LOCATION	, over which he travelled , have been mastered by one of a less adventur - ous and daring nature .

		The Journals of the
Royal Asiatic Society	ORGANIZATION	and of the Royal Geo - graphical Society , of fifty and sixty years ago , bear record of the young explorer 's achieve - ments .

		The zenith of
Rawlinson	ORGANIZATION	's career as a dip - lomat was reached in
1859	DATE	, when he was ap - pointed Ambassador to the Persian court .

		His long residence in
Persia	LOCATION	, his personal friend - ship with the
Shah	PERSON	, and his familiarity with the language and customs of the country , made his nomination a happy one , although events beyond his control caused him to resign his office only six months after entering upon it .

		The remainder of his life was passed in En - gland , as a member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, a student of and writer on cuneiform inscriptions and oriental antiquities , a trustee of the British Museum , a life member of the
India Council	ORGANIZATION	, member and president of the
Royal Geograph	ORGANIZATION	- ical Society , and contributor of scientific and political articles to various publications .

		It is interesting to learn that his favorite poem , and one which he often repeated in later life , was
Longfellow	PERSON	's '' The Day is Done '' ; and also that as early as
1857	DATE	he was given the degree of LL.D .

		by
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The life of this distinguished Orientalist , as told by his younger brother and ardent admirer , certainly loses nothing in the telling .

		It is sympathetic , and inspires the reader with some - thing of its author 's love of his theme .

		But why must the
Canon	ORGANIZATION	drag his favorite Hero - dotus into the body of his text , untranslated at that however brief the quotation ?

		And is it not a bit of unnecessary pedantry to use the verb desiderate instead of desire or want ?

		The chapter on personal characteristics , by the present Sir
Henry Rawlinson	PERSON	, adds much to the warm human interest of the book , but con - tains one note jarring to American ears .

		In referring to his father 's scrupulous care , as a public servant of her Majesty , to avoid en - gaging in any commercial enterprise or even lending his name to the promotion of such enter - prise , the writer says : '' We have been drifting lately nearer , perhaps too near , to the system of financial morality prevalent on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		However , we may be allowed to take our revenge in a harmless smile at
Sir Henry	ORGANIZATION	's mixing of metaphors when he adds : Let us hope that our drifting ... may ere long be turned into the straight and upright channel . ''

		THE DIAL , 261 RECENT PEDAGOGICAL .

		LITERATURE .

		* For a third of a century Dr.
W. T. Harris	PERSON	has been contributing generously to the growing educa - tional literature of the country addresses , articles , papers , lectures , prefaces , introductions , reports , '' discussions , '' etc. , contributions rich in the fruits of reading , thought , and experience .

		Still , until now there has been no one work that could be said to present in one view the essential features of his system of educational thought .

		To arrive at such a view , the student must consult many scattered publications and make a synthesis of his own .

		This situation was the more remarkable because Dr.
Harris	PERSON	has stood for years , by common consent , as the foremost pedagogical thinker and the highest educational authority of the country .

		The '' Psy - chologic Foundations of Education '' at once puts an end to this state of things , and meets the desire , often expressed and still oftener felt by the fore - most teachers , educators , and thinkers of the coun - try , that Dr.

		to apply to it the stock expression , that its appear - ance is the '' event of the year . ''

		The space at our disposal forbids the more lengthy notice that the book deserves and that we should be glad to give .

		There are plenty of points that attract the reviewer 's attention .

		The scheme adopted , going over the principal matters consid - ered twice once unsystematically in the chapters bearing the general title '' Psychologic Method , '' and then systematically in another series entitled '' Psychologic System '' has its points of both ad - vantage and disadvantage .

		The book is not one for novices and amateurs ; even trained pedagogists will not always find it easy reading .

		Dr.
Harris	PERSON	is so completely at home in the pale land of philosophical abstractions , that he does not always make sufficient allowance for the infirmity of the ordinary reader ; we mean the ordinary reader of solid pedagogical works .

		We are well aware that such a mind as his can not pour out all its riches in a duodecimo vol - ume of four hundred pages , but there are some points that we think he should have treated more fully .

		Such a page as the following one , however , leaves nothing to be desired on the score of clearness . ''

		We have omitted any notice of the fields of labour now diligently worked in the psycho-physiological labora - tories of
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	namely , the ascertain - ment of exact quantitative experiments of the velocity and intensity of nerve-currents to the brain from vari - ous organs , or outwardly from the .

		former to the latter .

		All quantitative measurement is useful in the process of inventorying Nature , and there is no doubt that the devotees of ' psycho-physics ' will discover much that is valuable on their road .

		De
Soto	PERSON	and others went in search of the ' Fountain of Youth ' and discovered vast rivers and the details of the continent , though the ob - ject of their expeditions was a figment of the imagina - tion .


Saul	PERSON	, the son of
Kish	LOCATION	, went out to find his father 's asses , but found a kingdom . '

		Many people have done the reverse of this , and meu of average capacity are usually well satisfied if in their search for kingdoms they are rewarded by finding useful beasts of burden .

		In the laboratories of the students of psychology no metaphys - ical results , nor results in pure psychology of a positive character , will be arrived at , it is safe enough to say .

		But it is equally safe to expect very useful discoveries relating to the proper care and nurture of our nervous system in short , a stock of pathological and educa - tional knowledge and scientific insight into the relation of man to other animals , and to his own historic evo - lution . ''

		Perhaps no writer has subjected the educational system of
Rousseau	PERSON	to a more searching examination than has Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	in his work on ''
Rousseau	PERSON	and Education According to Nature . ''

		Beginning with the ideas and aspirations current in
Rousseau	PERSON	's time , and that filled his atmosphere , the author pro- ceeds to relate the material facts of
Rousseau	PERSON	's life , to expound his educational theories , and sum up his influence , in a volume that , for its size , leaves noth - ing to be desired in respect to fulness , clearness , or general correctness .

		As he suggests in his preface , the ''
Rousseau	PERSON	'' stands at the opposite pole of thought to his '' Aristotle '' ; that work gave an account of 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ancient , classical , and social education , while the present one deals with modern , romantic , and un - social education .

		The chapter on
Rousseau	PERSON	's influ - ence gives a brief but comprehensive and firm view of the extent and nature of the effects that he pro- duced on politics , religion , literature , art , and edu - cation .

		Under the last head , Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	finds that most of the good work which he did was merely negative .

		He says : '' In so far as
Rousseau	PERSON	laid bare the defects and abuses of the society and education of his time , and demanded reforms in the direction of truth and simplicity , he did excellent work ; but when be came to tell how such re - forms were to be accomplished , be propounded a system which , from a social and moral point of view , has hardly one redeeming feature , and which is frequently in glar - ing contradiction with itself . ''

		Still , he says
Rousseau	PERSON	's influence has been power - ful beyond measure , and calls him the father of modern pedagogy , even despite the fact that most of his positive teachings had to be rejected .

		He calls him , too , the father of democracy , which sug - gests to us the principal criticism that we have to make on the book .

		We do not find in it an ade - quate recognition of the prodigious influence that modern democracy has had on modern education .

		The author 's final estimate of his subject appears to be a late one ; at least , he says in his preface : '' If my estimate of
Rousseau	PERSON	's value as an educator proves disappointing to those who believe in his doctrines , I can only say , in excuse , that I am more disap - pointed than they are . ''

		It is not always , or perhaps often , that a definite centre of unity and interest can be discovered in a book which is made up of the author 's miscellaneous addresses and essays covering a period of fifteen years , even when they relate to the same general subject .

		This may , however , be fairly claimed for Dr.
Butler	PERSON	's new volume , '' The Meaning of Educa - tion , '' the reason being that his thinking on educa - tion is controlled by a consistent general view of the whole field ; a view formed , he expressly tells us , from the evolutionary standpoint His utter - ances on educational subjects , he also assures us , have been controlled by the following convictions : '' First , that education , in the broad sense in which I use the term , is the most important of human interests , since it deals with the preservation of the culture and efficiency that we have inherited and with their exten - sion and development ; second , that this common interest can and should be studied in a scientific spirit and by a scientific method ; and , third , that in a democracy at least an education is a failure that does not relate itself to the duties and opportunities of citizenship . ''

		The book is not a treatise , and does not profess to be ; still , questions that are raised in one address or essay are sometimes answered in another .

		Thus , the author 's statement at the close of the second address , that '' that knowledge is of most worth which stands in closest relation to the highest forms of the activity of that spirit which is created in the image of Him who holds nature and man alike in the hollow of His hand , '' leaves us inquiring what this knowledge is ; but by turning back to the pre - ceding address we find at least the practical answer .

		There is no part of the book that college and uni - versity men can read to more advantage than the third one : '' Is there a New Education ? ''

		Dr.
Butler	PERSON	here declares that as respects the application of psychological knowledge to teaching , the ele - mentary teacher , especially in the
Western States	LOCATION	, is far in advance of all other teachers .

		And he sets forth in strong language the ignorance of the prin - ciples of pedagogy and of education shown by a large number of teachers in the higher schools . ''

		Here and there a secondary school master , and here and there a college president or professor , takes a genuine and intelligent interest in education for its own sake ; but the vast majority know nothing of it and are but little affected by it . ''

		He might have added that , as a rule , the farther these teach - ers have followed their own lines of specialized study , the more thoroughly Germanized they have become , the less they know and the less they care about education as such .

		The
Countess of Warwick	ORGANIZATION	thus explains , in her brief preface , the genesis of the book on
Women 's Education	ORGANIZATION	in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, for which she stands sponsor : '' Amongst the multifarious sights of the Jubilee year of our Gracious Queen 's reign , perhaps none gave greater occasion for thoughtful interest than the ' Wo - men 's Work Section ' of the Victorian Era Exhibition at
Earl	ORGANIZATION	's Court ; and of these the sub-section Education ' was a striking object lesson of a movement essentially belonging to the past sixty years .

		In addition to the permanent exhibit in the Education Section , a series of
Saturday	DATE	Conferences and a three days ' Education Con - gress were arranged .

		The Conferences dealt with vari - ous sides of women 's work , professional and educational ; the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	with what might be called the Imperial aspect of Education . ''

		The volume contains the addresses , papers , and dis - cussions that were offered in these
Saturday	DATE	Con - ferences , together with some prefatory and introduc - tory matter .

		It is a book of facts rather than of ideas , an attempt to show what , in the Jubilee Year , the British Empire was doing for the educa - tion of women .

		Those who are seeking information concerning this many-sided subject will find it here .

		If we could have a volume giving a similar view of women 's education in the year that the Gracious Queen ascended the throne , the two books would offer about as striking an educational contrast , con - sidering the interval of time , as could well be shown .

		Port-Poyal Education '' will be a welcome addi - tion to pedagogical libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The group of great teachers , able teachers and writ - ers , and noble men and women for whom the name stands is not as well known among us as it should be .

		The book is mainly composed of extracts , but the editor has supplied an historical and critical introduction of sixty-seven pages .

		For this country this introduction , while a good one in itself , might 1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 263 have been better ; a more detailed and elementary account of Port Royal and of what the name signi - fies , would have added interest to the book .

		The extracts are the best of the Port Royal pedagogy , and they show the depth , weight , and seriousness of all that the famous solitaires wrote and did .

		It is well to read such classics , if for no other purpose than to show how much that is now thought new is really old .

		Might we not now accept
Nicole	PERSON	's definition of the most essential quality in the preceptor of a prince as a good definition of the essential quality in the teacher ? ''

		It can not be better explained than by saying that it is that quality which makes a man always blame what is blameworthy , praise what is praiseworthy , disparage what is low , impress with a sense of what is great , judge everything wisely and equitably , and express his judg - ments in an agreeable manner , suitable to those to whom he speaks , and , in fine , makes him direct the mind of his pupils to the truth in everything . ''

		And then , how modern are these paragraphs from the same writer : '' The aim of instruction is to carry our minds to the highest point they are capable of attaining . '' ''

		It does not give memory , imagination , nor intelli - gence , but it cultivates them all .

		By strengthening them one by another , the judgment is aided by the memory , and the memory is assisted by the imagination and the judgment . '' ''

		When some of these parts are absent they should be supplied by others .

		Thus , the tact of a master is shown in setting his scholars to things for which they have a natural liking .

		Some children should be instructed almost solely with what depends on memory , because their memories are strong , but their judgment weak ; and others should at first be set to things regarding judg - ment , because they have more judgment than memory . '' ''

		It is not properly the teachers nor extraneous instruction that cause things to be understood ; at most they only expose them to the interior light of the mind , by which alone they are accompanied ; so that when this light is not found , instruction is as useless as wishing to show pictures during the night . ''

		No matter whether they agree or not with the opinion expressed not long ago that President
Eliot	PERSON	is the greatest constructive force that has acted upon American education in recent years , the better teach - ers and educators of the country will heartily wel - come the volume of essays and addresses to which he has given the name of '' Educational Reform . ''

		He explains , in his preface , that the papers con - tained in the volume have been selected from a much larger number , on the ground that they set forth with clearness and sufficient amplitude the various educational reforms that he has been trying to pro- mote during the last thirty years .

		The title well expresses the character of the work , as '' educational reformer '' would well express the character of its author .

		We notice the absence from the collection of the articles on '' The New Education '' published in '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' which first drew gen - eral attention to Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	, and had much to do , as was then understood , with making him President of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The arrangement is chrono - logical , and the first paper is the inaugural address , delivered in
October , 1869	DATE	.

		The author says that almost all the reforms advocated in the later papers are distinctly , though slightly , outlined in this ad - dress ; possibly , however , some of his readers will not be able to see them all there as distinctly as he sees them .

		The papers are marked by that breadth of view , virility of thought and expression , and courage which have contributed so much to the suc - cess of President
Eliot	PERSON	's administration at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and without which it would have been impossible .

		We find him saying in the inaugural : '' In spite of the familiar picture of the moral dangers which en - viron the student , there is no place so safe as a good college during the critical passage from boyhood to manhood . ''

		If he can persuade the public of this truth , he will at once assuage the anxieties of some breasts that are now troubled , and stimulate attend - ance upon colleges .

		The papers are eighteen in number , and they touch the whole range of educa - tion , from lowest to highest , professional schools included .

		Herbart 's `` Application of Psychology to the Science of Education '' is , so far as we are aware , the fourth of this writer 's educational works to be presented in an English dress .

		Translations of the '' Text-book in Psychology , '' the '' Science of Education , '' and the '' ^ Esthetic Revelation of the World , '' the two last in one volume , came out some years ago .

		The '' Application '' was a late pro- duct of
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's pen ; it appeared in the form of short letters , was meant to be supplementary to the '' Science of Education , '' and was never completed .

		Miss
Millner	PERSON	has rendered students of pedagogy , and especially Herbartians , a service by her trans - lation and her '' Introduction to the Study of Her - bart . ''

		The frequent translation of
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's books , to say nothing of the large secondary literature , shows how much interest the Herbartian pedagogy has awakened .

		This interest can not be indefinitely maintained , relatively speaking , and it is not desir - able that it should be ; but it will not ebb until the more valuable Herbartian ideas have become incor - porated into our general stock of pedagogical thought , such as the ethical ideal , apperception , and interest .

		We do not remember a better brief char - acterization of Herbart than the one that Mr.
David	PERSON	- son gives in the work noticed above : `` Ideas are treated as forces which may be com - pounded , and whose mechanical relations and resultants may be stated in mathematical formulas .

		With such notions he could , of course , arrive at no conception of a free will or any true morality .

		To have will Is nothing more than the mechanical resultant of his idea-forces .

		But in spite of these serious drawbacks , which tend to make education a mere mechanical matter ,
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's contributions to the science of pedagogy were most val - uable and lasting . ''

		President
Taylor	PERSON	's '' Study of the Child '' is some - thing quite different from the conventional book on child-study .

		It is not an inventory of child-actions , child-words , and child-ideas and feelings , nicely ex - 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, pressed in tobies and summaries and left with little attempt at interpretation or synthesis a monument to their author 's interest in facto , but it is just what the secondary title expresses , a brief treatise on the psychology of the child .

		It is strongly marked by the method and spirit of the objective psychology , and could not have been written without the new insight from
that quarter	DATE	, but it also recognizes the fact that , at bottom , psychology is an introspective science .

		The matter of the book is well chosen , the plan easy and natural , and the style clear , while the more abstract parts are well set off by concrete examples .

		Professor and Mrs.
Bryan	PERSON	's '' Republic of Plato '' has been prepared with a view of bringing the ideas , methods , and spirit of that great master to bear more directly upon the teaching and education of the country .

		The object is a commendable one .

		The '' Studies for Teachers '' consist of careful analyses of the several books of the '' Republic '' what it was once the fashion to call '' arguments . ''

		These studies those who use the book will find very helpful .

		Following them is a general introduction , historical and critical in character .

		The editors have taken a hint from the current
Sunday	DATE	School Lesson Leaf : '' In the Studies some golden sayings have been quoted in full , in the hope of making them current coin among us . ''

		Dr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's '' Development of the Child '' is made up of a series of well-considered studies , writ - ten solely from the modern objective or strictly sci - entific point of view .

		We interpret the book to mean that the author took up for discussion a class of subjects that he thought very important and also very much neglected , and not that it expresses the full range of his pedagogical thought .

		His method and spirit are well shown by the chapter devoted to the value of the child as a witness in suits at law .

		After showing that the old writers on evidence placed the stress on the religious element involved in the sanctity of an oath , he proceeds to show that it should rather be placed on the child 's ability to understand the facts involved in his testi - mony and correctly to report them .

		His argument is perfectly conclusive , but we fear that a majority of jurists and lawyers have not the scientific train - ing to appreciate its force .

		The subject has obvious practical difficulties , and we are by no means sure that the dictum , '' The only safeguard that can effectually preserve the common interest is the with - drawal of such child-evidence from courts of law as a well-informed man must , a priori , doubt , '' would remove them .

		Dr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	finds in the profes - sion of maternity the highest activity of woman , but he does not find that the new education provided for women in any way fits them the better for the performance of this activity .

		But this opinion is less discouraging than the old one , which was that it tended directly to unfit them .

		He holds that a careful and exact preparation for the work in hand has to a certain extent received recognition , that it is one step of immense importance , one stride in the right direction ; still , he contends that the young man enters much more fully into the enjoyment of the new education than the young woman , even if her education is described as higher . '' ''

		A young man 's training , '' he tells us , is designed to further his ability to accomplish definite work in the world ; his sister 's is still arranged on the plan of making her appear better cared for , more advantageously placed , better apparelled in mental garments than her neighbors . ''

		It is quite safe to say that a ma - jority of the young women now in colleges and uni - versities will not take kindly to this view of the matter .

		In her attractive volume , '' Child Culture in the Home , '' Mrs.
Mosher	PERSON	addresses to mothers , in a pleasant style , much sound instruction that they need to know and lay to heart .

		There are sixteen chap - ters , all bearing such practical titles as '' The Emo - tions , '' '' The Moral Sense , '' '' The Training of the Will , '' '' Manners , '' '' Domestic Economy , '' and '' Civic Duties . ''

		We have not discovered fresh or novel ideas in the book , but its old lessons , shaped anew and fitted to new conditions , will never go out of fashion , because they are essential to sound child - culture , and , in great degree , to the best interests of human life .

		The motif in the preparation of '' A Study of a Child , '' as stated by the author , '' is the interest awakened in
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	by the child-study movement , the fascination that lies in the sayings and the doings of children , and especially the ex - pressed desire of psychologists , physicians , and teachers for opportunity to study individual child records , both normal and abnormal . ''

		The book opens with an argumentative chapter , '' Reasons for Child-Study in the Home , '' and then proceeds with the '' record '' which '' is given exactly as it was originally written , with a few additional explanatory remarks concerning the course taken to produce the results recorded . ''

		These '' results '' are a large collection of facts observed by an intelligent observer in
the first eight years	DATE	of the development of an individual child , that is endorsed as healthy , happy , and intelligent , care being taken to interfere as little as possible with his spontaneity .

		They have slight connection , or rather none except what is furnished by chronological sequence .

		The large number of original drawings add to the value of the book .

		The foregoing list of books suggest two or three things that are worth noting .

		One is the activity of the pedagogical mind of the country .

		These works all bear the date
1898	DATE	, and are the accumu - lation of three or four months .

		It is not so very long ago that , to make up an equal list , one would have been compelled to run over a series of years , and then the books would have been only relatively as good .

		It is only within a few years that books of as high a character as several of these began to be written in the country .

		Again , the list shows , very happily , the range that our pedagogical litera -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 265 tare is taking .

		The three great fields are all covered more or less fully the science , the art , and the history of education .

		Unless all signs fail , the ed - ucation of the country must be steadily improving .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Professor
Shorey	PERSON	's edition of the Odes and Epodes of
Horace	PERSON	, recently published in '' The Students ' Series of Latin Classics '' -LRB-
Benj	PERSON	.


H. Sanborn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a text-book of such unusual value that it must be given more than the perfunctory mention usually accorded to publications of this description .

		There are an - notated editions of Horace without number for col - lege use , and it would seem at first thought that to add another to the number was about as unnecessary a task as a scholar could attempt .

		But an examina - tion of this new edition not only justifies its exist - ence , but sets a new standard of excellence for works of the class to which it belongs .

		To put the matter briefly , we doubt if there has ever before been brought to the preparation of a classical text for school use so complete a knowledge of the literature of all ages and so great a wealth of illustrative ma - terial as are condensed into the four hundred pages of Dr.
Shorey	PERSON	's introduction and notes .

		There is such a thing , no doubt , as over-annotation , but this criticism does not apply to the apparatus with which the present volume is provided , and an examination of these notes , extensive as they are , reveals the fact that , so far from being padded , or eked out by the admission of pedantic trivialities , they illustrate the extreme of compactness , and that they contain nothing the scholar would willingly miss .

		The average college student , of course , could get along with much less help than is here offered , but for him the remedy is obvious enough , and the book has the great merit of providing the student -LRB- in or out of college -RRB- who is not of the average type with a richer treasury of comment , parallel passages , and Horatian echoes in modern poetry , than has pre - viously been brought within the covers of one vol - ume .

		Let us quote one note , taken almost at ran - dom , by way of illustration .

		The subject is from Ode IV. , XIV. , 31 . ''

		and Cress. , 5 , 5 , ' And there the strawy Greeks ripe for his edge | Fall down before him like the mower 's swath . ' ''

		When one has hundreds of pages of this sort of thing , it becomes impressive .

		We may add that the quotations given in the notes are taken not only from
Greek	LOCATION	,
Latin	LOCATION	, and English literature , but also , although somewhat more sparingly , from the clas - sical writers of
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Yet , in the face of all that has been given , the editor remarks , truthfully enough : `` It would not have been difficult to add indefinitely to the quotations from English poetry , and the task of selection was not easy . ''

		Mr.
Remington	PERSON	Home-keeping folks of steady habits as artist may find Mr.
Frederic Remington	PERSON	's bouquet of wild-life sketches , entitled '' Crooked Trails '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , rather dangerous read - ing .

		Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's enthusiasm for the scenes he paints is infectious enough to tempt a sedentary man into exchanging the trusty arm-chair for the plunging bronco or the fickle canoe as did the misguided attorney who figures as a sort of Tartarin in one of the present sketches .

		With the work of Mr.
Remington	PERSON	the artist we are all more or less familiar .

		He is the delineator par excellence of the Indian , the cavalryman , the cowboy , and the '' greaser , '' and the sharp realism of his pictures will make them of positive historical value to future generations , when the types and phases of Amer - ican character he chooses to portray have disap - peared from the shifting stage of our national life .

		With Mr.
Remington	PERSON	the author we are not so familiar ; but the present volume shows that Mr.
Remington	PERSON	can write if not nearly so well as he can draw still fairly well .

		His book is not free from expressions of -LRB- to put it mildly -RRB- questionable taste , such as '' Nature had slobbered all over Car - ter
Johnson	PERSON	, '' and the like .

		These outbreaks are clearly efforts on Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's part to seem '' breezy '' and off-hand ; but they are clumsy and evi - dently forced .

		How well he can write when he is con - tent to be himself , the following pretty bit of word - painting shows : '' The colors play upon the senses the reddish-yellow of the birch-barks , the blue of the water , and the silver sheen as it parts at the bows of the canoes ; the dark evergreens , the steely rocks with their lichens , the white trunks of the birches , their fluffy tops so greeny green , and over all the gold of a
summer	DATE	day . ''

		All in all , Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's book is a delightful one .

		Of course the pictures are the best part of it .

		There are forty - nine of them in all , and they are to the text what the gem is to the setting .

		The volume is a comely one , and it will make a tempting gift-book when the

		The income of the fund thus provided , except one-tenth which should be regularly added to the principal , should be ex - pended in providing free public lectures to be given in the city of
Boston	LOCATION	by distinguished scholars of the highest attainments .

		The first lecture was de - livered on
December 31 , 1839	DATE	, by
Edward Everett	PERSON	.

		Since then , more than fifty-four hundred lectures have been given by three hundred and fifty-two lecturers .

		Many epoch-marking books have been first presented to the public as

		While the honora - riums paid to the lecturers have been generously adequate to the service , the finances have been so skilfully administered that the original endowment has been about doubled .

		difficult things in the world to write .

		Tet it is surely more humane to let the friends rather than the adversaries of any given person set forth his qualities , appreciatively and not without rev - erence , as in the case before us .

		Dr.
Jacobs	PERSON	has been careful to keep on solid ground .

		The myths which have done much to obscure the real entity behind them are cleared away , and the triumphs and trials of a very human personality disclosed .

		Some of the more important documents on the other side are given in full , a welcome concession to impartiality .

		Nor is the book too voluminous , while its interest is heightened by many illustrations .

		What it has done for its famous subject may be summarized thus : Leaving him still the hero , it affords us a portrait of the man .

		Complaint has been rightly made by those best entitled to be heard in the premises , that modern fiction in gen - eral deals with the art of music as if it were some - thing to be learned without painstaking not an art with a science and history and literature of its own , but something of which it can be affirmed , '' This is good that is bad , '' empirically , by rule of thumb , and without reference to any ascertain - able canon of taste .

		Complaint has also been made by many and many a critic recently , that a book showing some real knowledge of the technique and history of the musical art , ''
Evelyn Innes	PERSON	'' for ex - ample , is quite beyond the reach of readers -LRB- mean - ing the critics -RRB- , and should be reconstructed on more popular grounds .

		Now comes Miss
Hannah Smith	PERSON	to the rescue with `` Music , How it Came to Be What It Is '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , which is a simple , attrac - tive , and wholly comprehensible presentation of precisely what it is that every person of culture should know regarding the fundamental facts of music , serving also to point out to them the
Cim	ORGANIZATION	- merian darkness of their ignorance in a startling number of cases .

		Almost everyone sets himself up as a literary or dramatic critic with at least some notion of the laws of construction in literature and the drama ; this book will prove that critic upon critic of music assumes for himself a knowledge of musical construction by mere instinct .

		Miss
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's work is commendable in every respect save one : she should have gone to anthropology instead of literary tradition for her account of the beginnings of the art she does so much to make comprehensible in its later developments .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , sundry memoirs , addresses , and discussions on animal psy - chology .

		After some general remarks he treats of feigning among squirrels , of hibernation among various animals , of psychic development of young animals , and closes with a discussion on instinct .

		The most valuable part of the book is the diaries showing the growth , physical and psychical , of dogs , cats , rabbits , guinea-pigs , pigeons , and chickens .

		While this work can not be accounted a thorough - going connected monograph , it contains much good and suggestive observation , and opens up a fascin - ating field of study .

		The candid , cautious , thought - ful spirit of the author is to be greatly commended in this age of rash generalization .

		Like all who seriously study animals , Professor
Mills	PERSON	finds in them an unsuspected mental complexity , a force and amount of psychic life , which is far beyond what the public grant them .

		He confirms the common belief that the woodchuck is a predictor of storms .

		The effect of food , both in its nature and quantity , upon the determination of the sex of developing organisms has often been the subject of experiment by the biologist , though not always with accordant results .

		Dr.
Schenk	PERSON	, director of the
Embryological Institute of the University of Vienna	ORGANIZATION	, has propounded a theory which has been much exploited of late in the daily press ; this has now been given to the expec - tant public in an '' authorized translation '' -LRB-
Schenk	ORGANIZATION	's Theory , the Determination of Sex ;
Werner	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Fol -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 26T lowing the suggestions of previous theories and ex - periments , the author finds a partial solution of the problem in a regulated diet .

		The experimental and statistical data given in support of his views , though interesting and perhaps suggestive to the physiologist , do not advance the theory beyond the experimental stage , nor are they adequate to com - mand its wide acceptance in scientific circles , and are quite insufficient , in the present state of the question , to justify a popular faith in its efficacy .

		The greater part of the book is made up of an un - organized repetition and confused jumble of the various crude and conflicting theories advanced upon this subject since the days of Aristotle .

		There is neither a table of contents nor an index to guide the reader through this maze of rubbish .

		The trans - lation is none too well done , and , as in the case of the original , no semblance of a bibliography of the subject appears .

		The '' Early Letters of
George Will	PERSON	- iam Curtis to John S ' & wight '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	, have all the elusive charm one of many which attaches to an overheard telephonic conversation .

		The references to what the other fellow says are not eliminated , and a delightful opportunity to guess what the missing links might be ensues , most gratifying to Yankee inquisitiveness .

		Curtis was a boy in the
Brook Farm School	ORGANIZATION	, sent there because it was probably the best secondary school in the country at that time .

		Curtis and the Farm being what they were , the resulting tale is not only a literary treat which , considering the lapse of years , it very well might not have been but a charming picture , replete with good humor , of departed ambrosial days .

		This latter aspect the editor has judiciously preserved by rescuing to be chromatic a daguerreotype or two of the time , as when he quotes from Mrs.
Kirby	PERSON	to show us the youthful Curtis '' as
Fanny Ellsler	ORGANIZATION	, in a low-necked , short-sleeved , book-muslin dress , and a tiny ruffled apron , making courtesies and pirouetting down the path . ''

		There are , besides , a number of later letters '' from the same to the same , '' which round out the value and worth of a very pleasant little book to read and to own .

		The American ^ - number of those things , technical Book Trade and otherwise , in which collectors of thi * century .

		Q f \ ^ OQ ^ re j o ice have been gathered together in the beautiful little volume printed for the
Dibdin Club	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, under the title '' Book-Trade Bibliography in the
United States	LOCATION	in the XlXth Century . ''

		It contains full accounts of early booksellers ' associations , of the conditions sur - rounding the book-trade in its beginnings in Amer - ica , of the first '' helps '' which became catalogues and journals in later years , of the succeeding bib - liographies which makes the book something very near that long sought for thing , a bibliography of bibliographies ; and , in addition , it holds excellent biographies of the men who attained fame in the bibliographic field , taking in the interesting careers of men as widely known as
Charles B. Norton	PERSON	,
Henry Stevens	PERSON	,
Nicolas Trubner	PERSON	,
Joseph Sabin	PERSON	, and
Frederick Leypoldt	PERSON	.

		Then , by way of climax to this list of treasures , there is appended the full text of the ' Catalogue of all the Books Printed in the
United States	LOCATION	... Published by the Booksellers in
Boston	LOCATION	,
January , 1804	DATE	. ''

		The whole has been prepared by Mr.
A. Grow-all	PERSON	, the managing editor of the '' Publishers ' Weekly , '' and is in excellent taste throughout , both in matter and manner .

		All this information has its value heightened , charac - teristically , by the announcement that a hundred copies and no more are printed for the non-members of the
Dibdin Club	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	.

		Possibly the weight - iest thing in a book which contains nothing unim - portant is the story of the life of the late
Henry Stevens	PERSON	.

		This really eminent American was forced , against his will and strong desire , to purvey to the libraries of
Europe	LOCATION	, that of the British Museum in particular , numbers of works pertaining to
America	LOCATION	which are not to be found in this country at all .

		The persons responsible for this apathy , which has placed the finest existing collection of Americana in
London	LOCATION	rather than
Washington	LOCATION	, are , of course , the members of past
American Congresses	ORGANIZATION	.

		A curious discrepancy between aim Homer ' * women and execut i on keeps The Women misplaced , * j of Homer -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , prepared by Mr.
Walter Copland Perry	PERSON	, from being a work of real delight .

		His subject and the age are alike auspiciously chosen something like Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	's '' Woman in Music '' should result : old facts made new by artistic juxtaposition and an illu - minating intelligence .

		The intention is , of course , to wrest Homer 's women from one literary setting and place them in another ; the fact stands before us in a scrappy , almost hasty , book , without an index , inconsecutive and illogical .

		Search may be made in vain for the first of the Homeric women , that dainty , fleeting impression of the pretty maiden re - turned to her old father 's arms , '' Many another bard some maiden sings Dearer to me Chry seis on the sands and the insistent dwelling upon the goddesses rather than the flesh-and-blood personages of the two epics is , after all , disappointing .

		So the work stands : too replete with Greek quotations and specialized Homeric knowledge for enjoyment by the many , too insistently written down to the many in other respects to make an appeal to the few .

		The time is not ripe for an adequate A * appreciation attempt to place the works of
Eugene of Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	.

		- , .

		, , * .

		, r - r , , .

		, , .

		Field in the canon of English litera - ture ; but his friends are doing all that lies in them to make his position as a classic secure when the authoritative critique is finally prepared .

		Mr.
Francis Wilson	PERSON	, comedian and bibliophile , is the last to lend himself to an exploitation of
Field	ORGANIZATION	's 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, various excellences , personal and otherwise , and `` The Eugene Field I Knew '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a very attractive person indeed .

		What the little book con - tains , however , is rather the raw material of the biographer than the finished product .

		We are some - what at a loss to understand the reasons for includ - ing the facetious epitaph in the closing pages of the book .

		As a rale , Field 's friends have been careful to keep all the work he did of this sort from the ears of the public , though not a few competent judges have held that it is here that his fame such as it may turn out to be is most secure .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The
Roycroft Press	ORGANIZATION	, situate in the little town of
East Aurora	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, is turning out from time to time some choicely-printed volumes which lovers of artistic bookmaking should not overlook .

		Their latest product is a comely volume , bound in gray boards with back of rough green leather , entitled '' Hand and Brain . ''

		It is made up of six essays on socialism , written by
William Morris	PERSON	,
Grant Allen	PERSON	,
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	,
Henry S. Salt	PERSON	,
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	, and
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	.

		The names of these writers alone are a sufficient indica - tion of the literary quality of the essays , and they are given a mechanical setting which is fully up to the pre - vious high standards of the
Royorofters	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sixth volume in the new biographical edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- contain the '' Contributions to Punch , ' '' which include `` The Book of Snobs , '' the '' Novels by Eminent Hands , '' the '' History of the Next French Revolution , '' and many other matters .

		The connection with '' Punch '' lasted for about ten years , and was discontinued because
Thackeray	PERSON	could not agree with the position taken by the paper toward Prince
Albert	PERSON	,
Lord Palmerston	LOCATION	, and
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	.

		It is interesting to read that it was
Thackeray	PERSON	's intention to include the '' Novels by Eminent Hands '' with parodies of
Dickens	PERSON	and himself , but that the publishers were not willing to have
Dickens	PERSON	thus caricatured .

		Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	says : '' We read the ' Prize Novelists ' for real stories , and longed for them to be finished , instead of always breaking off at the most interesting point '' Preceded by a careful essay upon the various versions of the Rev.
S. R. Driver	PERSON	's psalms of
David	PERSON	which have appeared in English from the time of Wycliffe , '' Par - allel Psalter '' -LRB-
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a conscientious attempt to bring new readings to the better comprehension of these ancient songs .

		The work does not seem to be one tbat is destined for popularity , though this is unques - tionably its intention .

		The Prayer-Book version of the Psalter stands on one page , with Dr. Driver 's version over against it , this latter showing every proof of a ripe and thoughtful scholarship , which has refused to sacrifice accuracy to literary attractiveness .

		The '' European History Studies , '' edited by Dr.
F. M. Fling	PERSON	, which have been coming periodically to our table during the past year , are now sent out in a small vol - ume by Mr.
J. H. Miller	PERSON	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Nebraska	LOCATION	.

		The studies are ten in number , deal with Greek and Roman history , and are to be warmly commended to teachers who understand the value of getting at tbe sources , even for the purposes of elementary work .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	have added '' Doctor
Pascal	PERSON	, '' in Mrs.
Serrano	PERSON	's translation , to their growing edition of

N. Y.	PERSON	, will be a volume of verse by Mr.
Claude Fayette Bragdon	PERSON	entitled `` The Golden Person in the Heart . ''

		Dr.
Ferdinand Schwill	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, has written a text-book of the '' History of
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, '' which work has just been published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons . ''

		Wireless Telegraphy Popularly Explained , '' by Mr.
Richard Kerr	PERSON	, is a very small volume just imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , and provided with a preface by Mr.
W. H. Preece	PERSON	.

		Selections from
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Rnskin	PERSON	make up the respective contents of three small books in the series of '' Little Masterpieces , '' now published by the
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two important books of travel to be issued shortly by
Messrs. Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are '' A Cruise under the Crescent '' by Mr.
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	, and `` Along the Bospborns '' by Mrs.
Lew Wallace	PERSON	.

		Tbe
G. W. Dillingham Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just put forth a revised edition of '' The Complete Works of
Artemus Ward	PERSON	, '' in a single handsome volume , with a portrait , numerous illustrations , and an introductory sketch . ''

		The Classics for the Million , '' being '' an epitome in English of the works of the principal Greek and Latin authors , '' by Mr.
Henry Grey	PERSON	, is a book that describes itself .

		It is an English production , and Messrs. Put - nam 's Sons publish it in this country . ''

		The Individual in Relation to Law and Institutions , '' being Part I. of a monograph on '' The Individual and his Relation to Society as Reflected in British Ethics , '' by Professor
J. H. Tufts	PERSON	and Miss
Helen B. Thompson	PERSON	, has just been issued in pamphlet form by tbe
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Great Words from Great Americans , '' edited by Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	, is a pretty volume containing tbe fundamental documents of our constitutional history , besides the most famous addresses of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		It is a well-illustrated volume published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The most remarkable of recent literary finds is one which we first saw mentioned a few days ago , although it is stated that the discovery itself was made in
June	DATE	.

		It is nothing less than a copy of the '' Original Poetry by
Victor	PERSON	and Cazire , '' of which every student of
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 269
Shelley	PERSON	has dreamed that he might be the possible dis - coverer , but which few have supposed would be brought to light in the waking world .

		The book is dated Hors - ham ,
1810	DATE	, contains sixty pages , and will be reprinted at once by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	.

		It has no absolute value as poetry , of course , but is historically of the same interest and importance as the equally famous '' Poems by
Two Brothers	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A valuable little book for those intending to take the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	or other competitive examinations is '' The Automatic Instructor , '' published by the
St. Paul Book & Stationery Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the work of a
United States	LOCATION	army officer , who attributes his success in a difficult competitive examination to the use of the system out - lined in his book .

		We are glad to note that '' The Artist '' of
London	LOCATION	has begun the publication of an American edition with a special supplement devoted to American art affairs . ''

		The Artist '' is one of the best of the English art journals , and this new departure should prove a success .

		Messrs.
Truslove & Comba of New York	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of the American edition .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a revised edition of Pro- fessor
James M. Taylor	PERSON	's '' Elements of the Differential and
Integral Calculus	ORGANIZATION	with Examples and Applications . ''

		The same firm has just issued a revised edition of Dr.
A. P. Gage	PERSON	's `` Elements of Physics , '' one of the best text-books of the subject that have ever been prepared for secondary schools .

		In an artistic booklet of twenty-five pages , the trus - tees of the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	have published , through Messrs.
Longmans & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' An Address delivered by
William Morris	PERSON	at the distribution of prizes to students of the
Birmingham Municipal School of Art	ORGANIZATION	, on Feb - ruary 21 ,
1894	DATE	. ''

		The lecture is printed in the Golden '' type and will be followed by others in the same form .

		A `` school edition '' of the `` Latin Grammar '' of Professors
Gildersleeve	PERSON	and Lodge has just been issued by the
University Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has about three - fifths the volume of the work of
1894	DATE	, a condensation made possible by omitting a certain amount of historical detail and grammatical exposition intended for advanced students , but without any sacrifice of scientific exactness .

		A beautiful edition of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's '' Sonnets from the Portuguese '' is published by Messrs.
George Bell	PERSON	& Sons of
London	LOCATION	, and imported by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In typography and decoration the volume is very similar to the edition recently issued by
Messrs. Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	in their '' English Love-Sonnet '' series .

		Messrs.
Bell	PERSON	's edition , however , is much smaller in form and sold at a cheaper price .

		An excellent summary , the more interesting as ema - nating from a Catholic source , is the ''
Jerome Savona	PERSON	- rola , a Sketch , '' prepared by the Rev.
J. L. O'Neil	PERSON	,
O.P.	LOCATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The writer is an enthusiastic supporter of the great preacher 's orthodoxy , and makes out a very strong case against those who see in him a rebel against the authority of the Holy See .

		Fra
Bartolom	PERSON	- meo 's portrait is used by way of frontispiece , and the work , which has received the approval of Father
O'Neil	PERSON	's ecclesiastical superiors , is given an excellent presentation by
Marlier , Callauan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The death of Mrs.
Blanche Willis Howard von Teuffel	PERSON	is reported as having taken place in
Munich	LOCATION	on the seventh of this month .

		She was born in
1847	DATE	, in
Maine	LOCATION	.

		Her first success was obtained with the bright novel , '' One
Summer	DATE	, '' which was followed by '' Aulnay Tower , '' '' Guenn , ''
Aunt Serena	PERSON	, '' '' The Open Door , '' and several other volumes of fiction .

		For the
last twenty years	DATE	or more she has lived in
Germany	LOCATION	, where she was married to Dr. von Teuffel in
1890	DATE	.

		His subsequent insanity brought a tragedy into her life , and she wrote little during the last few years of her life .

		Her novels have an unfailing charm , and some of the elements of enduring value .

		The above book , which is not a translation but an original work , is composed , as the title indicates , of three parts , each separate and complete in itself .

		Of these , the first two , '' The Jew '' and '' The Gypsy , '' are deeply interesting ethnological studies , containing the fruits of much personal observation and original research .

		The third part , '' 1 Islam , '' is a profound and sympathetic study of the Mnhammadan religion .

		Thus the volume is made up of some of the most valuable of the unpublished
Burton MSS.	ORGANIZATION	, to which so much interest is attached , and forms an admirable example of the work of the famous Oriental traveler in fields which he made his own . ''

LAURENCE GBONLUND	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, author of '' The Cooperative Commonwealth , '' etc. 12mo .

		Cloth ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		In his previous books the author has been criticised for his great dependence on theory , and not enough on fact .

		In his present work he proves how by simple and practical methods society can be materially changed within a short space of time .

		He advocates many new methods which will be found interesting and instructive , not only to students of sociology , but to the average reader as well .

		We could not wish for a better representation of the art of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		In appearance it is only a sketch of a girl who works the telegraph in an office that is part of a grocer 's shop in the
West End	LOCATION	, but as background there is the extravagant world of fashion throwing out disjointed hints of vice and intrigue in mes - sages handed in as indifferently as if the operator were only part of the machine .

		Nevertheless , she is a woman too , and feminine interest and curiosity so quicken her wits that she is able to piece together ' the high encounter with life , the large and complicated game ' of her customers .

		This , in fact , is the romance in her life , the awak - ening touch to her imagination , and it is brought into skilful contrast with the passionless commonplace of her own love . ''

		This novel was running serially in
Godey	LOCATION	's Magazine at the time of Miss Pool 's death .

		It will not , however , be completed in that periodical , but will be issued at once in book form .

		It is a story of love and adventure in
St. Augustine	LOCATION	, much more exciting than Miss Pool 's stories usually are , but with all her delightful sense of humor .

		With ''
Jerry	PERSON	the Dreamer '' Mr.

		His present book treats , in fiction form , of the government of our cities by large private corporations and the difficulties a man with wide business interests has to conduct his affairs honestly .

		It does not aim to show any new solution of municipal problems , but , in a dispassionate way , points out how materially the average community is affected .

		44 A Slave to Duty , and Other Women , '' by OCTAVE THANET .

		Miss French has such a thoroughly established reputation among the present reading public that no further introduction to this collection of short stories will be necessary than to say that it is on a par with her previous books .

		It is probable that no woman thoroughly qualified to write upon this subject would be willing to sign her name to such a book .

		Matters of good form are so constantly changing that there is at present a great need for a new book .

		310 HAR OLD FREDERIC .

		American fiction could ill afford to lose so good a writer as
Harold Frederic	PERSON	, who died at
Henley	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, on the nineteenth of
October	DATE	.

		His reputation as a novelist was hardly more than ten years old , but it was firmly fixed , and we had come to think of him as one of our foremost story-tellers , as one to the growth of whose powers there was no readily assignable limit .

		That he should have been taken away in the very prime of life for he had only com - pleted his forty-second year is of itself a happening sufficiently tragic , and the tragedy becomes heightened by what is reported of the circumstances under which he died , for the despatches state that he had fallen into the hands of those fanatics who deny the efficacy of the scientific treatment of disease , and that he was refused the medical attendance which might , it is claimed , have averted the disaster of his early death .

		If this be true , a heavy indictment lies against those who were respon - sible for the neglect , and they stand condemned morally even if they are beyond the reach of the civil law .


Harold Frederic	PERSON	was born on a farm in cen - tral
New York	LOCATION	,
August 19 , 1856	DATE	, of an ancestry in which English , French , and Dutch elements were commingled .

		His childhood was familiar with poverty , and his schooling ended with his fourteenth year .

		Forced thus to become a self - educated man , his subsequent career gave evi - dence once more of the truth which some seek to minimise or even to deny that educa - tion is none the less education because a man gets it by his own unaided efforts that the education gained in this strenuous way may be of a more solid kind than that attested by a parchment certificate .

		After a few years of employment , first as office-boy , then as draughts - man , then as retoucher of photographic nega - tives ,
Frederic	PERSON	found himself landed in journal - ism , and speedily made his way to the front .

		At twenty - four , he was one of the editors of the
Utica	LOCATION	'' Observer , '' at twenty-six , he became editor of the
Albany	LOCATION	'' Evening Journal , '' at twenty-eight , he was engaged by the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times , '' and sent to
London	LOCATION	, as correspond - ent for that newspaper .

		Since
1884	DATE	, then , his 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, career has been public property , and we are now left sadly wondering at the position he created for himself during the last fourteen years of his life , and at the amount of serious work that he had accomplished before he died .

		It was , we believe , in this first year of his English life , that we first saw the name
Harold Frederic	PERSON	in print .

		It was signed to a short paper in the `` Pall Mall Gazette , '' written by an American in
London	LOCATION	, '' and devoted to an account of the condition of literary affairs in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		We well remember ask - ing ourselves who this man could be , whose name was wholly unfamiliar , yet who wrote with so much assurance and intelligent grasp of his subject .

		It was not until some
three years later	DATE	that the name again attracted our attention , when it was attached to a striking story called ''
Seth	PERSON	's Brother 's Wife , '' which began to appear serially in one of the magazines .

		From this time on which amounts to saying for the past ten years the name has been well known to all American readers , and has come to stand for good literary work , conscientiously performed , in whatever field of activity its owner might choose to engage .

		As a correspondent , Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	's work has become very widely known indeed during recent years .

		His
London	LOCATION	letters , printed in a number of our leading newspapers , have been the most interesting of their kind , full of energy and ideas , bringing a trained mind to bear upon cur - rent questions of politics , society , and art , and embodying as much of style as could reasonably be expected of a writer who used the
Atlantic	LOCATION	cable for his instrument .

		Moreover , on at least two notable occasions , Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	was not con - tent with providing for his American public the news supplied to his hand in
London	LOCATION	, but set out to obtain news of his own by direct investigation .

		It was in
1884	DATE	, at the outset of his career as a newspaper correspondent , that he made a per - sonal inspection of the cholera-infected districts of
Southern France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		He visited Mar - seilles and
Toulon	LOCATION	in the days when the popu - lation of those cities was panic-stricken , and his letters upon the subject were an important con - tribution to our knowledge of the epidemic at a time when it was feared that even our own country was threatened with invasion by the dreaded plague .

		The second of the occasions referred to was in
1891	DATE	, when the recrudescence of Jew-baiting in
Russia	LOCATION	was made the subject of a personal investigation by Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	, the result of his observations being published the following year in a graphic and impressive work entitled '' The New Exodus : A Study of
Israel	LOCATION	in
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		This work , and the newspaper correspondence which he carried on for fourteen years , gave Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	considerable prominence as a student of public affairs , and his firm grasp of political problems made him something of an authority upon contemporary history .

		All this work , however , is of a sort soon to be inevitably for - gotten because essentially ephemeral .

		But Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	's fiction is not ephemeral , and has won for him a high place among American novelists .

		Eight volumes of that fiction have already been published , and two more will make the list com - plete .

		Ten volumes in ten years is not a bad record , when we consider that their author was by vocation a journalist , and a man of letters only by avocation , especially when we consider that the ten volumes are of a far higher character than the work of most journalists , that they are reasonably free from those touches of crudeness and vulgarity that few journalists are able to exclude from their attempts to produce literature of the serious sort .

		The ten volumes are these : ''
Seth	PERSON	's Broth - er 's Wife '' -LRB- 1887 -RRB- , `` The Lawton Girl '' -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , `` In the Valley '' -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , `` The Return of the O'Mahony '' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- , `` The Copperhead '' -LRB- 1894 -RRB- , ''
Marsena	PERSON	, and Other Stories of the War '' -LRB- 1895 -RRB- , `` The Damnation of Theron Ware '' -LRB- 1896 -RRB- , `` March Hares '' -LRB- 1896 -RRB- , ''
Gloria Mundi	PERSON	'' -LRB- 1898 -RRB- , and '' The Market Place , '' promised for publication next year .

		Of the eight volumes that are already contained between covers , '' March Hares '' and '' The Return of the O'Mahony '' are extravaganzas , and stand apart from the rest .

		Neither of them would we willingly miss , for they display a richly humorous side of the author 's fancy , the exist - ence of which would hardly be suspected by read - ers of his other novels .

		The second of the two just named , in particular , has never enjoyed half the popularity it deserves ; for exuberant vital - ity it outranks the others , although this char - acter is doubtless gained at the expense of more artistic qualities .

		From the other six novels that stand on the shelf , '' In the Valley '' stands apart as a work of historical fiction , in the sense that it deals with a bygone period .

		We make this distinction because all of the six are histori - cal in a wide but very genuine sense of the term .

		Of '' In the Valley , '' which deals with the Revo - lutionary period of our history , and with the events that prepared the way for an American victory at
Saratoga	LOCATION	, we do not hesitate to say that it is one of the best historical novels that
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 291 we have , a strong and vivid portrayal of one of the most stirring and pregnant periods in our national annals .

		Five books remain for a few words of char - acterization .

		They all deal with the region and the period that the author knew so well , the central
New York	LOCATION	of the sixties , seventies , and eighties .

		They accomplish for that region and that period the work of analysis and portraiture that so many of our writers are doing for other regions and contemporary periods .

		Two of them reproduce for us the feeling with which the old North viewed the Civil War , and show us the cross-currents of sentiment and the conflicting passions that divided non-combatants as well as combatants .

		Two others are more strictly domestic in their interest .

		The fifth , by com - mon consent Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	's most successful novel , has for its theme the warfare waged by two religious ideals in the battle-field of a man 's soul ; but even this powerful work is at the same time a richly observant study of provincial American society .

		We may perhaps be per - mitted to quote , in closing , a few words that we wrote of this powerful fiction at the time of its appearance two years ago : '' Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	has aimed to produce a great and typical picture of American life , and an unerring instinct has taught him that such a picture must be con - cerned with the life of a small community rather than with the more attractive but also more sophisticated civilization of the great cities .

		It is in the small community that the main - springs of a nation 's strength are to be felt most distinctly and the elements of its weakness most clearly discerned ; it is here that its fundamen - tal ideals are most naively offered to the view . ''

		These words were written of '' The Damnation of
Theron Ware	PERSON	, '' but their application extends to the greater number of Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	's novels , and for this reason they are here reproduced .

		THE B TGONE L
TCE	ORGANIZATION	UM .

		When , in the early thirties ,
Emerson	LOCATION	, cut adrift from his church and his livelihood , began his forty years of platform work , the American lecturing sys - tem may be said to have its most definite beginnings .

		It is the old story of the mustard seed : there has sprung up a great tree , and the European celebrities come and lodge in the branches .

		Its like has existed nowhere else in quite such luxuriance .

		When
Archibald Forbes	PERSON	thought of a lecturing tour in
England	LOCATION	, after the Russo-Turkish war , he had no precedents , and was forced to barnstorm the country under the guidance of a theatrical manager .

		Jona - than 's lecturing machinery was still a '' foreign devil '' to
John Bull	PERSON	, for
America	LOCATION	, which led the way in establishing an organized system , has all along retained pretty much what a furnisher would call an exclusive design .

		The unit of the system in its completeness was the
Lyceum	LOCATION	, the idea of which is now concrete only to the old and middle-aged , and whose rise , decline , and fall have yet to find their historian .

		In a gen - eral way , the term denotes the various organizations which , flourishing or languishing as the local ther - mometers of '' culture '' registered high or low , once existed in city and village alike throughout the North - ern States , with the improvement of the community as their especial aim , and the delectable exhibition , in courses of lectures covering the winter months , of the intellectual lions of the day as a corollary .

		It is difficult for the present generation to realize the im - portance of this institution ; the weekly lecture was the social event before which all other engagements must needs give way , and it often stood in lieu of the inaccessible theatre or the forbidden dance .

		The history of popular lecturing in this country would seem to fall into three periods : the first , roughly bounded , ends with the Civil War ; the second , some twelve years ago ; while the third is still with us .

		Of the early days , and
Emerson	PERSON	's first
Boston	LOCATION	lectures , we have a sympathetic picture . ''

		Who that saw the audience , '' says
Lowell	PERSON	, '' will ever forget it , where everyone still capable of fire , or longing to renew in himself the half-forgotten sense of it , was gathered ?

		Those faces , young and old , agleam with pale intellectual light , eager with pleased attention , flash upon me once more from the deep recesses of the years with an exquisite pathos .

		... I hear again that rustle of sensation , as they turned to exchange glances over some pithier thought , some keener flash of that humor which always played about the horizon of his mind like heat-lightning , and it seems now like the sad whisper of the autumn leaves that are whirling around me . ''

		Other men of letters followed
Emerson	PERSON	, and lec - turing began to grow in favor .

		It paid but meagrely at first .

		Holmes tells a story of ''
Emerson	PERSON	's coming to my house to know if I could fill his place at a cer - tain Lyceum so that he might accept a very advan - tageous invitation in another direction .

		I told him that I was engaged for the evening mentioned .

		He smiled serenely , saying that then he supposed he must give up the new stove for that season . ''

		By the time of the war , the lecturing field was crowded and the Lyceum system widespread .

		There is in the possession of the writer a bundle of old letters to whose yellowed paper and faded ink the signatures of men famous in literature and public affairs lend a revitalizing touch .

		They all pertain to lecturing , and were written during the Civil War to the sec - retary of a Lyceum in a town of western
New York	LOCATION	.

		Here are letters from statesmen , judges , bishops , war correspondents , editors , men of letters , mer - chants , lawyers , philanthropists , orators , and trav - ellers ; from politicians who were too busy to lee - 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, tare and politicians who had little else to do , poet * open to persuasion and a poet who could not be lured , a man who had been president and men who were ambitions to be president ; and , not the least interest - ing , letters from the Lyceum secretaries who talked of the great ones for whom they were angling as though they were commodities to be bought and sold .

		Those were the days of the giants , but the giants had their host of pygmy imitators , and in perusing these old letters no point is more striking than the present comparative nnfamiliarity of the names of most of their authors .

		What , for example , do the names of
MacGowan	ORGANIZATION	,
Edwin James	PERSON	,
Murdoch	ORGANIZATION	, or even the once celebrated
E. H. Chapin	PERSON	, now mean to us ?

		What legacy has been left us by
Richards	PERSON	, who used to sugar-coat science for the crowd , and whose popularity permitted matinees for children ?

		Where , outside the annals of journalism , do we meet with the names of
W. C. Prime	ORGANIZATION	,
Manton Marble	ORGANIZATION	, or
Benjamin F. Taylor	PERSON	?

		Yet all had their vogue , and this one sentence of
Taylor	PERSON	's , '' My pro- tracted absence with the
Army of the Cumberland	ORGANIZATION	has served to confuse my lecturing arrangements , '' is indicative that there were those among them who stood near the pulse of the stirring life of the time .

		Bishops
Clark	PERSON	and
Simpson	PERSON	, good men both , the latter the man whom Lincoln regarded as the great - est orator he had heard , are shadowy figures ; and to how many to-day comes as a familiar sound the name of ''
Edmund Kirke	PERSON	, '' the pen-name of
J. R. Gilmore	PERSON	, who was at one time entrusted with what proved a bootless mission to the Confederacy ?

		What memories of defunct issues that once were live are stirred by this voice from the past : '' My subject , '' he writes , '' will be ' The Southern Whites : their characteristics , and their relation to the future of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	. '

		It will , naturally , be largely de - scriptive and humorous , but while it will contain nothing to offend the abolitionist or anti-abolitionist , it will give the
Vallandigham	PERSON	school of Copperheads 4 Hail
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	. '

		I wish this distinctly understood and assented to by you , as , like a certain old lady of everybody 's acquaintance , I like to have ' my say . ' ''

		This was the season of 1863-4 , and the men of affairs found other wine-presses to tread .

		Thus ,
Seward	ORGANIZATION	, writing from
Washington	LOCATION	, pleads in ex - cuse that '' my engagements obliged so early a re - turn to this place . '' ''

		I shall be required at Wash - ington , '' writes Fernando Wood ; and
Washington	LOCATION	again claims the presence of
Holt	ORGANIZATION	, the Judge - Advocate General .


Henry Winter Davis	PERSON	's duties '' are too engrossing . '' ''

		With my present engage - ments , '' says
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, '' I dare not promise myself . ''


Reverdy Johnson	PERSON	's outlook is certain to keep me in work '' ;
Edward Everett	PERSON	has '' not ac - cepted any invitations to speak the ensuing season '' ; ex-President
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	declines without ex - planations ; and
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	, in a scrawl that speaks of haste more than his assertion of the fact at the close , with a half promise , thrusts the whole consideration of the matter months forward into the uncertain future .

		These men , however , with the exception of
Phillips	LOCATION	, were hardly '' regulars '' in the lecturing phalanx which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	indisputably led .

		Among the professional lecturers , few were more sought after than
John B. Gough	PERSON	and
Henry Ward Beecher	ORGANIZATION	.

		Gough 's agent announces by circular that he is booked for months to come ; and one of the Lyceum secretaries states on the eve of
Beecher	PERSON	's return from his memorable trip to
England	LOCATION	: '' There is a pile of letters a foot high waiting his arrival , all of which relate to lectures . ''

		Another favorite was the comedian
James H. Hackett	PERSON	, the Falstaff of his generation , who found time outside his theatrical work for occasional read - ings .

		He was much in demand , but difficult to pin down to a definite date , and there are in my pile several letters in his nervous , old-fashioned hand , anent one of the attempts to secure him .

		He makes an interesting confession as to his professional re - wards .

		He had received an offer of
$ 100	MONEY	from
Albany	LOCATION	, a compensation which , he asserts , '' ap - proached nearer to such as I can obtain by four nights acting upon the stage . ''

		Naturally , in a collection like this there are letters from such platform celebrities as
Curtis	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, and
Anna Dickinson	PERSON	; but their correspondence contains but little of general interest .

		Curtis was then in the thick of that strug - gle to liquidate a publishing-house debt which he might have legally avoided , but which , like
Scott	PERSON	, he chose to shoulder .

		The five letters in his hand , trifling though they are , reflect everywhere the '' heart of courtesy '' which this first gentleman of
America	LOCATION	so markedly possessed .


Holmes	PERSON	's letters , like everything he touched , bear the imprint of his personality .

		This is rather a model declination : '' I have got tripped up at starting , '' he says , in breaking an engagement by reason of sickness . ''

		I hate to disappoint an audience as much as any lec - turer can .

		I have strong personal motives for car - rying out my plan for that lecturing trip during that vacation .

		Nothing but necessity would have forced me to relinquish it , and that I am sure will prove a sufficient apology . ''

		This same
Lyceum	ORGANIZATION	also made an attempt to entice
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		In a dainty mon - ogrammed note from
Nahant	LOCATION	the poet replied : It would give me great pleasure to accept your invita - tion if I ever appeared in the character of lecturer .

		As I do not , I must decline . ''

		The drama of the present was at that period too absorbing for interest in things literary or philo - sophic , and the subjects proposed in these letters are , with rare exceptions , pertinent to the struggle then in progress .

		Thus , we have '' The Southern Whites , '' '' The State of the Country , '' '' The Prob - able Issues of the War , '' `` The Way of Peace , '' `` The National Heart , '' and `` The Crisis of the Nation . ''

		Politics , hitherto tabooed from the Ly - ceum , began to overshadow all else .

		From the point of view of our day , when the best - known lecturers receive from three to
five hundred dollars	MONEY	a night , and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	toured the country at
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 293 ' the rate of a hundred and
ten thousand dollars	MONEY	for a hundred and ten lectures , the prices paid these men seem paltry .

		A hundred dollars was then con - sidered munificent hire for a Lyceum lecture , and equally so , it is likely , in many instances by the lecturers themselves .

		Both
Gough	PERSON	and
Beecher	PERSON	could ask and easily get a hundred and fifty dollars ;
Holmes	PERSON	,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	,
Phillips	LOCATION	,
Butler	PERSON	, and
Everett	PERSON	valued their services at one hundred dollars ;
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	was satisfied with sixty ; and
George William Curtis	PERSON	, with a modesty that is characteristic , rated himself in the fifty-dollar category with
Manton Marble	ORGANIZATION	,
Benjamin F. Taylor	PERSON	, Bishop
Clark	PERSON	, and
Charles Carleton Coffin	PERSON	.

		After the war , conditions changed .

		Up to this time the lecturers had been largely their own busi - ness managers , and dependent upon the invitations they might receive .

		A tendency toward centraliza - tion of management now set in .

		The Lyceums of the West pooled their interests in the securing of prominent lecturers from the
East	LOCATION	, and suggested , it is likely , by this came the establishment of bu - reaus for the supply of the Lyceums and the intro - duction of the methods which have been stigmatized as '' lecture brokerage . ''

		Prices rose , and by the early seventies , and the coming of Major Pond the
Warwick	PERSON	of the modern lecture-world , who infused a new spirit into the business the organ - ized machine got fairly under way .

		Illustrative of the change which came about , it may be said that
Curtis	PERSON	latterly received from two hundred to three hundred and
fifty dollars	MONEY	a lecture , and
Gough	PERSON	's annual income from this source exceeded thirty thousand dollars .

		In the changed conditions , however , were the beginnings of the downfall of the Lyceum .

		The rise in prices brought a natural influx of mediocrity into the field , which cheapened the abler men and degraded the Lyceum system into what Dr.
Holland	PERSON	characterized as '' a string of entertainments that have no earnest purpose , and minister to no manly and womanly want . ''

		As early as
1868	DATE	, Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	noted a change of tone and the passing of the orthodox Lyceum lecture . ''

		The scholar , '' he wrote , '' recedes from sight , and the impassioned orator takes his place . ''

		By
1874	DATE	the decline of the Lyceum itself had obviously begun .

		The platform was losing its former leaders the men who bad given
America	LOCATION	a literature , who had made the Ly - ceum 's existence possible , who had denounced slav - ery , and who had taught the liberty of conscience , and the public was offered the stimulus of music and operatic effects to relieve the tedium of its lec - tures .

		Popular interest flagged more and more , until now , although '' there are more lectures given than ever before , '' as Major
Pond	PERSON	said in a recent letter to the writer , '' a regular Lyceum course is known only in the memory of the people past mid - dle life . ''

		There has succeeded the period of '' stars . ''

		For - eign invaders , with high hopes of plunder , are ever among us with varying fortunes ; the
Conan Doyles	PERSON	fail where the Ian MacLarens prosper ; our own men of letters still lecture , but in the main before some convention , or at some civic , reform , or liberal club dinner .

		The old-time Lyceum audience whose average portrait the '' Autocrat '' has drawn so well no longer gathers . ''

		Front seats : a few old folks , shiny-headed , slant up best ear towards the speaker , drop off asleep after awhile , when the air begins to get a little narcotic with carbonic acid .

		Bright women 's faces , young and middle-aged , a little behind these , but toward the front , -LRB- pick out the best and lecture mainly to that -RRB- .

		Here and there a countenance sharp and scholarlike , and a. dozen pretty female ones sprinkled about .

		An indefinite number of pairs of young people , happy , but not always very attentive .

		Boys in the back - ground , more or less quiet .

		Dull faces , here , there , in how many places !

		I do n't say dull people , but faces without a ray of sympathy or a movement of expression .

		They are what kill the lecturer .

		These negative faces , with their vacuous eyes and stony lineaments , pump and suck the warm soul out of him ; that is the chief reason why lecturers grow so pale before the season is over . ''

		The lapse of four decades precludes the gathering again of that audience .

		The fact that we are now intellectually almost one country , and not several differing provinces , has stripped the lecturer of something of the glamor attached to that which is 1 foreign .

		His message has preceded him . ''

		When all can read , and books are plentiful , lectures are unnecessary , '' is the dictum of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, which ' Miss Repplier tellingly quotes in her `` Gentle Warn - ing to Lecturers , '' and it perhaps best explains why the real Lyceum belongs to the past , and what makes improbable a true renaissance .

		For although
the University Extension	ORGANIZATION	movement is a legitimate child of the Lyceum , the revival of lecture courses brought about by its influence is a thing apart .

		The good which the Lyceum wrought it is impos - sible to estimate .

		A '' general toleration of all men and all opinions , '' '' the education of the public taste in intellectual amusements , '' a higher '' standard of excellence in English and its utterance , '' and the untiring championship of '' universal liberty , '' these Dr.
Holland	PERSON	regarded as foremost among the quickening influences of the popular lecture while the Lyceum was yet undegenerate .

		`` WOULD BETTER '' FOR `` HAD BETTER . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In this part of the English-speaking world there has sprung up of late years a form of expression that is becoming wide-spread , at least in colloquial , newspaper , , and schoolmaster English ; it has not been used by any good writer that I know of .

		Attention has never been called to it , so far as I have observed , and I bring it up merely to find out to what extent the usage is becoming 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, general .

		I refer to the use of '' would better '' for the idiomatic `` had better '' in such sentences as these : '' You would better see about it yourself . '' ''

		The man who meditates throwing out of the convention would better put on asbestos gloves before trying it . ''

		The origin of such an unidiomatic , illogical locution may be due to the schoolmaster 's diagram , which in general tends to level the idioms of our speech to the weak , insipid English more easily analysed by the diagram-formulfe , a passing fad in English instruc - tion , at least here in the
West	LOCATION	, that has done more harm than its advocates are aware of .

		I know nothing more destructive of idiomatic , and hence effective , English speech than the popular school methods of parsing and diagramming .

		Another explanation I offer is , that '' would better '' for '' had better '' may have arisen in the common speech by analogy with '' would rather '' for '' had rather , '' both of which are in good use .

		It seems more likely , how - ever , to be a conscious effort on the part of the purist , regardless of idiom , to put his speech in accord with his notions of grammatical correctness .

		`` You had better '' is , in the process of evolution , from an earlier '' You were better '' -LRB- Anglo-Saxon Eoto waere betere -RRB- , meaning '' It were -LSB- would be -RSB- better for you . ''

		You , originally a dative , came , in time , to be mistaken , on account of its position , for a nominative , as in '' If you please , '' and the usage then became ex - tended , as in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` She were better love a dream '' -LRB- T. N. , 2 .

		2 -RRB- , '' I were better to be eaten to death '' -LRB- 2
Hen	ORGANIZATION	.

Statua	LOCATION	, or Picture , then to suffer his Thoughts to pass in smother '' -LRB- `` Of Friendship '' -RRB- . ''

		You were better '' became in time '' you had better , '' probably by analogy with such forms as '' had come , '' 44 had gone , '' for earlier '' were come , '' 4 were gone , '' according to the prevailing rule for the conjugation of intransitive verbs , as in modern German .

		But no man with Anglo-Saxon instincts , or with red blood in his veins , is going to use '' would better '' either in speaking or in writing .

		It is uuhistorical , unidio - matic , and defies all logical analysis .

		THE MUSES AND THE CUBAN WAR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		Students of early poetry have heard more or less of the theory of 4I communal authorship , '' according to which primitive poetry just grew , without having any author at all in the modern sense of the term .

		However much truth or falsehood there may be in this view , there is a sense in which certain kinds of verse have a communal genesis .

		Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	was to all practical intents and purposes the author of that soul-stirring war lyric , '' Mine eves have Mem the glory of the coming of the Lord , He is trampling out his vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored , '' but she was something more than its individual author ; and that is , the point at which the electrical force of a
Nation	ORGANIZATION	's deep and unified moral feeling was discharged .

		Granted the highest possible poetic genius , and yet she could never have produced that particular poem under any other condition than that of a great people swayed by the deep feeling which it expresses .

		And this gives us a key to the problem of Cuban War lyrics which some of your correspondents have recently raised .

		If the masses were pervaded by a deep , unified , and well - defined moral sentiment in the recent struggle , then the friends of the muses have reason for serious concern over the failure of that struggle to produce even one lyric which could be put by the side of such work as Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's '' Battle-Hymn '' without betraying at once its utter lack of the qualities necessary to really great war verse .

		We & & y failure without any hesitation ; a war lyric of the higher type will sing itself into the hearts of the people at once , without waiting to be hunted up and introduced by the students of literature .

		If , then , this unified moral feeling was present and could not find utterance , poetical ability must be at a very low ebb among us .

		If , however , -LRB- we make the sugges - tion with fear and trembling -RRB- there was no unification of moral sentiment ; if any chance group of citizens who met together took about as many different views of the war as there were individuals present ; if the less intel - ligent classes were confessedly following the yellow journals ; if the thinking classes were either wholly con - vinced , or even strongly suspicious , that there would have been no war except for these same journals and the baser element in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; if even those who were hearty believers in the war for it * declared purpose fore - saw the inevitable movement to carry it far beyond that purpose , and into regions of doubtful expediency and morality , then we may easily take the most hopeful view of current poetical ability in
America	LOCATION	, and still feel no surprise that the verse of the struggle rose no higher than strained rhetoric about the eagle and the flag , ingenious quips about bottling fleets , etc. .

		These alternatives are sincerely believed by the writer to cover the entire ground : '' The lady or the tiger 1 '' Let each reader decide for himself .

		NATIONAL PRIDE AND HISTORICAL ACCURACY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		Spanish historians may be trusted to give a good ac - count of themselves when the time comes for them to chronicle the naval events of the late war in a way as little mortifying as possible to the pride of posterity .

		Much ingenuity and perhaps some lying may be looked for .

		But in the art of extracting balm , and even mat - ter of gratification , from a tale of national disaster , the Spaniards can hardly hope to outdo the average British historian of the naval actions of the war of
1812	DATE	.

		The latest considerable British writer to distinguish himself in this respect is Mr.
Charles Oman	PERSON	.

		In his for the most part capital little '' History of
England	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Oman	PERSON	, after cautiously admitting that `` on three successive occasions '' in
1812	DATE	the English frigates engaged had possibly a shade the worst of it , goes on cheerfully to say that '' In course of time the American vessels were hunted down and destroyed by our squadrons '' !

		This belated bit of '' war news '' ought to prove as agreeable a surprise to most of Mr.
Oman	PERSON	's countrymen as did Mr.
Cunningham Grabame	PERSON	's discovery that
Dewey	PERSON	's victory at
Manila	LOCATION	was won by British gunners .

		Seri - ously , it is a comfort to know that such preposterous slips as the one cited above are extremely rare in Mr.

		THE DIAL 295 OUR RESPONSIBILITY , NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL .

		.

		* The essays gathered together by Professor
Woolsey	PERSON	have already been separately given to the public in recent years as contributions to periodicals , and bear the marks of their original destination in an occasional sketchiness and some repetition .

		They deal with the Cuban Question , the future of
Hawaii	LOCATION	and the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines , the
Interoceanic Canal	ORGANIZATION	, the
Fisheries Question	ORGANIZATION	, the Arbitration Treaty of
1897	DATE	, and '' The President 's
Monroe	PERSON	Doctrine . ''

		Although a number of the questions here discussed have reached stages of development hardly to be fore - told when these essays were written , the book is to be welcomed by those who now seek the true solutions .

		The same deliberate and judicial mind that marked the elder
Woolsey	PERSON	appears in all these pages , and they must appeal to a very large class of thoughtful men , not because they say anything unexpected , but because they ap - peal to and fortify a kindred habit of mind .

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	, on the other hand , in a most remarkable and able paper , goes deeper , and breaks new ground for thought .

		He asks the question , why it is that the American people , in the course of one brief year , seem to have changed so radically their attitude with refer - ence to foreign policy .

		Before this recent war came upon us , the great mass of Americans were content to say ''
America	LOCATION	for the Ameri - cans , '' and to leave the Old World to its own areas and its own devices .

		To-day the same great majority contemplate with jocund serenity the annexation of
Porto Rico	LOCATION	perchance of
Cuba	LOCATION	and , going far overseas , of
Hawaii	LOCATION	and
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		A second question follows : Does this change betoken a revolution in Amer - ican national purposes , or is it merely a revela - tion a revelation of a hitherto unrecognized stream of tendency ?

		Mr.
Powers	PERSON	decides for the latter , and proceeds most forcibly to illus - trate his thesis .


Washington	LOCATION	's advice , in his farewell address , when he urged avoidance of political entanglements with the Old World , and pointed the gaze westward upon our great undeveloped continent , was a warning .

		Rec - ognizing already the rising tendencies of his *

Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
Annals American Academy of Political and Social Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		indefatigable fellow-countrymen to '' go in and possess the land , '' he anxiously directed their attention along the line of least resistance toward the interior of their own continent .

		But the bounds that
Washington	LOCATION	's dying gaze rested on were too strait ; and within four years ,
Jefferson	PERSON	, the strict constructionist , voicing the American mind , first tested the elasticity of the Constitution in the annexation of
Louisiana	LOCATION	a land of alien race and alien institutions , and as far away from the banks of the
Potomac	LOCATION	as are
the Philippines	LOCATION	to-day .

		Again in
1848	DATE	, by force and the sword , we entered upon the possessions of another alien race possessions which were removed from our borders by sup - posed deserts , more difficult of passage than a
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	.

		So too , in
1866	DATE	, we bought an outlying domain , far from our centres df population , and not to be reached across Amer - ican soil .

		Thus a trend of national expansion , regardless of alien race and institutions , or of physical barriers , has been set up , which recent events , according to Mr.
Powers	PERSON	, but further express , although he emphasizes the fact that now for the first time this trend brings us face to face with races beyond our powers of assimila - tion , with climates beyond our powers of adapta - tion , with neighbors fully as strong as ourselves .

		If to-day we ask for the reasons in favor of the forward policy which the Spanish War has made attractive to so many minds , we are fur - nished with a goodly number , each with its special group of advocates .

		We are told by some that the glorious Star-spangled Banner should never recede from any spot on which it has been planted , and this for mere sentiment 's sake , regardless of the right or wrong that placed it there .

		Others speak of our '' mis - as the most intelligent and most devel - son oped of the nations , to carry our civilization and our institutions into less favored lands , and thus to preach liberty , fraternity , equality .

		Many ambitious masters of industry see the commercial fields of the oldest East lying ripe for a grand harvest , and desire to take posses - sion of them for Yankee exploitation .

		From not a few of the religious newspapers and as - semblies comes a similar idea as regards the great field of heathenism , which offers them an adundant opportunity , once covered by our national flag .

		More thoughtful men than any of these tell us that in virtue of a situation which is new , yet into which we as a nation have drifted , a new responsibility now exists as a fact , whether we like it or not .

		Others , again , concede the strangeness and the risk of all that 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, now seems impending , but console themselves and us with the proposition that this coming touch with the larger world of international affairs will sober and steady us as a nation , banish shirt-sleeve diplomacy '' from our ser - vice , and enable us to stand among the peoples of the earth respecting and respected .

		Those who think differently can not afford to brush all these arguments aside with impatience , as they safely may do with the first .

		They must rather give reasons for the faith that is in them , and present their counter-plea .

		They ask , then , in the name of consistency , what was the pro- claimed purpose of this war , and how the Amer - ican people can stand before the gaze of the world , and especially of our neighbor republics to the southward , if a war of liberation and humanity is diverted into a land-grabbing ex - ploit .

		They emphasize with prolonged empha - sis the home needs of this nation , and ask if all its surplus energy is not demanded to solve the weighty problems political , financial , and social that to-day confront us .

		They point to '' the machine , '' overshadowing and imper - illing all our free institutions ; they note the arrested development in the whole matter of currency reform , where the prospect seemed so bright less than a year ago ; they suggest that the claims of organized labor and the peril of organized capital need the full attention of all our minds , if catastrophe is to be averted from the republic .

		Again , they assure us that while it is true that the annexations of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, of
Texas	LOCATION	, of the farther West , of
Alaska	LOCATION	, mark a century 's trend and were made through con - quest not only of alien institutions , but also of obstacles of remoteness and inaccessibility , the present situation lures us to a sphere of empire differing in kind from all that preceded it .

		They dwell with eloquent words on the barriers of race , of climate , of Old World cabals and armaments .

		But the argument culminates in the thesis that democratic government and colonial administration for inferior races are essentially antagonistic .

		Democracy in its very essentials offers to the world not only freedom but equality ; it knows no dependent classes , no clients ; it dare not withhold from anyone a share in the disposal of his own destiny .

		Colonial government , on the other hand , is the work of a benevolent despotism , and is best administered by an autocracy or an aristocracy witness the colonial history of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and of
Holland	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , it is the work , when not characterized by maladministration , of a trained civil service which has been spe - cialized and made efficient and expert by more than a century of experience with its warning failures and its stimulating successes .

		Such a system must grow on each soil ; it can not be borrowed or imitated .

		The advocate of '' the old ways '' concedes and accepts Mr.
Powers	PERSON	's fruitful thought that we stand but on the highest point of a ris - ing wave : that natural law has expressed itself in a century 's trend .

		But he also suggests that the natural law in the social sphere is but the resultant of multitudinous forces , and of these every man 's opinion is one .

		For thirty years , nearly , before the Civil War , the whole trend in the North seemed to be toward abstention from any meddling with the '' peculiar institu - tion '' ; yet a few '' inspired fools , '' from Garrison to Sumner and Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, set up a small movement which finally mastered and changed the trend and made a stream as wide as the North , on which were borne the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment .

		To-day a class of thoughtful minds , scattered throughout the land , seek to sway and master the trend .

		They point the American people to their true mission , consecrated by a hundred years of historic existence .

		It is to present to the warring Old World a continent over which the
Pax Americana	ORGANIZATION	holds sway ; throughout which a great people have come to realize that the arts of peace are nobler than those of war .

		It is to continue to hold ever before Old World faces the best model of a free government ; one which helped to make the Revolutions of
1789	DATE	and
1848	DATE	, and has brought every nation in
Europe	LOCATION	but
Russia	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	to constitutional government .

		It is to find in the intense indi - vidualism of American life its greatest leverage on the world at large , rather than in any group action .

		They cite the experience of the past and of the ever-living present to assure the trader and the churchman that American goods and American apostles equally are in the fore front of every market and every mission , re - gardless of national boundaries , that indus - trial alertness and missionary ardor are more potent than even '' old Glory . ''

		They ask a nation with such an historic mission and such national characteristics to set their faces calmly against the pleadings of the new imperialism ; to set their allies in
Cuba	LOCATION	and in
the Philippines	LOCATION	on their feet ; to give them the chance that our re - moteness fully as much as our prowess gave us in the days of our Revolution ; and to make them a part of these
United States	LOCATION	only when by their own act they seek it .

		THE DIAL 297 A LATTER-DAY NOVELIST ON DlCKENS .

		* I have labored of late , but without striking success , to establish a parallel between the three chief novelists of fifty years ago and the three chief novelists of to-day , or , at least , English novelists .

		Of course there is no very good reason why eminent masters of fiction should appear by groups of three -LRB- nor , indeed , do they -RRB- , nor why , when they do so appear , they should represent homologous tendencies .

		Still , Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	are on the whole more alike in general spirit and intention than either is like Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	.

		And Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	are more alike , as concerns the topics that preoccupy them , than they are like Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	.

		And Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	is much like
Dickens	PERSON	, of whom he has written a book which is naturally very interesting .

		I admit that there are differences between the author of '' Middlemarch '' and the author of ''
Evelyn Innes	PERSON	. ''

		Both are realists , it is true ; but then , so are many other people .

		The real point of contact is that both are absorbed in questions of conscience .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's books are often thought to be immoral , and
George Eliot	PERSON	's are , on the other hand , very improving .

		But both authors are chiefly inter - ested in the conscience as such ; they consider their characters chiefly as moral agents , and that is not a very usual point of interest .

		Few novelists are natural historians of the con - science : Hawthorne was , but there are not many others .


George Eliot	PERSON	stood alone in that absorption in her time , just as Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	does to-day .

		A case of conscience is enough to interest either of them , without any - thing else .

		Now this is not so with
Thackeray	PERSON	, nor with Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	.

		Neither of these fancy that the world is merely a moral opportunity .

		The world to them is more complex , has many other factors beside the moral factor , other fac - tors quite as interesting ; its people do things without knowing whether they are right or wrong , and without our knowing , either .

		Such as the world is , they intellectualize it ; they see it , or rather they make us see it , in a medium , their medium , of style and way of thought as well ; they exhibit it as indulgent critics or as friendly impresarios ; they stand by you as you are absorbed by the comedy , and sometimes whisper epigrammatic comment on the inside history of the green-room , or they explain why the scenery creaks .

CHARLES DICKENS	PERSON	: A Critical Study .

		By
George Gissing	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is not the case with
Dickens	PERSON	or with Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	.

		Each of these goes , or tries to go , flatfooted down into his world with his photo - graph and phonograph .

		It is true that they are men of very different gifts :
Dickens	PERSON	's gift of humor alone is enough to separate him from Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	in most minds , as well as from anybody else .

		But what is their aim ?

		Dickens 's aim was certainly not merely to be funny : he had some other aim than that .

		If it turn out to be the same as Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's , there is good reason for hoping that the latter will see sympathetically the strong points of his great predecessor .

		This is what we want .

		Dickens 's weak points we are painfully aware of .

		We are so aware of them that we can hardly read his books nowa - days on account of finding nothing to make up to us for the tediousness of his extravagances .

		Yet the average reader , perhaps , would say that no one could understand
Dickens	PERSON	less than the sad-faced and sad-minded Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	.

		I call him sad-faced , because all the pictures I have seen of him -LRB- mostly on the outside of paper editions of his novels -RRB- are sad-faced ; and I call him sad-minded because I have met many who thought his novels very sad .

		I think it was the '' New York Times '' which , in review - ing `` The
Whirlpool	ORGANIZATION	, '' could find no more cheerful expressions in which to characterize it than `` dreary , '' '' uncourageous pessimism , '' `` pitifully shabby , '' `` no attempt at humor , '' '' sluggishness of circulation . '' ''

		His mind , '' says this appreciation , '' is possessed by images of hopeless misery . ''

		How very different from
Dickens	PERSON	, who delighted to fill his mind with imaginations of the most sanguine cheerfulness .

		Yet no one regards
Dickens	PERSON	as merely a cheer - ful humorist .

		He thought of himself certainly as much more , and so do we when we read his books .

		And as a novelist he certainly had dis - tinct aims .

		Nothing would have induced him to write like Disraeli .

		He could not have un - derstood the desire to write like
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		He had his own field . ''

		We must dig deeper , get to untouched social strata , '' says one of Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's char - acters in an early novel . ''

		Dickens felt this , but he had not the courage to face his subjects ; his monthly numbers had to lie on the family tea-table . ''

		We shall probably have our doubts as to the latter part here : it was not so much that
Dickens	PERSON	was afraid to present
Nancy	PERSON	as she really was , as that he habitually thought of her as other than she was .

		But the first part seems to me excellent .

		Dickens labored in untouched 298 THE DIAL -LSB- Nor .

		1 , social strata ; he had love and sympathy for an immense world which had been conceived nn - literary save in ignorant caricatures .

		And herein he resembles Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	, and this gives Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	an advantage in thinking over
Dickens	LOCATION	's work .

		Of course , in another way Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	stands quite apart from
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		He is an Artist in the current sense of the word ; and
Dickens	PERSON	is not , precisely .

		Dickens wrote with much con - sideration , certainly , and remarkably well , too .

		But he , like
Scott	PERSON	, regarded himself rather more as one whose office it was to entertain and amuse the public than as a servant of the rigor - ous mistress raised up by the poets and painters of our day .

		Dickens wrote his novels part by part : he kept his finger on the public pulse to see whether they were popular .

		If the public was dissatisfied , he made a change .

		There is a kind of novel that one meets with now and then -LRB- Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	has written one or two -RRB- in which the first three hundred pages serve chiefly as an introduction to the last chapter .

		These pages are often not very interesting in them - selves , sometimes they are even rather dull .

		But they are necessary ; they make the effect of the last chapter tremendous ; you could n't get such an effect without .

		Of this kind , for instance , are apt to be the novels of
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	.

		This may be called an artistic form : such an effect is to be produced , and it must be produced in a certain way .

		But it is not a conciliatory form of fiction .

		Imagine such a novel coming out , as
Dickens	PERSON	's novels did , in parts .

		The first nineteen parts would wear out the populace ; they never would get to the twentieth , for which all was preparatory .

		Such is rather an exaggerated example of the difference of feeling between the novelist of to-day and the novelist of fifty or sixty years ago .

		Dickens , like
Scott	PERSON	twenty years before him , looked on the public from the standpoint of an * artificer of their pleasures , '' considered himself as one '' catering for public amusement . ''

		Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	would seem to have little regard for the pleasures of the public or their amuse - ment ; his books are to some tedious , to some painful , to others true , to others powerful .

		But Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	, to judge from the general tone of his work , seems to have been influenced very little by public desire : he writes what he calls a good novel , and if the public does not like it , they can do the other thing .

		Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	himself is '' devoted to his art . ''

		With these considerations pro and con as to Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's especial qualifications for the understanding of
Dickens	LOCATION	, we come to his book .

		What will he have to say on one who was not so long ago '' the most popular novelist of the century , one of the greatest humorists that
England	LOCATION	has produced '' ?

		As might be imag - ined , he speaks chiefly of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's characters .

		The reason for this is that Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	is mightily interested in people and in the way to present them in novels .

		He is also interested in the construction of a story ; but he sees at a glance that
Dickens	PERSON	's stories are not well con - structed .

		He is interested in social questions ; but he sees that
Dickens	PERSON	's sociology was too conservative to be now illuminating .

		He is not much of a humorist himself , and he does not , therefore , have much to say of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's hu - mor .

		He is not a great man for style , and he does not , therefore , have much to say of
Dick	PERSON	- ens 's style .

		These four matters he does deal with to some extent , but to them all together he gives rather less attention than to the study of character , and of Realism , which goes along with it .

		All that he says can not be here re - viewed and estimated : one thing must be enough , the great question , indeed , as to
Dickens	LOCATION	, Did he approach Nature in his characterization ?

		Here Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's views are interesting .

		Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	, whose own methods of charac - terization are very different , thinks that
Dick	PERSON	- ens 's figures are not caricatures but idealiza - tions ; and this idealization he approves . ''

		In this idealized portraiture , we have essential truth , '' says he , speaking of Mr.
Micawber	PERSON	, or , rather , of the pre-Australian
Micawber	PERSON	.

		To one who recollects that this essential truth is commonly roseate , this view of the '' pessi - mistic '' Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	should be a revelation .

		Dickens sometimes presents unfavorable ideal - izations like Mr.
Pecksniff	PERSON	; but commonly his idealizations are a compliment to the human race , or at least to the masculine half of it , from one of the keenest of observers .

		For
Dickens	PERSON	was on the better side ; '' he embodied the better dreams of ordinary men . ''

		And this , I suppose , was the reason why he needed the sympathy of his audience , so that he always kept them in mind and so often refined his ideas in order to humor them .

		It is a pleasant conception , and , I think , sound .

		Still , I do not think that people are very fond of this kind of idealization just at the present time .

		Neither does Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	, I imagine , though he does not say so .

		What he does say is that '' so great a change has come over the theory and practise of fiction ...
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		299 that we must treat of
Dickens	LOCATION	as in many respects antiquated . ''

		This states boldly what many people will never have thought of .

		Yet I do not suppose that
Dickens	PERSON	is very much read now ; most people have already read his novels , generally as children , but they do not read them now . '

		Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	, however , has evidently read
Dickens	PERSON	thoroughly and often .

		This book shows a familiarity with
Dickens	PERSON	's works which either indicates severe study or pretty constant re-reading .

		Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	doubt - less has gained something from
Dickens	LOCATION	, although probably not in the way of technique .

		We can not really comment on Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's criticisms ; it must be enough to indicate the general interest of his book .

		Personally , I think it more interesting for the light it throws on Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's own books than for that which it throws on its especial subject .

		But most people , I suppose , will be more interested on account of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		And such will read the book with pleasure , and probably have a higher opinion of
Dickens	PERSON	when they finish than they had when they began .

		THE SUPREMACY OF THE ANGLO-SAXON .

		* The appendix to
M. Edmond Demolins	PERSON	's '' Anglo-Saxon Superiority '' suffices to show the extent of the hubbub this sensational work created in
Paris	LOCATION	upon the occasion of its first appearance , in
April , 1897	DATE	.

		Having attained a tenth edition in
France	LOCATION	, it is now translated into English by
M. Louis Bert	PERSON	.

		Lavigne .

		The work is a polemic , devoted to the maintenance of the thesis that individuality means success in temporal affairs , and collectivity failure , when viewed as national characteristics .


France	LOCATION	is a nation which teaches its people to be inde - pendent in nothing , but rather to look to the state for the most desirable because the most permanent of careers ; while
England	LOCATION	ehcour - ages its subjects to think and act for themselves , and
America	LOCATION	follows the same course , even to turning the management of its affairs over to foreigners , so averse is the Anglo-Saxon ele - ment in the nation to profiting by governmental opportunities .

		Then ,

		which are occupying the earth to the exclusion of all others , it is an easy matter to prove that socialism is the easy descent to Avernus , and individualism a royal road to all manner of prosperity .

		Real prosperity , in the sense of high national character and righteousness , are not touched upon other than incidentally .

		Throughout the book , the welfare of the body is taken as the standard of success .

		Religious differences are rigidly excluded from the dis - cussion .

		It is a matter of sociology and the social instinct .

		To those sincere individualists among the Anglo-Saxons in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	who really hold with the fundamental proposition advanced by
M. Demolins	PERSON	, the work reads un - commonly like a satire .

		The French book was written and published before the Spanish war and the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	incident , both of them adding weight to its contentions , since one makes for Anglo-Saxon predominance and the other for Gallic decadence .

		But if it is true that the Anglo-Saxon stands higher in the world to-day than ever before , is it not also true that the principles of socialism have obtained a footing in the two great English-speaking nations un - known before ?

		M. Demolins takes no account of a host of facts .

		He estimates the growth of socialism in
England	LOCATION	by the success waiting upon the efforts of
William Morris	PERSON	and his associates .

		But what of Lord
Salisbury	PERSON	's dic - tum , '' We are all Socialists now '' ?

		which is something more than a generalization it is a confession .

		And what of the
London	LOCATION
County Council	ORGANIZATION	, and
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and this city and that , with board schools , labor legislation , and the like ?

		And why is the voice of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	raised in a protest against the bland - ishments of collectivism ?

		Is it not because English contemporaneous history in lawmaking reads like a ballade with the refrain , '' And where are the heroes of laissezfaire ? ''

		This being the state of affairs in
Britain	LOCATION	, what of the
United States	LOCATION	?

		From the begin - ning of the republic there had been a political party devoted to the principles of individualism as elementarily needful to the safety of the nation .

		What has become of that party ?

		Opposed to it , under one name or another , was a combination of opportunists who held out more government and more as fundamental to permanence in American domestic affairs .

		So successful has this organization been in its propaganda of governmental aid , rather than self-help , that its tenets have been somewhat expanded and adopted by its former adversary .

		300 THE DIAL -LSB- NOT .

		1 , Instead of a conservative party devoted to the Jeffersonian dictum that '' that nation governs best which governs least , '' opposed by a liberal party which stood for
Federal	ORGANIZATION	aggrandizement at the expense of the
States	LOCATION	, we have now a party devoted to such radical tenets as national expansion at the expense of other peoples on the globe , as taxation for taxation 's sake in the matter of the tariff , as a permanent public debt , as an increased standing army and all the con - comitants of militarism , and pledged to a score of mentionable minor matters which would have appalled the Fathers of the Constitution ; while over against this body of radicals stands an - other who seek such a revision of the Federal Constitution as can be called nothing short of revolutionary , even though it be within the limits of the written law that it intends to make its efforts felt .

		The entire tendency of the Republican party since the death of Lincoln has been socialistic ; the sole purpose of the Democratic party since its capture by the Popu - lists the '' Republicans gone to seed '' of Mr.
Bourke Cockran	PERSON	has been socialistic to a point almost ridiculous .

		And the only indi - vidualists left in the land , to all appearances , are comprised in a little band of '' Jeffersonian anarchists , '' '' voices howling in a wilderness , '' pastors without a flock , teachers without pupils , politicians without a party , almost patriots without a country .

		What , then , becomes of
M. Edmond Demolins	PERSON	and his explanation that really explained ?

		We fear that Anglo-Saxons are successful in spite of socialism , and French - men are not : a reduction of his thesis to an absurdity , if ever there was one .

		THE NEW SCIENCE OP ETHICS .

		* The study of ethics has been carried on very largely by men whose interest was in some form of social utility rather than in science ; hence , the influence of the modern spirit has transformed other humanistic studies before being felt in the sphere of distinctly ethical problems .

		The result is that many who are interested in carrying scientific methods into the study of humanity have been inclined to regard ethics as a mere pathological study .

		ETHICAL SYSTEMS .

Wilhelm Wundt	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Marcaret Floy Waahbnrn	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Maomillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the great importance of ethical problems makes such an attitude necessarily transient .

		Ethics regains something of the central import - ance which was given it in the Greek world , and various attempts are made to determine its sphere and function as a modern science .

		These attempts have been seriously ham - pered by the distorted perspective in which human problems are seen .

		The lower biological world has been widely and deeply studied , while the higher human life has received little scien - tific investigation .

		Thus we are inclined to view human problems largely from the stand - point of forces and tendencies whose main ex - pression is in lower forms of life .

		Yet the laws which are most important in any sphere of life are precisely those which are found only in that sphere .

		To attempt the explanation of biolog - ical problems by the application of the princi - ples of the inorganic world would be no more absurd than to try to interpret human life by applying the more universal biological laws .

		Carrying over generalizations from one field to another , without an independent study of the facts in the new sphere , is as remote from the true method of science as theological specula - tion is from the inductive study of nature .

		Nowhere is this distortion of view more pre - valent or more harmful than in ethics .

		The problems in this field are so peculiarly human that the first requisite to any understanding of them is an independent study of the facts in the history of the human spirit .

		Professor
Wundt	PERSON	's work is not entirely free from this faulty perspective , though there is less of it here than in other recent attempts to make ethics scientific .

		The two volumes which are here admirably translated survey respect - ively the facts of the moral life , and the data of ethical reflection as represented in philosoph - ical systems of ethics .

		Such a descriptive sur - vey is certainly an indispensable preliminary to all theoretical discussion of ethical problems .

		Yet Professor Wundt begins his survey from the point of view that ethics is a '' normative '' science , and so entirely differentiated from positive sciences that limit themselves to the discovery of natural laws .

		He shows how the idea of a norm has passed from ethics over into other sciences and has modified them .

		At the same time he regards this transference as gen - erally questionable , and holds ethics to be the one truly normative science .

		Yet he realizes that ethics has its positive aspects ; and , indeed , he approaches its problems now from the one and now from the other point of view , without at
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301 any time integrating the two .

		The question suggested by this discussion is whether the nor - mative idea in ethics is not a mere inheritance from the speculative period , a tradition from which we find it hard to free ourselves precisely because ethics is the last of the sciences to feel the modern impetus .

		Ethics leads immediately to the art of living the most important of the fine arts ; but it is a question whether the pure science of ethics is concerned with a norm for conduct in any other sense than the pure science of physics is occupied with furnishing norms to the mechanical arts , or than the sci - ence of botany is concerned with giving laws to horticulture .

		The effect of the point of view which Pro- fessor Wundt assumes is less important in these two volumes than in the third portion of the German work in which the statement of his own view is given .

		Yet his fundamental attitude can not fail to modify his account of the data of the moral life as well as his discussion of the history of ethical theory .

		On the other hand , he has the merit of uniting with severe scien - tific training the reflective insight that comes from a deep study of the history of philosophy and particularly from thorough familiarity with
Kant	PERSON	.

		If this may partially account for the prejudicing of his point of view , it makes him more open to peculiarly human facts and prob - lems than is true of most efforts to make ethics scientific .

		Again , it enables him to see over the more superficial utilitarian views which have accompanied the modern development of English ethics .

		The chief value of the anthropological vol - ume is in the range of facts cited .

		There is but little effort or ability to focus the facts and indicate their significance .

		The main idea which prevails throughout is that of the early dependence of moral facts upon religion , and their slow differentiation from the latter .

		The wealth of anthropological illustration grows rather tiresome from the absence of artistic power in its presentation .

		The second volume furnishes a very readable review of the progress of ethical philosophy .

		The point of view , differing so substantially from that present in English books discussing the same material , gives a peculiar freshness and suggestiveness to the treatment .

		As the clue to the author 's own view is given in the first volume through the introductory chapter , so in the second volume it is the concluding general criticism of ethical systems which has greatest interest .

		One closes the book with a very mingled feeling : the admiration for its suggestiveuess and occasional largeness of view is accompanied with regret that the author , having gone so far in emancipating himself from the traditional view of ethics and in lifting it to the plane of a science , should not have gone one step further .

		802 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, matter for experimentation betrays no feeling in the presence of all these quivering nerves .

		The De - stroyer is Love , working upon a group of unbal - anced natures , and bringing one life after another to shipwreck .

		A book at once so unpleasant and so powerful is not often met with , although The Tor - mentor '' in a measure prepared us for it .

		Mr.
Swift	PERSON	's style is Meredithian in its turn of phrase , but less tortuously involved than that of his master .

		One would like to forget his books after reading them , but the thing is impossible . ''

		Scribes and Pharisees '' purports to be '' a story of literary
London	LOCATION	, '' but the description is hardly justified .

		The hero , it is true , after a career in the
Latin Quarter of Paris	LOCATION	, returns home across the Channel , and works his way through provincial jour - nalism into some sort of repute as a man of letters , but the story is really that of the miserable failure of his own private life rather than of the typical conditions of the literary life , in
London	LOCATION	or else - where .

		Its text may be taken from the book itself . ''

		To the pressman , as to many others , the life of the writer of fiction is believed to be an ideal exist - ence .

		In few cases , perhaps it is , but in the majority , even the popular novelist , whose name is on everyone 's lips , and whose doings and sayings are chronicled in every newspaper up and down the Kingdom , has his skeleton in the cupboard . ''

		From this sentence it will be seen that Mr.
Le Queux	PERSON	has no style worth mentioning ; it may also be inferred that he has become somewhat embittered by the accidents of his calling .

		There is not much of '' literary
London	LOCATION	'' in his book , but there is a good deal of life in its more clouded aspects , besides an infusion of melodrama . ''

		By Order of the Magistrate '' is the story of a girl called Mordemly .

		She is a product of the Lon - don slums , and the mystery of her name is not solved until we have given up puzzling over it .

		When we learn that it is merely a corruption of
Maud Emily	PERSON	we rather resent the intrusion of the conven - tional cognomen , so accustomed have we grown to the phonetic spelling .

		As a rule , slum stories are depressing , if not flatly unreadable .

		This one is neither the one nor the other , because , in the first place , it does not single out sensational incidents for treatment , and , in the second , it tells a frank tale of the development of wholesome character under unfavorable circumstances .

		Mordemly is so vital a figure that she has our sympathetic interest from the start , and even her dialect is acceptable , since we feel that her story is not told for its sake , but that it is merely one of the conditions necessary for the delineation of her character .

		The book is a faithful study of a phase of low life ; the author 's eye is constantly fixed upon his object , and the re - sult , while not in any way startling , has the effect of a piece of work carefully and faithfully done .

		In writing The Queen 's Cup , '' Mr. 6 .


A. Henty	PERSON	has , for the moment , turned aside from his audience of boys to address their elders .

		He has produced an entertaining story of love and adventure in which those very qualities of simplicity and directness that have made him so successful a writer for the young appear to excellent advantage , and make us wish that others of our novelists might have the advant - age of a similar discipline .

		Perhaps the t 's are crossed a trifle more carefully than they need be , but straightforwardness and lucidity are of the prime virtues of fiction , and we would rather have them in exaggerated form than miss them altogether .

		There is little to say of The Lust of Hate '' be - yond mentioning the fact that our old friend Dr.
Nikola	PERSON	figures once more , quite as mysterious a vil - lain as ever , and that the story begins in
Australia	LOCATION	, ends in
South Africa	LOCATION	, and has a shipwreck and desert island episode by way of interlude .

		It is ingeniously contrived , and quite as melodramatic as Mr.
Boothby	PERSON	's earlier novels .

		In '' The Iron Cross , '' by Mr.
Robert H. Sherard	PERSON	, we have a story of considerable originality and suc - cess in the narrating .

		A young Englishman sojourn - ing in the
Landes	LOCATION	, comes upon the track of a kins - man who has fought in the Peninsular War , and into possession of a much-venerated relic which he had stolen from a Spanish church and concealed in the village where he had taken refuge and died .

		How the young Englishman falls in love with a fair Spanish maiden , how he obtains possession of the relic and learns of its value , and how , in restoring it to
Cartnela	LOCATION	, he restores her own happiness at the cost of his own all these things are set forth most attractively in this distinctly interesting story .

		The Romance of a Midshipman '' is welcome to lovers of wholesome sea stories , as , indeed , are all the many books of Mr.
W. Clark Russell	PERSON	.

		He does not seem to write himself out , in spite of his indus - try , and somehow finds fresh material , at least in part , for every new story .

		The material is far fetched at times , a fact witnessed by the story now before us , which , besides the familiar incidents of storm and shipwreck , desolate reef and providential rescue , provides us with at least two novelties a derelict ship with a cargo of wild beasts , and a floating island of driftwood in the midst of which is imbedded a yacht in prime condition , all supplied with fresh provisions .

		The '' Romance '' begins in
France	LOCATION	, on the coast betwixt
Brest	LOCATION	and placid old
Calais	LOCATION	, '' where the hero was born of English parents , where he goes to school , and whence he runs off to sea .

		This boyish part of his life is quite as interesting as what comes afterwards , and suggests a comparison with the school and the schoolboy of Du Maurier 's '' Martian . ''

		The hero is , however , hardly more than a boy when we take leave of him , romantically and happily married , and having wisely resolved to exchange the sailor 's life for the landsman 's .

		It is hinted by the publishers that Mr.
Russell	PERSON	has put not a little autobiography into thin interesting book , which again suggests the comparison with '' The Martian , '' as far as the early chapters are concerned .

		Mr.
Owen Rhoscomyl	PERSON	, in '' The Lady of
Castell March	PERSON	, '' gives the following directions for under - standing the historical environment of the period
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 803 of which he writes : '' Let -LSB- the reader -RSB- take all that he has read about the Highlands under the clan system , about the
Scottish Borders	ORGANIZATION	in the old days of the Raiders , and about the
Ireland	LOCATION	of the Pale .

		To these add something which outdid them all as fostering turbulence ; namely , the
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	'
Lordships Marcher	PERSON	' which for centuries wielded the chief influ - ence over the English crown on the one hand and the fortunes of
Ireland	LOCATION	on the other ; making always for the profit of the strong hand .

		Shake all these together into inextricable confusion and the result will give some idea of the
Wales	LOCATION	of Tudor times . ''

		There is no doubt about the '' inextricable confusion , '' at least , and we must make complaint of this , as of Mr.
Rhoscomyl	PERSON	's two earlier novels , that the confusion has passed over from the history , where it belongs , to the work of art based upon these materials , where it undoubtedly does not belong .

		We defy the most careful reader to get a clear notion of the complicated relationships of this romance , or to fix the scenes of its wild fighting and hairbreadth escapes in the mental vision .

		All that can be won by the most patient effort is the spectacle of a phantasmagoria of turbulence , from which shadowy figures emerge from time to time , but which is merely bewildering in general effect .

		The skele - ton of the romance is of a familiar sort .

		There is a stout and youthful hero , scorned by the high - born maiden whose knight he becomes , yet who per - sists in encountering great perils in her service .

		He is , of course , rewarded at last , and her maiden pride melts into submission when it is time for the story to end .

		But there is no psychological ground for her conduct , and she is even less of a rational being than is usual with heroines of her type .

		The story is exciting enough , even if it carries Celtic vagueness to an extreme , and its archaism of manner is skilfully consistent . ''

		To Arms ! ''

		by Mr.
Andrew Balfour	PERSON	, is a semi - historical romance of the eighteenth century , having a young Scotch surgeon for hero , and
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	for chief scenes of action .

		From the borderland farmstead where the boy is reared to the
Bastille	LOCATION	whither his strange adventures lead him is a far cry , and the way is filled with surprising adventures .

		John Law is the only historical char - acter of whom anything like a full-length portrait is attempted .

		The story is long drawn out , and almost wearisome in parts , so garrulous does the narrator grow , but the interest quickens every now and then , and helps the reader to persevere through the nearly six hundred pages . ''


John Burnet	PERSON	of Barns '' is a story of romantic adventure in
Scotland	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	during the years just preceding the English Revolution .

		There is a moderate amount of Scots in the language em - ployed , but it is not broad enough to make reading difficult , and the narrative flows with even current to a satisfactory ending .

		There is a scholarly flavor about this book which sets it upon a higher plane than most of its kind .

		Yet there is also no lack of exciting incidents and bloody encounters .

		The story is told in the familiar reminiscent fashion , a harmless affect - ation , albeit one that has been employed quite enough .

		Mr.
Victor Waite	PERSON	's `` Cross Trails '' is a story of adventure pure and simple , being quite inno - cent of style and devoid of literary architecture .

		Half of it is in
South America	LOCATION	, and the other half in
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		The hero is a despicable creature , but his adventures are exciting enough , in all conscience , and they follow thick and fast one upon another .

		The mainspring of the action is the hackneyed device of an ancient manuscript giving indications of a hidden Spanish treasure , but we do not have even the mild satisfaction of unearthing the treasure at the end , which is a sad disappointment .

		The author seems to know the two countries of which he writes , and this is something to his credit . ''

		The Adventures of Captain Kettle '' are epis - odical stories united into a sort of novel by the personality of their hero , and by the occasional reappearance of a few other people .

		The doughty Captain of these adventures is a carefully studied type of the sea hero , most of the time '' down on his luck '' and consequently ready for all sorts of desper - ate ventures , bold and resourceful in emergencies , and given to writing poetry for a diversion , unscru - pulous at sea , and a model husband and chapel-goer at home .

		His adventures are in many parts of the world , from
Cuba	LOCATION	to
Japan	LOCATION	, and there is no reason why the writer should not have many more of them to tell , as we sincerely hope he has . ''

		Prisoners of Hope '' is an engaging title for a romance , and awakens a pleasurable anticipation in the approach .

		It does not take long for the reader to find his anticipations more than realized , for , as the story develops , it rises so far above its class as to occupy an almost unique position .

		We have had many romances of colonial
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the chief impression produced by them has been that of wonder at their inadequate use of the rich material available .

		It would seem that the example of Thack - eray should have established a standard toward which at least some approach might be made by those following in his footsteps .

		But '' The Virgin - ians '' has had no successor , until the story now before us , that has not seemed pitifully bare and inadequate .

		We have no intention of ranking the present pro- duction with '' The Virginians , '' but we do not hesi - tate to assert that no previous romance of American origin dealing with the subject has equalled it in firmness of handling , in literary and constructive art , or in romantic interest of the finer sort .

		The '' prisoners of hope '' are the '' redemptioners '' of the Restoration , that strange commingling of felons with high-minded gentlemen sold into temporary slavery upon the Plantations .

		Jail-birds from New - gate were shipped to
Virginia	LOCATION	in company with austere and fanatical Cromwellians and victims of the Act of Uniformity , and all were subjected to the same harsh treatment at the hands of their masters .

		Miss
Johnston	PERSON	has taken for her hero 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, a young soldier of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, condemned to servitude for a crime of which he is innocent , who becomes the leader in an uprising which has for its object the establishment of a new Common - wealth in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		The revolt is made futile through treachery , but the hero is placed in a position to perform striking acts of heroism for his master , and to win his respect and gratitude in the face of fearful adverse presumptions .

		More than this , he wins the love of his master 's daughter , for he rescues her from deadly peril upon more than one occasion , and finally wrests her from Indian captivity under circumstances as thrilling as any that were imagined by
Cooper	PERSON	.

		The story of the long search for the captive girl , and the still longer journey with her through the wilderness and back to civilization , is one of the most effective things of the sort with which we are acquainted , and the final tragic separation of the lovers , necessary though it be from the artistic standpoint , comes as near to being heart-breaking in its pathos as any thing that is often met with in romance .

		It is
Cooper	PERSON	over again as to adventure , and has , besides , a literary grace that was beyond
Cooper	PERSON	's reach .

		The minor characters are also admirably portrayed the Vir - ginian planter , the court gallant who wooes his daugh - ter and turns out a finer gentleman than his affected foppishness would seem to indicate , the stern Olive - nans and the Muggletonian fanatics all are deline - ated with a skill that comes near to being masterly , while the figure of
Governor Berkeley	LOCATION	is for the first time made actually to live in a work of fiction a feat often attempted , but never , to our recollection , before accomplished .

		Miss
Johnston	PERSON	is , as far as we know , a new writer , and if this be indeed her first book , it is a performance that is remarkable in itself , and that promises much for the future of American historical fiction . ''

		A Romance of Summer Seas , '' the second work of fiction published by
Miss Varina Davis	PERSON	, is a dis - tinctly interesting and almost strong piece of work .

		The action occurs on a P. and O. steamer , and in
Hong Kong	LOCATION	and
Yokohama	LOCATION	.

		The heroine is a slip of a girl , the daughter of an Englishman living in
Fenang	LOCATION	, sent on a voyage in search of health under the protection of an old friend of the family .

		She is hardly more than a child , and both she and her protector are too innocent to imagine that anyone will think evil of their innocent relationship .

		But they reckon without the evil tongues of a scandal - loving ship 's company , and before the voyage is many days old , they find themselves objects of sus - picion , and very ugly complications follow .

		Later on , there is a duel , and the story ends with the mar - riage of the girl and her guardian .

		So much for the story proper , but the book is more than a story .

		It is a delineation of life , made possible by a gen - uine gift for characterization and made vivid by many deft touches based upon actual experience of the scenes and situations described .

		There is no doubt of the individuality of each of the half dozen persons chiefly concerned , and the account of their relations with one another has both variety and animation . ''

		Ye Ly tile Salem Maide '' is a prettily artificial story of the witchcraft terror in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		As a novel it has little to recommend it , for it is weak in both plot and characterization .

		But it is written so charmingly , and has so winsome a childish hero - ine , that its reading brings a certain pleasure , aside from the instruction afforded .

		While making no pretensions to historical scholarship , it does display a close study of Puritan manners and modes of liv - ing , and brings before us in a rather impressive way the figure of the young
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	, besides giving thumb-nail sketches of Judge
Sewall	PERSON	and Sir
William Phipps	PERSON	.

		Miss
Marshall Sannders	ORGANIZATION	, in her Acadian story entitled '' Rose a Charlitte , '' has chosen a track almost unbeaten by the novelist , and given us a faithfully-studied and charming picture of the
Land of Evangeline	ORGANIZATION	and its people .

		She tells of a young Bostonian , who goes to
Acadia	ORGANIZATION	in the hope of right - ing a wrong done by one of his forefathers to a victim of the expulsion , and who not only accom - plishes his purpose , as far as that is humanly possi - ble , but finds his own happiness , although long - delayed , as well .

		Rose a Cbarlitte is one of the most gracious women who are often met with in romance , a creature of ideal purity and charm , un - touched by the stain of the modern world , whose placid soul , made even more beautiful by the chast - ening of adversity , is sharply contrasted with the nervous and anaemic types of womanhood who figure as the heroines of most of our recent novels .

		The story exhibits but little constructive art , and its texture is almost as decoitsu as the speech of the simple Acadian folk who people its pages , but it pictures a race and a mode of life that are almost unknown to us , although so easy of access , and the final impression left by it is one of sweetness in the sentiment and conscientiousness in the portrayal .

		In naming her latest novel '' Good Americans , '' Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	doubtless wished to convey a mildly satirical suggestion , since only one of her characters can be taken as literally answering to that description .

		The others are of the useless and aimless class of those whose lives are a mockery of every worthy American ideal , the class that styles itself society '' in our larger cities , and brings con - tempt upon the American character .

		But Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	is of too kindly a nature to be satirical otherwise than by suggestion , and it is to be feared that the doings of the fashionable world are taken by her rather too seriously , in spite of her sympathy for what is simple and good in human nature .

		Her book has the grace that comes from long practise in entertaining writing , and she moves easily about in the world of dining , and yachting , and foreign travelling , and pleasure-seeking which she knows so intimately .

		Now this world of petty ambitions and empty occupations can not possibly have other than an artificial interest for any earnest person , and , consequently , such a novel as this can not be any -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 thing but trivial and superficial .

		It is the best tribute to Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's skill to say that she does her work so well that fair entertainment is made out of these unpromising materials .

		`` The Californians '' is a book that attracts , although it is disfigured by cynicism , melodrama , and various vulgarities in both thought and expres - sion .

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	is not likely ever to acquire a refined style , and such phrases as ''
Helena	PERSON	was back '' and '' His soul grinned '' will continue to set her readers ' teeth on edge , no matter how many more books she may write .

		But she imparts to her narra - tive a sense of the exuberant spirit and crude civiliza - tion of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, and her Californians are studied from the life .

		They are not a very agree - able lot , and the Spanish-American girl
Magdalena	PERSON	is the only one that appears to be delineated with real insight .

		Still , such books are documents in the history of culture , and have the value of all writing that is done with the eye upon the object .

		We might make much the same sort of general comment upon '' The Money Captain , '' only we should be constrained to add that the writer has a true sense of the demands of style , and , if he does not frequently achieve ease and grace , is evidently striv - ing after these qualities , and may discover their secret in time .

		This is but the second novel of an unques - tionably talented writer , and is , we think , an improve - ment upon his first , although he has not yet realized his artistic consciousness .

		It is a storyof a very sordid kind of life , the life that centres about stockbrokers and speculators and fortunes both made and used unscrupulously .

		The '' money captain '' so merci - lessly delineated in these pages is a figure only too familiar to our American life in its larger aggrega - tions , and readers in
New York	LOCATION	or
Philadelphia	LOCATION	will find it quite as easy as readers in
Chicago	LOCATION	-LRB- where the scene is laid -RRB- find it to fit the description to some notorious corrupter of men and manipulator of com - mercial forces .

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	displays in his story the instinct of the practised journalist rather than that of the writer whose aim is above all else artistic ; this fact , taken together with his inherently disagree - able theme , prevents '' The Money Captain '' from being a pleasant story to read , in spite of its shrewd - ness of observation and skilfully-managed plot .

		The politics of an episcopal election , and the soul - stirrings of two young men who discover , after vow - ing themselves to the religious life , that the fluid in their veins is blood and not water , are the chief themes of Mr.
Arlo Bates	PERSON	in his latest novel .

		The matter is not very exciting at best , and outsiders can not be expected to take more than a languid inter - est in the factional differences to be found within the limits of one of the Christian sects , or even in the question of clerical celibacy , burning as that question becomes to the two young men here concerned .

		One of them breaks from the theological tangle altogether and becomes a natural man before it is too late ; the other perseveres in his mysticism and carries it to the only logical conclusion .

		Mr.
Bates	PERSON	calls this book `` The Puritans , '' because he finds in the puritan inheritance the secret of the spiritual stress that makes his young men take life so very hard , and even of the intellectual restlessness that drives his other Bostonians to such forms of debauchery as spiritualism , and '' Christian science , '' and interest in Oriental cults .

		As a study of certain types of
New England	LOCATION	society , and even of certain undercurrents in
New England	LOCATION	thought , the book is a conscientiously put together piece of workmanship , but the breath of life is not in it , and the author 's ambition has so clearly gone beyond his achievement that the final word of our criticism must be failure that is , the relative failure that does not preclude a considerable measure of thoughtful writing and literary skill .

		We shall be much surprised if Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	's story , '' In the Sargasso Sea , '' does not at once leap into boyish favor , and win a place among the books of adventure best beloved by the young .

		It seems to us almost as good as `` Treasure Island , '' and good in the same way , for both old and young .

		It gives us adventure pure and simple , without admix - ture of love or other adventitious sentiment , and deals wholly with the strange experiences of the one character who tells the story .

		How he embarks for
Africa	LOCATION	upon a slaver , is thrown overboard because he knows too much , is picked up by an English steamer , is wrecked in the
Sargasso Sea	LOCATION	, finds refuge among the derelicts that cluster there , works his way from hulk to hulk until he finds a Spanish treasure-galleon , and then , laden with precious stones , makes his way back to civilization , all these things , and many more , are related in a way at once matter-of-fact and romantic , calculated to delight boys of all ages and win a host of devoted readers .

		The
Sargasso Sea	ORGANIZATION	is almost a new field for the imagination of the story-writer , although some older readers will remember Mr.
Theodore Tilton	PERSON	's '' Tempest Tossed , '' published a quarter of a century ago , and embodying the same general situation .

		Another story of adventure in which boys will delight is called '' Four for a Fortune , '' and tells of the discovery of a treasure-hoard upon the French island of
St. Pierre	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is the usual chart , mys - teriously brought to light and deciphered with diffi - culty , there are the usual obstacles in the way of the search , and there is the usual villain who attempts to murder his companions and gain the booty all for himself .

		But we can not become reconciled to the subsequent sinking of the boat that bears away the gold so hardly won , and the return of the finders empty-handed to
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		The Grenadier '' is a story of the Napoleonic wars from the
Peninsula	LOCATION	to
Waterloo	LOCATION	, and has for its hero a soldier of the Old Guard who typifies the old-fashioned sort of hero-worship of which the Corsican brigand was so long the object .

		This atti - tude toward the Emperor is a good deal belated , now that a rich collection of memoirs and other his - torical material is accessible to everybody , making clear enough to all but the wilfully blind how essen - tially despicable was the character of
Napoleon	PERSON	and how unprincipled were his ambitions .

		For the rest , 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, Mr.
Farmer	PERSON	's romance is interestingly written , although it is overloaded with a large amount of strategic military detail that might well be spared from a work designed for entertainment .

		The author of The Final War '' and '' An Amer - ican Emperor '' has just made a third appearance in the field of anticipatory historical fiction with '' The Lost Provinces , '' which is a sequel to the second of the books above named .


France	LOCATION	is again plunged into war by the provocation of the German Em - peror , and the puppet King
Henry V.	PERSON	calls upon Vansittart for help .

		This resourceful American promptly responds to the appeal , takes command of the French armies , and , on the very ground of the battles of
1870	DATE	, reverses the tragedy of Sedan , win - ning back for
France	LOCATION	both her prestige and her provinces .

		At the same time a new Commune arises and has to be suppressed , to which task also the ingen - ious
Vansittart	ORGANIZATION	is easily equal .

		The story makes no pretensions to literary form , and is rather disjointed in structure , but of its absorbing interest there can be no doubt .

		In its way , it is almost brilliant at times , and one or two of its episodes are worthy of the arch - magician of historical romance who created
Monte Cristo	ORGANIZATION	and Artagnan .

MORTON PAYNK	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		or vhinu t Anything which naturally calls up general discussion is apt to lose a little in intrinsic interest .

		Such is the for - tune , with us , of Mr.
Louis J. Block	PERSON	's '' Capriccios '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Mr.
Block	PERSON	has here chosen dramatic form , has written prose dialogues imaginary conversa - tions we might call them , although the first is of con - siderable length and in several scenes .

		Now the dramatic form is apt to arouse the worst passions of some people , and even with ourselves it induces a disputatious mood foreign to the enjoyment of high poetry .

		We do not , it is true , think it a crime to use dramatic form for matters which can never see the stage .

		We think that
Browning	PERSON	did well to write monologues , that
Landor	PERSON	did well to write conver - sations , and that
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, in writing plays that can never succeed on our stage , did as well as
M. Rostand	PERSON	did in writing a play that can succeed .

		So we do not think that Mr.
Block	PERSON	is blameworthy in seeking to convey his philosophy and his poetry in dramatic form , even though his scenes were never meant to be acted .

		No , we question the form for another reason .

		We have seen different opinions as to the meaning of the word '' dramatic . ''

		We have ours , which need not be mentioned here ; in it , as in all other such opinions , there is recognition of the necessity of characters , actors , persons .

		Browning , in My Last Duchess , '' must have had an almost visual realization of the Duke ;
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, in present - ing Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	and
Home Tooke	PERSON	, had the antago - nists in mind quite as much as the antique philological speculations .

		And
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	conceives his ideas in the form of people as obviously as
M. Rostand	PERSON	con - ceives his people in idealistic form .

		Now we can not think that Mr.
Block	PERSON	does conceive his ideas in per - sonal form : we think he has the ideas himself first , and then thinks of people who are to have them .

		Take , for instance , the four well-distinguished types of thought in '' Myriad-Minded Man . ''

		There are four philosophies , but no philosophers at all .

		Or take
Faust	LOCATION	between
Raphael	PERSON	and Mephistopheles : one thinks , perhaps , of `` Manfred , '' but if so , what a difference in character .

		In short , Mr.
Block	PERSON	had here a fancy , a caprice ; he thought he would try his hand at a new form .

		This is the right of a man who has already won the consideration of his readers .

		But we rather regret the experiment , for we think that much high thought and feeling has here gone into an uncongenial form with an unsatisfactory result , which might have delighted us were it more naturally and therefore more harmoniously expressed .

		CuHotUiet of Replete with matters of the first liter - native literature ary importance to Americans , and bar - Arty ytari ago .

		ren Q f
Ifo	ORGANIZATION	^ y f orm ^ a point a l mO st incredible , are the '' Passages from the Correspond - ence and other
Papers of Ruf	ORGANIZATION	us
W. Griswold	PERSON	, '' edited , annotated , and published by his son , Mr.
William M. Griswold	PERSON	.

		From one cover to the other the work abounds in the most fascinating revelations of the per - sonalities which made up the American world of let - ters in the ` forties and ` fifties ; letters , notes , auto - biographies , confessions , self-laudations , wails of despairing and neglected geniuses now forgotten , in brief , all the curiosities of literature which the fore - most critical writer of an interesting period might be expected to accumulate during his life-time .

		Not let - ters alone but the early journalism is given us in what scientists call '' preparations '' innumerable , notes from
Greeley	PERSON	and
Raymond	PERSON	, and correspondence with half the magazine editors in the country , the whole forming a collection quite without parallel .

		There is , inevitably , a belated revival of the contro - versy over Poe which we hoped had been settled long ago .

		The younger
Griswold	PERSON	is not satisfied with leaving his father in the right so far as truthfulness is concerned , but wishes the literary reputation of Poe revised to suit the life he lived without his art .

		Can it not be learned that the worse
Poe	PERSON	is made to appear as a man the more he entitles himself to our charitable sympathy as an artist ?

		This is the worst blot on Mr.
Griswold	PERSON	's work in matters of taste .

		But in matters of form the editor has adopted the exas - perating plan of commenting on the text of the let - ters preliminary to quoting from them , which keeps the reader somersaulting throughout the book , habit insisting upon connecting the comment with the let - ter preceding rather than following .

		And the dia - critical marks imposed upon the unfortunate letter o , '' with other typographical and orthographical vagaries , are maddening , nothing less .

		Mr.
Griswold	PERSON	forgot , apparently , that the book was to be read by others .

		THE DIAL 307 Colonial expansion on English models .

		Thoughtful Americans , still halting between two opinions as to the great question of the hour touching our policy in regard to possible future transmarine possessions or dependencies , will find much to interest them in Mr.
Benjamin Kidd	PERSON	's essay on '' The Control of the Tropics '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Besides the essay from which the little book takes its title , the tenth chapter of the author 's widely read work on '' Social Evolu - tion '' is given , the whole forming a booklet of one hundred pages .

		Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	's argument is somewhat elaborate , and justice can not be done to it in our limited space .

		His main conclusion is that as it is the manifest destiny of the tropics to be eventually controlled and administered from the temperate regions , it is hence the manifest duty of the English - speaking peoples to so act now -LRB- '' with clear purpose and with courage '' -RRB- that this eventual control and administration shall conform to English rather than continental standards of colonial policy .

		Tropical countries , he argues , should be held in the future as a trust for civilization , and not , as they usually have been in the past , as estates or '' plantations '' to be worked for the exclusive profit of their custodians .

		England 's administration of
India	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	is plainly the model Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	would hold up for gen - eral imitation .

		To American minds of the '' expan - sive '' type , Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	's pamphlet will probably open out an alluring vision of the future paramountcy of this country in the tropical regions of Central and
South America	LOCATION	, which are now parcelled out into purely nominal '' republics , '' and whose vast resour - ces are running to waste in hands incapable of develop - ing them .

		But will protectionist
America	LOCATION	, in that great day , suddenly awaken to the broader advan - tages of '' the open door '' ?

		In
1865	DATE	, at a Newspaper Press Fund had left the reporter 's gallery thirty years before , he had never '' forgotten the fascina - tion of the old pursuit . ''

		That this should have been so was most natural ; in some important respects
Dickens	PERSON	was essentially a journalist from the begin - ning of his life to the end of it .

		Not because his books were generally published periodically , nor because he spent much time in editing '' Household Words '' and '' All The Year Round , '' nor because throughout his life he had some connection with the press .

		Rather because his literary disposition was that of the journalist .

		He felt the need of being close to his public , of keeping in touch with those for whom he wrote , of feeling their mood , their temper .

		This was one of the reasons why he liked to publish his novels in parts .

		He could see how they went .

		This was one of the reasons why he was so strongly and so fatally drawn to his Readings .

		This is the reason why , in his development of story and of character , he so constantly considers how it will seem to his readers .

		Most of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's actual jour - nalism was the work of a shorthand reporter , and left nothing original as a result .

		But of his sub - sequent journalistic work the recently published `` Old Lamps for New Ones '' -LRB-
New Amsterdam Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by
Frederick G. Kitton	PERSON	, gives excellent example .

		It contains about half a hundred '' essays , reviews , and other papers , here collected for the first time . ''

		These papers are from many sources , the '' Examiner '' and the '' Daily News '' and the '' Morning Chronicle , '' the magazines that
Dickens	PERSON	edited himself , and other places .

		We think it extra - ordinary that the editor did not note concerning each article the paper or magazine in which it appeared .

		But he did not do so , and the value of the book is thus very seriously impaired ; for it comes down to the intrinsic value of the productions in question , and the fact that they were written by
Charles Dickens	PERSON	.

		Intrinsically some of these papers are extremely good , some not so valuable .

		But they are most significant as being by
Dickens	LOCATION	; they are capital examples of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's journalistic temper applied to the ordinary topics of journalism .

		Thus , the article which gives title to the collection , written at the acme of
Dickens	PERSON	's power , holds the Preraphae - lites up to ridicule with the same sympathy with current feeling on the subject that the most ephem - eral penny-a-liner would have had .

		Not that
Dickens	PERSON	slavishly followed popular taste -LRB- or that journalists do either , for that matter -RRB- ; he has the same percep - tion of popular feeling when he writes of something that is not popular , as , for instance , Capital Pun - ishment or Ragged Schools .

		We think that the book makes us understand
Dickens	PERSON	better .

		From this point of view it is extremely interesting ; but how much more interesting it would have been -LRB- and use - ful to the student -RRB- if Mr.
Kitton	PERSON	had assumed more of the duties of an editor .

		`` Democracy < ^ ne nee < ^ ^ a new English edition in
America	LOCATION	'' of De Tocqueville 's `` Democracy in in new S etimg .

		America '' has been well supplied by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Reeve 's translation , as revised and annotated from the author 's last edition , has been used , and President
Daniel C. Oilman	PERSON	, of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, is the editor .

		De Tocqueville 's speech foretelling the Revolution of
1848	DATE	, his essay on Swiss Democracy , and Dr.
Bowen	PERSON	's biographical sketch have been retained .

		There is a portrait of the author , a Bibliographical Note , and , we are glad to say , a good Index .

		The helpful Introduction by President Oilman lends the requisite element of com - pleteness to this well planned edition .

		Social and political conditions in this country have changed in some important respects since De Toequeville wrote ; but the value of his treatise is in the main unim - paired .

		It is , and will remain , one of the great classics of political philosophy , for it is philosophy rather than description that De Toequeville gives us .

		Herein he differs from Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, and hereby , we venture to say , his work is likely to outlive that excellent and as yet indispensable account of our existing institutions and current characteristics , '' The American Commonwealth . ''

		De Tocqueville 's book bears the impress of a mind of a peculiar 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, cast , of a unique talent , a rare individuality .

		In a word , it is a work of genius .

		The best that is in it is something other and rarer than the fruit of toil and scholarship , of close observation and temperate judgment , though in the marks of these useful qualities , too , it is eminently rich .

		Another
Bryce	PERSON	, another
Bodley	PERSON	, perhaps another
Lecky	PERSON	, we can readily imagine coming on occasion to the aid of the student of political institutions .

Montes	PERSON	- quieu , a second De Tocqueville , the world is not likely to see .

		Of De Tocqueville 's ``
America	LOCATION	'' Professor
Blackie	PERSON	said : '' Next to
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's Poli - tics , I account this the most valuable political book in my library '' ; and this judgment fairly indicates the rank of the book in literature .

		In reprinting it in the form needed by students of to-day , the pub - lishers have rendered a public service .

		No intelli - gent American can rise from its perusal without being a sounder patriot , a wiser citizen , and a firmer believer in the doctrine that government by the people for the people , under whatever outward form or manifestation , is the government of civilization that came in with civilization and will perish only with civilization .

		Dismal speculations now current as to the duration of popular government seem futile enough .

		It will endure , under one form or other , as long as Western civilization endures .

		It is not possible to seriously imagine a people of high aver - age intelligence living permanently under a polity which denied them the controlling voice in the conduct of their public as well as private affairs .

		Democracy is a phase of human development .

		Readers of THE DIAL are familiar w * tk tne critical writings of Mr.
Hiram M. Stanley	PERSON	, and will wel - come the appearance of them in book form under the title of '' Essays on Literary Art '' -LRB-
Swan Sonnen	PERSON	- schein
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The wide reading , the fine discernment , the accurate scholarship with which Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	has successfully associated his name , may here be seen and enjoyed .

		Especially sugges - tive is the concluding paper on '' The Secret of Style , '' which adds the weight of literary authority to the scientific analysis of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, though we should have liked to see something specific of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's essay on style .

		We detect a nod of the critic in the '' Thoughts on English Love - Song '' where he says : '' It is a long leap from the
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethans to Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, but the interim contains no love sonnet of any great merit , with the possi - ble exception of
Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	's ' To a Lofty Beauty ' '' .

		Surely we are , then , to read Jacobeans for Elizabethans , or disregard the beauties of Drum - mond of
Hawthorden	LOCATION	; while
Keats	PERSON	's `` The day is gone , and all its sweets are gone , '' is but one of several which suggest themselves in preference to
Hartley Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's , which , after all , is chiefly suggestive of filial love .

		Notably neglected is '' The Traveller and hi * Wife 's Ringlet '' of -LRB-
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Turner	PERSON	, and the charming u Love 's Anniversary '' of Habing - ton as well , which our critic rates much too low ; while all the epithalamia are omitted from consider - ation , strangely enough .

		Nor does the statementthat '' we look in vain for it -LSB- the true lyric love-note -RSB- in any measure in
Robert Browning	PERSON	'' seem well con - sidered in the face of ''
Summum Bonum	PERSON	, '' One Pearl , One Girl , '' and a number of longer songs of perfect charm .

		Still , these are minor matters .

		TheraMxne Uritieut .

		The Polychrome Bible -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is called to our attention again by the appearance of
Leviticus	LOCATION	, the fourth volume issued .

		This part is edited by Prof.
S. R. Driver	PERSON	, of
Oxford	LOCATION	, assisted by the Rev.
H. A. White	PERSON	.

		The general features are the same as of those volumes already noticed -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Feb. 16 , ' 98	DATE	-RRB- .

		The employment of three colors marks the docu - ments as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The Law of Holiness , occu - pying chapters
17-26	DATE	, is distinguished by yellow ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the main body of the priestly narrative and laws is marked by a white background ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a few laws regarded as later than the priestly narrative are on a brown background .

		The analysis is very simple , and accords with the views of the school of Dr. Driver .

		The notes contain considerable mate - rial of real value .

		The illustrations are on a par with those of the earlier volumes .

		Scholars and Bible stu - dents will greet this part as another scale upon which to measure the present status of criticism in
Leviticus	LOCATION	.

		Another evidence of the research which is going to make Americans the most thoroughly ancestried people in the world appears in the private printing of '' The Vestry Book and Register of
Bristol Parish	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, 1720-1789 . ''

		This interesting manuscript has been recently brought to light in the library of a gentleman who had kept it immured there for a round half-century , and is now given to the world in print through the indefatigable labors of Mr.
Churchill Gibson Chamberlayne	PERSON	-LRB-
Richmond	LOCATION	, Va M published by the editor -RRB- .

		The book is brimful of quaint old facts , some of them of value to anyone , historian or novelist , seeking to recreate the atmos - phere of a departed and fascinating age .

		And it is also a record of importance to all who set the slightest value upon descent , and find the names of their for - bears recorded here in respect of the three great facts of life birth , marriage , and death .

		Sainltbtiry ' t Knglitk literature .

		It was preordained that Mr.
Saints	PERSON	- bury should write a complete history of English literature complete , that is , in the sense of summarizing the entire course of that literature from '' Widsith '' and Beowulf '' down to the most recently departed poet Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	is the only living writer considered , an exception to the general rule that finds some justification .

		What - ever we may think of the eccentricities of the author 's style or the vagaries of his judgment , he has never yet produced an uninteresting book , and his new Short History of English Literature '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is thoroughly readable from first to last , even the sec -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 tions that are perforce closely packed with names , titles , and other bits of bare fact .

		And we always feel sure that the judgments expressed are Mr.
Saints	PERSON	- bury 's own , for his practice of reading any literature whereof he discourses is well known .

		Indeed , there are probably few men living who have read , with criti - cal eye , so much modern literature , in the English and other languages .

		This qualification , combined with unusual retentiveness of impressions , gives to Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's writing a solidity beyond that of most current criticism , and makes this latest book of his peculiarly welcome .

		The only novelty in its plan is provided by the series of ten brief '' interchapters '' that summarize in their more general aspects the periods just surveyed .

		The history is not so very '' short , '' either , for it extends to some eight hundred pages of about five hundred words each .

		It takes a great deal of industry to prepare such a work , and we are not disposed to carp at its minor defects .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
W. J. Alexander	PERSON	has edited the '' Select Poems of Shelley '' for the '' Athenaeum Press '' series , published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The usual elaborate introductory essay is provided , an essay not as entirely in sympathy with its subject as we could have wished , but still interesting and concise .

		The longer poems included are '' Alastor , '' '' Adonai 's , '' '' Epipsychidion , '' and '' Prometheus Unbound '' ; the shorter ones embrace most of the best lyrics .

		The notes are carefully chosen and valuable , and the total impression made by the vol - ume is one of scholarly neatness and a conscientious endeavor to embody the heart of the poet 's mystery in a series of suitable critical formulae .

		A melancholy interest attaches to the late Professor Lane 's '' Latin Grammar for Schools and Colleges '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He had been engaged upon it for nearly thirty years , and brought it near completion , only to die before he could give it to the public .

		The task of finish - ing the work thus left was entrusted to
Professors Morgan	ORGANIZATION	,
Allen	PERSON	, and
Smith	ORGANIZATION	, but again death intervened , and classical scholarship had to mourn the loss of Pro- fessor
Allen	PERSON	.

		Then Professor
Smith	PERSON	left
America	LOCATION	to take charge of the
American School of Classical Studies	ORGANIZATION	in
Rome	LOCATION	, and Professor
Morgan	PERSON	alone was left .

		Under his direction the work has been carried through the press , and is now issued in a volume of nearly six hun - dred pages a reference work for advanced scholars rather than a college text-book , and a monument to the minute and industrious scholarship of
George Martin Lane	PERSON	. ''

		From Chaucer to Arnold , '' edited by Mr.
Andrew J. George	PERSON	, is a volume of '' types of literary art in prose and verse , '' intended for use as a secondary school text - book in English literature .

		It is essentially a volume of texts , as there are more than six hundred pages of them , selected with the skill of an experienced teacher and critic .

		The use of such a book gives , at least , some sense of the development and continuity of our litera - ture , which is more than can be said of the method which restricts a year 's reading to three or four random clas - sics .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	's book is one of the best of its sort , and we are glad to commend it to teachers .

Schurman	PERSON	's address of
last June	DATE	, upon the occasion of the thirtieth annual Commencement of Cor - nell
University	ORGANIZATION	, has just been published in pamphlet form by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, and given '' A Generation of Cor - nell '' for a title .

		A second series of '' Chap-Book Stories '' has just been published by
Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, thus adding another volume to the several that have already been furnished forth by the files of the little magazine that won so many friends during its brief career .

		Mr.
A. Flanagan	PERSON	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, publishes an arrangement of '' Hiawatha , '' in twelve scenes , for reading-classes and school entertainments .

		The pamphlet is prepared by Miss
Minnie M. George	PERSON	, and gives full directions con - cerning costumes , music , and other adjuncts of such an entertainment .

		Mr.
Frederick W. Morton	PERSON	, whose compilations entitled '' Woman in Epigram '' and '' Man in Epigram '' have found much favor with a certain class of readers , has now prepared '' Love in Epigram , '' a third collection of the same general character , published , like the others , by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just published '' A Con - cise Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities , '' based on
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's larger work , and edited by
Vice-Provost F. Warre Cornish	PERSON	, of
Eton College	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are over eight hundred pages and more than a thousand illustrations , all of which are provided at a moderate price .

		The charming reprint of '' The Spectator , '' edited by Mr.
G. Gregory Smith	PERSON	and published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , to which we have referred from time to time , is now completed by the publication of the eighth volume , which has indexes to the entire work .

		A more presentable set of books has not often been devised .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons announce that they have purchased the publications of the Christian Liter - 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, atnre
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

Stanley Laoe-Poole	PERSON	.

		There are many illustrations , and the edition is in every way an acceptable one .

		It is published in this country by the

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons import for the Ameri - can market a new edition -LRB- the third -RRB- of '' The Life of
Michelangelo Buonarroti	PERSON	, '' by the late
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	.

		Published as they are at a moderate price , the two volumes of this edition are brought within the reach of a new circle of purchasers , who will , we doubt not , heartily welcome the opportunity now offered to place them upon the shelf .

		As the end of the century comes nearer and nearer , we may expect a great production of works , singly and in series , which undertake to sum up the progress of the hundred years , or present a conspectus of human knowl - edge at the time when we pass into the twentieth century .

		Such books are not strictly due until
1901	DATE	, but eagerness to be early in the field will anticipate that date in many cases , and announcements are already beginning to appear .

		355 THE DRAMA AS ART .

		Every now and then , the consciousness of that section of the public which is provided with such uncomfortable things as ideals becomes stirred to the pitch of indignation in contemplation of the degradation to which some form of artistic endeavor is subjected by the hard conditions that a commercial age ever seeks to impose , and usually succeeds in imposing , upon the produc - tion of the art in question .

		At one time it is literature , at another music , at still another painting that comes up for discussion ; just now , thanks to the stimulus of a lecture by Mr.
Israel Zangwill	PERSON	, it is dramatic art upon which the fierce light of criticism beats .

		That the art of the playwright will be bettered by this light or , to vary the metaphor , by the destructive dis - tillation of the accompanying heat is more than doubtful ; but it is well that some one should from time to time call public attention sharply to the low estate into which the stage has fallen , for if the ideal find no spokesman when hardest pressed , its condition is indeed hopeless .

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	, who has just thrown himself bravely into the breach , deserves warm gratitude for what he has been saying , and we trust will keep on saying , for the substance of his contention is of demonstrable nature , and the eternal years of God belong to the truths that are being given so pointed an expression .

		Like all speakers of the unvarnished truth , Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	finds that his message is anything but acceptable in many quarters .

		To say noth - ing of the wounded susceptibilities of dramatic managers , and of the men who fabricate the kind of play that the managers want , the journeymen who write '' dramatic criticism '' for the news - paper press are quite comically outraged by his outspoken remarks .

		Many of them have been saying much the same thing , in a more guarded way , all along ; but they profess themselves out - raged by the antics of this bull in the
china	LOCATION	- shop of modern vaudeville , and cheap farce , and tawdry melodrama .

		They would roar you as gently as any sucking-dove , but they would not for the world speak the plain truth in plain words ; and as for the scintillating words and keen thrusts that flash from Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's armory , they are wholly incapable of forging 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, and wielding the needed weapons .

		Indeed , the lot of these gentlemen who write about the nightly happenings of the stage is no pleasant one .

		They have to deaden whatever artistic con - science they may possess , to invent euphemistic phrases for the characterization of bad plays , to pretend that the contemporary English stage is interesting when they know in their heart of hearts that it is not , and , above all , to simu - late a virtuous and fiery indignation when some dramatist of genius traverses the petty conven - tions of an artificial seemliness and probes human life to its depths .

		The treatment accorded to Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	daring the past ten years by nearly all newspaper critics stands in everlasting and shameful evidence of their shallow incompetence as a tribe .

		We are glad , then , that Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	has stirred the waters in which these criticasters disport themselves , and has called widespread public attention to a few home truths concern - ing plays and playgoers .

		He has said nothing new about the subject there is nothing new to say but he has placed a pretty wit at the service of a few of the old ideas , and some of his observations are pointed enough to pierce the utmost thickness of the Philistine hide .

		There is penetrative energy in such phrases as the following : '' The modern receipt for a success - ful play is a paying compound of snivel , drivel , and devil . ''

		`` The old actors are dead and buried , but the plays are dead and printed .

		You can buy them at the price of eggs ,
twenty-five cents	MONEY	a dozen , and they are mostly bad . '' ''

		The critic no more represents the simple and occa - sional playgoer than a congressman represents the baby he kisses . ''

		The taste of these sayings is dubious , but an exhibition of bad taste is no new thing to Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's readers .

		Free from this reproach are such acute sayings as these : ''
Irving	PERSON	's respect for
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	is unique in the history of the stage and of Irving . '

		. '

		44
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's ink often runs in the veins of his char - acters . ''

		4 -LRB- The French stage has never lost its literary tradition .

		We have legitimatized its children , we have turned its intrigues into flir - tations ; but such virtue has its own reward . ''

		The lecture from which these excerpts are made is a sort of
Gatling	PERSON	gun of epigrams , and its deadly fire is sustained for more than an hour with but brief pretermissions .

		The essential contention of this censor of a degraded art is that our playmongers are apt to forget that it is a form of art with which they are concerned .

		When we think what the drama has been as a factor in civilization , when we recall the noble uses to which the stage has been put in other times and lauds , when we reflect upon the possibilities , for instruction and edification , of the play which is conceived as something finer than a means of amusement , we can not but view with contempt the English play which we get from the theatrical syndicate and the '' bad shopkeepers '' of Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's invective .

		And when we realize that the drama is still treated as a fine art in
France	LOCATION	and Ger - many , in
Spain	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, in
Russia	LOCATION	and Scan - dinavia , while in the English-speaking countries alone it has fallen to a level which makes mean - ingless any mention of art in its discussion , we may well bow our heads with shame .

		This is a general truth of which there is no effective denying , for the occasional manager of high ideals and the occasional play of literary qual - ity serve only to emphasize the pass to which the majority of plays and managers have come .

		It is no more than the simple truth to say that our audiences do not want ideas in their plays ; they want costumes , and tricks of stage-car - pentry , and farcical situations ; they are hugely delighted by a catchy song or an utterly irrel - evant dance ; they will tolerate sentiment if not too delicate , and even passion if its origin be not too deep within the soul ; but ideas they will not have on any terms .

		Is our popular artistic standard lower in matters pertaining to the stage than it is in matters that concern the other forms of art endeavor ?

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	thinks that it is ; but we are not so sure .

		It is popular taste in 44 lit - erature that makes possible the existence of the class of newspapers that so disgrace American civilization .

		Surely the stage , at its basest , can do no worse than that .

		If we seem to set up a higher standard for books than we do for plays , it must be remembered that the bad play forces itself more obtrusively upon public atten - tion than the bad book .

		People view the for - mer in public , as it were , and it is discussed in the public press ; whereas the latter is read in private , and the critic usually ignores it alto - gether .

		Beneath the lowest stratum of books that are thought deserving of mention by news - paper reviewers , there is a still lower stratum that makes up the chief reading of countless thousands of people , as far as they read books at all .

		But the theatres that provide the corre - sponding forms of cheap sentiment and vulgar - ity are conspicuous in the public eye , and have their place in the daily or weekly theatrical summaries .

		We doubt , then , very much if the taste of the real public be any better in its read -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 ing than in its acting .

		When we consider music , painting , and sculpture , much the same prin - ciples hold true .

		As in literature , so in the case of these arts , we can never learn what the masses really like , because we can not readily catch them -LRB- as we can at a theatre -RRB- in the act of what stands to them for aesthetic contemplation .

		But from the popularity of certain forms of music , and of certain forms of the graphic arts , forms in which imbecility and vulgarity seek to outrival each other we may at least shrewdly surmise that the taste of the dear public is here , as with books and plays , in almost equally evil case .

		Yet when all is said , one important consider - ation remains .

		In literature , the finest forms of art are accessible to everybody .

		This state - ment is also measurably true of music , and painting , and sculpture .

		One can to a con - siderable extent come to understand the ideals of these arts by the study of photographs and scores .

		At all events , the large cities afford actual examples of the highest achievements of these arts .

		But even the large cities rarely , if ever , afford to the spectator examples of what the art dramatic at its highest can do .

		They may show us marvellous stage - effects , but they do not show us sincerity of purpose and unity of artistic endeavor .

		In this respect , it is true that in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	the drama stands upon a lower level than the other arts .

		We can all read the greatest literature at home ; we can often hear the greatest music perfectly per - formed ; we can view some of the greatest works of painting and sculpture in the originals and all of them in trustworthy reproduction ; but we can not witness such productions of the great plays as are to be witnessed in the theatres of the European Continent .

		Our productions may cost a great deal more , and be more dazzling to most of the senses , but they do not make art their foremost consideration , and they justify the reproach that in our time has fallen upon the English-speaking stage .

		FREEING A DIRECTION .

		This phrase is
Bacon	PERSON	's definition of his own philosophy .

		The direction he so successfully freed was , of course , towards the promised land of the practical and industrial arts , and away from the regions of myth and metaphysic .

		It has become more than a direction , it has become a current , irresistible and perhaps irreversible .

		Especially in
America	LOCATION	, where the genius of Franklin has stamped practicality on our national character , have we gone the whole Baconian way .

		Recent events are like to confirm us in the reasonableness of our ideals and methods .

		A South American traveller reports asking the
Padre	LOCATION	of a
Jesuist Mission	ORGANIZATION	what it was he taught the Indians whom he caught young and innoculated with Spanish civilization . ''

		Why , '' he said , '' we teach them poetry and theology . ''

		Does not the difference between the Latin races and ours speak in that statement ?

		But let us not be too proud .

		Poetry and theology are no bad aids to happiness in this life and security in the next .

		The charm of life is something ; the two immortalities of art and the soul are more .

		There have been civilizations which have risen and spread and dom - inated the world , and then vanished and left nothing behind in the mind of man but a nightmare and a headache .

		Despite our material prosperity , I be - lieve there would be a gain in the higher and intenser joys of living were some philosopher to look about him and free us a direction leading away from the long-travelled Baconian road .

		We have ceased to live in the imagination .

		Literature is degraded to about the position of the lapdog of an idle woman .

		Restore us our faiths and our fancies , O philosopher , and you may take away some of our comforts and conveniences .

		Perhaps the witch 's broomstick was a better vehicle than the bicycle .

		But is it possible to establish a new direction ?

		Are we not in the iron grip of a movement which must go on until every atom of imagination , every spark of superiority , is extinguished ?

		The theories of spon - taneous generation and development have disposed of
First Causes and Efficient Causes	ORGANIZATION	, and the rest .

		Man is only a part of the machine of the world , and can no longer , as of old , front the huge beast and sport with him and turn him about .

		We are no longer images of Our Maker , but a conglomeration of cells and unconscious cerebration .

		We have lost initiative .

		We can no longer originate or control .

		Bacon expressly claimed for his philosophy that it did away with the necessity for superior talents that it tended to make all men equal .

		And genius itself is accepting this view to-day .

		Tolstoi in his '' War and Peace '' has a long polemic against the delusions of superiority and direction .

		Great warriors and generals , he explains , have nothing to do with gam - ing battles : '' the man behind the gun '' does it all .

		An event like the French Revolution , he says , surges up from below , to label it with the names of Vol - taire ,
Rousseau	PERSON	, and
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	, is absurd .

		He does not go so far as to claim that without Christ Christianity could have existed , or Mohammedism without Mohammed , or that the radiant area of peopled creation which we know as the Shake - spearean world could have come into being want - ing Shakespeare , but the deductions are evident .

		Positively , it is a relief to turn from the worship of unguided force from the view of man as a product of climates , foods , inherited nerve-suggestion , and what not , to
Nietszche	ORGANIZATION	's conception of the Over THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Man , who at least stand * on his own legs and plays docks and drakes with the universe .

		Waiting the philosopher to arise who is capable of changing oar coarse , I would offer a few sugges - tions which are particularly for the interests of lit - erature .

		It is wrong to suppose that literature in its normal state deals with or imitates all of life with equal pleasure .

		There are vast regions of human experience and exertion upon which it looks coldly .

		The scientific activities of man the accumulations of minute facts and the uses to which they are turned are indifferent if not repugnant to it
Keats	PERSON	was perfectly right in drinking to the confusion of New - ton , who destroyed the rainbow .

		The vast daily commonplaces of life have hardly more place in real literature .

		They are not beautiful enough , or signifi - cant enough , or profound enough , for lasting record .

		Yet it is precisely in these fields that the tendency of modern thought has driven literature to reap its harvests .

		It is worth while to analyze a little the ordinary and the commonplace , to see why they fail to afford materials for great art .

		A human being is a human being , and per se one ought to be as interesting as another .

		But they are not .

		Circumstances alter cases .

		Pere Goriot suffers perhaps as intensely as
King Lear	PERSON	, but he does not affect us as much or as permanently .

		In the first place , Balzac could not deal with him beautifully .

		To put into his month the magnificent language of King Lear would have been inappropriate even had it been at
Balzac	LOCATION	's command , and cloth of gold is more valuable than homespun .

		In the second place , to have given Pere Goriot the far-reaching and elemental thought of
King Lear	ORGANIZATION	would have been equally absurd .

		The conditions of his life could not allow or evoke it .

		Yet great thought is a necessary requisite of great art .

		And , lastly ,
Pere Goriot	PERSON	is simply an unfortunate old man , like any other ; whereas
King Lear	PERSON	is the sym - bol of old age itself , the old age not only of humanity but of nature .

		There is a tendency among recent writers to use scientific facts and appliances as materials for liter - ature .

		A certain hardness and hollowness in the results is discouraging .

		It is curious how little we really care for such things .

		A lucifer match or a telephone instrument is an article of comfort and convenience .

		We use the one or the other without emotion or gratitude .

		The slightest fact of experi - ence which touches our souls the sight of a sunset , the scent of a flower , the sound of a woman 's voice is worth a thousand times more for delight and for literature than all the scientific facts and generali - zations in existence .

		The sciences are the helots of civilization the hewers of wood and drawers of water .

		We accept their services , but dismiss them from our company when we are bent on intellectual or social enjoyment They have always resented this exclusion , and of late , by dint of decrying the nobler and more delicate susceptibilities of human nature , they have crushed their way into recognition .

		But the moment man recovers the knowledge of himself as a being whose best prerogatives are to think and feel , the doom of their equality is sealed .

		If literature can get little aid from science or the commonplace , it may be urged that history can sup - ply all the materials it needs , and of the noblest and costliest kind .

		History is the school-girl 's idea of serious literature .

		She would be shocked if told that she must go to poems and plays for profundity .

		But
Aristotle	PERSON	said that history was less philosophical than poetry .

		Diderot said that history was a bad novel .

		Arnold said that history presented foam-bells of truth on a
Mississippi	LOCATION	of falsehood .

		History , in fact , lacks the metaphysic basis of great art .

		It relates men only to each other , seldom to their families , and never to Nature or God .

		It is always the same kaleidoscope , with the same bits of colored glass , in the same hard brilliancy and unmeaning complication .

		A great writer , a Shakespeare or a Scott , may humanize characters out of history , but as a rule they are only half successes , inferior to figures the same writers caught from common legend or projected from their own souls .

		Wagner hesitated in choosing for the trial of his greatest powers between the historical Barbarossa and the legend - ary Siegfried , and he finally rejected the first because he felt that the history had not the truth or significance of the myth .

		It is , indeed , in the direction of the myth that we must turn for the first hope of great literature .

		The myth-making instinct is its life-blood .

		To allegorize the facts of nature or humanity , to fasten upon and exalt certain elemental traits and types , is the primal instinct The conscience , the aspirations , the very essence of races , speak in their myths .

		Yet myths are always an individual product .

		People never assembled in convention to make one , as we do to nominate a President .

		Some sensitive poet soul first embodied in words an appearance of nature or a human experience .

		Another added to this , another interpreted it , another satirized it , until it became a possession of the tribe and the world .

		In this view the process is always going on .

		The great figures of history , as they are accepted by mankind , are in the main myths .

		The mere trivial truths of biogra - phy are overridden by the sum of impression .

		Here in
America	LOCATION	we are unfortunate in not having a back - ground deep enough for these ghosts and guides of life to gather in any number , yet we have done what we could .

		I can not recall any other instance of a superior race accepting the legends of an inferior and savage one , and making literature out of them .

		Yet this is what
Longfellow	LOCATION	effected with Indian mythology in
Hiawatha	LOCATION	, and
Cooper	PERSON	with Indian legends in the Pathfinder romances .

		Hawthorne waa driven to import into Puritan life old-world ideas , most assuredly foreign to such an environment , the search for the elixir of youth , for instance , the phantasies of ancestral curses , of a reincarnated faun , and many others .

		Poe 's poetry and romance * belong to the region of abstraction , metaphysics , rather than
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 337 of myth .

		All these writers were conscious in their efforts after what must have seemed to their contem - poraries unreality .

		In the critical jargon of to-day , they were not sincere .

		Yet they achieved great successes the greatest our literature has known .

		There is no reason why their successors should not follow in their footsteps .

		Imagination lies dormant in the mind of man , and only needs a touch to evoke it .

		Myths are the metaphysics of the ignorant .

		But metaphysics themselves the imaginations and logi - cal deductions of abstract thought are and always must be the mental pabulum of the educated .

		There lies the theatre of the world 's greatest poetry .

		It is folly to say that the problems of thought have all been threshed out that '' fate , foreknowledge , free-will absolute , '' the finite and infinite , birth and decay , good and evil have all been so thoroughly debated that there is nothing more to say about them , or that Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's Pyrrhonistic dialectic has put them forever out of court .

		They are no more exhausted than the eternal `` Amandus he '' ``
Amanda	PERSON	she ' 1 which is the staple of fiction .

		Man must investigate the dark foundations of his estate .

		The main ten - dency of modern literature is akin to the impression - istic fallacy in painting , which strives to solve the problems of light , and forgets that nearly all signifi - cance comes through shadow .

		To go into a gallery of impressionistic pictures is like entering a
spring	DATE	opening of a millinery establishment .

		Everything is so gay , riant , and trivial .

		Put a Rembrandt or a
Corot	LOCATION	or a Millet among such pictures , and the grave deep note makes the triviality still more appar - ent .

		In the same way , bring the figures of an Elizabe - than tragedy into a crowd of characters from modern novels , and the latter will seem like chattering monkeys in a cage .

		Patriotism and Religion are matters of too mighty import to be made the tails of a literary kite .

		They are , indeed , too dominating and absorbing in their nature to have any direct or immediate effect on literature .

		They work for it , as they spiritualize man break up his selfishness and sordidness , and give play to the exalted enthusiasms of the soul .

		A wave of patriotism seems spreading over the world , and perhaps the opening century will see a reawaken - ing of the religious instinct .

		I have said enough to indicate the direction I believe literature should take .

		Of course , art of any kind can never give up its imitation of life , its repro - duction of reality .

		Myths and abstractions must be embodied in human form , must be translated into terms of human experience , before they can interest humanity .

		The dark monotony of thought must be infused with emotion , colored with imagery .

		But , for my part , I can not conceive of anything more use - less than a literature which reproduces life without a background of thought and imagination .

		AS TO `` HAD BETTER . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The reading of Professor
Edward A. Allen	PERSON	's commu - nication in THE DIAL for
November 1	DATE	might prompt the query , How far is grammatical construction to be sacri - ficed to a popular idiom ?

		It strikes one who reveres , without feeling himself worthy to be classed among the '' purists , '' that while there are combinations preferable to '' would better '' the idiomatic '' had better '' is not among them .

		Let us make a few experiments with Professor
Allen	PERSON	's first quoted sentence as a basis .

		By changing the auxiliary we have : 1 . ''

		You can better see about it yourself . ''

		2 . ''

		You might better see about it yourself . ''

		3 . ''

		You had better see about it yourself . ''

		Now suppose we remove the adverb '' better '' -LRB- which threatens to befog the view of everybody but the '' pur - ists '' -RRB- to a place almost equally advantageous for it , near the end of the sentence , and note the result : 1 .

		`` You can see about it better yourself . ''

		2 .

		`` You might see about it better yourself . ''

		3 . ''

		You had see about it bet - ter yourself . ''

		Which of these three is it that `` defies all logical analysis '' ?

		If the last one is anything but '' insipid English , '' if it is not nearer an '' idiotism '' than an idiom , if nobody except a '' purist '' would dream of objecting to it , then may Heaven and the colleges send us more '' purists '' before our language becomes entirely corrupted !

		< THE WHITE MAN AND THE TROPICS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your brief notice of Mr.
Benjamin Kidd	PERSON	's remarkable little book on '' The Control of the Tropics '' -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Nov. 1	DATE	-RRB- accurately states that somewhat dogmatic writ - er 's main conclusion , but fails to point out a serious flaw in his argument .

		I allude to the sweeping assumption that the white races can not permanently and successfully colonize the tropics .

		Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	, soaring on the wings of theory , picturesquely says : '' In the tropics the white man lives and works only as a diver lives and works under water '' !

		It is pretty evident that Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	has never been south of the
Tropic of Cancer	ORGANIZATION	.

		To his imagination -LRB- fed , one might suppose , by the reports of Sir
John Maude	PERSON	ville -RRB- a tropical country apparently presents itself as an Inferno , the native races of which are a sort of human salamanders born to an environment in which the white man is either bound to be promptly grilled to death , or else to gradually perish , qua white man , through a pro- cess of mental and physical enfeeblement .

		The fact is , Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	is so bent on working out his imperialistic thesis that he exaggerates , on the one hand , the climatic dan - gers and discomforts that beset the white settler in the tropics , and underrates , on the other hand , the degree to which those dangers and discomforts can be counteracted by modern hygienic science .

		Were tropical heat the real enemy , the case of the colonist might be considered hope - less .

		But the real enemy is the microbe .

		It has been pretty conclusively shown , as is stated in '' The Brit - ish Medical Journal , '' that `` disease , deterioration , and deaths in the tropics are due not so much to the influ - ence of climate as to pathogenic germs , which have their limited and peculiar geographical areas , and differ greatly in the various tropical regions . ''

		The inference is plain .

		As a matter of fact , owing to scientific sanitation , the death-rate of English troops in
India	LOCATION	, which used to be about 125 per thousand , is now as low as 12 per thou - 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, sand ; while in
Trinidad	LOCATION	and Barbadoes the sickness and mortality among the soldiers are actually less than at home .

		There are already over ten millions of white men Mid descendant * of white men settled in the tropics ; and , in fine , as the distinguished authority quoted above asserts -LRB- in direct contradiction to Mr.
Kidd	PERSON	-RRB- , '' It is hardly reasonable to dispute any longer the possibility of tropical acclimatization . ''

		NOTES ON AN ENGLISH LETTER .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have been reading in THE DIAL of
September 16 last	DATE	, a letter from your
London	LOCATION	correspondent , and I am constrained to write to your journal traversing certain statements and opinions which are there advanced .

		I .

		As to copyright .

		The
Committee of the House of Lords on Copyright	ORGANIZATION	was appointed in order to seem to be doing something .

		The opinions and facts it has col - lected were known to everybody long ago .

		Nothing that was given in evidence is new .

		So far , the
Lords ' Committee	ORGANIZATION	has done nothing to justify its appointment .

		Of course its report may turn out to be valuable .

		II .

		As to a new Copyright Bill .

		-LRB- 1 -RRB- Nothing is known of the intentions of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		A bill is now being drafted by one of the oldest Parliamentary hands , but that does not mean that it will be brought forward .

		The great difficulty in the way is the necessary assertion of Imperial copyright .

		If
Canada	LOCATION	, for instance , should insist upon a copyright Law of her own to protect her small body of printers , the Bill will fall to the ground .

		I doubt if the
Government	ORGANIZATION	means to bring it in , because they will not raise the point of Imperial authority if it can be avoided .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Tour correspondent thinks that '' the magazine has almost ousted from the attention of the reading public all books other than those of the first import - ance . ''

		This opinion seems to me absolutely at variance with the facts , which are these : The high-class maga - zines , though two or three of them hold their own , do not increase greatly in circulation .

		The old shilling magazines seem to be decaying in circulation and in influence .

		More books are published than were ever known before ; public libraries are springing up all over the country , and are crowded with readers of books .

		What , however , has happened is this :
Harmsworth	PERSON	and
Pearson	PERSON	and Newnes have discovered the new mass of readers created by the
School Boards	ORGANIZATION	.

		They give these people what they want something light , amusing , and exciting ; and their productions sell literally by the million .

		But to infer from this that magazines are taking readers from books is ridiculous .

		Those who buy these magazines have never bought books .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Tour correspondent thinks that publishing of the future will be in the hands of a few large syndicates .

		It hardly looks like it , so far .

		Longmans absorbed Rivington and a Rivington started afresh the next day .

		Bentley is absorbed by
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	, it is true .

		But in the last few years new publishers have started up by the dozen .

		For instance :
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Percival	PERSON	,
Methnen	LOCATION	,
Innes	LOCATION	,
Heinemann	PERSON	, Constable ,
Duckworth	PERSON	, Grant Rich - ards .

		And they all seem to be doing well : they have all got respectable lists .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- I am sorry to traverse every opinion of Mr.
Temple Scott	PERSON	.

		But the truth is that the abolition of the three - volume novel has not produced `` disastrous effects , '' as he asserts , but the very reverse .

		Under the old system , nobody bought the three-volume novel ex - cept three or four circulating libraries ; the cot > t of each to the library varied from 13s .

		6rf .

		to 15 * .

		Naturally the library took as few as possible : of a very popular work , perhaps about
1200	DATE	to 1800 copies in all .

		The great public , the Colonies ,
India	LOCATION	, were kept from the book until a cheap ed itiou was issued t. .

		, for a twelve - month .

		When it did come out , the demand for the book was generally declining and the sale of the cheap edition was seldom more than a few thousands .

		At the present moment , when a demand arises for a new book it is met at once by the bookseller .

		A publisher showed me the other day the returns of a six-shilling novel by a popular author .

		It was not a '' boom , '' but it was a great many thousand copies .

		By the one-volume novel this man must have made double what he could have made by the three-volume .

		A great many novels are published which bring in nothing ; but they ought not to have been published at all .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Mr.
Temple Scott	PERSON	finishes his letter with a fling at the Authors ' Society , the
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Booksellers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, all three .

		He says : '' They none of them know what they want , or how to get it if they did . ''

		This is the kind of language com - monly adopted about the first of these three societies .

		Of course it is rubbish , and , what is worse , it is mis - chievous rubbish .

		All three associations know perfectly well what they want : each association wants to get as large a share as it can of literary property .

		The Au - thors , however , demand that the division of literary property shall be conducted on principles of equity .

		These principles they have long since laid down , and repeated over and over again .

		The Publishers have lately shown what they want by issuing '' Draft Agree - ments . ''

		They are very curious and even startling doc - uments .

		They demand in their drafts as a right the power of seizing any pay they please , or the whole of the profits of a book , however great .

		They have not yet established that right .

		The Booksellers , who are in the most wretched plight , owing to causes which it would take too long to explain , know only too well what they want , viz : better terms from the publishers .

		Else bankruptcy and ruin .

		That is quite certain .

		Bank - ruptcy and ruin .

		I congratulate Mr.
Temple Scott	PERSON	on his fine sense of humor .

		He promises himself a hearty laugh . ''

		I suppose it will begin when the last bookseller , with his family , retires to the workhouse , and the last author discovers that it is useless to go on writing when the publisher allows him nothing .

		In other words , your correspondent looks on while the authors are fighting for the independence and the self-respect of literature , what they have effected I will ask you to let me tell you on another occasion , and while the booksellers , with sinking hearts , are struggling for a bare living : he proposes to laugh at both .

		He writes for a literary journal , and these are his views on the efforts of literary men to raise literature out of dependence !

		`` REALISM COMES TO STAY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have by chance come into possession of the follow - ing fragmentary MS. , purporting to be an eighteenth century production .

		While the formal character of the heroic verse in which the author 's ideas are couched might suggest the epoch in question , there are many indications which lead me to think the MS. is of more recent origin , as , for instance , the italicized propo - sition '' Realism comes to stay . ''

		It is a curious coinci -

		THE DIAL 339 dence , indeed , that those are the very words assigned to Mr.

		THE BANISHMENT OF ROMANCE .

		Methought in regions where the Florentine Once passed with groping feet , there wandered mine -LRB- With all humility I haste to say -RRB- ; And , while I mourned the vanished light of day , A star-bright Being towards me bent her way , Whose coming roused innumerous dim acclaim . '

		I am Romance -LRB- if thou dost seek my name -RRB- , Your little world of letters banished thence !

		And now it sets in sacred eminence An upstart whom it hails as Realism , But thou , perchance , art sworn unto that schism ! ''

		An hundred quivering lights , as from a prism , Played on her starry brows and in her smile . '

		Not yet , Goddess , not yet I defile The ancient faith , the only and the true , With heresies the fathers never knew ! ''

		Then spake the star-bright One : `` She sits her throne , All pomp , all servitors , dimissed , alone .

		Nor Tyrian dyes , nor ermine , her adorn , Nor crown is set upon her locks close-shorn .

		There is no tribute that could please her best , And none is more exalt than are the rest ; The only peerage she creates by grace , The royal Order of The Commonplace !

		The incense that she most delights to breathe It is the effluvium of crowds that seethe In proletarian turmoil , cheek by jole !

		She hath no scrutiny of any soul -LRB- As was our wont -RRB- , but of the fleshly case ; And there is neither glorious nor base , In her esteeming .

		Yet is Truth her boast , But Truth she seeks in regions nethermost .

		And , were a pearly treasure cast to swine , Think ` st thou to find the pearls she would incline ?

		Nay , rather would the herd in
Circe	LOCATION	's pen Please her as swine than as enchanted men ! ''

		Here paused the Presence , and the darkness trembled With sighs of those her plaint had there assembled , Spirits
august	DATE	, who , while on earth they dwelt , In hearts of men had made her empire felt .

		Recall ye , how the souls by us inspired Ever to nobler zeal and action fired The race they loved , by setting up on high Examples eminent that filled the eye , And quickened emulation in all breasts , That they , too , might be tried by sovran tests !

		So , these my artists , on large canvas , threw Heroic shapes , in living line and hue , That all men might the Optimates view , And fashion their own lives and deeds thereto .

		What hath the Usurper brought them , of new truth ?

		She hath estranged them from the World 's great Youth , And taught them downward to direct their gaze , To bound their life by breadth of sordid days .

		Now , evermore , meseems I hear them say , ' With magnitudes and altitudes away ! '

		The mountains tower above the plain for aye ; Yet not the mountains , nor the liquid light Poured round those summits , now engage their sight : But in some homely spot of spaded ground , In ant-reared tumuli , their heights are found I The day hath been -LRB- but far away it gleams -RRB- When man did wake , and tell his wondrous dreams ; And all that listened were like forest pine Long-swaying to the jEolian wave divine !

		The dream passed on , yet never quite forsook The earth it gladdened so .

		Who now would brook To hear a dreamer tell his dream ah , who ?

		To Poesy the poet saith , ' Adieu !

		Get back to
Castaly	LOCATION	, or
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	; Thy reign is past , thou proud , thou lovely one !

		There is a damsel , of a Doric race ; Coarse are her hands , her speech , and blowzed her face .

		She hath constrained me to her heavy pace ; And her , perforce , I 've taken in thy place . ' ''

		Here suddenly broke off her words , amid Queries and sighs of those the darkness hid . ''

		Epic ?

		Nay , Epic verse shall be no more .

		There is no heart now beating at the core , Nor life of faith , nor red blood in the vein , To wake again that old heroic strain .

		The Lyric ?

		Like a bird with crippled wing She soars not , where it was her wont to sing .

		Obscure her melancholy notes , how changed From the free songster that with Ariel ranged ! '

		As ill with prose it f areth as with verse ; The new Divinity hath laid a curse Upon the stylus , that it shall not move -LRB- Though freedom be its boast -RRB- beyond the groove Her tyranny prescribes .

		It is her pleasure To say of Human Life , '' I take your measure By which , hereafter , ever stand confessed Plain mediocre , neither worst , nor best ! '

		So , therefore , do her subjects , each one , strive How he may be the dullest scribe alive !

		Great fiction once from wizard pens did flow ; They also spake of what themselves did know .

		They knew what now from casual vision hides - How the deep sea of being has its tides , When , all at once , some man of men transcends His fellows ay , himself , and therehy ends , With some great , ne'er - to-be-forgotten act , The dull tradition of diurnal fact .

		The last of these my brave artificers -LRB- Who on the earth leaves no inheritors -RRB- His birthsong and his cradle
Scotia	LOCATION	gave , The far sea isles a requiem and a grave !

		Now , in his stead , beneath the anarch rule That has ordained the Realistic School , Is one all-hailed the foremost Son of Truth , Whose art exalts the ribald and uncouth .

		Do ears emasculate , for simple force , Mistake the simply ruffianly and coarse ? '' '

		Goddess , his fame still runs its fervid course , As though they had some maddening brew been tippling .

		All praise him even tender maid and strippling !

		Yet , sometimes , from his lip a song is blown , That thrills the world with its full Orthian tone ! '' '

		That song , naught else , shall bid his memory live When Aftertimes the high award shall give . '' '

		* O Sovereign of my lasting fealty , '' I cried , `` Shall Aftertimes , then , wiser be Than are the wisest of the current day , Who hold that Realism comes to stay ? '' ''

		Fear not .

		I shall again resume my sway , And she new tribute in my hands shall lay ; For so , hath Science done , so all , who thought , Usurping , they could bring my power to naught ; Since of the oldest dynasty am I , Delight of life within my gift doth lie ; The heart of man , of woman , and of child , Without me were to Fate unreconciled .

		A space hath Human Fashion banished me ; But Human Fashion will soon wearied be !

		I only wait the unfed heart 's recall , To take my place my place supreme in all .

		Farewell till then . ''

		So ebbed the
Voice	ORGANIZATION	away ; Darkness and starlight melted into gray , And I awakened to the garish day .

		> T EO-IUKALI8M IN THE DRAMA .

		* Nothing reconciles me to the denseness with which the world is apt to harden itself against the lambent life of my ideas more readily than the denseness with which I myself occasionally exclude the ideas of others .

		It is partly that language alone is not the ideal means of com - munication .

		I am enough of a philologist of the school of
Talleyrand	LOCATION	and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	to be assured that language is not the best means of getting one 's ideas about .

		Anyway , I existed calmly for a long time after the production of '' Cyrano de Bergerac '' without even having heard that there was such a play .


M. Rostand	PERSON	's earlier work had aroused a very gentle curiosity in my mind ; and as to
Cyrano de Bergerac	LOCATION	, I had never heard of him .

		When a friend lent me a copy of the play , I looked at it mildly , and let it lie around without reading it .

		Soon there was so much in the newspapers on the matter that I was annoyed , and avoided the sight of the book .

		Another friend then lent me another copy , and I let that lie around , too .

		Not even when four copies had come into the house was I stirred from my inertia , until a kindly fellow-critic , with a little more imagina - tion than I have , incited me to read some of them .

		After all this , no one will suppose that I mean to offer any critical opinions of my own on a subject already so publicly possessed .

		Fer - guson discovered many things already known , and
Emerson	PERSON	approved , saying , '' The better for him . ''

		It may be so ; and yet it would not have been the better for the world , had he pub - lished his discoveries .

		No ; there seems to be a very general understanding among the critics as to the excellence of '' Cyrano de Bergerac , '' and I need not add my voice .

		I may , however , remark that the two translations that I have seen compare very unfavorably with the best translations of plays known to me ,
Coleridge	PERSON	's translations of
Schiller	PERSON	for instance , or
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's of Calderon .

		This is unfortunate , but probably unavoidable .

		Miss
Hall	PERSON	's translation is chiefly prose , and that of Miss
Thomas	PERSON	and
Miss Guillemard	LOCATION	is partly in verse .

New York	LOCATION	:
Donbleday A McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		sion used by Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	is said to be verse .

		I have not read it , but my impression from hearing it is that there is not much verse , either blank or rhymed , in it .

		But aside from this matter -LRB- which is an important one , as the play in French is in rhymed verse -RRB- , both transla - tions give something of an idea of the original , and neither , I should say , would do much more .

		On the whole , I should sty that the translation of Miss
Thomas	PERSON	and
Miss Guillemard	ORGANIZATION	gives more of an idea of the play as one remembers it from the French .

		And this is a matter of appreciable impor - tance just here , for in some respects the writ - ten play gives one something the acted play can probably never give , just as the acted play gives something that the written play can not give .

		But had I the forced choice , to see the play two or three times or to have the book , I should certainly choose the latter , although the play is remarkably put on the stage by Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	, and the part extremely well acted by him .

		I had rather have the book , for it con - tains things the stage can never give , things which I -LRB- who am rather an academic haunter of libraries , and of cloistered citadels of the soul , than a man of that fluent , refreshing cur - rent of thought which they call the world -RRB- had rather have than those things that the stage can give and the imagination never .

		At any rate , as an acted play I must leave '' Cyrano de Ber - gerac '' to the dramatic critics , as I have said .

		From the standpoint of literature , however , there are some interesting things to be said , for in the history of the literature of the nine - teenth century
Cyrano de Bergerac	ORGANIZATION	will be a well-remembered figure , would be some - thing much more than that , except that people do not read plays as they do novels .

		But even as it is ,
Cyrano de Bergerac	ORGANIZATION	is and will remain one of the great characters which the French literature of our time offers to the world .

		As we look back , any one of us , into the vista of our earlier days , and recognize the figures that arise from the readings of our youth , the first to strike us when we think of our early acquaintance with French is the heroic figure of
d'Artagnan	LOCATION	.

		Or is it perhaps Mauprat ?

		Never mind , the elder
Dumas	PERSON	and
George Sand	PERSON	were the great French writers of our earlier days , as they were of an earlier part of the century .

		It must have been later in life that we became acquainted with the Come ` die Humaine and
Marguerite Gaatier	PERSON	, with
Madame Bovary	PERSON	and the Rougon-Macquart family .

		Whether or not it were so in our own individual youth , it was practically so with the
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 youth of our time .

		To readers nourished on
Byron	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	,
France	LOCATION	gave the '' Three Musketeers '' and `` Monte Cristo , '' `` Mau - prat '' and '' Consuelo . ''

		Then came the turn of the tide , and a generation brought up on
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	put aside childish things and were thrilled by the tragedies of
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Dumas	PERSON	fils ,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Zola	LOCATION	.

		The Realistic movement was general , but those were the men who represented
France	LOCATION	, and who created the typical characters that seize the imagination and recollection of all .

		And now that the century is coming to an end ,
France	LOCATION	presents another figure , and that not realistic , but now romantic again , presents it to a world which is all ready to enjoy romance once more .

		Just as a generation fed on
Scott	PERSON	welcomed
d'Artagnan	LOCATION	, so a generation fed on
Stevenson	PERSON	welcomes
Cyrano de Bergerac	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pendulum has swung back again .

		When , after the duel in the first act , a bril - liant and heroic musketeer strides out of the crowd and shakes the victorious Cyrano by the hand and vanishes , the incident is more sig - nificant than the audience appreciates . ''

		Who is that gentleman ? ''

		says Cyrano to Cuigy . ''

		D'Artagnan , '' says he , and Cyrano turns round ; but the older hero is gone , and
Cyrano	ORGANIZATION	holds the attention alone .

		The two are alike , and are different .

		Both are heroes who fire the old-time savage element of the soul ,
Gascons	PERSON	, swordsmen , invincible , men of the dominating word and the convincing stroke , hotblooded , honorable , heroic .

		But the difference : one is tall , handsome , brilliant , magnificent , and the other is almost grotesque .

		He is cruelly grotesque : there is nothing to lighten it ; it is nothing one can pity , like a hump or a clubfoot ; nothing that one can delude oneself into thinking fine , like a mountain belly and a rocky face , or a
Rochester	LOCATION	sort of hideousness .

		All these things the world would forgive or forget .

		Here is something ridiculous , something that would make any one of us shiver and writhe if we saw it by our own fireside .

		Here is something that touches us cynical , susceptible , bantering people , touches us in a very tender place .

		And yet one swallows it , and with it all minor matters .

		Cyrano might by an enemy be called ^ a bully and a braggart , but that we forget , as well as his nose ; we feel only that he is a noble figure .

		This is a rather curious thing .

		It is the result of Realism , I take it .

		In the old , old fairy tale , the
Beast	LOCATION	stopped being a beast when he was loved .

		^ The mon - ster became Cupid .

		But Realism has pricked that bubble , and we know that human nature is , and will long continue to be , human .

		We must accept the strange mixture of the god and the animal .

		We must recognize that the old - time dreams are dreams , beautiful , encour - aging , inspiring , to be remembered and to be thankful for , but not truths that we shall ever know .

		Realism has forced upon us the pre - eminent thought of our time , that the triumph of the spirit is despite the flesh ; and now the new Romanticism profits by the lesson .

		Our English romancers did not quite dare .

		They knew , as a general thing , that their heroes must not be the old-time impossibilities , but they have compromised , as a rule , by having their heroes , on the whole , chumps : they did not dare to go to the impossible extreme which so often makes the type .


M. Rostand	PERSON	has dared to do so , and he has succeeded .

		He has drawn a very noble character , a man essentially high-minded and good .

		It is , to me , a little curious to contrast three ideal figures of the English , German , and French dramas .

		I am thinking , beside
Cyrano de Bergerac	ORGANIZATION	, of Heinrich the
Bell	ORGANIZATION	- founder and
Marchbanks	PERSON	in ''
Candida	PERSON	. ''

		Of these three poets , the only one whom we can really call a good man is the Frenchman .

		Heinrich 's ideal - ism is such that his poor wife is driven to drown herself .

		Eugene loves the wife of his friend , and would take her away if she had not still the idea that her husband needed her .

		Such things we pass over in great men , although we should be annoyed at them in our personal friends .

		But Cyrano needs no apology .

		Of course , the German and the English plays do not shock us , we have got bravely over all that .

		That seems to me a curious thing .

		Perhaps , then , the most noteworthy fact about '' Cyrano de Bergerac '' is not so much that
M. Rostand	PERSON	should have written it , as that

		Now THAT we have had time to read , if not to digest , Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's Boswellian account of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, we are to have the great statesman 's own memoirs '' Gedankan und Erinnerungen '' they are styled or at least the two volumes that the executors permitted to be pub - lished at the present time .

		342 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, THE EXPANSION OF THE ENGLISH RACE .

		* The fact that the era of rivalry between
Spain	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	for the control of
America	LOCATION	, which in a certain sense began with
Columbus	LOCATION	and
Cabot	PERSON	, is just closing , gives renewed interest to the period of its beginning .

		It is a striking coincidence that the end of the period should have followed so closely the celebration of the four-hundredth anniversary of the beginning .

		Only five years ago ,
Spain	LOCATION	joined the
United States	LOCATION	in the celebration of the Columbian dis - covery .

		Who would then have anticipated that within so short a time the
United States	ORGANIZATION	would expel
Spain	LOCATION	from the Western Hemisphere ?

		It is somewhat anomalous that the people of the
United States	LOCATION	devoted all their energies to the celebration of the Spanish discovery , and left the celebration of the
Cabot	LOCATION	anniversary entirely to the English .


North America	LOCATION	might have been English , had
John Cabot	PERSON	never lived ; but the fact remains that it is English as the result of what he accomplished .

		His voyage is the first link in the chain of events that has given the hegemony of the Western world to an English-speaking nation .

		His career ought , therefore , to possess an especial interest for us as a nation .

		Although the
Cabot	PERSON	literature has assumed considerable proportions , there has heretofore been no biography of the two men , father and son , suited to the needs of the general reader and at the same time em - bodying the results of the latest historical re - search .

		Such a book has recently been written by Mr.
C. Raymond Beazley	PERSON	of Merton Col - lege ,
Oxford	LOCATION	, and published in the series of '' Builders of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		A similar book might with equal propriety be included among the brief biographies devoted to the '' Makers of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The distinguishing characteristic of Mr.
Beazley	PERSON	's book is his making the original doc - uments relating to the Cabots the '' backbone '' of his narrative .

		This mode of treatment has a decided advantage in that it shows the reader precisely what the evidence in support of par - ticular conclusions is , and how the history of past times is reconstructed from obscure and scattered materials .

		The method is especially well adapted to a life of the Cabots by reason of the small number and brevity of the docu - ments that we have relating to them .

		Mr.
Beazley	PERSON	does not write as entertainingly of old maps and musty manuscripts as does Mr.

		Fiske , and he fails at times to set out with suf - ficient emphasis the salient points of his story ; but as a whole the work is excellently done .

		A syllabus of documents and a bibliography of Cabot literature are given in an appendix .

		It would have been a convenience had references to the syllabus been included in the body of the text .

		Mr.
Beazley	PERSON	's conclusions upon the principal controverted points in the lives of the Cabots may be briefly stated .

		He thinks that the data are insufficient for a precise determination of the landfall of the first voyage , and that we must content ourselves with placing it somewhere between
Cape Breton	LOCATION	and the south coast of Labrador , with
Cape Race	ORGANIZATION	,
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, as likely a place as any for '' Priina Vista . ''

		He rejects
Harrisse	ORGANIZATION	's theory that the island of St.
John	PERSON	is fictitious , but regards its identification as not at present possible .

		The evidence of the ''
Cabot	PERSON	map '' is accepted as fixing the date of landfall at
June 24	DATE	, and
Pasqualigo	ORGANIZATION	's story that
Cabot	PERSON	coasted three hundred leagues is discred - ited as an exaggeration .

		The evidence of the payment of
Cabot	LOCATION	's pension , discovered last year in the archives of
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	, is regarded as positive proof of his safe return from his second voyage .


Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	is set down as Venetian born , a conclusion that seems reasonably certain , notwithstanding the controversy that has grown out of the desire to make him out an Englishman .

		Mr.
Beazley	PERSON	considers it probable , in the absence of positive evidence either way , that
Sebastian	PERSON	accom - panied his father upon both voyages , but that his share in them was unimportant .

		He con - cludes that he was not in any real sense the author of the so-called '' Cabot map , '' but that he furnished material for some of the inscrip - tions and consented that the whole should pass under his name .

		The resuscitation of the south - erly landfall , after a suppression of forty years , was intended to please the English government , but was put out in such a way that it could easily be repudiated if the Spanish authorities objected .

		In his estimate of
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	's character , Mr.
Beazley	PERSON	strikes a happy mean .

		He admits that he appropriated his father 's achievements , and that he was intriguing and deceitful , but contends that he could not have won and retained the exalted opinion in which he was held by the foremost of his contempo - raries had he been the unmitigated charlatan '' that Harrisse would have us believe .


Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	's title to fame is quite dis - tinct from the voyages of his father with which 1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 his name is usually associated , and rests mainly upon the expedition of
1553	DATE	in search of a Northeast passage .

		That he was the chief pro- moter of this voyage is clear from the fact that the charter of the
Muscovy Company	ORGANIZATION	made him Governor for life , for the reason that '' he was the chief est setter forth of this journey . ''

		Mr.
Beazley	PERSON	fully recognizes the importance of this expedition .

		The voyages of
John Cabot	PERSON	, he says , had not really aroused the nation .

		It was the enterprise of
1553	DATE	that awoke the English people to their mission in exploration , trade , and colonization ; it was the real beginning of English exploring activity , wider commercial ambitions , and of national interest in schemes of discovery : it was the starting-point of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	.

		In the initiation of this great movement
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	played the leading role , and he is entitled to the credit for having done so , notwithstanding the fact that the re - sults achieved were not the ones intended .

		There is one phase of the voyage of
1553	DATE	which Mr.
Beazley	PERSON	and the other biographers of
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	overlook .

		That voyage was the first application of the trading corporation to purposes of discovery .

		It was a new appli - cation of an old force , analogous in the phys - ical world to the application of steam to navi - gation .

		The
Muscovy Company	ORGANIZATION	, which resulted from this voyage , was the prototype of the great corporations by which
England	ORGANIZATION	acquired em - pire in
India	LOCATION	, planted her colonies in
America	LOCATION	, preempted the region of
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's Bay , and in our own day has exploited
Central Africa	LOCATION	.

		The fact that the ships of the
Muscovy Company	ORGANIZATION	brought the first colonists to
Jamestown	LOCATION	is inter - esting as showing how closely English schemes for discovery in diverse directions were con - nected .


Spain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	devoted infinite pains to the up-building of colonial empires , but their colonies were weakened by paternal - ism , impoverished by corruption , and alienated by despotism .

		England left everything to indi - vidual enterprise , and individual enterprise operated through the corporation .

		The result has been the expansion of little
England	LOCATION	into two great English-speaking nations , whose com - bined power extends to every corner of the globe .

		Upon the threshold of this movement stood
John	PERSON	and
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	.

		The one furnished a basis for the claim which
England	LOCATION	made at a later date to
North America	LOCATION	; the other aroused an interest in foreign trade and discovery , which ripened into colonization , and pointed the way by which success was achieved .

		WILLIAM MORRIS : His WORK AND His In a large measure , Mr.
Vallance	PERSON	's book on
William Morris	PERSON	is a revelation , since it is , per - haps , the first time the entire product of Mor - ris 's life has been arranged so as to be evident as a whole .

		Hitherto , such of us as possessed any of the poetic virus have concerned our - selves with his poetry , vaguely conscious that he also '' made things . ''

		Such as were crafts - men have admired and studied his product in their especial line , unconscious for the most part that he also '' wrote things . ''

		Biblioma - niacs of course centred their interest at
Kelms	LOCATION	- cott .

		Here , however , we have a record , an ad - mirably impersonal one , which yet gives a grave impression of a marvellous many-sided person - ality ; and as this impersonal record piles up effort after effort , successful all , endeavor after endeavor in many varied and different lines , achievement after achievement , the effect is received of a product whose bulk and quality make it a fit monument for six men .

		If we regard but the mere output , the result is over - whelming ; but this again has to be empha - sized by the fact that in many cases the actual method had to be invented or rediscovered .

		Taking the case of tapestry , Mr.
Val	PERSON	lance tells us that : '' At the time when it occurred to him to start hand - weaving according to the ancient plan , it had become extinct in this country -LSB-
England	LOCATION	-RSB- .

		In default of any existing instance available where the actual weaving process might be observed ,
Morris	PERSON	had to pick up the details of the craft as best he might from an old French official handbook , published prior to the Revolution .

		He caused a handloom to be set up in his bedroom at
Kelmscott House	ORGANIZATION	, and , so as not to let this new under - taking of his interfere with his ordinary occupations , he used to rise betimes , and practice weaving in the early hours of the morning . ''

		-LRB- Page 113 , et seq. -RRB- Turning from this description to the beauti - ful illustrations of some ultimate results at pages 118 and 120 , we have a very vivid pre - sentation of a notable achievement , albeit one which the world , especially the American world , regards with suspicion .

		Similar action was , un - fortunately , necessary in nearly every craft with which
Morris	PERSON	concerned himself , and in dye - ing , weaving , stained glass , printing , stamping , as well as tapestry , he had first to lay new foundations for the art , or else to dig deeply in search of them through the rubbish with which our own and preceding generations had buried them .

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		344 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, an essay on inceptions or origins , this book would be a veritable mine of examples ; and the initial experiments , conducted in scullerys , attics , and coach-houses , are , in view of their developments , most inspiring incidents for workers .

		In realizing the astonishing sum of
Morris	PERSON	's work , it is not only the sheer industry which is remarkable , but the industry animated by a high ideal , a fine enthusiasm .

		Mere industry is often pitiful .

		The application and self - surrender necessary to establish and carry on most of the large industrial organizations is painful in view of the fact that the only outcome of this good effort is an addition to the sum of existing hideousness .

		But industry which gives knowl - edge where before was only vague groping , which recalls to the social memory delights and possibilities it was in danger of forgetting , which evolves principles out of confusion , in that sort of industry lays the significance of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		This sort of effort is always viewed askance by the public and damned with the popular anathema of impracticability , because , first , the popular mind is very slow to comprehend any other actuating motive than that of self-interest , and , secondly , it is slower to perceive that , tested even by popular standards , human inter - est as a motive is always the most practical .

		The ordinary producer says , '' Unless I make my work bad I can not sell it , '' and makes it as bad as possible in order to sell as much as possible , cheerfully conscious that he can always furnish an alibi of bad intentions .

		Mr.
Edward Lloyd	PERSON	, in an interesting essay , has shown that it has been those men who had the courage to give the public that which it did not want , but which it was good for it to have , who have made the greatest sales : Mr.
Raskin	PERSON	, in the actual amount the public has paid to possess writings with which it violently disagreed ;
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, in the actual amount paid to possess his industrial products by a public who clamored for picto - rial hearth-rugs ; and
Wagner	PERSON	, in the fabulous amounts paid by the public to hear musio which at first evoked only witticisms and hoots .

		This standard of narrow self-interest is like that numerical standard of certain primitive races , the hand , a standard which does not promote counting , but limits counting beyond a cer - tain number .

		Morris , following
Ecclesiastes	LOCATION	, preached his art propaganda from the text , '' Let every man rejoice in his own works , for that is his portion , '' and that was his practise .

		The industrial mind , limited by its standard of self-interest , and unable to count so many men , ingenuously paraphrased the text as '' Let every man rejoice in
Morris	LOCATION	's works . ''

		Hence the many imitations .

		These will of course pass away , as did the bulk of the spurious
Chippen	PERSON	- dales and Sheratons ; and when the air is clear again we shall see
Morris	PERSON	occupying his true and very important position in the historical sequence of art .

		At present the air is not clear ; but Mr.
Vallance	PERSON	's book , with its strong current of sane and impersonal record , will do much to clear it , especially in connection with that prize con - undrum , Was
Morris	PERSON	a mediae valist , or was he not ?

		This is a very difficult subject to discuss , because nobody ever troubles to define accurately what is meant by the medievalist
Morris	PERSON	was supposed to be .

		Broadly inter - preted , the accusation is that
Morris	PERSON	reproduced European mediaeval designs , decoration , furni - ture , glass , and printing , which were well enough for the times and manners from which they grew , but which are not indigenous to our own conditions and are consequently un - important exotics .

		I have even heard the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	called a Society for the Sup - pression of Knowledge , on account of the limited editions of its publications .

		Morris , of course , never proposed to supply the whole world with books ; he only determined that what books he did supply should be good in every particular .

		With regard to the other productions , it must be remembered that there are certain things which are persistent , certain principles which always obtain .

		This is true of principles of design and construction no less than of such O accepted principles as the equality of the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle , or the fal - lacy of counting chickens before they are hatched , principles which have been persist - ent factors in geometry and conduct from very early periods , the acceptance of which does not lay one open to charges of anachronism , as in the present case .

		One is fortunately able to retort to this charge with a counter-accusation , a mode highly recommended by
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer in the '' Art of Controversy . ''

		The anti- mediaevalists have no historic sense .

		If they were able to project themselves back into early Victorian days they would find an age clut - tered up with very bad Greek imitations , very bad Renaissance imitations , very bad Gothic imitations , combined with our own proud con - tributions of horsehair upholstery and cast - iron fireplaces .

		These represented Art and Progress at the first
Crystal Palace Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	where
Morris & Co.	ORGANIZATION	made their first exhibits of
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 furniture and tapestry which were awarded prizes .

		In designing these articles ,
Morris	PERSON	had first of all been obliged to burrow back , so to speak , through the horsehair suits , cast-iron fireplaces , neo-Grec and Wyatt-Gothic abom - inations , to find the lost thread of the princi - ples of industrial art and applied design .

		These he found for various arts in various periods in various places , and carefully avoiding the sharp edges of cast-iron and stucco , he has drawn it down and pieced on to it , and placed it care - fully in our hands , that the addition of our spinning may carry it forward into the next age .

		The astonishing point is , that as long as people merely copied old forms they were placidly accepted as art without question ; but as soon as one man began to work with the old spirit , which is old and new , and ever will be , though disregarded sometimes and forgotten , a protest is evoked .

		Laws and principles are persistent factors , with slightly varying aspects for each generation .

		As
Tennyson	PERSON	, with the mythical forms of
Arthur	PERSON	and his Court , ex - pressed the persistent principles of honor , truth , and justice , as
Wagner	PERSON	uses not
Sieg	ORGANIZATION	- fried but Siegfried 's strength and
Parsifal	ORGANIZATION	's purity , so
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, whatever the form -LRB- and no one has called
Tennyson	PERSON	mediaeval , in spite of his association with
Malory	PERSON	-RRB- uses the everlast - ing principles of art .

		That is the difference between him and his forerunners and imitators , a difference of spirit ; and it is not the par - ticular forms he uses which are the essential , but the fact that his decoration has two planes , that its line is strong and supple , that mass and void are well balanced , and that all rela - tions are organic ones .

		The whole point is trivial , and were it not that in the minds of those people whom
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	calls social cement it militates against the sweet , strong , healthy influence of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, it would be a neglectable quality .

		But having pursued it so far , it now becomes intensely interesting .

		For it is plain that if a knowledge of decorative origins were more widespread
Morris	PERSON	would have been branded as a Persian also .

		For he not only , as stated , went back to the time when a particular craft reached its highest development , but he also went to any country where that occurred ; and it is in cer - tain products of
Persia	LOCATION	that the best manifes - tation of certain principles of design may be found .


India	LOCATION	at present is an interesting con - undrum in this particular regard .

		There the debasing influence of the English occupation on the indigenous arts is becoming painfully apparent , and it is being further degraded by the manufacture , by the government , in the prisons and reformatories , of carpets and woven goods of an exceeding cheap and nasty descrip - tion .

		There is no particular necessity for the government to manufacture carpets in the jails , and all it cares for is to make the shops self - supporting ; so the superintendents have to work down to the level of a mercantile taste which wants a cheap grade of goods .

		The con - tract for entirely furnishing the new vice - regal palace at
Simla	LOCATION	was given to a manufacturer in the
Tottenham Court Road	ORGANIZATION	, with the swift result that the Guikwar of
Baroda	LOCATION	also refurnished his palace throughout with European stuffs and furniture .

		If the disaster stopped here we might still be complacent , and even slightly sorry for the Viceroy and the Guikwar envi - roned by
Tottenham Court Road	ORGANIZATION	products in a land of beautiful woodwork and weavings ; but we are much more intimately concerned .


Baden	PERSON	-
Powell	PERSON	has told us how , as a consequence of these acts of the high , the skilful carpenters of
India	LOCATION	, with a taste for progress and modern improvements , now abandon their old principles of ornament and forms , and hasten to produce copies of English furniture the designs for which they procure from the rough cuts and perspectives of the manufacturer 's catalogue .

		The importation of analine dyes is also increas - ing rapidly , and a proportionate substitution of strong garish tints for the old soft-color beauty of Indian fabrics is taking place .

		This degradation of the carpet-making , wood - work , weaving and dyeing of
India	LOCATION	is an exact parallel to what occurred to English arts and crafts during the Post - Renaissance period ; and the question is , when they are unbearably degraded will
India	LOCATION	say in the twenty-fifth century produce a
Ruskin	PERSON	and a Morris to gather together for human delight that which we are so wantonly destroying in the nineteenth century ?

		The most hopeful part of the situa - tion is that
Morris	PERSON	perceived the tendency , and immediately started the manufacture of carpets . ''

		The East , '' he said , '' is going to fail us ; therefore we had better make our own carpets . ''

		This has raised the standard of design in En - gland ; and certain French and American firms , large customers of the Indian jails , have sup - plied them with some of the best examples of the Indian mediaeval work , and insist that their orders be filled with copies of these .

		In a debased age we have to hold on to the best existing examples .

		This action of the exporters , however , unfortunately does not affect the dye - 34t > THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, ing or woodwork .

		If anyone will look at this slow but relentless degradation and killing of the native arts of
India	LOCATION	, and realize the enor - mous effort which would be necessary to oppose it , even at this initial stage , he will have some idea of the work done by
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	in a land where such deterioration had been in process for a long period .

		Mr. V al lance 's book itself seems beautifully printed and bound .

		It is , of course , too heavy , but it has an index , and the illustrations are admirable .

WASHINGTON	LOCATION	IN HIS DAILY LIFE .

		* A melancholy interest attaches to the publi - cation of ''
Washington	LOCATION	after the Revolution , '' by the late
William Spohn Baker	PERSON	, the
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia antiquarian and connoisseur .

		It seemed peculiarly fitting that this indefatigable collec - tor and investigator should have devoted him - self to gathering biographies of the foremost American and to collecting facts concerning him .

		The addition of a volume on '' Washing - ton after the Revolution '' completes the chain begun several years since in '' Early Sketches of
Washington	LOCATION	'' and in `` The Itinerary of General
Washington	LOCATION	from
1775	DATE	to
1783	DATE	. ''

		It is sufficient for our interest in most men to know the great deeds they accomplished , the benefits they left to posterity , and the best points in their respective characters .

		But the love and veneration felt for
Washington	LOCATION	by his countrymen cause them to demand the most minute details concerning him .

		It is not suf - ficient to know that he existed day by day , but we would know precisely what he was doing day by day .

		Hence the thought of Mr.
Baker	PERSON	in supplying a calendar in which the where - abouts and occupation of
Washington	LOCATION	could be described from his journals and letters , as well as from records , newspapers , and the writings of others .

		The public has had so much of the tradi - tional , the sentimental , and the frothy , concern - ing the great Virginian , ranging in time from
Weems	PERSON	to

		away his aristocratic feeling , to explain away those outbursts of Southern temper , to heat up that cold reserve in which he commonly cloaked himself , is to lose sight of the man in the demi - god ; but in contemplating him day by day in Mr.
Baker	PERSON	's record one can not lose sight of the very busy and thrifty planter , plain , prac - tical , yet never so much engaged in private affairs as to neglect his duty as a citizen .

		There is a fascination in accompanying the great man in his daily occupations and amuse - ments , chasing the fox in
Virginia	LOCATION	for a half - day and disgusted at ending with a '' cold scent , '' receiving guests of state in the national capital on New Year 's Day , attending the the - atre , assisting at a lottery drawing , overseeing the carving of the city of
Washington	LOCATION	out of the primeval woods , complaining about a domes - tic crisis caused by the flight of the negro cook , growing '' quite merry '' over the champagne , sitting to the portrait painters like a sheep in the shambles , and making the little meteorological entries in his journal until the hand of dis - ease and approaching death grasped the pen after the entry of '' Mer 48 at
Night	TIME	, '' on Fri - day ,
December 13 , 1799	DATE	.

		The most amusing of the many glimpses afforded us come from the French tourists , vol - untary and involuntary , who , having mistaken the American political revolution for a French social revolution , are rather stunned by the surroundings of
Washington	LOCATION	as president and as ex-president , and are at a loss to understand the superior social standing assumed by him and allowed by his fellows .

		But they content themselves with dwelling on the more than mor - tal benignancy of his countenance and the more than human wisdom of his judgment .

		Being strictly a compilation , the volume lacks the impress of an author 's individuality .

		None will claim that it was a useless task , since the volume will be a storehouse of accessible mate - rial for the student and a source of delight to young people interested in contemplating the character of the true
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It clothes with flesh and blood the classic statue erected by the panegyrists .

		Like its prototype , the dictionary , this book makes good reading at any point where it may chance to be opened .

		The compiler has supplied footnotes explana - tory of the names mentioned in the context , and at times has inserted necessary connecting notes .

		It is difficult to imagine any improve - ment on the execution of the plan .

		THE DIAL 347 RECENT STUDIES IN CURRENCY AND FINANCE .

		* Recent attempts to solve the currency problem show a disposition to treat the subject in a calmer and less confident manner than was customary a few years ago .

		Each party to the controversy has come to recognize the validity of at least some of its opponents ' arguments , and to appreciate that a treatment of the question which gives due consid - eration to these contrary opinions is likely to lead to more permanent , if less positive , results than were obtained by the more dogmatic methods of earlier writers .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	, the author of '' International Money Conferences , '' is doubtless right in his opinion that '' an understanding of the Silver Question can not be had from conditions that obtain in the
United States	LOCATION	alone . ''

		He has set forth , in a clear and gen - erally impartial manner , the international circum - stances that have been influential in determining the trend of our monetary and financial history dur - ing the last thirty years .

		Four international con - ferences have been held during that time , and it would seem that the chances of securing an inter - national agreement have been in about an inverse ratio to the number of times the effort to secure such an agreement has been made .

		The Conference of
1867	DATE	came near to reaching an agreement for an international coinage system based on a gold stand - ard and on the French system of coinage , in spite of the fact that the
Latin Monetary Union	ORGANIZATION	, then only two years old , had adopted the bimetallic stand - ard .

		The delegates to the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	, for the most part , seemed enthusiastic over the idea ; and had it not been for the Franco-Prussian war , and the down - fall of
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	, who had been the chief promoter of the universal coinage scheme , the advo - cates of international monetary unity might have seen their hopes realized .

		For nearly a decade the trend of monetary history was in the direction of the gold standard .


Germany	LOCATION	abandoned bimetallism ; so did the Scandinavian states , and
Holland	LOCATION	prepared to do so .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	, the gold standard , which the Amer - ican delegate to the
Paris	LOCATION	Conference of

		or without , and such opposition as did arise came '' from commercial centres like
New York City	LOCATION	. ''

		The cause of the gold standard was championed by the very men who later denounced the suspension of the silver coinage as a secret crime .

		But the decrease in the production of gold and the efforts of European countries to establish a gold standard began to cause a feeling of alarm lest the supply of that metal should prove insufficient .

		At the same time , the increase in silver production , the sale of silver by European countries , and the substitution of council bills for silver in the trade between En - gland and
India	LOCATION	, caused a fall in the price of that metal .

		An effort to restore silver to its old place in the coinage of the leading nations led to the Conference of
1878	DATE	.

		This was the first international attempt to establish a bimetallic standard .

		The suggestion of the conference came from
Holland	LOCATION	, although the invitations were issued by the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Noth - ing of a practical nature was accomplished at this meeting .


Italy	LOCATION	was the only European country to give strong support to the propositions presented by the American delegates .

		Other countries seemed anxious lest the further adoption of the gold stand - ard should lessen the supplies of that metal for their own use ; but they were not willing themselves to abandon that standard .

		The next conference , that of
1881	DATE	, accomplished even less than its predecessor .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	were willing to make what they regarded as concessions to silver , provided the
United States	LOCATION	and the
Latin Union	LOCATION	would reopen their mints to the free coinage of the white metal .

		But the French and American delegates considered the concessions unimportant , and decided that '' nothing could result till the stress of circumstances had become more severe in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		The Con - ference adjourned temporarily , to allow the French and American governments to formulate a practical programme , but it never reassembled .

		Eleven years passed before the third attempt was made to secure an international bimetallic agree - ment .

		During this interval , however , the friends of silver were not idle .

		Disregarding the advice of the delegates to the Conference of
1881	DATE	, the Amer - ican supporters of silver began an agitation in favor of free coinage by the
United States	LOCATION	alone .

		The passage of a free-coinage measure was prevented only by the enactment of the bullion-purchase act of
1890	DATE	.

		From the standpoint of international bimet - alism , this silver agitation and legislation was highly detrimental .

		It prevented the very `` stress of cir - cumstances , '' upon which the French and American international bimetallists had depended , from being severely felt in either
Germany	LOCATION	or
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and continued
Europe	LOCATION	in the '' state of expectancy '' of still further silver legislation in
America	LOCATION	.

		Under these circumstances , the Conference of
1892	DATE	accom - plished nothing .

		It continued in session only a month , considered a number of plans for increasing the use of silver as money , debated once more the 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, question of bimetallism , but did not even take a vote on any of the plans discussed .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's conclusion , which certainly seems justified by the history he has given us , is that the cause of international bimetallism will prosper only when '' the
United States	LOCATION	stop begging and pleading and voting for free silver , and go to work earnestly to secure and to keep gold , '' a programme of action which monometallists will heartily endorse , although for quite different reasons than the desire to promote international bimetallism .

		Some of the difficulties to be overcome before the cooperation of
England	LOCATION	can be secured in the estab - lishment of a bimetallic standard are exposed by Major
Leonard Darwin	PERSON	in his book on '' Bimetallism . ''

		Major
Darwin	PERSON	may not voice the sentiments of the majority of English bimetallism , he would prob - ably not profess to do so , but a perusal of his book will show the reader that the unwillingness of
Great Britain	LOCATION	to enter into an international bimetallic union with the
United States	LOCATION	and the countries composing the
Latin Union	LOCATION	is not entirely due to British obsti - nancy or to the opposition of the creditor classes .

		The reasons for supporting bimetallism in
England	LOCATION	are , in part , quite different from the arguments put forward in its support in the
United States	LOCATION	, or even on the Continent .

		In this country the demand for bimetallism in so far as it is not made by silver mine-owners comes mainly from those who are seeking a higher price for their commodities , especi - ally agricultural produce .

		They believe that it would inaugurate an era of rising prices , to take the place of the period of falling prices which has continued for a quarter-century .

		But in
England	LOCATION	there is little demand for a rise in the price of commodities .

		The agricultural classes have little influence as com - pared to the commercial and laboring classes .

		Neither of these latter classes desires high prices of commodi - ties .

		The arguments in behalf of bimetallism which appeal most strongly to the English trading and industrial classes are -LRB- 1 -RRB- that it would establish a steady rate of exchange with silver-using coun - tries , such as
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	, and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that it would increase English trade with those countries by check - ing the competition of the native producers .

		They do not desire , therefore , to enter into an agreement to coin silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 , or at the French ratio of 15 to 1 .

		Major
Darwin	PERSON	argues in favor of the market ratio at the time of the international agreement , let that ratio be what it may , 20 to 1 or 40 to 1 .

		This would , he thinks , tend to keep prices from falling as much as they have fallen under the gold standard , and yet would prevent them from rising , and thus the imputation of dishonesty due to the introduction of the double standard would be avoided .

		If the object of bimetallists , he says , is to force up prices , '' I , for one , am prepared to meet them as an open foe . ''

		Silver , he thinks , used as a single standard corresponds closely to the '' com - modity standard , '' t. e. , one which keeps the price of commodities at a level .

		Gold , used alone , corre - sponds more nearly to the '' labor standard , '' t. .

		, one which keeps the output of a certain quantity of labor at a constant price .

		The perfect standard , our author says , lies between these two limits , but approaches nearer the commodity standard than the labor standard ; and market-ratio bimetallism , he thinks , would furnish this perfect standard .

		H e does not seem hopeful of securing the necessary interna - tional agreements for the adoption of market-ratio bimetallism , but says that `` this is no argument against trying to obtain them . ''

		To frame a plan of monetary reform which thall embody , '' first , the essential principles of the advo - cates of the gold standard ; second , of the advocates of free silver coinage ; and third , of that large body of American citizens who regard government paper money as superior to bank-notes , '' is a task which to ordinary mortals seems beyond human power to accomplish .

		But Mr.
William Brough	PERSON	, the author of `` Open Mints and Free Banking , '' does not regard the task as especially difficult of accomplishment .

		On the contrary , he presents us , in 170 small pages , with a plan which , in his opinion , will not only settle the differences between the above mentioned parties , but will prevent a recurrence of '' currency panics '' in the future .

		He believes that the currency diffi - culties in the past and present have been due mainly to the attempts of governments to maintain gold and silver as equivalent legal tenders at a given ratio , and to determine in advance what supply of money is necessary for local industrial and trading com - munities .

		He is of the opinion that to these com - munities should be left the task of supplying money as their needs arise , and that each community should be left to adopt as its measure of value the metal which best serves its particular needs .

		He urges , therefore , that all laws which go to make silver and gold dollars an equivalent tender should be repealed .

		He would then open the mints to free coinage of both metals without any definite ratio , and would allow all banks to issue notes subject to redemption on demand in the metallic money which they represent .

		The Secretary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	should not be obliged to pay out and to keep in circulation any specified kind of money .

		As a forerunner to these changes , our author would have the nation pledge itself to the payment in gold of its present outstanding obli - gations .

		He displays considerable acumen in dis - cussing monetary principles , but does not make it very clear how these principles support the changes proposed by him .

		** Norman 's Universal Cambist '' is a practical treatise on exchange , whose main object , as stated by its author , is '' to set forth in the plainest man - ner possible , with examples -LRB- 1 -RRB- the most simple and direct modes of arriving at the world 's fixed and absolute par of exchange ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the mode of determining the equivalent commercial exchanges limited by the cost of the transmission of metal ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- coinage charges ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- interest for the use of money when such a charge is included in the rate of exchange . ''

		Besides the valuable tables which the book contains , it gives in the form of sixteen

		THE DIAL 349 short articles what the author considers to be the true '' science of money . '' ''

		Republican Responsibility for Present Currency Perils '' is a republication of a series of articles written by Mr.
Perry Belmont	PERSON	for the ''
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Citizen '' last
December	DATE	.

		The author finds the Republican party responsible for '' the unconstitu - tional greenbacks , '' for the suppression of the note - issues of
State	ORGANIZATION	banks ; for the establishment of the system of national banks , '' more powerful if they could be united in the hands of one political party than the ' bank ' destroyed by
Jackson	PERSON	'' ; for the abandonment of bimetallism , and for the subsequent uncertainty in regard to the currency standard .

		As a political pamphlet , the work may possess some value .

		As a serious scientific study in our financial history , it is of little importance .

		The two Demo - cratic administrations since the Civil War have , it is true , been seriously handicapped by previous Republican evasions in currency matters , but the record of the votes in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	shows that neither party can be freed from responsibility .

		For a proper understanding of our recent cur - rency difficulties , no work has been so much needed as a clear and compact history of the financial opera - tions of the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	since the close of the Civil War .

		This we now have , in Mr.
A. D. Noyes	PERSON	's '' Thirty Years of
American Finance	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		As its title indicates , the work concerns itself not so much with the currency problem as with the broader aspects of public finance ; but the reader is made to appreciate , as perhaps he never has done before , how much the late confusion and distress , and even the present uncertainty , in regard to our currency are due to the unwise financial management of the Civil War and the subsequent delay in the refund - ing operations and in the contraction of our paper currency .

		The author shows no hesitation in his criticism of either men or measures , and his own opinions are never in doubt ; but on the whole , the book is less extreme in its attitude than might have been expected from an editorial writer on the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		Opinions must differ widely concerning many public acts and the policies of many public men , and there are doubtless many who will find the author 's treatment of Secretaries Sher - man and
Windom	PERSON	unusually severe .

		But there is no evidence of a desire to treat these men , or others , unfairly .

		The criticism is a natural result of the author 's attitude toward the financial problems which these men were called upon to solve .


Finan	PERSON	- cial measures and financial events are not treated by themselves , but their relation to the political history and economic development of the country is kept steadily in mind .

		Reliance is not placed upon sec - ondary authorities ; the record is entirely from original sources , and the author speaks with the authority of a man long accustomed to dealing with the material which furnishes him with his evidence .

		The book is written in a clear and even style , and , in spite of the exact information which it contains , the record is never lacking in interest .

		In passing to Professor
Durand	PERSON	's book , '' The Finances of
New York City	LOCATION	, '' we leave entirely the field of currency , and have to do with questions of public finance alone .

		The field of local finance in the
United States	LOCATION	is one filled with difficulties and one which has hitherto remained almost entirely unworked .

		Professor
Durand	PERSON	is the first writer to present us with anything like a comprehensive treat - ment of the finances of even one municipality .

		In spite of the small geographical area with which the book deals , the extent of the financial field is by no means insignificant .

		Only four States of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	have a population as large as that of the
Greater New York	LOCATION	; the public expenditures of the consoli - dated city are nearly two - thirds as large as those of all the States in the
Union	LOCATION	, while the city 's gross debt exceeds that of all the States combined .

		The financial history of
New York	LOCATION	resembles that of most of our American municipalities in teaching chiefly what not to do .

		The government of our cities is generally recognized as the most conspicuous failure in our public administration , and it is scarcely too much to say that our next greatest failure has been in the management of our finances .

		Hence , when we find these two failures combined , the record is not a pleasing one to patriotic Americans .


New York	LOCATION	's experience with the Tweed Ring is remark - able , not because of its exceptional character , but because of its magnitude , for practically the same record of the stealing of public funds can be found in the history of franchise-granting and the con - struction of public buildings in all our large cities .

		The results of this disgraceful chapter in
New York	LOCATION	's financial history may still be seen , not only in the enormous debt , amounting to about sixty dollars per capita , but in the character of the char - ter government with its many anomalies that has prevailed since that time .

		About one-third of Pro- fessor
Durand	PERSON	's book is given up to a history of the city 's finances to the end of Tweed rule ; the re - mainder is devoted to a description and criticism of the financial system since that time .

		While the adoption of the
Greater New York	LOCATION	charter undoubt - edly furnishes a fitting closing point for a treatment of the city 's finances , it is in some ways to be re - gretted that the author did not continue his historical narrative down to this point , and confine his descrip - tion of the present system to the workings under the new charter .

		In this way he would have avoided many administrative details which possess little interest because not a part of the present system .

		The new charter itself receives from the author some sharp criticisms .

		The budget system , the management of the sinking funds , and the power to authorize debt issues , are faulty under the present charter , as they were under the old one .

		Reform in these as in other matters will come only with the growth of the civic spirit among the people , and with a better understanding of the need of the city and its methods of administration .

		To the accomplishment of these ends Professor
Durand	PERSON	's book should prove an important means .

		Heraldry for Ameri - cans '' -LRB- The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a title no t i j k , .

		that of the famous chapter on snakes in the history of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		At least it would be , were it not for the highly reassuring message its author , Dr.
Edward S. Holden	PERSON	, brings to the socially aspiring in the statement that it is entirely legal and permissible for any person to assume coat armor , provided only he does not take to himself the armo - rial bearings of someone else .


Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	sought and obtained an achievement of arms , we are told ; and it is said to be altogether likely that the stripes in the national ensign were obtained from
Washington	LOCATION	's well-known blazoning .

		Recalling the difficulty some of
Franklin	PERSON	's kinsfolk had , a few years ago , in obtaining admission into one of the so-called patriotic societies , the rather pitiful pretension of his shield does not seem to have made a pronounced impression upon his countrymen , who based their objection entirely , if memory serves aright , upon his plebeian birth and democratic bearing .

		So far as
Washington	LOCATION	's '' argent , two bars gules , in chief two mullets of the last '' having provided the field for the '' grand union '' flag under which the thirteen colonies typified themselves by thirteen stripes alter - nately red and white ,
Washington	LOCATION	has never been shown to have had the slightest connection with it , nor is it needful to seek further than the well-known banner of the free city of
Lubeck	LOCATION	for its pattern .

		Dr.
Holden	PERSON	illustrates , moreover , the fatality which seems to befall heralds when they attempt to blazon the bearings in the great seal of state of the nation .

		He points out specifically that the shield in it has seven white and six red stripes for no earthly reason that has ever been discovered and that the blue '' chief '' is starless , those luminaries having been reserved for the crest These are facts which the American appears to spurn , for all the battle - ships bear the national shield with more red stripes than white on their prows , and everybody inserts stars to suit his fancy upon it .

		Glorious examples of ignorance in these particulars may also be seen in the coats-of-arms of the
City of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	and of the
State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, both assuming designs in open viola - tion of the laws each has passed , as well as of the laws of heraldry .

		It is easy to find excuses for an alder - man or state legislator in respect of such matters ; but what is to be said of Mr.
Holden	PERSON	's blazoning the American shield as '' argent , six pallets gules , a chief azure , '' which would make the red stripes in it wider than the white , when the statute in such case made and provided reads simply , '' Pale ways of thir - teen Pieces Argent and Gules ; a Chief Azure '' ?

		When Captain
Totten	PERSON	published his work on the Great Seal , he succeeded in reading '' paleways '' as a plural noun , and discoursed learnedly about a '' pale way . ''

		The word is , of course , an adverb , the equivalent of '' paly , '' meaning a perpendicular dividing of the shield .

		Mr.
Holden	PERSON	also errs in of minor SeotcHpoeU .

		describing the glory above the shield by way of crest , though consultation of the act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	would have put him right .

		Finally , the work should have set forth the various badges adopted by the `` hereditary '' societies , if only to show how much like a profusely decorated foreigner an American of happy ancestry can look .

		We commend to the ambitions in such matters
Warburton	PERSON	's wise dictum : '' High birth is a thing which I never knew anyone to disparage except those who had it not ; and I never knew anyone to make a boast of it who had anything else to be proud of . ''

		One could hardly find a more incon - gruous couple than
James Thomson	PERSON	and
Robert Fergusson	PERSON	, whose lives have been lately added to the '' Famous Scots Series '' -LRB- imported by
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		They may , per - haps , be rightly called a couple , for they were both poets , both Scotch , both of the
eighteenth century	DATE	, although not contemporary , for they followed , as it happened , one upon the other ,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	living through the
first half of the century	DATE	, and
Fergusson	PERSON	the
third quarter	DATE	only .

		Probably very few people read either now .


Thomson	ORGANIZATION	is a minor classic , and so pretty certainly unread by the majority ; Fer - gusson can hardly be said ever to have been very generally known outside of
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		But the two men offer two interesting types : one , the hard - working , easy-going poet , in time successful ; the other , the unappreciated and often extravagant genius , living by the hardest efforts and often dying in misery .

		Those are typical artists ' lives , with the trifling exception that with these two there is enough known of them a hundred and fifty years after they are dead to warrant their lives being written .

		The books are different in merit .

		Dr.
A. B. Grosart	PERSON	, who writes that on
Fergusson	PERSON	, is well - known for many engaging qualities which are here more apparent than are his equally well-known drawbacks as an editor .

		He has , too , a more en - couraging subject than has Mr.
Bayne	PERSON	, who perhaps does all that is possible to make
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	an inter - esting figure .

		Thomson was not an interesting man : he seems to have passed calmly through the life of a student at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, and then , on emigrating to
London	LOCATION	, to have gradually gone through the life of a poet of the time , publishing poems and producing plays , supported by tutorship , patron , sinecure , and pension , with no greater incident than imprisonment for debt when ordinary sources of income failed .

		His poetry is not wholly uninteresting historic - ally it is very interesting ; but his life has but little in it to take up one 's time nowadays .

		Fergusson , on the other hand , is still an interesting figure .

		Born almost in poverty , delicate in health , put to drudgery for a living , succumbing finally to mad - ness , and with all this a poet , he is a figure that arouses sympathy .

		An edition of
Fergusson	PERSON	was one of Dr.
Grosart	PERSON	's very early works ; he has , therefore , peculiar opportunities which he makes good use of .

		He haa made a very interesting book ;
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL and though there may not be many -LRB- out of Scot - land -RRB- who will now care for
Fergusson	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , there will be few who will read unmoved the story of
Fergusson	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		All this is as it should be :
Fergusson	PERSON	needed a biography ; most of us will be content with
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's poems .

		Under the title '' Latin Literature of the Empire '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , Dr.
Alfred Gudeman	PERSON	, of the
University of Penn	ORGANIZATION	- sylvania , has undertaken the presentation of char - acteristic selections from Roman writers of con - sequence , beginning with the elder Seneca and extending over a period of four centuries .

		The first volume , covering the prose writers of this period , is now before us .

		The works of fifteen authors are represented , the selections varying in quantity from about fifteen pages for some of the less important authors to seventy for
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Gudeman	PERSON	is thoroughly acquainted with the literature of the imperial period , and his selections are made with due discrimination .

		If , after a hasty examination of the contents , we were asked to suggest anything which ought to have been included in his book and is not , it would be the crushing characterization of Tigellinus in the Annals of Tacitus . ''

		Quo Vadis '' is mentioned in the remarks introductory to the selections from
Petronius	LOCATION	; it would perhaps have been well to show how much more effective Tacitus can be in clear-cut character-painting than
Sienckiewicz	PERSON	.

		Mention of Petronius recalls the wording of Dr.
Gudeman	PERSON	's opening sentence on this author : '' The author of the Satirae is now generally identified with the elegantiae arbiter , or master of ceremonies , under Nero , '' etc. .

		Did Dr.
Gudeman	PERSON	intend this form of statement as shrewdly non-committal ?

		We imagine that he did , as the identification rests on a very slender thread of argument , and he is inclined neither to accept weak arguments over-hastily , nor to give forth any uncertain sound when once he has reached a satis - factory conclusion .

		Students of Latin literature will thank Dr.
Gudeman	PERSON	for this book .

		Most of the authors included are not frequently edited , and their works are difficult of access except in the vicinity of a few large libraries .

		At the same time , their works are valuable in themselves and necessary to any adequate view of the development of the Latin language and literature , as well as that of the subse - quent offshoots from this stem .

		Professor
Gudeman	PERSON	's studies in this field have not blinded his eyes to '' the relative inferiority of this literature as a whole when compared with the noonday splendor of that of the age which preceded it '' ; and it is to be hoped that the increasing tendency to study the authors of the silver age will not be allowed to contribute to the present tendency toward inferior standards in English .

		As a prophylactic against such a result , we advise a careful reading of Quintilian 's famous passage on the younger
Seneca	LOCATION	, which may be found on pages 257-8 of the volume before us .

		We await with interest the second volume , which will be devoted to the poets .

		The French The
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish in Revolution two sizable volumes entitled '' The Reign of Terror '' a miscellaneous collection of narratives of various eye-witnesses of the scenes that disgraced French humanity during the period of the ascendency in revolutionary
France	LOCATION	of the ultra-Jacobin factions .

		These extraordinary documents have been freely drawn on by the histor - ians , and students of the period will find in them much that is familiar .

		The narratives are interspersed with biographical notices and curious anecdotes , and the second volume is devoted mainly to memoirs describing life in the prisons .

		Readers with a taste for the horrible will find their account in these grewsome records .

		Read aright , they are not de - void of instruction .

		In them is writ large the lesson that a social order based on the ruthless oppression and degradation of society 's toilers by a governing caste will go down in blood and ruin when the measure of its iniquity is full .

		What , essentially , was the French Revolution ?

		It was the sudden and complete collapse of the long reign of a corrupt and enfeebled oligarchy that , after generations of misrule , fell in a day a prey to the vengeance of a populace it had educated in misery and crime .

		It used to be the fashion to point warningly to the excesses of the Terror as illustrating the way in which triumphant democracy might be expected to comport itself .

		But experience and calmer reflec - tion have long since shown the hollowness of this cheap reactionary cry .

		The blood shed by brutality at the bidding of fanaticism during the Reign of Terror was on the head of the old regime .

		The monsters that did that work were of its breeding .

		What the character of that work was , the present volumes sufficiently show .

		The edition is founded on the English one of
1826	DATE	.

		There has been some judicious excision and compression , and an account of the maniacal proceedings at Nantes of that most infamous of the revolutionary proconsuls , Carrier , has been added .

		The work is passably edited by Messrs.
P. Pinkerton	PERSON	and
J. H. Ashworth	PERSON	.

		But the grotesque blunder in the old preface which places the number of the victims of the
September	DATE	massacres at '' upwards of twelve thousand '' should have been rectified .

		Twelve hundred is a rather high estimate .

		The volumes are presentably made , and contain two portraits the Princess de Lamballe and Beaumarchais .


Wagner	PERSON	, his music and his theatre .

		Professor
Albert Lavignac	PERSON	, of the
Paris Conservatoire	LOCATION	, has written a book about '' The Music Dramas of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	and his Festival Theatre in
Bayreuth	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- which , although such a book upon such a subject would now seem to be a work of superogation , is hardly to be spared from the - music-lover 's shelves .

		It provides '' a real practical guide to
Bayreuth	LOCATION	, '' and , as such , is distinctly supe - rior to any other book with which we are acquainted .

		There is little of the nebulous aestheticism with which so much of the Wagnerian literature reeks , : J52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, bat instead two classes of facto , presented with the greatest particularity , neglecting nothing , however seemingly trivial , that either prospective pilgrim or visitor on the spot would wish to know .

		The first class of these facts includes details about reaching the musical Mecca of
Bavaria	LOCATION	, about employing the time when one is there , about the architecture of the Schauspielhaus , about the arrangement of mu - sicians and spectators , about the dates and casts of all the performances thus far given , and about the external history of the Wagnerian dramas , including the biography of the composer .

		This section of the work is illustrated by photographs and diagrams .

		The second class of facto includes all those apper - taining to the dramas considered as works of art ; that is , act-by-act analyses of the texts , charts giving the order of entrance of the characters , catalogues of the Leitmotive with copious illustrations in mu - sical notation , and diagrams showing the appear - ance of each motive in each act and scene of all the dramas .

		These are some , but by no means all , of the details provided by this remarkable work .

		We have said that the author eschews aestheticiam in his descriptions , but this does not mean that they are devoid of the critical element .

		On the contrary , they are compact with criticism , sympathetic but sane , and we are quite as much attracted by
M. Lavignac	PERSON	's lucidity of style and sobriety of judg - ment as by the astonishing array of facto which he provides .

		For the book is by no means a dry com - pendium , but for the most part a readable and ex - tremely interesting essay in interpretation , such a book , in short , as we have long wished for , but have hitherto despaired of possessing .

		A im > g-ra * ge ^ ' ne '' certain condescension '' no - criiic of our ticeable in Americans who have lived long abroad is apparent in the pages of Mr.
Eliot Gregory	PERSON	's `` Worldly Ways and Byways '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , the tone is still one of sympathy with the cruder forms of American life , rather than of mere tolerance .

		Being judged by one of ourselves , instead of by foreigners , has this advantage : that the sayings and doings of immigrants and their immediate pro- geny are not taken to be the manifestations of our national life , with the corollary that the criticisms offered by the essayist are directed at those who may heed them the Americans of old descent The sense of aloofness which Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	's European education has given him is heightened by the fact , which he makes evident , of his enjoying the '' best '' society in
New York City	LOCATION	.

		This furnishes him with the point of view of an aristocrat , and enables him to discourse upon the evils of discontent in our mode of living , meaning , apparently , the failure of his countrymen to keep themselves duly arranged in social strata for generation after generation , in accordance with the more stable institutions of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Every American who has progressed far enough along the social ladder to dwell in a household with a '' hired girl '' has felt the same thing , in all probability .

		Some of us have tempered the acerbities of the situa - tion by trying to view it with the eyes of the employed .

		But the wisest look forward to the day when the American genius for mechanics shall have given up an automatic servant , rather than to the establish - ment of caste .

		Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	's comments are fair in the main , making allowances for his early advan - tages , and are certainly pertinent and interesting .

		Still , we can not quite look forward to ourselves as a nation of Gregories .

Mary Dormer Harris	PERSON	, the slow development of a community founded a short time before the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	is placed before the reader panoramic-ally , showing the successive struggles of the church , the burghers , and the robber barons to obtain control of the taxing power .

		There are more centuries in the age of
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	than there are decades in the existence of
Chicago	LOCATION	; and the latter , for all that it has never had any religious questions to solve , is not much further along in commanding its own resources than
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	was during the Wars of the Roses .

		In both cases the struggle is a desperate one , the shrewd intelligence of greed arraying itself against the diffused interest of sleepy or preoccupied citizens , who fairly refuse to arouse themselves until thrust forcibly from their very beds of ease .

		Coventry to-day is governed in a manner which may well be emulated .

		And there are episodes in its history , such as the use its inhab - itants made of their periods of prosperity for the erection of notable public buildings , which are no less exemplary .

		The work is done with a pains - taking which does not suffer itself to degenerate into the mere recital of detail , and is , therefore , a wel - come addition to the '' Social England '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of which it forms a part Grtekartin Greek drama .

		That minuteness of knowledge which is to be looked for in a thesis sub - mitted by a candidate for a doctorate in philosophy in a German university is the apparent thing in '' The Attitude of the Greek Tragedians toward Art '' -LRB-

		So far , the essayist 's purpose is clear .

		But there is another and deeper matter beneath , which makes the essay also one upon the inter - relations of the fine arts during
Athens	LOCATION	' glory , and gives it an interest hardly less catholic than special .

		As a whole , the book is a flattering example of the work American scholars are doing in the worthiest directions .

New York	LOCATION	`` Nation , '' some weeks ago , that it was about as good a thing in its way as we had ever seen ; and after re-reading it we put it carefully away for future reference .

		This admirable historical outline has now been issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in book form under the title of ''
Bismarck	PERSON	and German Unity . ''

		The volume is a comely one of about a hundred pages , and it con - tains a capital frontispiece portrait of its hero .

		We heartily recommend this little book as a royal road to a clear general understanding of
Bismarck	PERSON	and his work .

		Mrs.
John King Van Rensselaer	PERSON	, by dint of patient ransacking of various collections of old family papers , has managed to piece together a rather readable pic - ture of old Dutch and English-Dutch colonial home life , which she entitles '' The
Goede Vrouw	PERSON	of
Mana	PERSON	- ha-ta , 1609-1760 '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Hitherto unex - ploited family papers furnish the basis of the book , but the authorities have not been neglected .

		As Mrs.
Van Rensselaer	PERSON	's title implies , it is with the ways and doings of the matrons of
Manhattan	LOCATION	, rather than of their spouses , that her book is prin - cipally concerned ; and this theme is naturally one which strongly enlists her sympathies .

		The book is of a type rather common of late years , and it is a favorable specimen of its class .

		Old Dutch home life in
Manhattan	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The series of small books called '' The Oxford Man - uals of English History '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- has just been com - pleted by the publication of '' England and the Hundred Years ' War . ''

		This volume , the third chronologically , but the sixth and last to appear , is the work of Mr.
C. W. C. Oman	PERSON	, the editor of the series .

		We do not know where to find the essentials of English history more compactly and at the same time more readably presented than in this series of six easily pocketable books .

		The title of the present volume is something of a misnomer , for the period it really covers is
1327 1485	DATE	, the period between the accession of
Edward II	ORGANIZATION	.

		and the Tudor victory on
Bosworth Field	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' edition of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, edited by Mr.
W. J. Rolfe	PERSON	, and published by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is uniform with the other single-volume poets issued under that designation , and has the usual portrait , biography , and notes .

		The text extends to nearly nine hundred double-column pages , and has been printed with scrupulous care .

		We miss from this edition '' The Foresters '' and the '' Death of CEnone '' volume , presumably for copyright reasons , but we get , per contra , the early poems omitted by
Tennyson	PERSON	in the later issues of his verse .

		Praise of the work , considering the auspices under which it appears , would be superfluous .

		Mr.
J. Scott Clark	PERSON	has prepared '' A Study of English Prose Writers , '' which is published by the Messrs.
Scrib	PERSON	- ner .

		The work is described as '' a laboratory method . ''

		Twenty-six writers , from
Bacon	LOCATION	to
O. W. Holmes	PERSON	, are made the subjects of as many chapters .

		In each case we have a biography , a bibliography , and a selection of critical opinions with accompanying illustrations .

		It is in the classification of this latter material that the most distinctive feature of the work is to be sought .

		The work seems to us a very useful one , and we commend it strongly to teachers of English , hoping at the same time that its success will be such as to encourage the author to proceed with his plan of two similar volumes to be devoted mainly to the poets . ''

		A History of English Critical Terms '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
J. W. Bray	PERSON	, purports '' to trace the changes of mean - ing which have taken place in the chief terms employed in English criticism .

		About fourteen hundred critical epithets are given in alphabetical order , and , according to their importance , are illustrated by quotations .

		Many of the entries are single lines , such as '' Ostentation :
B. Jon	PERSON	.

		to present . ''

		A few have pages of illustrative passages .

		An appendix attempts a somewhat labored philosophical classification of the terms indexed .

		The work embodies an excellent idea , and is useful as far as it goes , but the author 's reading does not seem to have been as extensive as it should have been .

		We miss many of the most characteristic terms of recent criticism , such as Arnold 's '' Corinthian '' and
Pater	PERSON	's '' indefectible , '' and we doubt if many of those given have been traced as far back as possible .

		The second volume of '' Operative Gynecology , '' by Dr.
Howard A. Kelly	PERSON	, of the
Johns Hopkins Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , has just been issued by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A general notice of the work was given in our issue of
May 1	DATE	last , on the appearance of Volume I .

		The present volume contains 570 large octavo pages , with more than six hundred original illustrations , twenty-four of them colored plates .

		There is a notable chapter on conservative operations , in which this eminent specialist has done much to relieve this branch of surgery from some perhaps not undue reproach ; and humanity would doubtless be the gainer if the chapter could be read by every member , and particularly every young member , of the medical profession .

		The Snake-Dance of the Moki Indians of
Arizona	LOCATION	attracts greater attention each year .

		It is the most striking and startling native ceremonial still celebrated in our country .

		Never celebrated two years in succes - sion at any one pueblo , it occurs in alternating years at
Oraibe	ORGANIZATION	and
Wolpi	PERSON	.

		This year it was held at
Oraibe	LOCATION	; next year it will be seen at
Wolpi	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Walter Hough	PERSON	, of the
United States National Museum	ORGANIZATION	, describes the dance and pueblo life in
Arizona	LOCATION	in a pretty little book , '' The Moki Snake-Dance '' just published by the
Santa	LOCATION	Fe Railroad .

		The plan of the book and the selection of the sixty-four illustrations it contains were the work of Mr.
Charles A. Higgins	PERSON	.

		Both in a literary and an artistic way the book is good , and deserves careful reading and a place in the library alongside of the standard works on such subjects .

		Recent modern language text - books include the follow - ing : Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a ''
Grammaire Franchise	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Messrs.
Baptiste Mdras	PERSON	and
S. M. Stern	PERSON	; TOpffer 's '' La Bibliotheque de Mon Oncle , '' edited by Mr.
Robert L. Taylor	PERSON	; and

Nov. 16	DATE	, KM ;
KISII	LOCATION	CORRESPONDENCE .


London	LOCATION	,
November	DATE	S ,
1898	DATE	.

		Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	's death baa been the talk of the town , and his friends are entirely at a loss to under - stand how he could have been brought to take up with this so-called '' Christian Science . ''

		I am afraid the connection , coupled with the revelations which have been made at the inquest , will not tend to increase his popularity , with the British public , at any rate .

		He leaves two wives and two families , and his will portions put his property between them .

		Not that his interests in the copyrights can be worth much ; for I am told the English interests had already been largely drawn upon while he was yet alive .

		He was a gifted man , without a doubt , and seems to have had the happy faculty of drawing to himself the best in his friends .

		The death of Mr.
Gleeson	PERSON	White makes another , if less important , void in the ranks of journalists .

		He did not achieve any very arresting work in literature , for his life was too much taken up with other matters .

		He will be best remembered as the founder and first editor of M The Studio , '' and for the charm of his gracious per - sonality .

		I have never known any man so generous , so unselfish , or so ready to help others .

		His wit and con - versation made it a delight to be in his society .

		But his career will be chiefly valued and appreciated by the many young fellows who found in him the quick-hearted friend and earnest adviser .

		I do not think that he would ever have made a great name in literature , in whatever circumstances he was placed .

		Creative activ - ity is the possession of but very few .

		But he had the rare nature which influences others by its own magic of tenderness , graciousness , and kindly encouragement .

		The world at large may soon forget him ; but the mem - ory of
Gleeson White	ORGANIZATION	will always remain enshrined in the hearts of his friends .

		I mentioned , some weeks ago , that Mr.
Harry Quilter	PERSON	was about to commence business as a publisher .

		His first '' announcement '' is just made .

		It is not new , by any means , for there have been illustrated editions be - fore of
Browning	PERSON	's '' Pied Piper of
Hamelin	PERSON	. ''

		What is new is that the publisher himself should be the illustra - tor .

		He calls the volume an edition de luxe . ''

		As the price of four hundred out of the five hundred copies to be issued is to be about
twenty-five dollars	MONEY	, and fifty dollars for the remaining hundred , one expects some - thing in the way of luxury .

		In addition to many spe - cially designed ornaments and borders , the volume is to contain twenty-seven full-page miniatures , and two color plates , as the circular has it , `` on English vellum and silk . ''

		It is to be whole bound , with original de - sign in gold , and inlaid with embossed silver plates . ''

		This is luxurious publishing , with a vengeance f You will , no doubt , have heard that Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	is to be the biographer of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, and that
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are to publish the biography in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	seems determined to do anything rather than finish his life of
Chatham	LOCATION	which has been promised for the `` Twelve English Statesmen '' series for the past ten years .

		Perhaps , like
Huxley	LOCATION	's
Berkeley	LOCATION	, '' it will never be published .

		I was right in my figures as to the price paid for the
Bismarck Memoirs	ORGANIZATION	.

		The 6000 is for
England	LOCATION	alone , and
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	have paid a similar sum for the American rights .

		The Esterhazy book is to appear in
Paris	LOCATION	on the
20th of this month	DATE	, but it will be a first instalment only .

		Efforts are being made to publish the work in
England	LOCATION	at the same time .

		It is to be a volume of some three or four hundred pages , giving the complete history of ''
L'Affaire Dreyfus	PERSON	. ''

		For the story of his own personal connection with this business ,
M. Esterhazy	ORGANIZATION	will have another volume .

		The American method of selling long '' sets `` of books by means of the instalment payment system , so success - fully adopted by the '' Times '' for the '' Encyclopaedia Britannica , '' will , in all probability , have great vogue here .


Already Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	offer their illustrated edition of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's '' Short History of the English People '' on these terms .

		Messrs.
Pearson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	lately announced that they would sell a complete edition in twenty-five volumes of the novels of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	by a payment of 5 .

		down and instalments of 1 * .

		per week .

		The applications they received were so numerous that they can not supply orders .

		Messrs.
Downey & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are following out the same principle with the Wormeley edition of Balzac 's '' Come ` die Humaine . ''

		An important work on
Russia	LOCATION	, its development and relations with
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Western nations , both politi - cally and commercially , is to be published next
spring	DATE	.

		It is from the press of Mr.
Alexis Krausse	PERSON	, and will be published here by Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	.

		The book ought to appeal to American readers ; but I have not heard that any American house has , as yet , acquired the right of publishing it .

		Mr.
G. Bernard Shaw	PERSON	has passed for the press the last sheets of '' The Perfect Wagnerite , '' which is to be published on your side by Mr.
H. S. Stone	PERSON	.

		The book will form an exposition of
Wagner	PERSON	's musical treatment of the fable of The Ring , '' and is written in Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's characteristic manner .

		TEMPLE SCOTT .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons publish a pretty volume of selections from
Southey	PERSON	's '' Doctor '' and other mis - cellaneous writings in the lighter vein .

		Sir
Henry Thompson	PERSON	's '' Food and Feeding '' is reis - sued by
Messrs. Frederic Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a new edition -LRB- the ninth -RRB- , revised and much enlarged .

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	have just published '' The Shaving of Shagpat '' and '' The Tragic Comedians '' in their new edition of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's novels . ''

		The Market - Place , '' the novel left in manuscript by the late
Harold Frederic	PERSON	, will be published as a serial in the
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post '' of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	. ''

		The Fortunes of
Nigel	PERSON	, '' in two dainty volumes , is the latest addition to the '' Temple '' edition of
Scott	PERSON	's novels .

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	are the American pub - lishers .

		Mr.
William Blaikie	PERSON	's '' How to Get Strong and How to Stay So '' is reissued by the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	, after nearly twenty years of popular favor , in a revised edi - tion printed from new plates .

		A recent publication of the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	a a monograph on the '' Ruins of Xkichmook , Yucatan , '' by Mr.
Edward H. Thompson	PERSON	.

		The pamphlet is a thin one , but it is richly illustrated by photographic plates of great interest . ''

		The Novel and the Drama '' will be the subject of ; be address that Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	is to deliver before the
Twentieth Century Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	on the twenty -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 355 fourth of this month .

		In view of the dual form that Mr.
Caine	PERSON	has given to '' The Christian , '' and the wide - spread discussion excited thereby , this address is likely to attract much attention .

		How much better it is to preach in sermons than in fiction , the republication of Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	's '' Ships and Havens '' serves to accent .

		The essay is a charming one , and the publisher -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- has given it a setting worthy of its beauties .

		Two valuable little volumes in the '' Ladies ' Home Journal Household Library , '' published by the
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	, are `` Model Houses for Little Money , '' by Mr.
William L. Price	PERSON	, and '' Inside of One Hundred Homes , '' by Mr.
William M. Johnson	PERSON	.

		Both are exten - sively illustrated . ''

		The Arabian Nights '' and ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' are two most acceptable additions to the '' Illustrated En - glish Library , '' imported by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Mr.
Fred	PERSON	.

		Pegram and Mr.
C. H. Brock	PERSON	are the respective illustrators of the volumes , and the work of each is unusually good .

		Mr.
R. L. Paget	PERSON	has prepared a collection of '' Poems of American Patriotism '' which is now published by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The special purpose of the editor seems to have been to bring together the lyrical outpourings occasioned by our three months ' war with
Spain	LOCATION	, for nearly half of the value is devoted to these precious effusions .

		Most of them seem to have been written for the newspapers , and should never have got into a book .

		The
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in connection with Mr.
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	, is putting forth a popular re - issue of '' The Adventure Series , '' a collection of histor - ical memoirs and narratives that enjoyed much vogue six or eight years ago .

		The first seven volumes have already appeared , and a dozen more are soon to follow .

		As in the original enterprise , so in this republication ,
Trelawny	LOCATION	's '' Adventures of a Younger Son '' leads bravely off , and whets the appetite for the books that are to come after .

		Mr.
E. A. Vizetelly	PERSON	, writing to '' The Athenaeum , '' makes some interesting statements about ''
M. Zola	PERSON	's next books . ''

		He says : ``
M. Zola	PERSON	has two books in hand : in the first place , one entitled ' Fe ` condite ' , 1 which will be the first of a series of four novels following the trilogy of ' Lourdes , '
Rome	LOCATION	, ' and
Paris	LOCATION	. '

		The second volume will be called ' Travail , ' the third ' Ve ` rite ' , ' and the fourth ' Justice . '

		The ' heroes ' of these works will be the four sons of
M. Zola	PERSON	's Abbe * Froment , and , beyond a similarity of names , they will have nothing in common with the Biblical Evangelists .

		The books themselves will be as much novels as , say , any volumes of the Rougon-Macquart series ; but they will reflect the four essential points of
M. Zola	ORGANIZATION	's own belief .

		With regard to
L' Affaire Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	, '
M. Zola	PERSON	certainly intends to write a book on it in due season , and has made many notes with that object ; but he has never shirked criti - cism , and whatever he may write he hopes to have pub - lished , not after his death , but during his lifetime .

		However , the end of `
L'Affaire Dreyfus	PERSON	' is not yet ; whether it will ever come is a proposition not unworthy of argument .

		And meantime between the chapters of 1 Fe ` condite ' '
M. Zola	PERSON	has been preparing an account of his adventures , experiences , and observations in exile .

		This will be copiously illustrated from photographs and sketches ; but inasmuch as it is still impossible to say when
M. Zola	PERSON	's exile will cease , no date can be fixed fpr its publication , '' LIST OF NEW BOOKS .

		411 THE REVIVAL OF ROMANCE .

		An attentive reader of the last issue of THE DIAL must have noticed the fact that no less than three of the chief contributions to that issue frankly espouse the cause of romance as against the claims that have been put forward so strenuously of recent years in behalf of realism .

		This conjunction of opinion was purely fortuitous and unpremeditated , and may for that reason be taken as a really significant sign of the times .

		When the critic wrote of
Cyrano de Bergerac	ORGANIZATION	as a heroic figure pre - sented `` to a world which is all ready to enjoy romance once more '' ; when the essayist sought to analyze `` the ordinary and the common - place to see why they fail to afford materials for great art , '' and concluded by saying that he could not '' conceive of anything more use - less than a literature which reproduces life without a background of thought and imagi - 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, nation '' ; when the poet personified triumphant Romance returning to her own , and saying : '' Since of the oldest dynasty am I , Delight of life within my gift doth lie ; The heart of man , of woman , and of child , Without me were to fate unreconciled .

		A space hath
Human Fashion	ORGANIZATION	banished me ; Bnt Human Fashion will soon wearied be !

		I only wait the unfed heart 's recall .

		To take my place my place supreme in all . ''

		All three , critic , essayist , and poet alike , were expressing , each in his own language , essen - tially the same truth , the truth that Art must better Nature and transcend it unless it is prepared to abdicate its ancient empire .

		The new romanticism , as was also pointed out by at least one of these writers , is not quite the same thing as the old , for it has learned something from the rival by which it has been for a time supplanted .

		What it has learned is the Shakespearian lesson that '' Nature is made better by no mean ,
Bnt Nature	ORGANIZATION	makes that mean : so , o'er that art , Which , yon say , adds to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, is an art That
Nature	ORGANIZATION	makes ... This is an art Which does mend
Nature	ORGANIZATION	change it rather : but The art itself is Nature . ''

		When we speak of the prospective or accom - plished revival of romance , we do not mean the sort of the thing that satisfied the eight - eenth century . ''

		The Castle of
Otranto	LOCATION	, '' and '' Melmoth the Wanderer , '' will hardly serve as prototypes of the new product atavism can not go as far as that but the romanticism that is now carrying literature before it is a form of art that , like the giant of Greek fable , gains renewed strength from contact with the earth .

		The romancer is no longer privileged to live in the clouds , or to dispense with the probabilities , but he is nevertheless constrained to idealize and ennoble those aspects of life with which he is concerned , and to view them , not with the scientist , through a microscope , but with the philosopher , sub specie ceternitatis .

		The terms realism and romanticism have been so bandied about in critical discussion , have been made so hackneyed by indiscriminate use , that we hesitate to drag them forth once more from their decent veteran retirement .

		And , as we have frequently maintained , they almost wholly lose their special signification when we seek to apply them to literature of the first order .

		It is the shallowest sort of criticism that will be content to label the '' Inferno '' as realistic and * Hamlet '' as romantic .

		Where , as in the case of the world-masterpieces , we are in the presence of the sheerest Vision , the tint of the glasses and the index of their refraction become matters of small importance .

		It is only upon a lower plane of literature that the distinc - tion between realism and romanticism actually exists ; it is a distinction hardly to be made , for example , between
Scott	PERSON	and
Balzac	LOCATION	, or between Tourgue ` nieff and
Hawthorne	LOCATION	; but it may prop - erly be drawn in a discussion of
Stevenson	PERSON	and Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	, or of Mr.
Black	PERSON	and Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		It is a distinction that exists only because of a one-sided development or a defective artistic endowment .

		It seems to us that the signs are multiplying upon every hand to show that the star of this narrower realism is waning , and that the world is once more coming to its own in the ideal realms of the imagination .

		Indeed , when we think of the other arts , of painting and music for example , the sort of thing that we are accus - tomed to call realism appears as a belated par - allel of the work that found favor in those arts a generation or more ago .

		It illustrates merely an iiberwundener Standpunkt .

		When we think how far painting has got beyond
Frith	PERSON	and the ''
Derby Day	DATE	, '' when we reflect upon the full meaning of the Wagnerian triumph , we may with small difficulty , if we are anything of a prophet , foresee the time when men shall look back upon the petty realism of the past score of years with mild wonder at the thought that it should ever have been taken so seriously , with no other feeling than the curious interest that we bring to the contemplation of such passing vagaries of thought and taste as the history of civilization reveals by the score .

		The aim of art always has been , and always must be , to get away from the details of life and to '' overhear '' its essential expression , to arrange ideal catego - ries for familiar facts , to make them symmet - rical , to classify , and , beyond all else , to exclude .

		What are some of the signs that realism has not '' come to stay '' in our imaginative litera - ture ?

		It may seem as if
M. Zola	PERSON	had the '' cry '' just now in
France	LOCATION	, but this is the most superficial view imaginable .

		He has notoriety enough , no doubt , but the sources whence it springs will be dried up in a few years , and then the bulk of his work will sink out of sight by its own specific gravity .

		Who ever wanted to read '' L'Assommoir '' or '' La Debacle '' a second time , except from some motive secondary to that of the satisfaction that their first reading gave ?

		But we re - cur with delight to Hugo and
Dumas	PERSON	and
George Sand	PERSON	, and no custom can stale their infinite variety .

		Why have Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	and
Signor	PERSON	d'Annunzio achieved lasting repu - tations in their respective countries ?

		The
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 389 former has done it by the pure romanticism of his genius , and the latter in spite , not because , of his over-insistence upon sordid facts .

		Why are `` Johannes '' and '' Hannele '' and `` Die Versunkene Glocke '' the most striking things in recent German literature ?

		Simply because they strike the note of idealism once more .

		Why are the careers of
Herr Bjornsen	ORGANIZATION	and Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	so illuminative for our thesis ?

		Because each of these great men presents in epitome the artistic experience of the generation .

		That is , because each of them began his work in the purest romantic spirit , was for a time led astray into the morass of realism , and is now groping his way back to the sunlit meadows of idealism .

		And because the former of these men never got so far from the true path as did the other , the totality of his work will , in the final estimate , be held the greater and more enduring .

		In
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	the swing of the pendulum toward romanticism is equally evi - dent .

		The exceptional delicacy and charm of their workmanship is all that keeps us reading the successive productions of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
James	PERSON	.

		They no longer produce any kind of a thrill ; the force by which they once pro- duced it is spent .

		In the work of Mr.
Mere	PERSON	- dith and Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	the elements are so mixed that a definite classification is difficult , yet when we reflect upon what we best remember in such books as ''
Richard Feverel	PERSON	'' and '' Jude the Obscure , '' it is easy to conclude that their authors are most effective when least realistic .

		In our more popular fiction , every form of romance is illustrated .

		There is the emotional romance of `` The Christian , '' the fantastic romance of the '' Zenda '' books , the mystical romance of ''
Aylwin	PERSON	, '' and the his - torical romance of '' The Seats of the Mighty . ''

		Other examples , equally typical , might be ad - duced by the score .

		Such are the books that the public delights to read , and their produc - tion is coming to outnumber overwhelmingly all the other kinds of story-books .

		The ro - mantic revival is at full tide , and contemporary literature bids fair to offer us once more the solace that it brought us of old .

		We have learned that it is extremely foolish to insist of a writer that he give us all the facts connected with his theme .

		We have learned the limita - tions of literary photography , we have learned that it is unwise to approach literature bur - dened with a sense of responsibility for the preservation of the literal truth and the ob - trusion of the ethical meaning .

		ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .


London	LOCATION	,
Nov.	DATE	.

1898	DATE	.

		It seems to me that this might be the right time to say a word or two on the matter of English and American Book Agencies ; and I think a discussion on the subject in the columns of your widely read journal should prove both profitable and interesting .

		By a
Book Agency	ORGANIZATION	, I understand a sort of
Publishers ' Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, where books could be seen , and copyrights of books bought , sold , or exchanged , either for
America	LOCATION	of English books , or for
England	LOCATION	of American publications .

		As things stand at present , only the more wealthy of publishers find it worth their while to keep in their employ special representatives across the water , to look after their interests and conduct negotiations for new works .

		A very large number of pub - lishers find it impossible to do this , and are at the mercy of a sort of blind circumstance .

		I do n't know how you manage on your side , although I can fairly well guess ; but here , one has to hawk a book round from one agency to another , in the hope that an edition will be bought for your market , or in the belief that it might be printed there and American copyright secured .

		I need not say that this business is a tedious affair ; and to its tedious - ness is often added disappointment , and the vexation that arises from the knowledge that the individuals with whom one is dealing have no power to do anything on their own initiative , and must refer to the home office for all de - cisions .

		I have often wondered at the meaning of a system of establishing agencies which have not the power of act - ing .

		Of course , on very large transactions , or important decisions , he might , like any ambassador , be compelled to refer to headquarters .

		But the average book offered could easily be either accepted or rejected without keep - ing us waiting here for weeks or even months .

		By the time this letter reaches you , Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's '' Life of William Shakespeare '' will have been pub - lished ; and also the new edition of ''
Aurora Leigh	PERSON	, '' for which Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has written an introduction .

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's excuse for writing the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	may be put in his own words : '' Shakespearean literature , as far as it is known to me , still lacks a book that shall supply within a brief compass an exhaustive and well-arranged statement of the facts of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's career , achieve - ment , and reputation , that shall reduce conjecture to the smallest dimensions consistent with coherence , and shall give verifiable references to all the original sources of information . ''

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's life will , as you know , be written by Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, and few of us will envy him the task of sifting the hundred thousand or so of letters which the English statesman collected .

		Mr.
E. J. Sullivan	PERSON	, the talented artist whose illus - trations to
Carlyle	PERSON	's '' Sartor Itesartus '' is announced to be published `` shortly , '' has dreams of doing a sim - ilar service for
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's '' French Revolution , '' and , probably , continuing the series so as to form , in time , a complete illustrated edition of the works of the
Chelsea	LOCATION	sage .

		The fashion seems coming in for books with colored illustrations .

		Besides the edition of
Jane Austen	PERSON	with colored pictures by Mr.
Brock	PERSON	, Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	have published Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' with illustrations in color by
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	, and Messrs.

		THE ROMANCE OF
ROME	LOCATION	.

		* We have long since ceased to wonder at the facility of Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	in taming oat delight - fal stories .

		For sixteen years now they have appeared with twice the frequency of the cal - endars and almanacs , and with two or three intercalary novels to spare .

		Possibly , two or three might have been spared : for example , '' An American Politician '' or '' A Rose of Yesterday . ''

		But the books which will main - tain his fame are those whose melodious titles end in a or e or i or o , and whose milieu is the faded but well-saved traditions of old Roman families of to-day .

		Between '' Mr.
Isaacs	PERSON	'' and `` Corleone '' lies a cycle of romances whose vivid portraitures and triumphs of description almost persuade us that they are not of an age , but for all time .

		At any rate , their author has no fellow in his chosen field .

		And now , as a variation on writing Roman romances , he has made the city his heroine , and has given us the romance of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The two sumptuous volumes before us are not , however , a mere hasty interlude between novels .

		There is strong external and inter - nal evidence that the book has been '' simmer - ing , '' as
George Eliot	PERSON	might say , for many years .

		The chapters on
Leo XIII.	PERSON	, the Vat - ican , and St.
Peter	PERSON	's , with other descriptive passages , appeared in the `` Century
Maga	PERSON	- zine '' in
1896	DATE	, and have now been brought together here , leaving behind them , alas !

		the superb illustrations by
Castaigne	ORGANIZATION	.

		In one sense , Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has been writing the book all his life ; and the result is something which is history , guide-book , and narrative , and more .

		The
Eternal City	ORGANIZATION	has often been described : but now she has received a sort of apotheosis .

		The plan of this great vision of
Rome	LOCATION	is topographical rather than chronological .

		A scant hundred pages of the first volume are given to a sketch of the city 's history , from the few shepherds digging on the
Palatine	LOCATION	, down to the close of the
Middle Ages	ORGANIZATION	.

		The rest of the first volume , and all of the second except the last three chapters , are occupied with an account of the fourteen Regiones -LRB- '' Rioni '' -RRB- , or wards , into which , with slight modifications , the city has remained divided since the time of Augustas .

		of the book ; and the dark romance of these various centres of princely and ecclesiastical life has been painted for us by the practised hand of a past master .

		From
Monti	PERSON	to Tras - tevere we are guided by an incomparable cic - erone , who knows every foot of the ground , is profoundly impressed with the nobility of his theme , and lectures on it with the scholarship of a
Lanciani	PERSON	and more than the charm of a Hare .

		Graphic description , philosophic reflec - tion , and acute art criticism abound in every chapter ; and the whole is steeped in that at - mosphere of affluent and felicitous expression which is distinctively Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's own .

		The embarrassment of riches overtakes us when we try to select for quotation passages which illustrate the author 's treatment of his subject .

		Perhaps nothing in the book is more vivid and realistic than the extended account , in the chapter on the region ''
Colonna	PERSON	, '' of the daily life of a princely Roman family in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		So irresistibly does the picture confront our eyes that we say instinct - ively '' this is contemporary observation , not reconstruction . ''

		No region was more swept by tragedy than the one called '' Ponte , '' and none of its trag - edies has wakened more pity and terror than that of the
Cenci	PERSON	.

		Here is a glimpse of the last scene in it : '' They died bravely , there at the head of the bridge , in the calm
May	DATE
morning	TIME	, in the midst of a vast and restless crowd , among whom more than one person was killed by accident , as by the falling of a pot of flowers from a high window , and by the breaking down of a balcony over a shop , where too many had crowded in to see .

		The old house opposite looked down upon the scene , and the people watched
Beatrice Cenci	PERSON	die from those same arched windows .

		Above the sea of faces , high on the wooden scaffold , rises the tall figure of a lovely girl , her hair gleaming in the sunshine like threads of dazzling gold , her marvelous blue eyes turned up to heaven , her fresh young dimpled face not pale with fear , her exquisite lips moving softly as she repeats the De Prof undis of her last appeal to God .

		Let the axe not
fall	DATE	.

		Let her stand there for ever in the spot - less purity that cost her life on earth and set her name for ever among the high constellated stars of maidenly romance . ''

		In the chapter on `` Sant ' Angelo '' Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	finds the old Ghetto a convenient text for a short but brilliant excursus on the status of the Jews in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		He tells us that they have been better treated by the religious than by the civil authorities , and cites the fact that they were required to do homage to the latter every year in the
Capitol	LOCATION	, the Senator of
Rome	LOCATION	placing his foot upon the head of the prostrate delegates ; but

		THE DIAL 391 '' The service they were required to do on the accession of a new Pope was of a different and less degrading nature .

		The Israelite School awaited the Pope 's pas - sage , on his return from taking possession of the Lat - eran , standing up in a richly hung balcony , before which he passed on his way .

		They then presented him with a copy of the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	, which he blessed on the spot , and took away with him .

		That was all , and it amounted to a sanction , or permission , accorded to the Jewish religion . ''

		What the Ghetto was like can hardly be described ; but here is as forcible an approxi - mation to description as most persons would care to read : '' In a low-lying space enclosed within a circuit of five hundred yards , and little , if at all , larger than the
Palazzo Doria	PERSON	, between four and five thousand human beings were permanently crowded together in dwellings centuries old , built upon ancient drains and vaults that were constantly exposed to the inundations of the river and always reeking with its undried slime ; a little , pale-faced , crooked-legged , eager-eyed people , grub - bing and grovelling in masses of foul rags for some tiny scrap richer than the rest and worthy to be sold apart ; a people whose many women , haggard , low - speaking , dishevelled , toiled , half doubled together , upon the darning and piecing and smoothing of old clothes , whose many little children huddled themselves into corners , to teach one another to count ; a people of sellers who sold nothing that was not old or damaged , and who had nothing that they would not sell ; a people clothed in rags , living among rags , thriving on rags ; a people strangely proof against pestilence , gathering rags from the city to their dens , when the cholera was raging outside the
Ghetto	ORGANIZATION	's gates , and rags were cheap , yet never sickening of the plague themselves ; a people never idle , sleeping little , eating sparingly , laboring for small gain amid dirt and stench aad dampness , till
Friday	DATE
night	TIME	came at last , and the old crier 's melan - choly voice rang through the darkening alleys ' The Sabbath has begun . ' ''

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's childhood was passed in
Italy	LOCATION	; and the
Rome	LOCATION	of Pius IX .

		the
Rome	LOCATION	of the sixties is recalled by him with an almost wistful fondness .

		The political union of
Italy	LOCATION	under the house of
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	is naturally given scant favor ; and the author '' views with alarm '' the present political and financial con - dition of the kingdom . ''

		The difference , '' says he , `` between
Unity	ORGANIZATION	under
Augustus	PERSON	and
Unity	ORGANIZATION	under
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	is that under the Empire the Romans took
Italy	LOCATION	, whereas under the Kingdom the Italians have taken
Rome	LOCATION	'' an epigram that pleases him so well that he repeats it in the second volume .

		As above noted , Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has brought together here his three articles on the Pope , the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, and
St. Peter 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the latter , the most colossal temple of
Christendom	LOCATION	, he finds the most impressive illustration of the '' giantism '' -LRB- a word he is very fond of using -RRB- of the Latin race .

		And there , on the thresh - old of the great church , the author takes leave of his readers ; but not of his theme .

		`` For a man can no more say a last farewell to
Rome	LOCATION	than he can take leave of eternity .

		The years move on , but she waits ; the cities fall , but she stands ; the old races of men lie dead in the track wherein man - kind wanders always between two darknesses ; yet
Rome	LOCATION	lives , and her changes are not from life to death , as ours are , but from one life to another .

		A man may live with
Rome	LOCATION	, laugh with her , dream with her , weep with her , die at her feet ; but for him who knows her there is no good-bye , for she has taken the high seat of his heart , and whither he goes she is with him , in joy or sorrow , with wonder , longing , or regret , as the chords of his heart were tuned by his angel in heaven . ''

		The volumes are flawlessly printed and tastefully bound .

		Twenty-eight photogravure plates just two to a region show the prin - cipal monuments with unsurpassed stereoscopic effect .

		One misstatement should be noted , on page 110 of Volume II. , where Moses Men - delssohn is made the father of the composer , instead of his grandfather .

		SPANISH INFLUENCES AND INSTITUTIONS IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* Recent events , by the course of which the last fragments of
Spain	LOCATION	's once vast possessions in the Western Hemisphere have been wrested from her grasp , have very naturally awakened an interest in Spanish - American history ; and one result of thi interest is likely to be seen in a number of new books upon subjects related to the Spanish colonial possessions .

		The appear - ance of Professor
Moses	PERSON	's work on '' The Estab - lishment of Spanish Rule in
America	LOCATION	'' is there - fore timely , but that does not imply that it has been prepared with undue haste to meet a tem - porary demand .

		Dr.
Moses	PERSON	has for many years past recognized the importance of the study of Spanish - American history to the perfect under - standing of some phases of our own history ; and some of the chapters in this book that have previously appeared in print have proved their value as contributions to the materials for a history of the western world .

		The necessity of close attention to the study of these early pages of history is apparent in order to a proper understanding of the causes of the prevalent political mismanagement and the revulsion from ecclesiastical domination in * THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SPANISH RULE IN

Dec. 1	DATE	, those countries which , though now independent of
Spain	LOCATION	, we still call '' Spanish-American . ''

		But it is also true that the history of that por - tion of the North American continent whose institutions are supposed to be of Anglo-Saxon origin is not to be written without reference to Spanish rule .

		That rule extended as far north as Nootka on the
Pacific	LOCATION	, as lately as
1793	DATE	.

		The
Georgia Colony	ORGANIZATION	was established with the object of restricting its northern boundary on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		One of the States of the Amer - ican
Union	ORGANIZATION	retains a system of jurisprudence derived from
Spain	LOCATION	, and others have geograph - ical names and land-titles which bespeak a former Spanish domination .

		The number of officials and the amount of governing attempted by
Spain	LOCATION	in her colonies in the New World probably exceeded those of any nation on record .

		First of all there was a
Casa de Contratacion	ORGANIZATION	, established in
1503	DATE	, through which
Spain	LOCATION	sought to control the pros - pective commerce of the Indies for her own benefit , and to make the best possible use of the colonies she then had in contemplation .

		This was literally a '' House of Contracts , '' though Dr.
Moses	PERSON	prefers to translate it ''
India House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It combined the functions of a
Board of Trade and a Supreme Court of Judicature	ORGANIZATION	in all cases of Admiralty .

		To this institution Dr.
Moses	PERSON	devotes a chapter , and gives us the best account thereof in English .

		Possibly a like extended notice of the Consejo de las Indicts -LRB- Council of the Indies -RRB- would have disturbed the rules of proportion established for this book , and the author contents him - self with references thereto , chiefly in his chapter on the '' General Policy '' of Spanish rule .

		The Consejo was established by Ferdinand in .

		l - ` il 1 .

		and was perfected by the Emperor
Charles V.	PERSON	in
1524	DATE	.

		It was principally legis - lative , but it was also judicial . ''

		The worst features of the two worst governments in the world , the Gothic rule and that of the Spanish Moors , '' as some one has said , '' were combined to form the government of
Spain	LOCATION	; and then the worst features of this mongrel government were carefully preserved to oppress the native popu - lation of the Spanish possessions in the
New World	LOCATION	, in the code of laws sent out to them by
the Supreme Council	ORGANIZATION	of the Indies . ''

		Naturally we would like to know more about the Consejo .

		To this council , far removed from the countries it was supposed to legislate for , and with little or no knowledge of their needs , are due many of the iniquities of Spanish rule in
America	LOCATION	, and hence much of the present day misrule in Spanish-American countries ; and to this coun - cil , with the
Casa de Contratacion	ORGANIZATION	, was due the iniquitous economic policy adopted by
Spain	LOCATION	in her colonial affairs .

		Under these general governing boards there were established Audiencias , first in
Santo Domingo	LOCATION	, and afterwards in
Mexico	LOCATION	,
Guadala	LOCATION	- jara ,
Guatemala	LOCATION	,
Panama	LOCATION	, and half a dozen of the South American cities .

		Ayuntamientos , or municipal governments , were also established , and have left their permanent impress upon the institutions of Spanish-American countries .

		For carrying out the scheme of colonial gov - ernment finally developed , there were Addon - tddos , Captains-General and Viceroys , the last - named capable of maintaining courts in
Peru	LOCATION	and
New Spain	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mexico	LOCATION	-RRB- modelled after that of
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		Besides these , there were offices created for the purpose of correcting abuses from time to time discovered in the colonies , or with the object of espionage ; and the official list finally included nearly all of the Spanish residents in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		In addition to these civil institutions , there were ecclesiastical hierarchies , which , in the intimate connection of the Church with the
State	ORGANIZATION	under the '' Most Catholic '' sovereigns of
Spain	LOCATION	, are not to be considered separate and apart from the civil government in the history of Spanish rule in
America	LOCATION	.

		All this receives due attention from Dr.
Moses	PERSON	, who is admir - ably equipped for the task he has chosen .

		And we are led to hope that he will proceed to give us , in the same clear and concise form , something upon the two other themes embraced in the general subject of Spanish Authority in
America	LOCATION	, viz : the movement toward civiliza - tion under that authority , and the struggles of the colonies to be free .

		We shall then feel that the whole Spanish-American history has been treated by a competent hand .

		There are errors to be found in this book , chiefly in the use of proper names , but these are probably typographical , and not such as Colonel Ingersoll would wish to incorporate in his lecture on `` The Mistakes of Moses . ''

		The date of the insurrection of
Tupac Amaru	ORGANIZATION	in
Peru	LOCATION	is given as
1571	DATE	instead of 1780-83 , which is an error of sufficient importance to receive notice and correction in a future edition .

John Lub	PERSON	- bock and Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	were published .

		Then came at least so far as books in En - glish are concerned a notable cessation of original work in that whole field .

		Writers were content to accept Tylor 's '' Animism '' or Spen - cer 's '' Ghost Theory . ''

		The old straw was threshed and rethreshed , but of new grain there was really nothing except
Frazer	PERSON	's Golden Bough .

		Everyone was quick to see , in new data secured by the traveller or anthropologist , evi - dence for the view he championed , but no one assaulted the foundations of the two theories or proposed new ones .

		Lately there has appeared a healthy tendency to reopen the whole matter , and to branch out in independent lines of thought .

		Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's book , '' The Evolution of the Idea of God , '' shows this tendency .

		Its writer claims that it is an attempt to reconcile the ideas of Tylor and Spencer : it really assumes a new point of view regarding many questions , and presents a good deal of shrewd and interesting original thought .

		And now Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	appears with a thought - breeding book , on '' The Making of Eeligion . ''

		It is a pity that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	did not write two little books instead of one large one .

		For his material falls into two well-defined masses , whose chief connection lies in both being used for assaulting , somewhat bitterly , the assump - tions of Anthropology .

		His first argument has been somewhat shadowed forth in some of his earlier writings .

		He feels that anthropologists have too much neglected a great quantity of curious belief , experience , and practice , which he calls `` a ?

		phenomena . ''

		Why not investi - gate such things as clairvoyance , crystal vision , trances , and possession ?

		These things may not be understood , but they are real experiences , and are supposedly fit subjects for investiga - tion by the student of man .

		The best proofs of their reality is their occurrence , with practi - cal identity , in all times and among all people .

		The negro clairvoyant in
South Africa	LOCATION	, the Cree clairvoyant in
Canada	LOCATION	, and the ignorant medium in
London	LOCATION	, can not have agreed together upon the details of a sham .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	believes that these x phenomena have strongly assisted in the development of the idea of a soul .

		He refuses * THB MAKING OF RELIGION .

New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		to be satisfied with the current anthropological teaching that the soul idea is evolved from dreams , reflections , and shadows , unless these are strongly assisted by these neglected x phe - nomena .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's plea is worth heeding .

		The phe - nomena deserve investigation , both for their inherent interest and for the importance they may have had in the way that he suggests .

		He has done an excellent thing in gathering and presenting the material he gives .

		His chapter on crystal-gazing abounds with important infor - mation .

		The practice seems to have existed almost everywhere and at almost all times .

		He finds it among Polynesians , Egyptians , Apaches , Iroquois ,
South Africans	LOCATION	, in
Madagascar	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	, among ancient Greeks , Romans , and Peruvians .

		To his list we may add Tonkaways , Cherokees , and ancient Mexicans .

		Yet , notwith - standing its wide distribution in space and time , no serious ethnic study has been made of it .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's second subject is not clearly con - nected with his first .

		Anthropologists have gen - erally held that the idea of a supreme , kind , creative being , who is worshipped , is a late con - ception in religion .

		It has been considered a development from the much earlier conception of spirits and ancestral gods .

		Where lower people mention such a being , it has been assumed that they have been influenced by Christian or other foreign ideas .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	boldly lunges at these time-honored theories .

		He collects an astonishing lot of evidence for a contrary idea .

		With him , a supreme , kind , creative being , worshipped by a people , is an ancient , almost a primitive conception , preceding , perhaps , in many cases the idea of spirits .

		Besides his mass of evidence for the existence of ideas relative to a supreme being among uncontaminated lower peoples , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	presents a logical argument against the usual view .

		He does not actually refuse ideas regarding spirits to early man .

		That primitive creature may early have had a variety of notions in his mind : but among his earliest original conceptions is the idea of a kind , creative , supreme being , whom men may worship .

		We can not discuss Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's book fully .

		To answer his argument and it must be an - swered , or prevalent ideas must be greatly mod - ified will task the best workers in the field for some time to come .

		The book is a bomb : it will cause some scurrying , but the effect will be good .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has an Englishman 's prejudice against foreign authorities .

		He knows few 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, American books .

		Much as he is interested in the firewalk and possession , he does not know
Percival Lowell	PERSON	's Japanese evidence .

		He has read Mr.
George Bird Grinnell	PERSON	, as he ought ; but plainly he read the Pawnee book more care - fully than he did the one about Blackfeet .

		He knows some of the papers in the
Bureau of Ethnology Reports	ORGANIZATION	, but not many .

		To be sure , in this respect we must sympathize with his plaint .

		Referring to a voluminous report on the Ghost Dance , he says : '' Republican Govern - ments publish scientific matter ' regardless of expense / and the essential points might have been put more shortly . ''

		The fact that our government scientists appear to write '' by the page '' is admitted , and forms some excuse for a busy man 's not trying absolutely to read what they write .

		Still , one loses something by not doing so , and there is a good deal of American material of which Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is ignorant which might have been used in his argument .

Henry Savage Landor	PERSON	, containing the narrative of his strange wanderings and ter - rible sufferings on the mountains and plains of Thibet , is at last published , under the appro - priate title , '' In the Forbidden Land . ''

		As was doubtless expected , the interest of the book lies more in the author 's account of his sufferings than of his discoveries .

		Indeed , the reader will hardly wonder that Mr.

		to provoke the attacks upon him .

		He was not only a trespasser , but his violation of Thibetan law followed immediately upon several official notifications , personally made , of the inhibition against European investigation .

		He repeatedly insulted , in the grossest manner , minor officials with whom he had to deal .

		And he himself gives abundant justification , in his account of the misrule of the Lamas , for the law against just such a traveller as he was .

		He was cer - tainly not a friendly or an impartial visitor , and his hostile and aggressive attitude inevi - tably impairs somewhat the force of his obser - vations , and even mitigates the feeling of outrage and horror attending the reading of his account of the cruel tortures inflicted upon him by the Thibetans .

		His boastfulness is incred - ible almost surpassing , let us say , that of some of the newspaper correspondents in the Cuban War .

		He gives us to understand that , had he not unguardedly laid down his rifie when within four days of Lhassa , he would have gained that holy city in spite of
Lamas	LOCATION	, soldiers , and people .

		At that time his follow - ing consisted of two coolies , one a leper and crippled ; and they were without provisions .

		Troops of several hundreds of men , fierce in their pursuit of him , bowed to the earth when he confronted them with his rifie and camera , and ran away at the first opportunity .

		There were undoubtedly superstitions at work , and the photographic apparatus may well have been mightier than the sword in its moral effects ; but it is impossible to rid one 's self of the feeling of exaggeration .

		With all this , however , there is no more doubt of the writer 's courage and hardihood than there is of the interest of the book .

		What he did for science he sets forth thus : `` I submit , with all deference , the following geo - graphical results of my expedition : '' The solution of the uncertainty regarding the di - vision of the Mansarowar aud
Rakstal Lakes	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- doubtful -RSB- . ''

		The ascent to so great an altitude as ` J' J ,000 feet , and the pictures of some of the great Himahlyan -LSB- ne -RSB- glaciers . ''

		The visit to and the fixing of the position of the two principal sources of the
Brahmaputra	LOCATION	, never before reached by a European .

		The fact that with only two men I was able to travel for so long in the most populated -LSB- sir -RSB- part of
Tibet	LOCATION	. ''

		And here is a typical account of a typical adventure of Mr.
Lander	PERSON	's in the forbidden country , his opponents in this instance being brigands rather than soldiers , though identical results followed : '' The band of dacoits approached and left the yaks
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 395 in charge of two women .

		When they galloped in a line towards us , my men , with the exception of Chanden Sing and Mansing -LSB- the faithful twain who were with him to the end -RSB- , were paralyzed with fright . ''

		They were now a hundred yards off .

		With loaded rifle in one hand , and my camera in the other , I advanced to meet them , knowing that , with their old - fashioned matchlocks , it takes them a considerable time to light the fuse and fire a shot .

		Moreover , it is almost impossible for them to fire on horseback , their weapons being heavy and cumbersome . ''

		I focussed them in my twin lens photographic ap - paratus , and waited until I had them well in the field .

		I snapped the shot when they were only thirty yards away , vaulting over their ponies in the act of dismount - ing .

		The camera , having done its work , was quickly deposited on the ground , and the rifle shouldered .

		I shouted to them to put down their weapons , and to give force to my request I aimed at them with my
Mann	PERSON	- licher . ''

		A meeker lot of brigands I do not believe could be found , though people of that kind are often brave when it is easy for them to be courageous .

		Their matchlocks were unslung from their shoulders with remarkable quickness and flung to the ground , and their jewelled swords were laid by the side of their firearms .

		They went down on their knees , and , taking off their caps with both hands , put out their tongues in sign of salute and submission , and I could not help taking another snap-shot at them in that attitude , which was comical , to say the least of it . ''

		This is certainly a novel use of the deadly camera , which in this case was probably taken for a new form of Gatling gun .

		Mr.
Landor	PERSON	does well to record the episode .

		To photo - graph a squadron of horsemen charging on your front , before taking them prisoners single - handed , is a feat to make Mr.
James Creel	PERSON	- man turn green with envy .

		He should have had a camera , with his pencil and spy-glass , when he captured his fort at
El Caney	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both Mr.
Merewether	PERSON	and the manner of his interesting book , '' A Tour through the Famine District of
India	LOCATION	, '' assure us that he was connected with a newspaper -LRB- in
Bombay	LOCATION	-RRB- before his expedition , and that he undertook it by way of newsgetting , acting , as the British phrase goes , as Special Commissioner for the
Reuter News-Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was looking for sen - sations , and , by the very terms of an Indian famine , he had not far to seek .

		When found , they were photographed for corroboration in the likenesses of human beings whose hunger was apparent in every wasted muscle and knotted joint .

		Two somewhat contradictory things were accomplished by Mr.
Merewether	PERSON	: he gives us a picture of the British administra - tion in
India	LOCATION	, laying aside all its customs and functions as a government in the western sense , taking up instead the duties of a beneficent des - potism , and subordinating everything to the alleviation of the misery of its subject peoples ; and he writes down the following eulogy of Mr.
Julian Hawthorne	PERSON	, who has been somewhat effusively blamed both in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	for sending out reports derogatory to the com - fort of the ruling race : `` Mr.
Julian Hawthorne	PERSON	... made a most careful and extended tour through the Central Provinces , and other parts of the famine districts of
India	LOCATION	.

		He was able to devote much more time to his mission than I , in view of my rapid and extended tour through the length and breadth of the land , could compass .

		Since his re - turn to the
States	LOCATION	, he has contributed a series of preg - nant articles upon the subject , and being a man with the trained faculty of observation very largely developed his statements may be accepted as the plain and unvar - nished facts of the case , as seen by himself in proprid persona '' It may be taken as true that the persons who died in spite of the strenuous efforts of the ad - ministration are those who would have been dead long before under a native regime .

		There was certainly nothing in the way of relief omitted , once the famine code was declared in operation .

		That there was delay in this , and that the government did not move until the press became clamorous , are nothing more than new examples of a familiar thing .

		The woman traveller in foreign parts is either what has been comprehensively called since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time a '' good fellow , '' or a very great bore .

		Miss
Sykes	PERSON	is a good fellow ; and the reading world may very well be glad that her brother , when appointed the British consul to open up relations with
Kerman	LOCATION	and other remote parts , had the good sense to take so cheerful and wholesome a companion with him .

		Miss
Sykes	PERSON	went '' Through
Persia	LOCATION	on a Side Saddle , '' as her title proclaims , and with her eyes wide open to a series of things which would have escaped the slower-witted man .

		She discovered , for example , that the dreadful problem of domestic service , which we look upon as solved in
Britain	LOCATION	, she expected to find solved in
Persia	LOCATION	, and with this result , as she phrases it : '' Every lady in
Persia	LOCATION	with whom I discussed the ' servant question ' confessed to an intense irritation of the nerves , engendered by struggling with these lazy Orientals ; and one went so far as to say that she some - times felt as if she could have killed her cook , a par - ticularly insolent fellow , and then ' laughed to see his corpse ! ' ''

		It was a most extended journey Miss
Sykes	PERSON	undertook , and as she is the first woman to write of
Kerman	LOCATION	and
Persian Baluchistan	LOCATION	from per - sonal observation , and enjoyed unusual oppor - THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	tunities through her brother 's position , a volume both of interest and importance results .

		Siam is the home of rubies in all the glory of perfection , and Mr.
H. Warington Smyth	PERSON	, who writes of his '' Five Years in
Siam	LOCATION	, '' was , during much of the time he describes , the direc - tor of the department of the mines of the king - dom .

		For the first time , therefore , we have not only an account of a matter which has long been shrouded in mystery by the native rulers , but one written by an expert upon this very topic .

		He draws a likeness of the seeker after precious stones which is admirable in succinct - ness . ''

		The Shah seems by nature designed for the pursuit of gems .

		He is bitten with the roving spirit , and in addition he has the true instinct of the miner , to whom the mineral be lives to pursue possesses a subtle charm , which constrains him never to rest or weary of its search against all odds .

		The sentiment is quite different to the ararice of the victims of a gold mania ... The
Gula	PERSON	regards this as a world where man must live by his wits , and sees no harm in profiting by the want of experience of a fellow-man .

		I have known a European , who gave up a permanent post in
Bangkok	LOCATION	to go gem-mining , put his whole earnings into the purchase of some thousand carats of glass .

		The men he dealt with found that glass pleased him as much as the real article , and that he was ready to pay for glass ; so glass , of beauteous ruby and sapphire colors , without a flaw , they gave him in large quantities . ''

		Of the first value in the chapters on the mines , Mr.
Smyth	PERSON	's book is also fresh and interesting throughout .

		He does not hesitate at criticism , whether of his own people or another , and does not talk without saying something .

		The book is well indexed .

		The
Gold Coast Colony	ORGANIZATION	is that familiar spot in
Africa	LOCATION	which has been known for many cen - turies as
Guinea	LOCATION	.

		It is an unwholesome and a malarious spot , formerly celebrated for its ex - ports of gold , ivory ; and slaves , and since the
Ashanti	ORGANIZATION	wars famous for nothing in particular except missionaries .

		The Rev.
Dennis Kemp	PERSON	is one of these indefatigable workers for the spread of Christian doctrine , and his `` Nine Years at the Gold Coast '' describes his personal experience .

		He says a good word for the native , quotes with mingled shame and delight the words of one of his dark-skinned colleagues who urged his brethren to shun strong waters , '' lest they become as drunken as the English '' !

		and sets down an interesting bit of savagery , thus : `` The mount -LSB- Croboe -RSB- was for the most part kept sacred , as a residence for girls of the age of fourteen years and upwards .

		As many as 4,700 found their way there during
1891	DATE	.

		The girls usually remained on the mount for a year or eighteen months , under the care of priests and priestesses .

		Previous to sending a damsel to the mount , the friends were in the habit of slaughtering a number of sheep ; the number slain was supposed to be proportionate to the wealth of the family , which was often put to great inconvenience in order to keep up appear - ances .

		The fat of the slaughtered sheep was placed upon the head of the young lady -LSB- woman is hardly included in Mr.
Kemp	PERSON	's vocabulary -RSB- , who was required to wear a curiously shaped hat while she went through the test of walking over very steep slippery slabs of stone .

		In the event of the hat falling from her head , the unfortunate girl was sent back to her family in great disgrace .

		Those who passed the test were expected to wear the strange or - nament during the whole of the term of their residence . ''

		It is expecting too much to look for scientific attainments in missionaries of the present day , but the book would have been made much more valuable had Mr.
Kemp	PERSON	had eyes for physical as well as spiritual phenomena .

		As it is , it succeeds in presenting in the reading matter all the arguments in favor of such missions , and all against them between the lines .

		All that the Rev. Mr.
Kemp	PERSON	's book lacks in the way of specialized information is well made up by Mr.
George Macdonald	PERSON	's '' The Gold Coast , Past and Present . ''

		An official of the government , who filled more than one im - portant post under the Crown , Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	had unusual facilities for obtaining knowledge , as well as the ability to set down his store in due order , without prolixity and with a proper sense of proportion .

		He even contrives to give us a clearer conception of the work of the missionaries themselves .

		The most interesting matter in the book , perhaps , is the account of
Lsetitia Elizabeth Landon	PERSON	, the `` L. E. L. '' of our grandmothers , whose marriage to the governor of the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	, and her death and burial within its borders , have been quite for - gotten .

		Says Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	: '' In the triangular courtyard of
Cape Coast Castle	ORGANIZATION	lie the mortal remains of the poetess ... and Presi - dent
Maclean	PERSON	.

		The local practice of intermural sep - ulture was here followed , and ... a neat tablet on the wall near by bears record of the death of the poetess , and the survivor 's grief .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Maclean	PERSON	landed at
Cape Coast	ORGANIZATION	in
August , 1838	DATE	-LRB- they had been married a fortnight before sailing -RRB- .

		The poetess died on the loth of
October	DATE	, and her husband followed her in
May , 1847	DATE	, to the great regret of the whole popula - tion . ''

		The book is to be commended to those in search of information concerning a region of increas - ing importance .

		So happy a conjunction of men , women , and things as Mrs.
Mabel Loomis Todd	PERSON	, a number of astronomers , a sea-voyage from
San Fran	LOCATION	- cisco to
Japan	LOCATION	, a total eclipse , and much inter - course with the strange and disappearing race of Ainus , could hardly fail in making a book
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 397 interesting ; and Mrs.
Todd	PERSON	's `` Corona and Coronet '' is interesting throughout .

		There was nothing hackneyed about the expedition , in manner , destination , objects , incidentals , or personnel ; and there is nothing stale or un - profitable in Mrs.
Todd	PERSON	's description of it .

		She tells of the long journey made by the as - tronomers from
Amherst College	LOCATION	to the land of the Ainus , for the purpose of observing the total eclipse of
August 9 , 1896	DATE	, most of it on the yacht '' Coronet , '' owned by Mr.
Arthur Curtiss James	PERSON	.

		The manner of the narrative is almost colloquial , and happily so , since it carries off a quantity of technical matters that might otherwise be a little indigestible .

		But it is not all colloquial , as this description of the supreme moment of totality bears witness : '' Grayer and grayer grew the day , narrower and narrower the crescent of shining sunlight .

		Theseafaded to leaden nothingness .

		Armies of crows which had pre - tended entire indifference , gazing abroad upon the scene , .

		.

		flew off in a body in heavy haste ... Sampans and junks faded together into colorlessness ; but grass and verdure turned suddenly vivid yellow-green .

		A pene - trating chill fell across the land , as if a door had been opened into a long-closed vault .

		It was a moment of appalling suspense ; something was being waited for the very air was portentous .

		The circling sea-gulls disappeared with strange cries .

		One white butterfly fluttered by vaguely .

		Then an instantaneous darkness leaped upon the world .

		Unearthly night enveloped all . ''

		With an indescribable out-flashing at the same in - stant , the corona burst forth in mysterious radiance .

		But dimly seen through thin cloud , it was nevertheless beautiful beyond description , a celestial flame from some unimaginable heaven .

		Simultaneously the whole northwestern sky , nearly to the zenith , was flooded with lurid and startlingly brilliant orange , across which drifted clouds slightly darker , like flecks of liquid flame , or huge ejecta from some vast volcanic Hades . ''

		The book is handsomely designed and well illus - trated .

		By way of contrast with the foregoing vol - umes , all of which treat of a single state or nation and contain much original matter , is the well illustrated book called '' An American Cruiser in the Far East . ''

		Its author , Mr.
John D. Ford	PERSON	, is Fleet Engineer of the
Pacific Station	LOCATION	, and was with
Dewey	ORGANIZATION	at
Manila	LOCATION	.

		His book is a summary of all he has learned by travel and from written authorities during his long sojourn in the far East , and is particularly valuable just now in what it has to say of
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Here is a description of one of the wholly unconsidered problems which the proposed American occupancy of
Manila	LOCATION	opens for settlement : ''
Cigar	ORGANIZATION	manufacture is a monopoly of the government , and the manufactory covers several acres of ground .

		It is a very interesting place to visit ; twelve thousand wo - men and girls are at work ... Here one sees all the processes of stripping , assorting , filling , rolling , pasting , counting , and packing in boxes , the rolls of fragrant weed .

		At the noon hour and in the
evening	TIME	, when the women leave the premises , they are all searched , to make sure that no scraps of tobacco are taken away . ''

		There are also some pictures of the inhabitants of the neighboring islands , which leave us won - dering if some of our future '' statesmen '' will ever be suspected of , say , cannibalistic prac - tices , in order to gain their vote .

		The one ob - jection to Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's book is that it covers more ground than can possibly be done thoroughly ; but it is interesting nevertheless .

		It is likely , as Mrs.
Miriam Coles Harris	PERSON	's pleasant book , `` A Corner of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' goes far to prove , that a sympathetic picture of the Spaniard is only to be drawn by one who has no prejudices against Roman Catholicism .

		One of our best reasons for disliking him , quite an impersonal one , she sets forth with some shrewdness : `` I shall always think our prejudice against the Span - ish is based upon their physical differences from us .

		We dislike them for their complexion , which is swarthy , and for their features , which are forbidding .

		The treachery is a matter of coloring ; and the cruelty , of outline .

		They are the kindest people in the world , and as honest as nous autres . ''

		And in the latter part of the really interesting little book she adds the following to her charac - terization : '' Their hospitality is frank and generous ; and at the same time , if it is gene to them , they will not for mere good manners do much for you .

		If they have taken a fancy to you , or are sorry for you , they can not do too much . ''

		Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	's particular corner of
Spain	LOCATION	was
Malaga	LOCATION	.

		Her account of it , the almost universal recurrence of small-pox , the total absence of sanitation , the picturesqueness , the squalor , the piety , all serves for a picture of the Spaniard everywhere , in
San Juan	LOCATION	,
Manila	LOCATION	, or
Havana	LOCATION	, as well as in
Malaga	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Charles F. King	PERSON	's '' Roundabout Ram - bles in
Northern Europe	LOCATION	'' is a guide-book cast in the form of a family journey through the principal countries of the Continent , north of the Latin line a line which , it occurs to us , is not unlike the
Mason	PERSON	and
Dixon	PERSON	's line of our own country before the war .

		The book is replete with photographic illustrations , and , with little claim to literary form , contrives to be inter - esting in a catholic sort of manner , which may serve its modest purpose better than many a more pretentious work .

		WALLACE RICE .

		398 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		For several seasons past the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	have been conspicuously in the field at this season with an elaborate edition of a single work of
Irving 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have already had the '' Darro '' edition of the ''
Alhambra	LOCATION	, '' the '' Agapida '' '' Conquest of Gran - ada , '' the - Backthorne '' Tales of a Traveller , '' the '' Surrey '' ''
Bracebridge Hall	PERSON	, '' and so forth .

		This season a welcome arrival is the `` Pawnee Edition '' of the ever fresh and delightful '' Adven - tures of Captain Bonneville . ''

		The younger gener - ation of readers may not be so familiar as their fathers were with this remarkable picture of life about and beyond the
Rocky Mountain	ORGANIZATION	region in the days when the Indian , the trapper , and the '' grizzly '' virtually were supreme .

		So a word as to the author for the book is essentially Captain Bonneville 's may not be amiss .

		Captain Bonneville was an officer in the
American Army	ORGANIZATION	, who , being smitten with a thirst for far-western adventure , obtained leave of absence in
1831	DATE	for an exploring expedition to the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Captain departed on his mission , was engulfed in the then nearly untrodden wilderness , and for three years nothing was heard of him .

		The term of his leave of absence expired .

		At last it was con - cluded that he was dead , or that he had '' turned Indian '' -LRB- as men of his blood and temperament sometimes do -RRB- , and his name was struck off the
Army	ORGANIZATION	List .

		Suddenly , in
1835	DATE	, Captain Bonneville returned to civilization and applied to his superiors at
Washington	LOCATION	for reinstatement .

		It was about this time that
Irving	PERSON	met him first at the dinner table of
John Jacob Astor	PERSON	-LRB- who must have revelled in the Captain 's '' yarns '' -RRB- , and later at
Washington	LOCATION	, where he found him rewriting the notes of his won - derful journey and making maps of the country traversed .

		The mass of manuscript thus prepared he subsequently entrusted to
Irving	LOCATION	, who made it the basis of the narrative now before us .

		Substan - tially , this book is Captain Bonneville 's Journal shaped and amplified by Irving .

		The `` Pawnee Edition '' of it is perhaps the most important , cer - tainly the most ornate , one yet published .

		There are two finely printed , showily bound volumes , which contain in all 28 photogravure illustrations of pass - able interest and quality .

		These represent mainly incidents of Indian life , and striking examples of western scenery .

		In point of decoration the chief feature is the pale-blue border-design of scroll-work which encloses the text on each page as the frame encloses the picture .

		The effect is pleasing .

		Messrs.
Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
London	LOCATION	, have reissued their pretty ten-volume edition of ''
Jane Austen	PERSON	, '' with added attractions , and
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are its American publishers .

		There is nothing on our list more enticing than these captivating little 16mo volumes .

		The special new feature of this edition is the illustrations in color , about six of them to the volume , by Messrs.
C. E. and H. M. Brock	PERSON	.

		A good many otherwise beautiful books that we could mention have been marred by this always risky experiment of colored pictures .

		But in the present instance the effect is charming .

		The plates are in harmony with their setting , and they are prettily done and tastefully conceived in themselves light , vivacious , decorative , emblematic .

		Then the colors are not too flaring , too strikingly at odds with the sobriety of the printed page .

		The shades employed are cool and subdued , and there is no suggestion of an oily vehicle , no sticky , varnishy surface always an abomination in book illustrations .

		How many pretty books have been half spoiled by those oil - cloth-like pictures , to which the tissues stick so provokingly !

		The initial frontispiece of the set is after
Zoffany	ORGANIZATION	's quaint portrait of
Miss Austen	LOCATION	at sixteen '' sweet sixteen '' in her case , evidently .


Jane Austen	PERSON	's could hardly have been one of those cases in which genius is bestowed upon a woman as compensation for a lack of physical charms .

		The edition is well edited by Mr.
Reginald Brimley Johnson	PERSON	, who supplies an informing introductory sketch of the author , besides a preface of a page or two to each novel , and other helpful editorial ad - juncts .

		The works are printed in their order of publication , from the text of the last editions revised by the author . ''

		Lady Susan '' is omitted , as we think , judiciously .

		Otherwise the edition is a com - plete one .

		Whatever advantage there may be in having a set of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's works that is quite complete is possessed by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	' a new edition in twelve 16mo volumes .

		These include all the novels and stories , the letters , and an extended memoir .

		The volumes are of a type less ornate and decorative than those of the Dent edition described above ; but they are tastefully bound and well printed , pleasing to the eye and convenient to the hand .

		The set is therefore an excellent one for actual use , and its price is moderate .

		Each volume contains a frontispiece picture by Mr.
Edmund H. Garrett	PERSON	, whose drawings , as usual , are refined and animated .

		The showy oblong volume entitled '' Ships and Sailors '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- makes a strong bid for popular favor .

		`` Jack Tar '' is just now -LRB- and rightly -RRB- the national hero ; and the national heart warms at once to whatever appertains to him and his ways .

		Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	is partly author , partly compiler of the book ; and Mr.
R. F. Zogbaum	PERSON	, who knows a ship and a sailor when he sees them , is the illustrator .

		The text consists mostly of sea-songs some of them new , more of them '' old and choicely good , '' the lat - ter category ranging from the immortal ditties of Gay and
Dibdin	PERSON	, to the roaring '' chantry '' of the nameless fo ` ks ` le bard .

		Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	is the author of the newer songs .

		He has essayed to do for the '' Jackies '' of the modern ironclad what the old song-writers did for the tarry race -LRB- now gone -RRB- who wore pig-tails , did miracles with ropes and marlin-spikes , and went down to the sea in real ships .

		Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	's songs ring true ; they are racy , resonant , and '' singable . ''

		We are glad to see those fine old favorites , '' Wapping
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 399 Old Stairs , '' '' Poor
Jack	PERSON	, '' '' The White Squall , '' Black Ball , '' '' Nancy Tree , '' etc. , included .

		Mr.
Zogbaum	PERSON	's pictures consist of twelve plates in colors , and twenty - six in black-and-white .

		Notably good are the pictures on pages 29 , 62 , and 89 .

		There is no need of characterizing this artist 's familiar work in this field .

		Many of the songs , it should be added , are printed with the musical notes .

		The Misses
Maude	PERSON	and
Genevieve Cowles	PERSON	deserve in the main hearty praise for the illustrations in
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin	LOCATION	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	's chaste two - volume holiday edition of
Hawthorne	PERSON	's ''
The House	ORGANIZATION	of the Seven Gables . ''

		There are twenty plates in all .

		Some of the figures are very happily con - ceived , notably Hepzibah herself , Judge
Pynch	PERSON	- eon , and the chance customers at the `` cent shop . ''

		The '' Miscellaneous Old Gentleman '' and '' Dixey '' are admirably done .

		With
Phoebe	PERSON	,
Clifford	PERSON	, and Holgrave , the illustrators have not succeeded so well .

		Phoebe seems at times -LRB- on page 58 , for instance -RRB- a little wooden , while the lankness of Holgrave and even of Clifford is overdone to the verge of caricature .

		But the pictorial ensemble is good , and we should very much like to see these refined and sympathetic illustrators try their hands at an edition of `` The Scarlet Letter . ''

		The vol - umes are gotten up in the best taste , the delicate yet practical bindings calling for special mention .

		As a gift-book for a fastidious friend of literary tastes , few things of the season are more suitable than Miss
Elizabeth L. Gary	PERSON	's ''
Tennyson	PERSON	; his Homes , his Friends , and his Work '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The volume is a handsomely appointed large octavo , of sumptuous yet substantial pictorial attractions , consisting mainly of photogravure portraits of the poet 's friends
Hallam	PERSON	,
Spedding	PERSON	,
Jowett	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	- ing ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Dean Bradley	PERSON	, etc. .

		Other plates show the different homes of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, the Memorial at Freshwater , and
Rossetti	PERSON	's and Hunt 's drawings of St.
Cecily	PERSON	and
The Lady of Shalott	ORGANIZATION	.

		The frontispiece is after
Watt	PERSON	's noble portrait of the poet .

		Miss
Gary	PERSON	's text is an outline sketch of
Tennyson	PERSON	's life , so thickly studded throughout with critical estimates of his character and work , quoted from various sources , foreign as well as English , that it is perhaps not unfair to style it an ordered anthology in this kind .

		The author 's own contri - bution in the way of narrative and appreciation is graceful , sympathetic , and discriminating .

		Tenny - sonians will be glad to find in Miss
Gary	PERSON	's pages certain matter hitherto unpublished , or not widely published , notably a letter -LRB- for which we must thank Professor
Norton	PERSON	-RRB- touching
Tennyson	PERSON	's introduction to this country ; a review of `` The Princess '' by
Lowell	PERSON	, and extracts from French and German critiques .

		German appreciation of
Tenny	PERSON	- son is usually a little cold .


Herr Bleibtreu	PERSON	, for instance , denies that he was a poet '' in the higher and highest sense of the word , '' and finds that while his roses have no tborns , they also , like the
Bengal	LOCATION	roses , have no scent .


Herr Engel	PERSON	thinks that `` of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's many volumes , very little , perhaps only a song here and there , will survive . ''

		We counsel those looking for a gift-book of the better class not to overlook this attractive and worthy volume .

		Mr.
W. B. Macdougall	PERSON	has been fairly successful in his decoration of the thin volume containing Ros - setti 's '' The Blessed Damozel '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		We are glad to say that Mr.
Macdougall	PERSON	has not attempted to illustrate the poem an attempt fore - doomed to failure in any hands but the poet 's own .

		That
Rossetti	PERSON	himself might have measurably suc - ceeded here is indicated by his exquisite study of the head of the Blessed Damozel which forms the frontispiece of the present volume and consti - tutes its most attractive adjunct .

		The stanzas are printed one to the page , each framed in a heavy black border with arabesques in white .

		Here Mr.
Macdougall	PERSON	has displayed a delicate fancy and much taste .

		But we repeat , we are glad he has not set his pencil the hopeless task of drawing mysticism and music .

		Even
Rossetti	PERSON	's head seems , when we think of the Damozel of the poem , '' of the earth earthy . ' '

		The text now given is the first British reprint of the poem as it stood in `` The Germ . ''

		There was an American reprint in
1894	DATE	, a private one of twenty - five copies done by the
DeVinne Press	ORGANIZATION	for Mr.
C. L. Williams	PERSON	, as we learn from Mr.
W. M. Ros	PERSON	- setti 's interesting introduction to this volume .

		The book is a pretty one , and should find friends .

		Amateur photographers who make a serious study of their favorite pursuit will be glad to learn that Mr.
W. Lincoln Adams	PERSON	, author of '' Sunlight and Shadow , '' has followed up that excellent manual with a similar and supplementary volume , entitled '' In Nature 's Image '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which he leads the reader '' a little farther along the pleas - ant paths of pictorial photography . ''

		In the volume first named , it may be remembered , the treatment was confined to landscape photography alone , to the exclusion of the more advanced and perhaps more difficult work of figure composition , portraiture , and kindred subjects .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	now proceeds to dis - cuss , in separate chapters , Landscape and Figures -LRB- work in which the figures are small and merely accessory to the landscape -RRB- ; Figures and Land - scape -LRB- work wherein the figures form the principal feature and the landscape the setting or background only -RRB- ; Genre ; Telling a Story ; The Nude ; Por - traiture at Home ; Children ; Flower Photography ; Interiors .

		It will be seen that in his two volumes the author has covered the ground pretty thor - oughly , so far as the selection of subjects is con - cerned .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, we need scarcely say , is himself an expert with the camera as the three examples of his work included in the volume attest ; and each chapter contains practical suggestions based on years of experience in the different branches of photography .

		The volume is a rather sumptuous flat quarto , full gilt , and neatly boxed .

		The text is handsomely printed on rather thick paper glazed to the degree required by the exigencies of the picture - making .

		There are ninety-three plates in all , full - page and vignette , the selected work of many camera 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, experts .

		Some of the specimens are very beautiful , and the collection aa a whole is varied and interest - ing .

		The work forms a pretty and tasteful gift - book for anyone , and an especially suitable one for a friend with a bent for photography .

		A happy thought is tastefully embodied in
Esther Singleton	PERSON	's '' Turrets , Towers , and Temples '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has selected , with good literary judgment , passages from the writings of famous authors wherein are described the most cele - brated buildings of
Europe	LOCATION	and the Orient .

		These passages form the suggestive and sometimes instruc - tive setting for the well executed photographic plates , whereof there are forty-eight The author has aimed to make her selections from the works of such writers as have felt and expressed the romantic spirit , as well as the architectural beauty and grand - eur , of the edifices described .

		The description of
St. Mark	ORGANIZATION	's , at
Venice	LOCATION	, for instance , is from
Ruskin	LOCATION	; that of
Antwerp Cathedral	LOCATION	is from
Thackeray	PERSON	; the
Kremlin	ORGANIZATION	, from
Gautier	PERSON	; the Escurial , from De Amicis ;
Strasburg Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	, from
Victor Hugo	PERSON	; the
Temples of Nikko	ORGANIZATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, from Loti ; the
Taj Mahal	LOCATION	, from
Andre	PERSON	' Chevrillon ; and so on .

		The book is for the general reader and the lover of good literature , rather than the professional architect though the latter may well relish these eloquent tributes to the masterpieces of his profession .

		With one exception , the translations are done by the com - piler of the book ; and they are well done .

		Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	's dainty publications are , as usual , among the more desirable books of the season , whether for holiday gifts or for the collec - tions of bibliophiles .

		This year there are thirteen of them , including one of greater importance than anything heretofore attempted by the publisher .

		Beginning our enumeration with the smallest of them all , we have to mention six additions to the '' Brocade '' series of booklets printed on
Japan	LOCATION	vellum .

		Four of the six are '' Imaginary Portraits '' by
Walter Pater	PERSON	, their subjects being Denys 1 ` Aux - errois ,
Sebastian van Storck	PERSON	,
Duke Carl of Rosen	PERSON	- mold , and
Watteau	ORGANIZATION	, '' A Prince of Court Painters . ''

		The other two are '' Quattrocentisteria , '' a chapter from Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's `` Earthwork out of
Tuscany	LOCATION	, '' and '' The Tale of King Florus and the fair Jehane , '' as translated from `` the ancient French '' by
William Morris	PERSON	.

		To the '' Old World '' series , which now numbers fourteen volumes , four additions are made this year .

		Rossetti 's '' House of Life '' reprints the entire sequence of 102 sonnets .

		Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	's '' Modern Love , '' which was Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's first publication , is here reissued , with additional pieces taken from the '' Poems '' of
1851	DATE	and later volumes , together with the great `` Ode on
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Here we get the real
Meredith	PERSON	, not the fantastic maker of verbal puzzles that recent readers chiefly know . ''

		The Story of My Heart , '' by
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, and '' Underneath the Bough , '' by ''
Michael Field	PERSON	, '' are the two other books added to this series .

		The first of the two needs no com - ment ; the second is a book of lyrics , new and old , which happily differs from the greater number of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's publications in being both sanctioned and arranged for publication by the author .

		The '' Bibelot '' series receives no accessions this year .

		Mr.J.W.Mackail 's prose translation of the
Eclogues of Virgil	ORGANIZATION	is a little book belonging to no series .

		It has a distinctive style of its own , marked by a dec - orative border on each page , a cover design , and a photogravure frontispiece .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Hep - talogia , or the Seven against Sense , '' is a reprint that is peculiarly welcome .

		First published in
1880	DATE	, it had no name upon its title-page , but the author - ship soon became an open secret .

		It is a collection of the best verse parodies ever written , their vic - tims being
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Whitman	LOCATION	,
Patmore	PERSON	, Lord Ly 1 1 on ,
Rossetti	PERSON	, and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	himself .

		The poet is thus himself the only survivor of a group all of whose members were living at the time of the original publication .

		Not inappropriately , the piece called '' Disgust : A Dramatic Mono - logue , '' which is in quite the ` same vein of humorous mockery , is also reprinted .

		It parodies
Tennyson	PERSON	's Despair , '' which was published in a review , No - vember ,
1881	DATE	.

		The parody followed promptly one month later .

		The most important of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's reprints , as we have already hinted , is the one re - maining for description .

		It is nothing less than `` The Germ , '' reproduced without abridgment , etchings and all , with facsimiles of the original wrappers .

		Nothing has been spared to make this edition all that the most exacting bibliophile could ask , as well as all that could be wished by the pur - chaser who values `` The Germ '' chiefly for its importance in the history of Victorian literature , and who welcomes it as a long-desired part of his literary apparatus rather than as a choice example of bookmaking .

		This little periodical , '' The Germ . '

		the seed which put forth two cotyledons , and then called itself Art and Poetry , ' and put forth two more little leaves , and then seemed to die , '' has a place in English literary history that can not fail to suggest the place occupied in our own by the orig - inal '' Dial . ''

		It is true that the motive was art in the one case and philosophy in the other , that four thin numbers made up the sum of '' The Germ , '' while '' The Dial '' lived to complete four volumes ; but a common spirit animated the two ventures , and a large proportion of the contents of each was des - tined to take a place in the permanent literature of the two countries neither knowing its own prophets until long afterwards .

		How germinal was The Germ '' is evident enough from an inspection of the work which it included .

		Rossetti 's '' Blessed Dam - ozel , '' '' Hand and Soul , '' and '' Sonnets for Pic - tures , '' his sister
Christina	PERSON	's '' Dreamland , '' and other lyrics , and the poems by
Thomas Woolner	PERSON	,
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	, and
W. Bell Scott	PERSON	, are all , if not classical themselves , at least pregnant with promise . ''

		How strange it seems , and new '' to read them here , in this modest setting , when we think of the significance of the names attached to them .

		How strange , too , to read these critical re -
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 401 views of early volumes of
Clough	PERSON	and Arnold and
Browning	PERSON	.

		By way of specification , we may say that the present reprint -LRB- which is not a facsimile , and extends to some twenty pages more than the original -RRB- is enriched by a preface , by
James Ash	PERSON	- croft Noble , '' A Pre-Raphaelite Magazine , '' as it was written for an English periodical in
1882	DATE	, an appendix giving the two later recensions of '' The Blessed Damozel , '' a number of helpful notes , and by an index which identifies the writers of all the poems and papers comprised in the four issues of '' The Germ . ''

		Except for the special interest at - taching to first editions , this reprint is a far more desirable possession than a set of the original num - bers , and Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	is a public benefactor in furnishing for
five dollars	MONEY	what has hitherto been unattainable for less than fifty .

		The mechanical execution of the volume is in every way dignified and beautiful .

		The egotism that peeps through more than one of the essays composing Dr.
Charles C. Abbott	PERSON	's little book , '' Clear Skies and Cloudy '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , is not the sweet and engaging egotism of Montaigne .

		For one who has communed much with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	and worshipped alone in her temple in season and out of season , Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	appears to fidget a good deal about what the world is likely to think of him .

		The moment he scents a probable critic in his reader -LRB- which is pretty often -RRB- he is all prickles , like a hedgehog .

		He serves notice in his preface that he does n't care two straws what we may say of him , and that he proposes to go his own lonely way in spite of us .

		This we are entirely willing he should do , so long as he will continue to give us papers as fresh , suggestive , and stimulating as those in his present volume .

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	is a writer of the tribe of
Jeffries	PERSON	,
Burroughs	LOCATION	,
White	ORGANIZATION	, excellent teachers all .

		Nature out-of-doors is his theme , and he has studied it closely and loves it well .

		Some of the titles are : '' Frost Foliage , '' '' A Morning in
May	DATE	, '' '' My Elm-Tree Oriole , '' '' Christmas Out of Doors , '' `` In Deep , Dark Woods . ''

		There are twenty-three papers in all .

		The volume is one of the most tasteful of the smaller ones of the season , and contains nineteen charming illustrations in photogravure .

		A holiday edition of
Bulwer Lytton	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Paul Clifford	PERSON	'' is issued by
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		At first blush the experiment seems a hardy one .

		But modern taste in fiction is capricious , and there is no counting on a public that reads
E. P. Roe	PERSON	one day , Rider Haggard the next , and buys `` Trilby '' by the ton the day after .

		So it is altogether possible that
Lord Lytton	LOCATION	's stagey highwaymen , with their elaborate manners and high-flown language so different from our vulgar modern '' sand-baggers '' and low perpetrators of unromantic '' hold-ups '' may have one day more of moderate popularity .

		By the man of imagination , who prefers romance to verisimilitude in his fiction , ''
Paul Clifford	PERSON	'' may still be read with relish .

		It is a little hard , perhaps , to accept nowadays a thief who says to his victim -LRB- while rifling his pockets -RRB- : '' Lie still , lie still , I beseech you !

		All wise men are fatalists ; and no proverb is more pithy than that which says , ' What ca n't be cured must be endured . '

		Little , perhaps , do you think that you are performing one of the noblest functions of humanity '' and so forth , for a quarter of a page .

		But
Turpin	PERSON	was not
Jesse James	PERSON	, and he seems , like the '' Prince of Darkness , '' to have been '' a gentleman . ''

		It must have been almost a pleasure to be robbed so genteelly .

		The pres - ent volume is a sizable one , presentably gotten up throughout , and embellished with etchings -LRB- including a profile portrait of the author -RRB- by Mr.
W. H. Bick	PERSON	- nell after the designs of Mr.
W. L. Taylor	PERSON	.

		The cover is of blue ribbed cloth stamped in gold .

		A less venturesome issue than the above is the same firm 's holiday edition of
Bulwer	PERSON	's ever readable '' Strange Story , '' made up in uniform style with the ''
Paul Clifford	PERSON	, '' and illustrated by the same artists .

		Of the enthralling interest and weird motif of this strong novel , we need not speak .

		The new edition is likely to find favor .

		Miss Neltje Blanchan 's '' Birds that Hunt and are Hunted '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a work which we especially welcome , because it serves as a cogent pictorial tract in aid of the current crusade against a form of vandalism that has been causing the rapid disappearance of bird-life in the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		People are now awakening to the fact that , owing mainly to the prevalence of a tasteless and really barbarous fashion in dress the most beautiful of our American birds are in immi - nent danger of extermination .

		As the writer of the preface to this volume observes , '' It seems incred - ible that any woman in this enlightened and refined age could be induced to wear an ornament that has cost the life of so beautiful a creature as an egret , a scarlet tanager , or a
Baltimore	LOCATION	oriole . ''

		That such ornaments are worn is of course due to thoughtlessness rather than cruelty .

		The fashion endures because its barbarity and its deplorable results are not clearly apprehended by those who follow it .

		Therefore the fact should be brought home to the popular understanding , that every woman who parades the streets with her head-gear '' decorated '' with the spoils of these slaughtered innocents is an abettor and a supporter of the dreadful traffic that is fast robbing rural nature in this country of one of its rarest and sweetest charms .

		As long as there is a demand in the market for bright-plumaged birds for purposes of ornamentation , that demand will be supplied up to the point , of course , when the source of the supply is exhausted .

		That point is already almost reached in the case of several species of our loveliest feath - ered choristers , which , within the memory of many of us , used regularly in great numbers to herald the
spring	DATE	and gladden the Northern woods and mead - ows with their cheery tribute of color and song .

		A
summer	DATE	without birds would be like a
spring	DATE	with - out flowers ; and many of us have observed with a pang the gradual passing of bird-life in the Northern 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, States .

		Happily , public sentiment is now strongly roused on this subject .

		The surest way to promote this sentiment of bird love and bird protection is to study the birds .

		They can be studied most pleas - antly and conveniently with the aid of this attractive and accurate book .

		It contains forty-eight beauti - fully colored plates , by the aid of which alone any bird illustrated may be easily identified .

		The price of the volume is remarkably moderate , quality considered .

		Taken with its companion volume , the popular '' Bird Neighbors , '' by the same author , it forms an excellent and fairly comprehensive popular ornithology and an always suitable Christmas gift especially for boy or girl .

		Of a decidedly '' stunning '' order are the attrac - tions offered in Messrs.
E. II	PERSON	.


Herrick & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's three large oblong folio volumes of highly-colored draw - ings -LRB- selected from '' Truth '' -RRB- by Messrs.
De Thulstrup	PERSON	,
W. Gran ville Smith	PERSON	,
C. H. Johnson	PERSON	, and other American illustrators .

		The volumes measure 21x14 inches , and each is encased in a showily decorated box .

		It is not necessary to characterize these drawings at length , as the style of the artists represented , and the scope of the lively periodical from which the examples of their work are chosen , are tolerably familiar to all .

		The work of Messrs.
De Thulstrnp and Smith	PERSON	, especially , is quite clever in its way .

		These gentlemen have taken , in the main , the ways and doings of the
New York	LOCATION	'' smart set '' and their followers for their province , and the mirror they hold up is a true one .

		The '' up-to-date '' flavor of these showy volumes will doubtless com - mend them to the many who make that quality the test of merit .

		The instructive publication entitled '' Historic Towns of New England '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- does not in strictness fall within the present category .

		But its pleasing variety of content and ` liberal pictorial attractions serve to make it a suitable and accepta - ble gift-book , especially for a friend of '' Yankee '' extraction , whose early memories are cradled in one of the towns '' described .

		The volume is edited by the Rev.
Lyman P. Powell	PERSON	, and it has for its special purpose the presentation of a connected ac - count of the more important events in the history of the towns selected for description .

		These towns are :
Portland	LOCATION	,
Rutland	LOCATION	, Salem ,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Concord	LOCATION	,
Plymouth	LOCATION	, the
Cape Cod Towns	ORGANIZATION	,
Deerfield	LOCATION	,
Newport	LOCATION	,
Providence	LOCATION	,
Hartford	LOCATION	,
New Haven	LOCATION	.

		Each sketch has been entrusted to a writer specially qual - ified for the task .

		Mr.
S. T. Pickard	PERSON	leads off with the story of
Portland	LOCATION	; then come , in order , as above ,
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	,
George D. Latimer	PERSON	,
T. W. Hig	PERSON	- ginson and
E. E. Hale	PERSON	,
S. A. Eliot	PERSON	,
F. B. Sanborn	PERSON	,
Ellen Watson	PERSON	,
Katharine Lee Bates	PERSON	, etc. .

		An inter - esting general Introduction is supplied by
George Perry Morris	PERSON	, who discusses
New England	ORGANIZATION	towns and town life , and incidentally makes it clear that in his opinion the
New England	LOCATION	type of character stands for something very exalted indeed in the his - tory of the progress of the race .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	at times reminds one a little of the
New England	LOCATION	gentleman who , in a burst of generous enthusiasm over the genius of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, went so far as to declare that ''
Boston	LOCATION	had probably not produced above ten men who were equal to him . ''

		The volume is a comely octavo , well printed on lightly glazed paper , and containing 148 illustrations , the subjects of which are judiciously selected .

		In the publication of old favorites in fresh , comely , and inexpensive form ,
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are well to the fore this season with their ''
Luxem	PERSON	- bourg Edition '' of '' Vanity Fair , '' '' The Scottish Chiefs , '' '' Ivanhoe , '' **
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' '' The Cloister and the Hearth , '' ''
Corinne	PERSON	, '' and Irving 's '' Sketch - Book '' and ``
Alhambra	LOCATION	. ''

		Taking the first two works named above as samples of the whole , it must be said that they are remarkably well made in view of the very moderate price asked for them .

		The binding is neat , print and paper are all that could be expected for the money , and the illustrations are both plentiful and good .

		In ' < The Scottish Chiefs '' there are eighteen well chosen and nicely executed half-tone plates from photographs of storied Scottish views and buildings
Loch Katrine	PERSON	, '' Auld Brig < > ' Doon , ''
Cambus	PERSON	-
Kenneth	PERSON	,
Glenfinlas	PERSON	,
Stirling Castle	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		In the seventeen full-page illustrations of '' Vanity Fair '' Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	has done very well in the main .

		His
Becky Sharp	PERSON	is accept - able , his Jos.
Sedley	PERSON	is delightful , his
Osborn	PERSON	the elder is capital , and his
Lord Steyne	LOCATION	is goatish and hateful enough in all conscience .

		Nobody , of course , could do pictorial justice to Dobbin .

		Thackeray 's own drawings of him would answer as well for
Noah Claypole	PERSON	; and with Dobbin Mr.
Merrill	PERSON	fails like the rest .

		His
Rawdon Crawley	PERSON	is more like a
Kentucky	LOCATION	Colonel '' than a
London	LOCATION	Guardsman , but we do not wish to seem captious , for Mr.
Merrill	PERSON	, we repeat , has done well on the whole .

		In this very acceptable ''
Luxembourg	LOCATION	Edition '' each work is given complete in a single volume .

		The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us their ' customary brace of new volumes in their pretty `` Thumb-Nail '' series , the titles this season being '' Poor
Richard	PERSON	's Alma - nack '' and The Cricket on the Hearth '' both happy selections .

		The first is judiciously edited by Mr.
Benjamin E. Smith	PERSON	, and is a really choice little product of book-making .

		Never , we think , has the homely and practical the peculiarly American philosophy of sagacious
Ben	PERSON	.

		Franklin received so fit a setting .

		The little book is portable , and even pocket - able , and contains a frontispiece portrait of
Franklin	PERSON	, and a facsimile of the first number of the Almanack , for the year
1733	DATE	.

		Miss
Blanche McManus	PERSON	's design for the stamped leather cover is particularly good .

		In the minds of many of us Mr.
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	is pleasantly identified with the character of ''
Caleb Plummer	PERSON	'' ; and we are glad to find that the Intro - duction to this edition of
Dickens	PERSON	's little masterpiece is from the pen of that sterling American actor .

		Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	surmises that had
Dickens	PERSON	known how good a play there was in '' The Cricket on the Hearth '' he would have dramatized it himself .

		Could he have foreseen how delightfully Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	would im -

		Their range and character are shown by the chapter headings '' Lepers and Leprosy in the
East	LOCATION	, '' '' A Trip to
Hebron	LOCATION	, '' ' * House-keeping in
Turkey	LOCATION	, '' '' In the Tower of Many Stories '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	Tower -RRB- , ''
William Wetmore Story	PERSON	, '' '' A Letter from Dres - den , '' ''
Florence Nightingale	PERSON	, '' `` Two Days in West - minster Abbey , '' etc. .

		Among the literary and epistolary odds and ends interspersed through the book is an amusing letter from
General Wallace	ORGANIZATION	to a friend , describing his purchase of a dog in Lon - don as a present to the Sultan .

		The contents of the volume are too varied for general characterization ; and the same may be said of the pictures , which consist of an oddly assorted but interesting medley of views of historic sites and buildings , portraits , photographic prints of native '' types , '' works of art , and what not .

		Mrs.
Wallace	PERSON	is a lively and agree - able writer , and her fund of experience is rich and ample .

		The book possesses many elements of popu - larity , and its attractive exterior bespeaks for it its due share of attention .

		Much intelligent and conscientious labor is rep - resented in Miss
Estelle M. Hurll	PERSON	's '' Life of Our Lord in Art '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The book is essentially a descriptive history of the art illustrating the inci - dents in the historic life of
Christ	LOCATION	, the accompanying plates being arranged in the authoritatively ap - proved chronological order of the events depicted - Symbolical and allegorical Christ art and the his - tory of Christ portraiture are omitted .

		The author 's treatment of her theme is systematic throughout , a certain number of points in connection with each subject being uniformly set forth : the relation of the subject to the life and character of Christ ; the origin and history of its treatment in art ; the reasons for its popularity or neglect ; its suitability for pictorial treatment ; the traditional type of com - position , and possible variations ; and , lastly , a descriptive account of the leading representative pictures from the appearance of the subject in art down to present times .

		With a half-dozen excep - tions , every subject treated in the text is illustrated , sometimes by two pictures , making a total of 104 illus - trations .

		Of these , sixteen are full-page half-tone plates which present leading facts in the life of
Christ	LOCATION	; the remainder are vignette drawings illustrating the minor incidents .

		The Old Masters are of course well represented in the list of plates ; and the modern schools have also their share of attention , pre - Raphaelitism in Holman Hunt ,
Millais	PERSON	,
Burne	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	, and
Ford Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	; the German mys - tic realism in
Fritz von Uhde	LOCATION	; while there are also examples of
Eastlake	LOCATION	,
Hoffmann	PERSON	, Dore '' , etc. .

		In selecting the pictures the necessity of presenting an historical series illustrative of the text has been mainly kept in view ; but esthetic considerations have not been slighted .

		On the whole , the work forms an instructive and attractive art-book of the solider type , being soberly conceived and soberly worked out .

		An illustrated volume of selections from
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's poems forms this year 's number of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's series of '' Selections from the Poets '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		There is a rather lengthy in - troduction , mainly biographical , in Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's hap - piest vein , and the selections -LRB- thirty-three pieces in all -RRB- embody about all of Coleridge that most people have time or taste for nowadays .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	does not attempt to '' place ''
Coleridge	PERSON	, but he volunteers an answer to the question , '' Why is he great ? ''

		He is a great poet -LRB- says Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, rather in the Coleridgean manner -RRB- '' because every now and then he captures in verse that indefinable emotion which is less articulately expressed in music , and in some unutterable way he transports us into the world of dream and desire . ''

		The little book falls within the present category largely by virtue of Mr.
Patten Wilson	PERSON	's capital drawings .

		There are eighteen of them , full-page plates in the pre-Raphaelite style .

		They are quaintly fancied , too vague , or generalized , to clash with one 's ideals ; and even the more austere Coleridgean will hardly wish them away .

		Magazine readers who have laughed over Mr.
Guy Wetmore Caryl	PERSON	's quaint versified renderings of old ^ sopian favorites will be glad to find these funny productions reprinted in a handsome vol - ume entitled '' Fables for the Frivolous '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		There are twenty '' Fables '' in all , among them '' The Ambitious Fox and the Unapproachable Grapes , '' `` The Arrogant Frog and the Superior Bull , '' The Urban Rat and the Suburban Rat , '' '' The Sycophantic Fox and the Gullible Raven , '' and so forth .

		The turn of the author 's humor may almost be guessed from his titles ; but we subjoin a specimen verse , taken from '' The Unusual Goose and the Imbecile Woodcutter '' that is , from the author 's version of '' The Goose that laid the Golden Eggs . ''

		It is Verse Number Two : '' There was much affected rejoicing In the home of the woodcutter then , And his wife , her exuberance voicing , Proclaimed him most lucky of men . '

		'T is an omen of fortune , this gold egg , ' She said , ' and of practical use , For this fowl does n't lay any old egg , She 's a highly superior goose . ' ''

		The book is gotten up in suitable holiday style , and contains six illustrations by Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	, one of the funniest of our pictorial fun-makers .

		We have so often commented on the work of Mr.
Frederic Remington	PERSON	that a word or two of de - scription will suffice here for his new series of '' Frontier Sketches '' -LRB-
The Werner Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is a flat oblong quarto bound in white vellum paper , and containing or , rather , consisting of , for there is no text save Mr.
G. S. Rowe	PERSON	's short introductory fifteen rather elaborate drawings with such titles as 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, - Pursuing Geronimo , '' Indian Village Routed , '' -
Sioux Warriors	PERSON	, '' `` The Lame Deer Fight , '' Surrender of Chief
Joseph	PERSON	, ''
Indiana	LOCATION	Firing the Prairie , '' etc. .

		Altogether , the set is aa graphic and stirring as any that we have seen from Mr.
Rem	PERSON	- ington 's pencil .

		It vividly and truthfully presents some of the most exciting and characteristic epi - sodes of that wild drama now drawing to a close on our Western plains .

		We may say , incidentally , that Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's style is agreeably chastened of late .

		It has lost none of its truth , but there is less of the superfluous bluntness of realism , more deference to the picturesque and the pleasing .

		In a word , Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's style has grown mellower and more artistic , and when we say that , we do not mean more conventional .

		He is , too , as it seems to us , getting over his liking for grotesque '' Muybridge '' effects shown , for instance , in those amazing horses of his , comically humped up with their hoofs bunched under them , like Mr.
Frost	PERSON	's funny dogs and jack-rabbits , or sprawling in air like a beetle dangled at the end of a string .

		We may be wrong , and an appeal to instantaneous photography might show that we are ; but we shall be slow to admit the '' realism '' of the equine contortions shown in some of Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's pictures .

		From such eccentric - ities the plates in the present volume are unusually free . ''

		Do-Nothing Days '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is a bouquet of a dozen little essays by Mr.
Charles M. Skinner	PERSON	.

		We have known Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	heretofore mainly as a compiler ; and we are now glad to have made his closer acquaintance through the medium of these crisp , familiar papers .

		Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	takes a cheery view of life , and chats away confidentially on what - ever happens to turn uppermost in his mind , in the essayist 's true style .

		There is no smell of the lamp in his pages , but there is a flavor of good reading .

		The chapters , aa he says , `` have mostly thought themselves into words in hours of wandering or idleness . ''

		As a companion for such hours , the little volume will serve very acceptably .

		There are four dainty photogravures , and the very tasteful binding calls for special mention .

		A year or so ago we noticed favorably a little collection of American legends compiled by Mr.
Charles M. Skinner	PERSON	.

		The kind reception accorded Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	's first effort has encouraged him to go beyond the territory of the
United States	LOCATION	for ma - terial for a fresh collection ; and this material he now embodies in a small-sized but rather closely printed book of '' Myths and Legends Beyond Our Borders '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		About two-thirds of the collection are drawn from
Canada	LOCATION	, and the re - mainder from
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		There is much curious and suggestive matter in the volume , and it should not be neglected by students of folk-lore .

		There are four very attractive plates representing ''
Chapulte	PERSON	- pec , '' '' The Church at Tadousac , '' '' Medicine Hat Assiniboia , '' and << Popocatepetl . ''

		Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	is to be complimented on his clever illustration of Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new two-volume edition of
Dumas	PERSON	' '' Twenty Years After . ''

		The eighteen plates are uniformly good , and show that Mr.
Merrill	PERSON	knows hi - author .

		The edition is a good one throughout notably so , con - sidering the moderate price asked for it .

		The translation is made from the latent French edition , and is a marked improvement on the slipshod ver - sions through which so many English readers have become acquainted with this fascinating romance .

		An attractive and readable book , whose cheery content belies its dismal title , is
Marion Harland	PERSON	's `` Where Ghosts Walk '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Drawing on her experiences abroad , Mrs.
Terhune	PERSON	has written fifteen sprightly papers descriptive of places once the haunts of historic people such as Holy rood Palace , the
Burns Cottage	ORGANIZATION	,
Hampton Court Palace	ORGANIZATION	, The `` Old Cheshire Cheese '' Tavern ,
Byron	PERSON	's
House	ORGANIZATION	at
Ravenna	LOCATION	,
Saint Catherine 's House	ORGANIZATION	at
Florence	LOCATION	,
Madame Beck 's House	ORGANIZATION	at
Brussels	LOCATION	, and so on .

		Five of the papers are reprinted from
Harper	PERSON	's '' Bazar . ''

		The book is illustrated with thirty-four plates , which are well selected and of good quality .

		Prospective tourists should find Mrs.
Terhune	PERSON	's sketches useful and suggestive .

		Two trim little volumes of '' Historical Tales '' told by Mr.
Charles Morris	PERSON	come to us from the
Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The one volume embraces episodes from the history of
Russia	LOCATION	, such as the
Fall of Novgorod the Great	ORGANIZATION	, the Conquest of
Siberia	LOCATION	, the Fall of the
Strelitz	PERSON	, the Death-Struggle of
Poland	LOCATION	, the Nihilists and their Work , the Advance of Rus - sia in
Asia	LOCATION	, and so on ; the other volume contains tales from the history of
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	selected on the principle indicated in the foregoing li-t .

		There are about forty `` Tales '' to the volume , and each volume contains a dozen or eo full-page photo - graphic plates .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	is well known as the author of a series of '' Tales from the Dramatists , '' ''
King Arthur	PERSON	and the Knights of the Round Table , '' etc. , and he has shown his customary good judg - ment in the preparation of the present volumes .

		The stories are popularly told , and should especially interest and instruct younger readers .

		`` The Old Chelsea Bun-House '' -LRB- imported by
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a tale of the
last century	DATE	, is a clever bit of literary mimicry and a charming picture of old times and old manners .

		The author has taken
Goldsmith	PERSON	for his model , and he echoes him skil - fully .

		The story is told in the first person , and is put in the month of ''
Patty	PERSON	, '' a daughter of the keeper of the hostelry which gives the book its title .

		The tale opens with the visit of a party of ladies and gentlemen of `` quality , '' who go up from the city to
Chelsea	LOCATION	by water .

		They amuse themselves alfresco after the conventionally frivolous and non - sensical manner of people of fashion -LRB- and to the grave disapproval of a serious and somewhat prig - gish '' Mr.
Fenwick	PERSON	, '' who eavesdrops from a neigh - boring window -RRB- , and are served demurely from the Bun-House by '' Mrs.
Patty	PERSON	'' and her sister .

		This introduces most of the dramatis persona ; , and the story moves on thence smoothly and in the main
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 405 merrily to its conclusion .

		There is much lively dialogue and episode , and no plot to speak of or , rather , there is a medley of small plots arising out of the loves , jealousies , uneven fortunes , foibles , or cross-purposes of the rather numerous actors .

		The book is essentially a picture of eighteenth-century manners couched in eighteenth-century style ; and it is cleverly done .

		There are ten delightful illustra - tions by Messrs.
John Jellicoe	PERSON	and
Herbert Railton	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Annie Trumbull Slosson	PERSON	's popular character sketch of '' Fishin ' Jimmy '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a book we like much in spite of its lachrymose ending , makes its appearance this season in attractive holiday garb , and with a dozen photogravures of fair quality by Miss
Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	.

		Print and paper are the best , and the modest cover is of grass-green linen with gilt side-stamp .

		Mrs.
Slosson	PERSON	's book is redolent of the scents of brookside and meadow , and her portrait of the good old angler of Fran - conia is so sweet and true -LRB- so long as she sticks to portraiture -RRB- that one can only wonder when she stoops to the worn device of killing her hero off to slow music in the last chapter .

		The silly and offensive picture that appears on the cover and title-page of the volume containing Mr.
Ch	PERSON	.

		Nelan 's '' Cartoons of Our War with
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- does injustice to Mr.
Nelan	PERSON	's often clever and incisive work .

		Mr.
Nelan	PERSON	's cartoons are not mere pictorial buffonery .

		At their best they show a real grasp of the political situation treated , and their lesson is sound .

		The cartoon , in proper hands , is a potent instrument of popular instruction ; and it is fair to Mr.
Nelan	PERSON	to say that a considerable portion of his work made distinctly for good when it appeared .

		For instance , there is the familiar drawing entitled '' Keep Your Head Cool , '' repre - senting '' Uncle Sam '' trying to repress his rising anger against
Spain	LOCATION	-LRB- in spite of the stings of vari - ous journalistic mosquitoes -RRB- , while some sensible person holds a block of ice , labelled `` Common Sense , '' to his head , and another cools his heated brow with the fan of `` Judgment . ''

		Naturally , the series of plates grows rather more truculent and `` jingoistic '' with the progress of events ; but they are always clever and seldom coarse .

		Mr.
Nelan	PERSON	was one of the best of the Spanish War cartoonists , and this volume forms a suggestive and striking souvenir of the period .

		The second volume of '' Historic New York '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- contains twelve of the interesting '' Half Moon '' series of descriptive and reminiscential pa - pers on Old
New York	LOCATION	, with the scope and aim of which our readers are already familiar .

		The pub - lication is a worthy one of considerable historic value .

		The contents of this volume comprise : '' Slavery in Old
New York	LOCATION	, '' by
Edwin V. Morgan	PERSON	; `` Tammany Hall , '' by
Talcott Williams	PERSON	; `` Old Prisons and Punishments , '' by
Elizabeth D. Lewis	PERSON	; `` The
New York	LOCATION	Press , '' by
Charlotte	LOCATION	M. and
Ben	PERSON	- jamin
E. Martin	PERSON	; ''
Bowling Green	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Spencer	PERSON	.

		Trask ; '' Old Family Names , '' by
Berthold Fernow	PERSON	; '' Old Taverns and Posting Inns , '' by
Elizabeth B.	PERSON	Cutting ; '' Early Schools and Schoolmasters of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	, '' by
Emma Van Vechten	PERSON	; and so on .

		There are thirty-two illustrations , with maps , curious facsimiles , etc. .

		The volumes are neatly got up , and the work evidences on the whole the serious purpose and the special competency of its contrib - utors .

		BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		L The question , '' But is it true ? ''

		is the one most familiar on the lips of a child , and sometimes most diffi - cult to answer .

		And it may be out of generosity to the harrassed and bewildered parent , that so many writers of juvenile books give their stories a foundation in fact .

		The motive is of doubtful value , however , for a story which is half true is much more likely to be essentially false than one woven entirely by the imagination .

		Facts must be first understood before they can be made truths .

		And one must be either an artist or a philosopher to make the perspective accurate .

		Unfortunately , most of the writ - ers of the present group of holiday books can not be described by either term , and it is safe to say that many of the facts they record would not recognize themselves even as possibilities .

		Yet we elders complacently rejoice in being able to dispense history to our boys in these sugar-coated pills .

		Some of them certainly are harm - less enough , and others may even be mildly nutritious ; but as mental tonic or stimulant , they are rarely effec - tive .

		The dose of history contained in them is decidedly homo3opathic .

		Of the few children 's books of this season which pro- claim themselves to be history unadulterated , a new edition of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	's '' Child 's History of Eng - land '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- may be taken with most confidence .

		This work is written with such spirit as to belittle the more labored chronicles , and to show that training in writing is not amiss even for a child 's book .

		This most recent edition is embellished with many reproductions of excellent photographs by Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	.

		They represent , as they exist to-day , the castles and fields and towns where famous deeds were done : a long and interesting journey to take in one 's library chair .

		To look through Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	's '' Story of
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Werner	PERSON	-RRB- means a shorter journey , but a more fatiguing one , because the assistance is so much more meagre .

		For this new edition the text has been revised by the author , who has added some chapters about the more picturesque events of the Spanish war .

		Founded upon
McKenzie	PERSON	's history of the
United States	LOCATION	, the narrative is simple and written with some force .

		The illustrations , some of them taken from quaint old engravings , are more interesting than beautiful .

		But Mr.
Butterworth	PERSON	gives his readers credit for more intelli - gence than Mr.
Eldridge S. Brooks	PERSON	does in his '' True Story of Benjamin Franklin '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		So familiar and conversational a style as his seems unnecessary even for very little children .

		Yet the story of
Franklin	PERSON	can not be told too early or too often , and this gossipy biogra - phy , with its many good pictures , may serve to introduce the man and his achievements to some children who would be bored by a more connected and rational account .

		The story of
Franklin	PERSON	's life , with its rapid and brilli - ant transitions , is hardly less romantic than are the biog - raphies one finds in Mr.
F. R. Stockton	PERSON	's '' Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		But these char - 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, acters have more spice in them , and their adventures give Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	abundant excuse for the display of his peculiar and delightful talent .

		The effort to tell the truth about these artists in piracy has not prevented him from describing them gaily and with a kind of amused sympathy .

		The book is serious enough , but there are illuminating flashes of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's dry humor .

		It is this quality in him which makes the work sane and wholesome , and helps him to model his bold buccaneers in the round .

		They are delightful , these spirited dash - ing figures ; and though Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	knocks off some of the romance which has gathered about them , there is enough left to bewitch any number of naughty little boys .

		The individuality of the book is reflected in the capital pictures by Mr.
George Varian	PERSON	and Mr.
B. West Clinedinst	PERSON	.

		The charm of this book is rivalled only by one other in this group , and that is '' The Story of
Marco	PERSON	Polo '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which Mr.
Noah Brooks	PERSON	has edited and arranged for the young .

		It is hardly necessary to say that the great Venetian traveller named was the first to penetrate the Orient and to bring back to the aston - ished Europeans tales of the civilizations of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		The stories then disbelieved have been proved true by later explorers , and it is pleasant to hear them told by this intelligent and alert young investigator , to whom every - thing was new .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	has done his work well , retaining the flavor of the original work , and connecting his long quotations from it merely with the necessary details , briefly and clearly expressed .

		The pictures , by Mr.
Will H. Drake	PERSON	, add to the extraordinary , quaint charm of the book .

		Mr.
Clinton Ross	PERSON	deals with quite another time and other peoples in '' Heroes of onr War with
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , and gives a vivid impression of the valorous deeds that were done this
summer	DATE	by our heroes on land and sea .

		There is no lack of material here to stir the blood and fire the imagination of youth ; and the author has handled it in a spirited and effective way .

		The other books in this group are more or less diluted with fiction .

		In some of them the color of the original facts is entirely lost in the mixture , but there are a few from which one can derive some idea of the real situ - ation , some picture of other times and customs .

		The greater number of them deal with the
United States	LOCATION	and its various conflicts , but only one writer has been enter - prising enough to take up the recent events .

		The Revo - lution keeps up its record for popularity , but three or four books take us as far back as the French and Indian war , and one even goes back to the
Mayflower	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	has bad the courage for the latter foray , and in '' The Pilot of the Mayflower '' -LRB- Apple ton -RRB- he brings in all the events known to have happened during that famous voyage .

		The pilot is made to tell these stories , and if he could not add to our respect for the Pilgrim Fathers he increases our knowledge of their difficulties .

		The book ends with the first Thanksgiving Day in the colony .

		Not many years intervene before the point where Mrs.
Mary P. Wells Smith	PERSON	takes up the theme , in '' The Young Puritans in
King Philip	LOCATION	's War '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , wherein she shows our modern warriors how their forefathers fought .

		Mrs.
Smith	PERSON	knows the
Connecticut Valley	LOCATION	thoroughly , and she puts something into her story which no stranger to it could compass .

		Her familiarity with its beauty makes for warmth and picturettqueness in this narrative of the conflict of races over its golden meadows .

		She uses the quaint speech of the early Puritans with good effect , and her descrip - tion of the
Deerfield Massacre	ORGANIZATION	and the events that led up to it is simple and vivid .

		It is entirely from the standpoint of the settlers , of course : it would be a pleas - ant relief to find a story of these wars from tin - Indian point of view .

		Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	has written two books about the period just before the Revolution . ''

		When
Israel Putnam	PERSON	served the King '' -LRB- Rates -RRB- gives the story of an old man who had fought under Gem-nil Put in m when he was a Major and served the
King	LOCATION	.

		He wishes to prove to a new-fangled soldier that men in those days knew something about fighting and its hardships and glory , and he leaves him in no doubt of their courage and endurance . ''

		The Charming Sally '' -LRB- Houghtou -RRB- , by the same author , is longer and more carefully worked up .

		The title is taken from the name of a privateer schooner which , in
1765	DATE	, had an active part in the resistance to the Stamp Act .

		The movements of three boys who join its crew are the focus of the plot , and the most exciting part of the story describes their perilous adventures in carry - ing the ship 's guns , concealed in a load of hay , to the dock .

		Mr.
Otis	PERSON	's boys are good and lively specimens , and they make things move at a rapid pace .

		The book is notice - ably well printed and bound , and the pictures , by Mr.
W. S. Lukeus	PERSON	, are good Mrs. .


Everett Green	PERSON	's `` French and English '' -LRB- Nelson -RRB- , is a well-constructed and vivid story of the terrible struggle which ended on the heights of
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		It is unusual , in that it gives both sides of the picture ; and the figure of
Montcalm	LOCATION	, as shown here , is not less dignified and noble than that of
Wolfe	PERSON	.

		It is a very large canvas , however , that the writer tries to cover , and the persons of her play are so numerous as to be a bit bewildering .

		She differentiates them well , however , and gives one the horrors of war as well as its tinselled glory .

		The number of books about the Revolution shows where the heart of our youth really is , and may do its part toward postponing that alliance with
England	LOCATION	of which we have been talking .

		It is difficult to affect a prejudice which is born and nurtured in our earliest youth .

		And it takes more courage than the average writer possesses , to be just to the redcoats in such a book as Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	's '' Minute Boys of
Lexington	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Kates	PERSON	-RRB- ; and probably , if he were just , the volume would remain indefinitely on the counter .

		As it is , there are few boys who can read the book without wishing that his lot had been cast in
Lexington	LOCATION	in so happily exciting a time .

		The style of the book is rather diffuse and discursive , but the matter has a thrill in it .

		And the two boys in blue and buff uniforms on the cover are themselves fascinating .

		Mr.
Everett T. Tomlinsou	PERSON	's second series of '' Stories of the American Revolution '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- bears a more direct re - lation to history than most of these books .

		He has selected some of the less familiar heroic episodes in the war , and written them up in the form of fiction , with the sugar-coating which is considered necessary .

		They are pleasant enough to read , however , and some of them tell of the quiet , unapplauded deeds of heroism which are the most difficult of all .

		The same author has written a story of
Washington	LOCATION	's campaign in
New Jersey	LOCATION	in
1778	DATE	, under the title of '' The Boys of Old Monmouth '' -LRB- Houghtou -RRB- .

		Much responsibility is thrown upou its hero by bis discovery that his own foster - father is working against the cause of the patriots , and his attempts to circumvent him bring many adventures .

		The battle of
Monmouth	LOCATION	is the climax of the book , and Lee 's disobedience of orders a large part of the theme .

		Still another book by Mr.
Tomlinson	PERSON	relates to Bur - goyne 's invasion , and is called '' Two Young Patriots ''
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 407 -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It ends with the defeat of the British gen - eral ; but though the author aims at truth in his de - scriptions , he altogether misses the vivid picturesque - ness which would carry the situation home to us .

		Miss
Mary B. Sheldon	PERSON	's '' One Thousand Men for a Christ - mas Present '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- has a cover attractive enough to atone for its cumbersome title .

		It is a vivid little tale of the encampment near
Trenton	LOCATION	and the crossing of the
Delaware	LOCATION	, ending with the capture of the city and a thousand Hessian prisoners .

		Mr.
Charles Ledyard Norton	PERSON	's '' A Soldier of the Legion '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- begins with the Revolution and makes its boy heroes witness the surrender at
Yorktown	LOCATION	.

		But it carries them far beyond that event , and describes their experience as pioneers in the great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The boys are
William Henry Harrison	PERSON	, who became President , and
Sergeant Bassett	PERSON	, his faithful attendant , who is supposed to write the book Two of these Revolutionary books make one conscious for the first time that girls were alive during that period .

		One 's attention had been given so exclusively to boys that such a possibility was not recog - nized .

		It is with a pleased surprise , therefore , that one takes up '' A Girl of '76 '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	.

		The little heroine 's interest in politics be - gins with the
Boston	LOCATION	tea-party , and though the book deals largely with more frivolous things than battles , the war is always in the background .

		The author tries , with some success , to show what a girl 's life was at that time .

		There are plenty of people in the book , but there is not much life , and it drifts into sentimentality at the end , the usual course with books for girls .

		The senti - ment is handled much better in
Margaret Sidney	PERSON	's `` Little Maid of Concord Town '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , but it is present nevertheless .

		Yet the story has a charm which brings it nearer to life and makes the love-affairs a bit more pardonable .

		It is full of action , but it has form , and the characters are simple and genuine .

		Mr.
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	has actually found a new subject in his tale of the American navy , called '' In Pirate Waters '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		He places his hero in the squad - ron sent to the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, in
1803	DATE	, to subdue the Barbary pirates .

		The combination of the familiar and the foreign makes this a capital subject , and Mr.
Munroe	PERSON	has a practised hand in the construction of a boy 's book .

		The result is one of the liveliest and most entertaining historical stories of the year .

		The war of
1812	DATE	is cel - ebrated by Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	, in `` The Cruise of the Comet '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Otis	PERSON	has made a book out of the letters written by a boy ,
Stephen Burton	PERSON	, who was on board the privateer '' Comet , '' which sailed from
Baltimore	LOCATION	in
1812	DATE	.

		They are written in a simple and vigorous style , which is very effective .

		It would be a dull boy who would not be excited by
Stephen	PERSON	's story of the British prisoners who managed to free themselves and tried to capture the ship .

		It is to the Civil War that Captain
Charles King	PERSON	gives his attention in '' From School to Battlefield '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , and he does it in a brisk and thoroughgoing fashion that must appeal to an energetic boy .

		The persons in his story have the air of being real boys , and they find some spirited adven - ture in General
McClellan	PERSON	's army , where boys were evidently made useful .

		The book has the advantage of some clever pictures by Miss
Violet Oakley	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Warren Lee Goss	PERSON	also devotes himself to the Civil War in `` In the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	; or , Father against Son '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , and focuses his story in the battle between the Monitor and the
Merrimac	LOCATION	.

		Most of the action takes place on the rivers of
Virginia	LOCATION	and
North Carolina	LOCATION	, which were so useful to the blockade runners .

		The enterprising spirit of Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	, who inaugurates the `` Old Glory Series '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with a book called '' Under Dewey at
Manila	LOCATION	, '' is much more com - mendable than his literary form .

		The story has no construction , the method of handling it is jerky and discursive , and the style is bad .

		Moreover , the point of view is sentimental and false , and unintentionally the story belittles both the Commodore and his victory It is by a stretch of the imagination , perhaps , that '' Cowmen and Rustlers '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Edward S. Ellis	PERSON	, is entered in the list of historical tales .

		Yet it is a story of the
Wyoming	LOCATION	cattle ranges in
1892	DATE	, and no war is more important or more picturesque than the development of the great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The theme of this story is the struggle with the '' rustlers , '' or cattle - thieves , who became powerful for a time in
Wyoming	LOCATION	.

		The talk is stilted and the incidents are exaggerated beyond the bounds of probability , yet it is a pretty good story nevertheless .

		Fame and fortune await the man who will write the truth about this life and write it with art .

		America claims apparently the lion 's share of the interest of her youth , yet this interest reaches out a little into the history of other lands , and it should cer - tainly travel far enough to take in the admirable book edited by Mr.
George Laurence Gomme	PERSON	, entitled '' The Queen 's Story Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		This volume con - tains dramatic tales of English monarchs , collected from romantic literature .

		Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	furnish a number of them ,
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	wrote one , and others are taken from Sir
Charles Napier	PERSON	,
Froissart	LOCATION	,
Thomas Love Peacock	PERSON	, and
Mary Wolstonecraf	PERSON	t Shelley .

		The result is just the kind of book to afford children vivid pictures of things it is well for them to know .

		Literature is just as good for a child as it is for a grown person , and twaddle is just as bad .

		This is a fact which can not be repeated too often .

		And another , equally important , and ignored in the same unaccountable way , is that children like the real thing in literature better than they like the false .

		They are much more discrim - inating in matters of art than their elders fancy .

		Mr.
Gomme	PERSON	's delightful book has an additional charm in the pictures by Mr.
W. H. Robinson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Charles W. Whistler	PERSON	has written a story about the first English fleet in '' King
Alfred	PERSON	's Viking '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is founded upon the life of Alfred written by his chaplain
Asser	ORGANIZATION	, but it consists chiefly of an account of the adventures of the Norsemen who were given charge of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's fleet .

		It is a good story , and -LRB- what is more unusual -RRB- it is well written .

		One of the best books of the year gives part of the romantic story of the
Black Prince	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	has put himself into the spirit of the thing , and he makes every right-minded boy long to follow that Red Dragon banner into the heart of the battle of
Cre	ORGANIZATION	` cy . ''

		With the Black Prince '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- should not be neglected Another well-written book , though one much less convincing , is Miss
Ruth Hall	PERSON	's `` In the Brave Days of Old '' -LRB- Houghtou -RRB- .

		It carries us down to the time of James the First , and opens at the death-bed of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		The little hero rides , with his guardian , to take the news of this dramatic ending to the new king in
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		But this is only the be - ginning of his adventures , which carry him finally with Hudson to
America	LOCATION	, and make him one of the first set - tlers of
Manhattan	LOCATION	.

		We come down to
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's time in Mr.
Frank Cowper	PERSON	's '' The Island of the En - glish '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , though the Emperor himself does not appear .

		The emigres and their misfortunes are the 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, theme of the story , which is vividly told .

		It is dramatic , and handled in excellent fashion .

		One of Mr. 6 .

		A. Henty 's books , '' Under
Wellington	LOCATION	's Command '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- , deals with almost the same period .

		It is a story of the Peninsular War , in continuation of '' With
Moore	PERSON	in
Corunna	LOCATION	, '' and it takes up the history of
Terence O'Connor	PERSON	at the battle of Salamanca Mr.
Henty	PERSON	, still indefatigable , contributes two other books to the season 's Christmas hilarity .

		One is a story of Hotspur and Glendower , called '' Both Sides the Border '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- , and it would be bard to find a more fascinating subject .

		It might be still pleasanter , though , to read about it in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		The third of this annual tri - umvirate relates to
Napoleon	PERSON	's invasion of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		`` At Aboukir and Acre '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- gives the author a chance to glorify the English arms at the expense of an almost invincible conqueror .

		Mr.
Henty	PERSON	's stories are too well known to need further description .

		He knows thoroughly well how to interest a boy in every page , and his style is spirited and good .

		The last book of this group is a story of the
Maccabees	ORGANIZATION	, written by Miss
Charlotte M. Yonge	PERSON	, whose following is large .

		In '' The Patriot * of Palestine '' -LRB-
Thomas Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- she tries to give an idea of the real career of Maccabeus and bis brother
Eleazer	PERSON	.

		It is an unfamiliar part of Jewish history , and if Miss Yonge can not make it live for us , she can at least suggest it .

		But the names and something in the manner make it a bit heavy for children .

		After so much serious literature , a little excursion into the land of fancy may be refreshing even to the big boys who outwardly scorn such frivolity .

		The pic - ture books , the fairy tales , and the nursery rhymes make a rather interesting group this year .

		And artis - tically the honors are divided .

		In literature they go to `` W. V. 's Golden Legend '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , and to the new edition , in one volume , of '' The Invisible Playmate '' and '' W. V .

		Her Book '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , both by the same author , Mr.
William Canton	PERSON	.

		The latter book was rec - ognized , on its first appearance , as one of the most ten - der and lovely pictures of child-life that have ever been written .

		The `` Golden Legend , '' with its admirable pictures by Mr.
T. H. Robinson	PERSON	, would have interest for as if only because it was ''
W. V.	PERSON	's . ''

		But in itself there is an exquisite beauty .

		It is made up of tales of the saints and martyrs , told as a poet might tell them to a child he loved .

		He makes these austere heroes more fascinating than fairies , more beautiful than princesses , and very human .

		Yet he is true to the spirit of the simple old legends , and the hidden signifi - cance of them becomes visible in his hands .

		We rec - ognize the great truths in character , the great lessons in conduct , which underlie them .

		But these are never obtruded , and the first and last impression is of beauty .

		In art , the honors are carried off conspicuously by '' An Alphabet of Animals '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , in which Mr.
Carton Moore	PERSON	Park takes rank with the cleverest painters of animals .

		The weather-beaten nags which appear upon the cover are alone enough to prove his artistic skill , but they lead us into a land where the most strange and enchanting creatures become our familiar friends .

		There is nothing superficial in Mr.
Park	PERSON	's knowledge of these animals ; he knows them as Barge knew them , with an intense sympathy for their characteristic peculiarities and uglinesses .

		There is humor in many of his drawings , but it has a deep serious - neas to support it .

		And this is all expressed in terms of art .

		It is a book that will delight children and col - lectors , and drive artists to despair Mr.
Kemble	PERSON	's humor in '' Comical Coons '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is more obvious .

		He exaggerates his types as he does his situations , but he does it consistently , and his mules and little dogs are as funny as his pickaninnies .

		Occasionally he forces his mirth a little , and this book is less genuine than others he has given us .

		Yet his darkies are still irresistible Mr.
Henry Bradford Simmons	PERSON	's `` Jingle Jangle Rhyme Book '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- is pure farce .

		Once or twice only does it achieve real fun , but everywhere else the effort is pain - fully apparent .

		The pictures are printed in colors which would be good if only an artist had combined them .

		Crudity is evidently the intention .

		Mr.
Simmons	PERSON	prob - ably dare not be as artistic as be could .

		Miss
S. Rosa	PERSON	- mund
Praeger	PERSON	continues some adventures begun last year in `` Further Doings of the Three Bold Babes '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- .

		By means of a gentle and obliging sea-serpent , which curls itself into a tubular bridge for their con - venience , they are enabled to enter the kingdom of the Head-hoppers .

		It is a realm which very little people will find amusing .

		For their benefit also was con - structed The Golliwogg at the Sea-Side '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , with pictures by
Miss Florence K. Upton	PERSON	and verses by Miss
Bertha Upton	PERSON	.

		No particular cleverness is wasted upon it , however , and the pictures of these jointed dolls are almost as wearisome as the rhymed narrative of their experience .

		Mr.
J. L. C. Booth	PERSON	's '' Sporting Rhymes and Pictures '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is for older and wiser children .

		The rhymes are gay and spirited , and the pictures have a great deal of life in them .

		There is character enough and to spare in both men and horses , and the artist has a refreshing keen sense of humor .

		We are all young again for an hour with ''
Jack	PERSON	the Giant Killer '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , as he appears in the series of Mr.
Hugh Thom	PERSON	- son 's illustrated fairy-books in paper covers .

		It is a good old-fashioned story with pictures of the right sort .

		These are just the kind of giants to give dreams to the old and nightmares to the young . ''

		Nursery Tales , '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is a series of paper dolls , made ready to cut out from the pages .

		They illustrate '' Mother Goose '' rhymes .

		A book of really delightful ballads is hard to find , but when one lights upon such a one as '' Down
Durley Lane	PERSON	, and Other Ballads '' -LRB- Century -RRB- it should kindle joy and merriment in the adults who read them and in the chil - dren who listen .

		Miss
Virginia Woodward Cloud	ORGANIZATION	has a sense of humor which can not leave one serious , and a sense of rhythm which makes her verses sing in the brain .

		So happy a combination could not fail to make a charming book , even without the assistance of Mr.
Reginald Birch	PERSON	's clever and amusing pictures , in which we find a full appreciation of the delicacy of Miss Cloud 's satirical character study .

		The ingenuity of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has evolved a new kind of child 's book : new because it is so old .

		He edits '' The Nursery Rhyme Book '' -LRB-
Frederick Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with a rather whim - sical preface explaining the historical origin of some of the verses .

		He groups the rhymes according to sub - ject , but further than that be is wise enough not to edit them .

		All the dear old verses that we knew and loved in '' Mother Goose '' are here , and some others that are less familiar .

		With the capital drawings by Mr.
L. Leslie Brooke	PERSON	the volume is a delightful one
Charles	PERSON	and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	's '' Poetry for Children , '' now reprinted by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is an odd contrast to the modern child 's verse .

		In comparison with
Stevenson	PERSON	and
William Canton	PERSON	, it is curiously dull and heavy and old-fashioned .

		Yet for the sake of the quaint and charming colored pictures by
Miss Winifred Green	ORGANIZATION	, which embellish this
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 409 edition , it is possible that even Lurried modern children will stop long enough to read some of the stiff old verses .

		It is not inappropriate to head the list of fairy tales with '' Stories from Dante '' -LRB- VVarne -RRB- , for no one knew better than he the poetic value of such creatures of the imagi - nation .

		Miss
Norley Chester	ORGANIZATION	retells these stories from the Divine Comedy with clearness and simplicity .

		It is not an easy task to reduce such poems to terms of prose , and much is necessarily lost in the process .

		Yet Miss
Chester	PERSON	is successful in making her book interesting to children , though she writes down to them a little too obviously ; and it is a fine thing to stimulate their curi - osity in regard to so great a poem .

		Another useful and instructive book , which is at the same time nourishing to the imagination , is
Zenaide A. Ragozin	PERSON	's version of `` Siegfried and Beowulf '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author is one who knows her subject as a scholar , and has the skill and imagination to construct her stories admirably .

		Her style is terse and vivid , well adapted to interest the young in these dignified and thrilling tales .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, not satisfied with having exhausted all the colors of the rainbow for his fairy-books , has this year wandered into the far East and selected and edited for children '' The Arabian Nights Entertainments '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	possesses a magician 's wand to con - jure up the kind of stories that children love , and this book will be irresistible to the imaginative , for whom the invisible world is the real one .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has shortened some of the stories and omitted those '' only suitable for Arabs and old gentlemen . ''

		The translations are from
Galland	LOCATION	's version , and are well made .

		They are illus - trated with many good pictures by Mr.
Ford	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Ernest Seton Thompson	PERSON	's delightful book called '' Wild Animals I have Known '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- can not be classified easily .

		It has much of the character of fable , yet these sketches are accurate , and belong to history quite as legitimately as some other books devoted to the glorification of man .

		Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's long and scientific study of animals and their ways , together with his skill as a writer , enables him to give these biographies of cer - tain intelligent animals with the precision of a scientist and the vividness of a novelist .

		The grim tragedy of
Lobo	PERSON	the wolf fascinates the attention as securely as though he had been born a leader of men instead of a leader of beasts .

		And the dramatic intensity of the story of the pacing mustang and his suicidal leap for freedom has not been equalled in its kind outside of `` The Jungle Book . ''

		Curiously enough , Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	has illustrated his book as well as he has written it .

		There is as much artistic quality in the pictures as there is character , and the little sketches in the margins are delightful Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	has also illustrated another book on natural history , which Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	has prepared for youthful readers .

		A thread of lively and entertaining narrative binds together the series of animated sketches of the principal mammals of this continent , in her '' Four - Footed Americans and their Kin '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The favorable impression created among all lovers of field and woodcraft by Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	's '' Citizen Bird '' will insure a most cordial reception to this companion volume .

		Judged , however , upon its own merits , it deserves com - mendation for its accuracy and completeness , as well as for its fascinating style , and for the fund of information which it contains regarding the familiar , and many unfa - miliar , animals of this country .

		It is an ideal book for children , and doubtless older folk will find in its pages much of interest to them about rats and muskrats , hares and rabbits , minks , martens , and ermines , caribou , moose , and elk , dolphins and manatees , and bats , moles , and shrews .

		The book has been edited by Mr.
Frank M. Chapman	PERSON	.

		The ethics of sport and the relations of ani - mals to man and his ways are touched upon in a whole - some and sensible manner .

		Much natural history is included , also , in Mr.
Ernest Ingersoll	PERSON	's '' Book of the Ocean '' -LRB- Century -RRB- , but it has still more physical geogra - phy .

		The plant and animal life of the ocean are made a kind of appendix to man 's dealings with the sea .

		The book covers a wide range of interesting subjects , from waves and tides , and the building of ships , to naval battles , robbers of the sea , yachting and fishing .

		It is admirably written and copiously illustrated ; the best kind of a book for a boy who loves the sea .

		It is a whimsical assortment of impossibilities that one finds in Mr.
Walter Douglas Campbell	PERSON	's '' Beyond the Border '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The story of `` Joke or No Joke , '' with the king 's ludicrous pursuit of a forgotten jest , is funny for all of us .

		The thing moves with a rush , and cleverly leaves one stranded at the end .

		There is another story of a wise king who could not tell how many beans made five , and who ordered the omission of the letter P from the alphabet because he could not pronounce it , with melancholy consequences to his obe - dient subjects , whose food consisted largely of pumpkin porridge .

		, Such vagaries form the basis of an amusing book , whose fun is too lively and spontaneous to seem forced .

		There is less of gayety in Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	's `` The Hollow Tree '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , but there is a good deal of quiet humor .

		The stories of the coon , the possum , and the crow , who lived in the hollow tree , are told to the Little Lady in the
House of Many Windows	ORGANIZATION	.

		And they are told very daintily and gracefully .

		It is the kind of thing that '' Uncle Remus '' has done su - premely well , and it is a little hazardous for another to try the same experiment .

		Yet Mr.
Paine	PERSON	's style is so good that his book can stand on its own merits .

		The pictures , by Mr.
J. M. Conde	PERSON	'' , are delightful , sketchy , full of character , and amusingly satirical .

		They alone are worth the price of admission .

		The same thing might be said for Miss
Rosie M. M. Pitman	PERSON	's drawings for '' The Magic Nuts '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , though they are less artistic than her illustrations for '' Undine '' last year .

		Mrs.
Molesworth	PERSON	writes the book , and her loqua - city makes one wonder at her popularity .

		Yet the story of the little English girl who finds herself in the country of fairies when she goes to
Germany	LOCATION	, is rather pretty .

		It is one of those harmless inventions which do not tax the imagination of the writer or of the reader .

		Much more ingenuity was required in the production of Mr.
Clement Fezandie	PERSON	^ s '' Through the Earth '' -LRB- Century -RRB- .

		The author seems to have followed
Jules Verne	PERSON	and over - taken him .

		The construction of a tunnel through the earth for the transference of freight and passengers from
Australia	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	is the basis of the plot ; and it is ingenious enough to keep one excited over the develop - ments .

		It is given the illusion of truth , also , and in spite of glaring impossibilities one is carried along by the apparent frankness of the narrative .

		Mr.
H. Escott	PERSON	-
Inman	PERSON	's '' The
Owl King	PERSON	, and other Fairy Stories '' -LRB-
Warne	PERSON	-RRB- is a much more old-fashioned book .

		Here are no modern scientific problems , no exasperating machin - ery to go wrong at the critical moment .

		Here are , rather , bosky dells and sunlit meadows inhabited by fairies and pixies who are wise enough to thwart the wicked witch and make everything come out happily in the end .

		The talking flowers and elves and princesses are prettily described and will please the little people vastly .

		422 THE DIAL -LSB- Deo .

		1 , HISTORY OF THE TO READERS OF '' THE DIAL '' : We make the following proposition to become members of
the Review of Reviews History Club	ORGANIZATION	, and obtain the three volumes of Our War in Two Hemispheres By
ALBERT SHAW	PERSON	, Editor of the `` American Monthly Review of Reviews '' and author of `` Municipal Government in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, '' etc. .

		T ^ VERY American citizen possessing a library , and many that do not possess J rf one , will be interested in the announcement of the history of the late war with
Spain	LOCATION	, now published by
the Review of Reviews Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Much of the narrative was written by Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	during the actual fighting of the sum - mer .

		This has been revised and amplified by him in the light of the official reports and documents which have only become available after hostilities ceased .

		A free quotation from the critical Congressional debates , and other public utter - ances at crucial periods , aids in making this work what it is , the standard refer - ence history of the decisive and successful struggle .

		But it is much more than a lively and comprehensive narrative .

		It goes back to the years of struggle in
Cuba	LOCATION	which prepared the way for the war ; it discusses energetically the problems which confronted the
United States	ORGANIZATION	after the war as to the
Philippines	LOCATION	,
Cuba	LOCATION	, and
Porto Rico	LOCATION	; and as a whole it forms a broadly conceived picture of the year which has seen
America	LOCATION	brought face to face with new world - duties .

		The important special and technical matters of the war period , generally dis - missed by the historian with only slight , and often insufficient , discussion , are fully and authentically dealt with in contributed chapters , written by men who had unusual opportunities for studying their subjects .

		Thus , the lessons which the war has for us as to the relative efficiency of rifles and machine guns are given in a carefully written chapter by Lieut.
John H. Parker	PERSON	, of the
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		The military movements of the
Santiago	LOCATION	and Porto Rican campaigns are analy / < !

		by the editor of the `` Army and

		With the necessary warnings against pinning too implicit faith to statistics drawn from Spanish sources , which notoriously make of statistics one of the most inexact of sciences , the tables of debt and revenue and trade and production which Mr.
Clark	PERSON	has compiled may be studied with real profit .

		Hia painstaking account of the railway and telegraph systems ; of highways and harbors ; of rivers and water supplies , and lighthouses ; of sugar and tobacco-growing ; and his detailed description of each province and of every city of any size , together with a ' business directory ' for the whole island makes his book one of great value for reference as well as for practical guidance .

		In the present situation of Cuban affairs it should command a wide sale .

		Its accuracy is certainly of a high order . ''

		It will be , therefore , the only authoritative biography of the Iron Chancellor , who stamped his personality upon the politics of

		These Reminiscences constitute not alone the autobiography of a great statesman , but the most important contribution to historical literature in the
last quarter	DATE	of a century .

		The book is remarkably full as regards internal affairs , and especially as regards influ - ences which prevailed at the
Berlin Court	ORGANIZATION	, as to the characters both of the Kings of

Bismarck	PERSON	was brought in contact , and it contains a minute criticism on the working of the Prussian and the German Constitutions .

Napoleon	PERSON	, to maintain for fresh generations the glamor which he had thrown over the eyes of his contemporaries .

		If I took no other paper , PUBLIC OPINION would still keep me abreast of the times .

		If I took one hundred periodicals I should still want PUBLIC OPINION .

		When it reaches my table every one of the other twenty papers to which I subscribe must give way to it .

		It is the only single publication issued in the world which keeps its readers fully abreast of the times , week by week .

		My wife , too , finds it exactly suited to her odds and ends of time , and so she keeps up with the day .

1899	DATE	a special magazine number .

		474 WILLIAM SLACK .

		A review , to be found further on in these pages , of the latest novel by
William Black	PERSON	, expresses the hope that his pen may continue to furnish forth many more novels for the enter - tainment and delight of his readers .

		We leave the review to stand as it was written , but the hope has proved futile , for the novelist died at his home near
London	LOCATION	a few days ago .

		His position among the writers of our time has been a dis - tinguished one for fully thirty years , and a brief survey of his life and literary activity becomes appropriate upon the present occasion .

		Born in
Glasgow	LOCATION	, in
1841	DATE	,
William Black	PERSON	had attained the age of fifty-seven years at the 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, time of his death .

		His education was somewhat irregular , and he never went through the public school and university courses which prepare most Englishmen who attain intellectual dis - tinction for their work .

		Instead , he was taught in private institutions , and , his early leanings being in the direction of art , he spent two years in the Government Art School of his native city .

		* ' As an artist , '' he says , '' I was a complete fail - ure , and so qualified myself for a time in after life as art critic . ''

		But it must be remarked , as a corrective to his own humorous self-depreci - ation , that his insight into the artistic tempera - ment is one of the characteristic features of his literary work , and that , if success in landscape painting upon the canvas was beyond his reach , few writers have ever been so successful in the verbal painting of landscape .

		The impression of natural beauty , as conveyed by hundreds of descriptive pages scattered through his novels , is deep and lasting ; one of the chief causes of our indebtedness to him is his joy in the change - ful moods of nature , in which he has made every one of his readers share .

		When Black made the discovery that he could write better than he could paint , he found in journalism the doorway to literature , as so many others have done , and became connected with the
London	LOCATION	'' Morning Star . ''

		This was in
1865	DATE	, when Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	was the editor of that journal .

		He served the '' Star '' as special correspondent at the time of the war between
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Soon thereafter he be - came a member of the '' Daily News '' editorial staff , occupying that post for several years , and writing leaders upon politics and questions of the day .

		Meanwhile , he was fledging his wings as a novelist ; and in
1867	DATE	'' Love or Marriage '' was published in the conventional three-volume form .

		This was soon followed by '' In Silk Attire , '' and this by ''
Kilmeny	PERSON	, '' a beautiful and pathetic story , written during the period of seclusion that followed the double bereave - ment caused by the death of his wife and his child .

		In
1871	DATE	'' A Daughter of Heth '' ap - peared , and its author leaped into popularity with the wider public that had known nothing of his preceding books .

		This sudden accession of fame found abundant warrant in the work to which it was due , for '' A Daughter of Heth '' was not only vastly superior to anything that had come before it , but was to remain the supreme artistic achievement of the writer .

		When we now look back to it , we look along the vista of more than a score of novels that have followed it , and we find no one of them as completely satisfy - ing , symmetrical , and artistic in the finest sense .

		The story of
Black	ORGANIZATION	's life during the seven - ties , eighties , and nineties , is the story of his books and nothing more .

		Even his trip to the
United States	LOCATION	, in the early seventies , calls for no comment beyond the statement that it in - spired '' Green Pastures and Picadilly , '' and possibly the further observation that from this time on the novelist 's heroines became some - what alarmingly addicted to humor of the American rather than the English type .

		For the rest , his seasons , like those of his heroes , alternated between the drawing - rooms and clubs of
London	LOCATION	and the coasts and moors of the
Highlands	LOCATION	that he loved so well .

		The one seri - ous book that he wrote was the life of
Goldsmith	PERSON	contributed to the '' English Men of Letters '' series in
1879	DATE	.

		The novels , as we have said , number upwards of a score , for hardly a year has passed since he began to write them that has not added one or two to the list .

		Among all these fictions , some are so lament - ably weak that they had far better have re - mained unwritten .

		Probably '' That Beautiful Wretch '' represents the lowest plane upon which it was possible for
Black	ORGANIZATION	's talent to work .

		Many others must be considered pot-boilers and nothing more .

		Still others are the merest replicas , as to motive , situations , and accessories , of his early successes , and nothing more need be said of them .

		But there remains a residuum of work , including perhaps half a dozen titles , which can not be ignored in any survey of Vic - torian literature , and upon which the author 's fame will ultimately rest .

		Of '' A Daughter of
Heth	ORGANIZATION	'' we have already spoken , and '' A Princess of
Thule	LOCATION	'' must be placed on nearly the same level in a comparative estimate of
Black	ORGANIZATION	's novels .

		In ''
Judith Shakespeare	PERSON	'' he acquitted himself of a peculiarly delicate task with rare tact and restraint .

		Its glimpses of the homely life of that spacious age in which the poet lived , and of the poet himself in his character as a prosperous citizen of
Stratford	LOCATION	, are altogether charming , and display unfail - ing taste .

		When '' Sunrise '' appeared , many among the novelist 's following rubbed their eyes at this strange new departure , for here Black deserted his wonted haunts and familiar characters to write a romance on the European revolutionary movement , a romance filled with plottings and dark secrets , a romance inspired by the '' Songs before Sunrise '' that , a few years previously , had revealed in Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne so great a lyrical gift as had not been known since
Shelley	PERSON	.

		But '' Sunrise '' was only
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 449 a '' sport '' among the author 's writings , and he at once reverted to his earlier manner and his well-worn themes .

		Among the remaining nov - els , there are none that stand out from the others quite as distinctly as the four that we have named .

		The tragic gloom that enwraps the ending of ''
Macleod	PERSON	of Dare '' makes the reader remember it rather better than its fel - lows , and the more gracious aspects of the nov - elist 's talent are perhaps better displayed than elsewhere in such books as '' White Wings '' and '' White
Heather	PERSON	. ''

		But we will make no more invidious comparisons .

		We have read with some gratitude even the feeblest of these novels , and with much gratitude the best of them .

		They have provided sweet and whole - some entertainment for many an idle hour , and we reflect with genuine sorrow that the source of this entertainment is now dried up forever .

		It is related that
Carlyle	PERSON	once said to Black , in the course of a conversation : '' Ay , ay , ye ken our
Scotland	LOCATION	weel , but tell me , mon , when are ye gaun to do some wark ? ''

		Souls of the strenuous sort , who expect novelists to deal with the serious problems of society , and who insist upon the ethical motive , if not upon the didactical method , will not find their account in the novels of
William Black	PERSON	, unless they think of him solely as the author of '' Sunrise . ''

		Such souls have their Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	and their Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	and their Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, and we do not deny them the right to their point of view .

		But when they go out of the way to institute invidious comparisons between the novelists they happen to like and such ac - complished craftsmen of a different sort as Mr.
Black	PERSON	and Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	, we feel bound to protest .

		The novelist who has just died did not have the genius of Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, for example , but he cultivated a saner method , and the talent that expresses itself by the meth - ods of sanity is not unworthy of being ranked , in the total estimate , upon a level with the genius that expresses itself by , let us say , that we may avoid the harsher term so obvi - ously suggested , the methods of perversity .

		Those intellectuels , in the name of whatever uncouth or morbid form of art they may make their plea , are not to be allowed the final word when it comes to an appraisal of so grace - ful and abundantly-endowed a writer as was the one from whom the world he has enriched must now take a sorrowful leave .


William Black	PERSON	will always be reckoned as one of the five or six best English novelists of his time that is , of the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		DR.
ROLFE	PERSON	'S NOTES ON
TENNYSON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the Publishers ' Note prefacing the new
Cambridge Tennyson	LOCATION	are these words : ''
Tennyson	PERSON	, as is well known , subjected his poems to fre - quent revision , and the editor has therefore , in addition to giv - ing the authoritative text with scrupulous care , collated the volumes of
1830	DATE	and
1833	DATE	.

		the edition of
1842	DATE	, and all others to which he has had access in this country and in the library of the British Museum , and has recorded the various read - ings in his notes .

		He has also , both in his notes and in the several introductions and brief prefaces , made a thorough bibliographical study of the poetry , so that the reader is now able to trace with great exactness the history of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's work . ''

		This collation of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's volumes , especially the early ones of
1830	DATE	,
1833	DATE	, and
1842	DATE	, has long been needed , and if it has here been done well the students of the poet will be much indebted both to the editor and to the publishers .

		A study of the first two pages of '' Notes and Illustrations , '' pp. 794-795 of the Cam - bridge
Tennyson	PERSON	, will suffice to test the accuracy of the collating .

		We follow the order of the editor .

		To the Queen . ''

		The following is the stanza referring to the
Crystal Palace Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	of
1851	DATE	, which originally followed the 6th : `` She brought a vast design to pass
When Europe	LOCATION	and the scattered ends Of onr fierce world did meet as friends And brethren in her halls of glass . ''

		Instead of this , the stanza originally read : `` She brought a vast design to pass ,
When Europe	LOCATION	and the scattered ends Of our fierce world were mixt as friends And brethren in her halls of glass . ''

		The editor mentions no other variations ; but he should have done so , for our present 4th stanza was inserted in the next edition -LRB- the 8th -RRB- , and four other slight changes were made after its first appearance .

		Leonine Elegiacs .

		The editor notes no changes .

		But later editions changed '' Deeply the turtle coos '' and '' Thou cometh morning and even '' to the present readings .

		Supposed Confessions .

		After quoting 17 lines omitted from later editions , Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	adds : '' The only other change is ' rosy fingers ' for ' waxen fingers ' in line 42 . ''

		But in the
1830	DATE	edition we have the line , '' Shall men live thus , in joy and hope '' Isabel . ''

		The only change in
1842	DATE	was ' blanched ' for ' blenched , ' which was probably a misprint . ''

		Not so ; for another line , changed in
1842	DATE	, originally stood '' The laws of wifehood charactered in gold ''
Mariana	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the line '' He held the peach to the garden wall '' Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	says : '' The line was changed in the printed poem at least as early as
1875	DATE	. ''

		It was changed in the edition of
1860	DATE	.

		He says of the line '' For leagues no other tree did dark '' 450 THE DIAL , -LSB- Deo .

		16 , that it was '' changed as early aa
1856	DATE	. ''

		True , but it was aUo changed as early as
1845	DATE	. ''

		In line 63 , the original ` sang i ' the pane ' was retained in all the editions I hare seen down to
1875	DATE	. ''

		This is not correct , as none of the editions between
1850	DATE	and
1875	DATE	have '' sang i ' the pane . '' ''

		Printed in
1830	DATE	without the division into stanzas , which was made in
1842	DATE	.

		The only other change is ' amorously ' for ' three times three ' in the hut stanza . ''

		Bat the change was in the errata of the original volume .

		Recollections of the Arabian Nights .

		Here two lines escaped the eye of the collator : `` From wreathed silvers looked to shame '' and '' Flowing below her rosehued zone '' ; Ode to Memory .

		Instead of three changes made in subsequent editions , Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	should have mentioned five .

		The two he fails to give are '' When the first matin song hath waked lond '' and '' The few whom passion hath not blinded , '' The Poet .

		`` The only change in the poem since
1830	DATE	is in the 12th stanza . ''

		On the contrary , the second line of the 9th stanza in the volume of
1830	DATE	reads '' Like a great garden showed '' ; and the second of the 14th , `` Of wrath her right arm hurled . ''

		The PoeCt mind .

		Here the editor failed to observe that the third line from the end in the edition of
1830	DATE	reads '' Yon would never hear it your eyes are so dull . ''

		The Sea Fairies .

		As the poem was completely recast in
1853	DATE	, the editor has given the original text in full .

		One line is not given correctly , `` When the sharp clear twang of the golden chords . ''

		The Dying Swan . ''

		Reprinted in
1842	DATE	with two slight verbal changes . ''

		Again not accurate , for one of these , '' Which loudly did lament , '' remained unchanged until the edition of
1850	DATE	.

		Adeline . ''

		The only changes in
1842	DATE	were in the 5th stanza . ''

		This is not the case ; for the first one , '' the side of the morn , '' was not made until
1853	DATE	, and the second , '' locks a-drooping , '' not until
1863	DATE	.

		These poems are treated of on the first two of the eighty pages of '' Notes and Illustrations . ''

		On these pages , as we have seen , the collator has made as many as twenty mistakes , and besides these there are a num - ber of misleading statements .

		These first pages , more - over , are not exceptional but typical .


ALBERT E. JACK	PERSON	.

Forest University	ORGANIZATION	,

		FOREIGN BOOKS IN
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As some interesting information with reference to the demand for foreign works in
Japan	LOCATION	has recently been made public in the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Times '' by Messrs.
Maruya	PERSON	and Company , the only Japanese importers of foreign books , I submit here several items therefrom .

		Works relating to architecture and building , chem - istry , electricity and magnetism , engineering and me - chanics , manufactures and industrial arts , metallurgy and mining , together with dictionaries and encyclo - pedias , enjoy the largest demand .

		In chemistry , Rem - sen is one of the popular authors ; in metallurgy ,
Phillips	PERSON	's work heads the list ; in electricity and magnetism ,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's works find the largest number of purcha - sers ; and there is an active demand for
Taggart	PERSON	's 41 Cotton Spinning . ''

		The favorite dictionary is Nut - tail 's
Standard Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, '' of which the firm above named has already sold between two and three hundred thousand copies !

		Next comes ''
Webster	PERSON	's Condensed Dictionary , '' and even ''
Webster	PERSON	's Unabridged '' sells at the rate of from fifty to sixty copies per month .

		The '' Students ' Standard Dictionary '' also sells well .

		Works on scientific subjects , especially new publica - tions , are in great demand , and show the eagerness of Japanese students to become acquainted with the results of the latest investigations .

		In astronomy , New - comb and
Holden	PERSON	's popular treatise comes first .

		In pedagogics ,
Herbart	PERSON	is the most popular author at pres - ent In history ,
Fisher	PERSON	's '' Universal History '' heads the list ; in general , works on modern history are in greater demand than those of earlier periods .

		The greater demand for language books , among which the Otto series stands first , may be due to the near approach of the date of mixed residence .

		Mathematical books are only in fair request .

		In medicine , German books have practically driven from the field works in other languages .

		In politics and diplomacy , however , French works are preferred ; Walk - er 's '' Political Economy , ''
Jevons	PERSON	's '' Money , '' and Has - tiat 's '' Science of Finance '' have a large sale .

		In law , German works are beginning to predominate .

		Taine 's '' English Literature '' heads the list in works of that class , and is used as a text-book or work of reference in several higher institutions of learning .

		Of books on
Japan	LOCATION	,
Griffis	PERSON	's '' Mikado 's Empire '' maintains its ground as the favorite .

		Works on antiquities and ethnology , elocution and oratory , theology and religion , are said to be practically devoid of demand ; but philo - sophical works find good sale , with
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	in the van .

		Fifty years ago a foreign book had to be smuggled into
Japan	LOCATION	and studied secretly ; and many an earnest scholar paid with his life the penalty for desiring a broad education through books .

		Fifty years ago , Dutch books were about the only ones , except Chinese , that got into the Empire even by smuggling .

		Now information is eagerly sought from all quarters of the globe ; and books in many languages are readable by Japanese .

		ERNMT W ' CLKMK * T. WHO SAID `` WE ARE ALL SOCIALISTS NOW '' ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I notice that a reviewer in a recent issue of THE DIAL ascribes to Lord Salisbury the dictum , '' We are all Socialists now '' -LSB- vide p. 299 . -RSB-

		I had supposed Sir
William Haroourt	PERSON	said these words originally .

		In `` Fabian Essays '' -LSB-
Charles E. Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, 1894 -RSB- p. 190 , I find this sentence from Mr.
Hubert Bland	PERSON	: II Why , for instance , does that extremely well oiled and accurately poised political weathercock , Sir
William Harcourt	PERSON	, pointing to the dawn , crow out that ' We are all Socialists now ' '' ?

		THE DIAL 451 FRANCIS PABKMAN AND - His WORK .

		* The publishers of the works of
Francis Parkman	PERSON	deserve thanks for presenting a de - lightful new edition , printed from entirely new plates , on excellent paper , and illustrated with twenty-four photogravure plates made by
Goupil	ORGANIZATION	from historical portraits and from works of well-known artists of the present time .

		It is one that in all respects satisfies the lover of good books well set forth .

		Whatever future editions may do in the way of furnishing illus - trations and notes , this edition must be the de - finitive text of the historian , who was his own best artist .


Francis Parkman	PERSON	was the greatest painter of historical pictures that this country per - haps it is not too much to say , that any country has produced .

		With correct scholarship , fidelity , graphic power , and literary beauty , he portrayed the scenes in the struggle between the French , the English , and the Indian , for the mastery of the American forest .

		Despite the fact that he chose the vehicle of prose , his work has also much in common with the great epic poems , for he dealt adequately with a period peculiarly suited to epic treatment in the sim - plicity of the contending civilizations , in the figures of the actors , in the grandeur of the pri - meval wilderness where the events progressed , and in the dignity of the great issues at stake .

		In his sophomore days , Parkman planned to write the story of the Old French War .

		`` Here , as it seemed to me , '' he tells a friend , '' the forest drama was more stirring and the forest stage more thronged with appropriate actors than in any other passage of our history .

		It was not till some years later , '' he adds , '' that I enlarged the plan to include the whole course of the American conflict between
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, or , in other words , the history of the American forest ; for this was the light in which I regarded it .

		My theme fascinated me , and I was haunted with wilderness images day and night . ''

		To this ideal he gave his whole sensitive nature with a vehemence that broke his physical powers .

		Labor became to him a passion and rest intolerable .

		He not only read books zealously , but he made long and trying expeditions into the forest ; and when his eyes began to fail him , while a youth of twenty - *

		three , he turned to study Indian life in the region where it could still be seen in something like its original form .

		Parkman 's visit to the
Oregon Trail	ORGANIZATION	, thus undertaken in
1846	DATE	, gave him an intimate understanding of the life of the frontier , and of the primitive Indian vil - lage in the days just prior to its passing away ; but the strain of following the savages in their hunting parties , and the hardships of wigwam life , left his eyes and his nervous system nearly ruined .

		The force of this blow can only be realized by one who knows -LRB- as Parkman clearly knew -RRB- the vast masses of manuscripts to be gathered from the scattered libraries of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, the minute comparison of their details , and the critical gathering of innumer - able facts into orderly and accurate form , that must precede the work of the historian of this period .

		When he began his task ,
Parkman	PERSON	estimated that twenty years would be required to complete it .

		But his brain was so over - sensitive during a considerable portion of his life , that creative effort inflicted intense tor - ture , and could be continued but a few minutes at a time ; moreover , he was forced to use the eyes of others for research .

		It is not strange , therefore , that the twenty years grew to more than forty-five , that the work , begun in his eager college days , stretched out until he closed his career , an old man of seventy .

		While he had filled all the gaps in his work at his death , it still lacked final revision to make the series an absolutely consistent and unified whole .

		A splendid panorama is unrolled by the very names of
Parkman	ORGANIZATION	's books .

		The order of their production was not in the natural se - quence of the episodes .

		Fearful lest his pre - carious strength should desert him completely before he had achieved the task to which he had set himself , he postponed some volumes to finish others for which his material was more thoroughly collected , or which he regarded as of paramount importance .

		While fresh from his Indian studies on the great plains , he dic - tated to the companion of his journey '' The
Oregon Trail	ORGANIZATION	, '' which appeared in the '' Knick - erbocker Magazine '' in
1847	DATE	, just prior to the great rush across the plains to the gold of
Cal	LOCATION	- ifornia . ''

		The wild cavalcade that defiled with me down the gorges of the
Black Hills	ORGANIZATION	, with its paint and war-plumes , fluttering trophies and savage embroidery , bows , arrows , lances , and shields , will never be seen again , '' so he writes in
1872	DATE	; and
twenty years later	DATE	he could say : '' The wild Indian is turned into an ugly caricature of his conqueror ... The 452 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, slow cavalcade of horsemen armed to the teeth has disappeared before parlor cars and the effeminate comforts of modern travel . ''

		Thus ,
Parkman	PERSON	, who was to write of the passing of the frontier in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , trained himself by a hard , but per - haps not too dearly bought , experience on the last frontier of the
United States	LOCATION	, in the middle of the nineteenth century a frontier which disappeared while the historian 's work was in progress .

		It was natural that he should next turn to ``
Pontiac	LOCATION	's Conspiracy , '' which he chose , although the last in the natural order of his historical series , because , as he tells us , it afforded '' better opportunities than any other portion of American history for portraying forest life and the Indian character '' ; he aimed '' to portray the American forest and the Amer - ican Indian at thf period when both received their final doom . ''

		As an introduction to this drama of the frontier he gave an unsurpassed study of Indian character , as well as an out - line of the history of
New France	LOCATION	to the begin - ning of
Pontiac	LOCATION	's war .

		The two volumes of this book are perhaps the most widely read of 1 ` aikman 's works ; and in their dramatic power , their contributions to Indian psychology , as well as in the extensiveness of view furnished by the introduction , they deserve their place .

		Yet it must be admitted that
Parkman	PERSON	's style lacked maturity here , and that these volumes made less demands upon his scholarship and judgment than did some of the later ones . ''

		The Pioneers of
New France	LOCATION	, '' with its stir - ring tale of Coligny ,
Menendez	LOCATION	,
Ribault	PERSON	, and
Champlain	LOCATION	, followed in
1865	DATE	; and two years later came '' The Jesuits in
North America	LOCATION	. ''

		The friendship of the Abbe Casgrain with
Parkman	PERSON	illustrates the historian 's success in dealing with the difficult subject of Catholic ideals and work .

		Casgrain believed Parkman to reject equally the Protestant ideas and Catholic dogmas , and declared : '' He is purely rationalistic ; he admits no other principle than the vague theory which is called modern civil - ization . '' ''

		One recognizes , '' he says , '' a soul rightly inclined and born for truth , but lost without compass on a boundless ocean . ''

		With - out admitting the correctness of
Parkman	LOCATION	's generalizations , and while sometimes resenting the indulgent amusement with which he relates the miraculous in early
Canada	LOCATION	, the fair-minded members of the Church have accorded to Park - man the recognition of his service in bringing before the Protestant reader a sympathetic and graphic picture of the Jesuit missionary .

		Re - cent monographic work of special students has added materially to our knowledge of the work of these missionaries , and new documents have come to light ; but aside from the critical read - ing of the great mass of the '' Relations '' them - selves , the reader can hardly get a more graphic , appreciative , and at the same time discrimi - nating , view of the noble devotion of these heroes of their faith .

		In
1869	DATE	,
Parkman	PERSON	published his `` Dis - covery of the Great West , '' which he revised and issued under the title of La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West '' in
1878	DATE	.

		This revision was necessary , owing to the re - fusal of Margry to admit him at first to certain manuscripts pertaining to La Salle .

		This leader 's high-souled expeditions had completed the claims of
France	LOCATION	to the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	; interest was next to turn to the conflicts be - tween
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	for the possession of these domains , and
Parkman	PERSON	introduced at this point -LRB- 1874 -RRB- his '' Old Regime in
Canada	LOCATION	, '' a description of the social and political organ - ization along the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, to which , in his revision of
1893	DATE	, he prefixed a section on the rival claimants of
Acadia	LOCATION	, La Tour and D'Aunay .

		About one-half the book is given to the exposition of the Canadian organization .

		No one will deny the thoroughness of Park - man 's study of his materials , nor the brilliancy of his characterizations .

		But he was not so skilful in exposition of the development of institutions as he was in the delineation of men and events .

		All his historical tastes and methods were formed before institutional study became fixed in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		These facts , together with the attempt to describe a society in a single view by material drawn from a whole century , render this book , charm - ing as it is , perhaps the least satisfactory to the critical historian .

		In '' Frontenac and
New France	LOCATION	under Louis XIV '' -LRB- 1877 -RRB- , we plunge into the storm and stress of the intercolonial wars , and the figure of the great governor is one of the abiding memories of
Parkman	LOCATION	's readers .

		These wars that follow had their re - lation to the
New England	LOCATION	fisheries , to the frontier hamlets of
New England	LOCATION	and of the middle region , and to the fur-trading posts of the interior .

		In all of these aspects ,
Park	LOCATION	- man 's touch is firm , true , and artistic .

		We see the activity of the coast , the ideals and prim - itive life of the backwoods Puritan , the traits of the bushrangers and borderers of
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania and
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the life of the lawless fur-trader .

		1898 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 453 Instead of carrying the series continuously on , the author now postponed the treatment of the half-century prior to the Seven Years War , in order to make sure of completing the design of his youth . ''

		Montcalm and Wolfe '' -LRB- 1884 -RRB- represents his full maturity , and is worthy of the great crisis in the history of the world with which it deals .

		It shows the author at his best in laborious collection and criti - cism of manuscript sources , in breadth of view , in precision of statement , and in sureness of touch .

		Every page tells of careful study , of the locality as well as of the written material .

		It is the crown of his work .

		In `` A Half Century of Conflict '' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- ,
Parkman	PERSON	filled the gap in his work between
1700	DATE	and
1748	DATE	.

		Possibly because of the lack of unity of the period , the work lacks some of the throbbing vitality of his earlier books , but it is still a most interesting survey of the period , taking us to the
Big Horn Mountains	ORGANIZATION	in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, and to
Santa	LOCATION	Fe in the
Southwest	LOCATION	; while the English are gaining the
Ohio Valley	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps it is at this point that
Parkman	PERSON	missed an opportunity .

		This half-century intervened between the picturesque era of exploration and the sunset glories of
New France	LOCATION	.

		The dra - matic centre in the story he is telling turns from the Frenchmen to the frontiersmen of the English colony , pushing along the river valleys and into the up-country of the South .

		To have adequately portrayed the origin of this army of invasion of the pioneer settlers , would have furnished the touch that the book lacks .

		But it was with
Parkman	PERSON	as with
Milton	PERSON	: it is not the Puritan of his
New England	LOCATION	home who lies closest to the artistic soul of
Parkman	LOCATION	.

		He praises the Puritan 's ideals , but it is the French gentilhomme , with all of his forest diablerie , who is the real hero of his epic .

		Summing up the limitations of
Parkman	LOCATION	, it must be admitted that he was fortunate in his theme .

		It is not certain that he would have been preeminent in other fields of historical research .

		It was the picturesque story of the American forest that filled his imagination , as he tells us ; and this romantic period permitted , nay , demanded , those very qualities of Park - man 's mind and style that might have led him astray in other fields .

		Indeed , it is doubtful if that very style that is so prominent an ele - ment in his success is unreservedly commend - able .

		What was in its nature dull , Parkman willingly avoided ; over what was repulsive he cast the mellow light of his style , until the bare atrocities of savage life , though frankly told , do not stand out in their own naked enormity .

		It needs the Hogarthian pages of the journals of
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	, or of the younger
Henry	PERSON	, to make them appreciated .

		There are points of detail in which Park - man needs correction , but they are not many ; nor is this the place for discussion of such min - ute questions .

		In his revised editions he did not fully study and incorporate the new material that came to light in the interval .

		But what is surprising is that he could have entered a field where tradition so held sway , supported by the filial respect of antagonistic peoples , a field where the contending societies were so based on antipodal ideas of church and state , and , in the midst of the innumerable problems and pit - falls of historical details , have preserved his rep - utation for justness and for accuracy .

		Perhaps it is still more remarkable that one whose in - vestigations had to include the collection and criticism of his material from the beginning , should have so transformed this raw product into a great work of art .

		For it can not be too strongly stated that whatever criticisms are to be made on
Parkman	PERSON	's work must come chiefly from considerations of what the function of history really is , and of what are the true ideals of society .

		As a literary treatment of his theme ,
Parkman	PERSON	's work is definitive .

		Natur - alists will study the American forest more scientifically ; the physiographical conditions that determined the frontier development of the French , the English , and the Indians will be more adequately investigated ; but no one is likely to bring back to the eyes of men that vast , continuous forest with such reality and loving sympathy of touch in its minute details , as well as in its immensity .

		Others will study the linguistics , the mythology , the ethnology of the American Indian with a more scientific training ; but in the pages of no later writer will actual Indian society live as it lives in those of
Parkman	LOCATION	.

		The Canadian parishes will still yield to the student of society ma - terial for new work ; but the noblesse and the clergy , the voyageur and the habitant , are less alive in the pages even of recent famous his - torical novelists than they are in the works of this historical master .

		Parkman was at once a scholar and an artist .

		His wide research , his critical astuteness , his fairness of temper , his insight into the meaning of historical move - ments , made him a great historian .

		But his work will live because he was even greater as an artist than as a historian .


FREDERICK J. TURNER	PERSON	.

		454 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, A FAMOUS NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT or THE CIVIL , WAR .

		* To those who remember the ''
Boston	LOCATION	Jour - nal '' in its best days , when ''
Carleton	PERSON	's '' let - ters formed one of its leading features , to the many who have known
Charles Carleton Coffin	PERSON	as a familiar figure in the city which was so long his home , and as a frequent visitor to other cities throughout the country , and to his thousands of readers everywhere , a life of the distinguished war correspondent , traveller , and author , by the Rev. Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	, his former pastor , will be welcome .

		Of
New Hampshire	ORGANIZATION	birth and Puritan an - cestry , all the conditions of Mr.
Coffin	PERSON	's early life were favorable to the development of those sterling qualities on which alone he relied in `` winning his way . ''

		As an editorial writer in
Boston	LOCATION	, in
1856	DATE	, when he was thirty-three years of age , he became identified with the newly - formed Republican party , giving his enthusi - astic support to
Fremont	LOCATION	, and ,
four years later	DATE	, to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, whose nomination at
Chicago	LOCATION	he has described as an eye-witness , in some autobio - graphical notes which were never published .

		A Lincoln anecdote which will be new to most readers is given by him : ' I accompanied the committee to
Springfield	LOCATION	to notify Lincoln of his nomination ... We went down the
Illinois Central	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was a hot , dusty ride .

		Reached
Springfield	LOCATION	early in the
evening	TIME	.

		Had supper at the hotel , and then called on Lincoln .

		His two youngest boys were on the fence in front of the house , chaffing some Democratic urchins in the street .

		A
Douglas	PERSON	meeting was going on in the
State House	ORGANIZATION	, addressed , as I learned , by A. McClernand afterwards Major - General .

		Lincoln stood in the parlor , dressed in black frock coat .

		Ashman made the formal announcement .

		Lincoln 's reply was brief .

		He was much constrained , but as soon as the last word was spoken be turned to
Kelly	PERSON	and said : '' < Judge , you are a pretty tall man .

		How tall are you ? ' '' '

		Six feet two . ' ''

		I beat you .

		I 'm six feet three without my high - heeled boots on . '

		44
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	bows to
Illinois	LOCATION	, where we have been told there were only
Little Giants	ORGANIZATION	, ' said
Kelly	PERSON	, gracefully alluding to
Douglas	PERSON	, who was called the
Little Giant	ORGANIZATION	.

		44 One by one we were introduced by Mr.
Ashman	PERSON	.

		After the handshaking was over , Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	said : 44 ' Mrs.
Lincoln	PERSON	will be pleased to see you , gentlemen , in the adjoining room , where you will find some refresh - ments . '

		44 We passed into the room ... The only sign of re - freshments visible was a white earthen pitcher filled with ice - water .

		Probably it was Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's little joke , for the next morning I learned that his Republican

		neighbors had offered to furnish wines and liquor , but he would not allow them in the house ; that his Demo - cratic friends also sent round baskets of champagne , which he would not accept . ''

		After a short term of service as night editor of the ''
Boston Journal	ORGANIZATION	, '' at
ten dollars	MONEY	a week , Mr.
Coffin	PERSON	became , on the outbreak of hostili - ties between the North and South , war corre - spondent of the same paper , where his graphic and trustworthy letters from the front , with the familiar signature of ''
Carleton	PERSON	, '' became known and eagerly sought for throughout the North .

		The accounts of his experiences with the army and on the battle-field are very inter - esting reading .

		After the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	tells us , 44
Carleton	PERSON	felt satisfied that Lee was in full retreat , though General
Meade	PERSON	did not seem to think so .


Carle	PERSON	- ton 's face was now set
Bostonwards	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not being able to use the army telegraph , he gave bis first thought to reaching the railroad .

		The nearest point was at West - minster , twenty-eight miles distant , from which a freight - train was to leave at 4 P. M. 44 Rain was falling heavily , but with
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	as companion ,
Carleton	PERSON	rode the twenty-eight miles in
two hours and a half	DATE	.

		Covered with mud from head to foot , and soused to the skin , the two riders reached Westminster at
3:55	TIME	P. M .

		As the train did not imme - diately start ,
Carleton	PERSON	arranged for the care of his beast , and laying his blanket on the engine 's boiler , dried it .

		He then made his bed on the floor of the bumping car , get - ting some sleep of an uncertain quality before the train rolled into
Baltimore	LOCATION	. ''

		At the hotel on
Sunday	DATE	morning he was seized by his friend ,
E. B. Washburn	PERSON	, Grant 's indefatigable sup - porter and afterwards Minister to
France	LOCATION	, who asked for news .

		Carleton told him of victory and the retreat of Lee . '

		You lie , ' was the impulsive answer .

		Wash - burn 's nerves had for days been under a strain .

		Then , after telling more ,
Carleton	PERSON	telegraphed a half-column of news to the 4 Journal ' in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		This message , sent thence to
Washington	LOCATION	, was the first news President
Lincoln	PERSON	and the Cabinet had of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	. ''

		Carleton stayed with the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Potomac	LOCATION	, sharing its vicissitudes and recording its defeats and triumphs , until the close of the war .

		The moral effect of his letters and despatches , in dark days even more than in bright , can hardly be overestimated .

		Sent abroad by the '' Journal '' to report the Austro-Prussian war , Mr.
Coffin	PERSON	arrived in
Europe	LOCATION	only to find the battle of Sadowa a thing of the past , and th combatants again at peace .

		Yet he remained as foreign correspond - ent of his paper , and was soon commissioned by it to continue eastward around the world , send - ing home letters as he went .

		This tour of the world he made in company with his wife , and its record is presented in book form in '' Our New Way Around the World . ''

		His bio - grapher 's statement that Mr.
Coffin	PERSON	was the

		THE DIAL 455 first , so far as is known , to circle the globe , starting eastward from
America	LOCATION	and using steam as the motor of transportation on land and water all the way , is not quite correct , inasmuch as the Central Pacific railway was not completed when Mr. and Mrs. Coffin , in the
fall of 1868	DATE	, left
California	LOCATION	for the
East	LOCATION	.

		Seven days and nights of staging interrupted the con - tinuity of the railroad journey .

		Mr.
Coffin	PERSON	served several terms in the
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts legislature , both as representative and as senator , and left his mark on the statute - book .

		The law placing the
Boston	LOCATION	police un - der state control , and that abolishing grade crossings throughout the state , are two of his most important reforms .

		Although the life of a war correspondent might perhaps be treated with keener appre - ciation and sympathy by a soldier or a journal - ist than by a clergyman , yet it would be ungra - cious to find serious fault with this interesting volume from Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	's practised pen .

		In giving dates , if he had oftener added the year to the month and day of the month , his narra - tive would have gained somewhat in clearness at least for the reviewer , who is as likely to read a book through backward as forward .

		Perhaps , however , it was to discourage such discourteous treatment of a good book that its author made his chronology intelligible only to those who had read carefully from the begin - nm & -

		THE PHILIPPINES AS THEY ARE .

		* The great timeliness and pertinence of the information contained in Professor
Worcester	LOCATION	's account of ''
The Philippine Islands	LOCATION	and Their People '' give it an insistent claim to careful attention .

		The author , a professor of zoology in the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, was a part of two extended expeditions to
the Philippines	LOCATION	in the interests of science , and thus gained inti - mate personal knowledge of the more important of the islands , their peoples and their resources , through the entire archipelago .

		The former of these journeys occupied a little less than a year , beginning with
September , 1887	DATE	; the latter extended over two years and eight months , ending in
March , 1893	DATE	.

		hostility among Spanish officials ; the other had diplomatic sanction , and was constantly aided by the colonial government .

		The opportunities of Dr.
Worcester	PERSON	were therefore exceptional for providing information needful for the instruc - tion of the American nation at the present time .

		The book is fairly exhaustive without degener - ating into mere detail and statistic , and its contents are informed with a spirit of disin - terestedness and candor worthy of high praise .

		At the same time it answers , and authoritatively , many questions which every conscientious citi - zen is just now asking himself .

		The
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	, Dr.
Worcester	LOCATION	tells us , have rich natural resources , both mineral and agricultural .

		But the obstacles to their development are very great .

		No white man can work there and expect to live ; while native labor is hard to get and every way unsatisfactory .

		The climate is especially severe on white women and children . ''

		It is very doubtful , '' he says , '' if many successive generations of European or American children could be raised there . ''

		Among the diseases that prevail , he enumerates malaria , cholera , calentura , small - pox -LRB- that inevitable accompaniment of the flag of
Spain	LOCATION	-RRB- , leprosy , and a host more of dreadful afflictions , including the horrible biri-biri .

		There are also to be found plagues of ants , which devour any - thing ; of locusts , which consume the crops ; of poisonous serpents , though , as we are informed , there is only one of the inhabited islands where the number of deaths from snake - bite reaches alarming proportions ; of crocodiles in the fresh waters and sharks in the sea .

		The land as a whole is subject to earthquakes , and is all of volcanic origin , having active volcanoes from which have spread wide areas of desola - tion in a not remote past .

		There are some eighty varieties of mankind on these islands .

		The dominating race is the one called Moros , a fighting and slaveholding people , of the stock of the head-hunters of
Borneo	LOCATION	, of the religion of the Mad Mullah or
El Mahdi	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the long-standing tasks of
Spain	LOCATION	in
the Philippines	LOCATION	has been to restrain these Malayan pirates from preying upon the more peaceful races .

		They have been con - tinuously in revolt since
1622	DATE	, and their char - acteristics have given rise to an expressive Spanish proverb which is about the equivalent of our English saying that '' There are no good Indians but dead ones . ''

		Our author gives many incidents , from his own experience , illus - trating their savagery .

		One of the chiefs or head men of the Moros , learning that Dr.
Wor	PERSON	- 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, cester desired to study some of the slaves or captives , calmly proposed to shoot a few of them for his greater convenience , and as a contri - bution to his store of specimens .

		Into the abuses of the Spanish friars in these islands , Dr.
Worcester	PERSON	does not go , contenting himself with quoting from Mr.
John Foreman	PERSON	's book , for the reason that this authority on the
Philippines	LOCATION	, an English .

		Catholic , may use a can - dor impossible to an American of another be - lief at this time .

		These abuses , it is well to say here , arise in great part from the holding and dispensing of benefices , a time-worn practice which went far toward producing the Lutheran revolt , its manifest objections having been recog - nized by the
Tridentine Council	ORGANIZATION	, which strictly forbade the process .

		These remote islands , being in portions infidelibus y are not subject to the decrees of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nearly half of the eight or ten millions of souls in the archipelago are in the hands of these friars , whose energies are concentrated in
Manila	LOCATION	, where their directing councils appear as the heads of enormously wealthy and influential corporations of a purely religious character .

		The significant fact is worth recalling here that the title to all the landed and other property of the
Church of Rome	ORGANIZATION	in
the Philippines	LOCATION	has been transferred since
Dewey	ORGANIZATION	's victory to a distinguished American citizen ,
John Gibbons	PERSON	, Cardinal Archbishop of
Balti	LOCATION	- more .

		Dr.
Worcester	LOCATION	tells us that the religious propaganda has made but little headway among the Christian-hating Moros , and expresses the conviction that '' the nation which would have any hope of getting on peaceably with them must let their religion strictly alone '' Those Americans who favor the annexation of these islands on missionary grounds will not find much encouragement in Dr.
Worcester	LOCATION	's book .

		Force , rather than moral suasion , seems to be what these troublesome semi-savages require . ''

		It is certain , '' says Dr.
Worcester	PERSON	, '' that for many years to come they must be held in check with a strong hand . ''

		Nor will the advocates of '' expansion '' or annexation find much of comfort or justifica - tion , on any grounds , in these frankly written pages , which are the more convincing as coming from a trained observer who records his experi - ences and conclusions in the spirit of science rather than of polemics .

		Without any pro- nounced political standpoint of his own , he gives a hundred practical reasons for our leaving these alien folks alone , to one in favor of our attempt - ing to make American wards or citizens of them .

		It is the fashion of the day to scorn any but optimistic views and visions ; but there is an older fashion of looking facts in the face , and of seeking such light as may be had from the lamp of experience before entering upon new and perhaps dangerous pathways .

		Those who so confidently assert that
America	LOCATION	shares with
Great Britain	LOCATION	a racial ability to govern remote subject peoples , forget or overlook the fact that
England	LOCATION	attained her present administrative skill slowly , painfully , and at a most appalling sacrifice of blood and treasure , both her own and others ' ; as well as the contrasting fact that the
United States	LOCATION	is wholly without any similar ex - perience in the past or precedent for the future .

		The hazardous nature of the proposed experi - ment in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, and the appalling difficulties that may be expected to attend it , become clearly impressed upon us by a reading of Dr.
Worcester	PERSON	's book .

		The information it contains and the manner of presenting it leave us longing for more books of travel by
Ameri	ORGANIZATION	- cans .

		Not since Dr.
Donaldson Smith	PERSON	's account of
Africa	LOCATION	, or Lieutenant
Peary	PERSON	's tale of
Green	ORGANIZATION	- land , have we been so instructed or entertained .

		The book has a single fault : its price precludes its general distribution among those entitled to an opinion upon a most vital point in our na - tional policy .

		THE DIAL 457 are both critics and artificers of poetry ; but bis work had to be sought out in its several places of conceal - ment the '' Athenaeum , '' the '' Enclopaedia Brit - annica , '' and others and until '' The Coming of Love '' made its appearance early in the present year , no book bearing his name was obtainable .

		He has now put forth the prose romance , `` Aylwin '' written at least twenty years ago but hitherto unpublished and adds the distinction of the nov - elist to that of the poet .

		We trust that he may soon be prevailed upon to make his service to the public a triple one by collecting into a volume or more those extraordinary essays in poetical criti - cism , and those fascinating chapters of personal reminiscence , that have for many years provided 44 The Athenaeum '' with the most interesting part of its contents .

		Of the critic , poet , and romancer so happily com - bined in Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	, we will say frankly that the laurels of the first two are greener than those of the third .

		His interpretation of poetry , technical and aesthetic , seems to us the finest work of its sort that has been done in our time , and '' The Coming of Love '' has shown how well the writer can exemplify his own critical principles . ''

		Aylwin , '' on the other hand , although revealing the stylist and the philosopher , although suffused with the tenderest sentiment and the deepest emo - tion , although a distinctly individual utterance and fascinating from first to last , does not afford a parallel to the severe and flawless art to be found in the finest of the poems .

		It is too rambling , too episodical for that ; it is not a well-knit piece of con - structive workmanship , but rather a vehicle for the conveyance to his readers of an excessively romantic view of life and of certain special forms of recon - dite lore .

		Primarily , it is a Romany romance , thus taking its place in the small group of works which includes '' Lavengro '' and the '' Kriegspiel '' of Mr.
Francis Hindes-Groome	PERSON	.

		It stands related even more closely to the author 's own '' Coming of Love , '' for the heroine of that poem figures in the novel , although in a comparatively unimportant part .

		Of this aspect of the romance we may say that the tri - umphant success is scored of enlisting our sympa - thetic interest in a race and a dialect not particu - larly attractive in themselves , except to the
Borro	PERSON	- vian elect .

		The figure of
Sinfi Lovell	PERSON	is a creation worthy to be classed with that of
Isopel Berners	PERSON	, and the imaginative literature of the subject offers no third figure of equal charm , unless it be that of
Rhona Boswell	PERSON	in '' The Coming of Love . ''

		Sec - ondarily , `` Aylwin '' is a protest against materialism , a plea for the supreme right of passion , in the fine sense of that term . ''

		The ennobling difference be - tween one man and another , '' says Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, `` is precisely in this , that one feels more than another . ''


Henry Aylwin	PERSON	is not ashamed to feel , and his cre - ator is not ashamed for him .

		The story of his over - whelming love for
Winifred	PERSON	, of the singleness of his aim in the long search for her after she has fled demented from his presence , and of the final happy reunion between hero and heroine the sanity of the latter restored is infinitely pathetic , and does nothing but honor to the heart that could project so great an emotion into the romance of his fash - ioning .

		It even prepares us to accept , as a necessary incident in the working out of the result , the bit of charlatanism whereby
Winifred	PERSON	is brought back to mental equilibrium .

		There are many other features of this remarkable book upon which we would gladly comment did space permit upon the magic of its style , upon the vision which informs its descriptions of natural beauty , and upon the power displayed in the treatment of certain of its episodes but prob - ably enough has been said to make clear the fact that '' Aylwin '' is a book apart from the generality of current literary production , a piece of imagina - tive work so original as almost to evade classification , a book to read with the closest care and to treasure for repeated reading in the future . ''

		Wild Eelin '' is a tale of familiar very familiar scenes and types of character , and we know before - hand that it assures us several hours of the most pleas - ant companionship .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	's heroines are always sweet and maidenly , with a wilding grace of their own that quite justifies his lovers for their infatu - ation , and makes their misconduct when such may be laid to their charge peculiarly atrocious and unpardonable .

		In the present instance they behave very well for there are two of them and one does not exactly see which of them should rightfully possess the prize .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	does not seem to see , either , for he finds no way out of the difficulty save that of making '' Wild Eelin '' catch cold and die incontinently .

		This sudden tragedy at the end is altogether uncalled-for , and plays with wanton bru - tality upon our emotions .

		Why not let one of the lovers die instead ?

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	is as good as ever in picturing
West Scotland	LOCATION	scenery and character , in making effective use of snatches of folk-poetry , and in infusing a tender sentiment into his scenes and situations .

		We hope to read his often-told tale in yet as many more forms as these that have already been given it by his ingenious invention . ''


Roden	PERSON	's Corner '' is a '' corner '' in the commer - cial or economic sense .

		It is a corner in malgamite , which we are told is an essential ingredient in the manufacture of paper .

		The preparation of malga - mite is a serious matter for the workman , since the chemicals employed result in poisoning and early death .


Roden	PERSON	and a fellow-schemer , both unscru - pulous , corner the production of malgamite , and start their consolidated works in
Holland	LOCATION	, among the sand - dunes of
Scheveningen	LOCATION	.

		The real nature of the manu - facture is so masked that what is destined to be an enormously profitable business appeals to the British public as a charity , and gets '' boomed '' into promi - nence .

		It is represented that the new process of manufacture saves lives instead of destroying them .

		A peer of the realm lends his name -LRB- for a consider - ation -RRB- to the enterprise , and all goes well until the honest but at first unsuspecting partners learn the sort of business in which they are really engaged .

		458 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, After a sharp tight , the enterprise is broken up , and the surviving workmen are pensioned for life out of the accrued profits .

		The story thus outlined has a certain interest , but it is badly put together , and there is too much dropping of one set of threads to take up another .

		Some of the threads thus dropped never get taken up again , and the book is closed with a great sense of dissatisfaction .

		In detail , the work - manship is excellent , but as a whole , it seems to us very defective .

		In '' The Castle Inn '' Mr.
Wey	PERSON	man contrives to get along without the historical accessories that have lent interest to his earlier novels , and tells , never - theless , a surprisingly interesting story of love and private adventure .

		To be sure , the environment is in a sense historical , for it is that of eighteenth cent - ury
England	LOCATION	, and the story is concerned with the manners , although not with the actual events , of its period .

		One historical figure , indeed that of the great Earl of
Chatham	LOCATION	makes a casual appearance in these pages , but there is no attempt to delineate him .

		The '' castle inn '' of the tale is somewhere on the road to
Bristol	LOCATION	, in the
West of England	LOCATION	; here the scene is chiefly laid , and here the actors meet to play their several parts .

		The story is of a young woman of humble surroundings , supposed to be the heiress to a great fortune , and sought after , both on this and other accounts , by a number of men .

		The story of her abduction by one of them and her rescue by another provides the narrative with its central situa - tion , and her marriage is a triumph for romantic principles , since she turns out penniless after all , yet is wooed and won by the rather dandified hero , who exceeds any expectations reasonably to be deduced from his training and early life .

		The story is , we repeat , skilfully put together and entertaining , repro - ducing in a vivid manner the social life and ideals of the Georgian epoch in English history .

		Mr.
Robert Barr	PERSON	has always known how to tell a good story , but he has outdone himself in ''
Tekla	PERSON	, '' his latest production .

		This romance of love , war , and archepiscopal politics of the thirteenth century is one of the best quasi-historical tales that we have read for many moons .

		The chief figures in this work are
Rudolf I.	PERSON	, the first Hapsburg emperor ;
Arnold von Isenburg	PERSON	, the primate of Treves ; and
Konrad von Hochstaden	PERSON	, his colleague of
Cologne	LOCATION	.

		Beyond these names , and a general truthfulness to the spirit of the period , there is little that is histor - ical in the book .

		The Emperor is represented as a far stronger man than history admits him to have been , and the story is based upon an imaginary episode placed in the beginning of his reign .

		Falling in love with a ward of the grim ruler of Treves , he aids her flight to the castle of her uncle on the
Moselle	LOCATION	, and , his name and rank unknown to all concerned , he remains in the castle and defends it against the allied Archbishops of Treves and Co - logne during a siege of two years .

		How the castle is held , how
Rudolf	PERSON	wins the love of
Tekla	LOCATION	, how , at the right moment , he collects the imperial forces and raises the siege , and how , restored to his throne in
Frankfurt	LOCATION	, he humbles the proud prelates who had thought him but a puppet in their hands , all this is told in some four hundred pages of the most engrossing romantic narrative .

		If the story is at times lacking in animation , and the dialogue some - what over-labored , there is , nevertheless , no doubt of the thrilling interest which attaches to the tale from first to last . ''

		The Adventures of Francois '' is at once a de - lightful surprise and a stronger proof than the author has ever before given us of his versatility as a writer of fiction .

		We had thought Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	to have touched his high-water mark with ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	, '' but even that admirable novel is surpassed by the present masterpiece of picaresque invention .

		In Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's previous books there has always been a certain strenuousness , and a slightly labored character has pertained to the best of them .

		While giving deserved praise to their conscientiousness and unfailing taste , we have never been able to escape the impression that their author was too intent upon becoming a great novelist to achieve the best sort of success .

		No such impression as this is produced by '' The Adventures of Francois , '' which is distinguished by an almost absolute freedom of movement The author has found a medium in which he is not impeded by external friction ; his narrative takes shape and color from within ; it is the genuine projection of a finely-realized creation of character .

		The hero is a foundling , thief , jug - gler , and fencing-master who lives in
Paris	LOCATION	during the period of the Revolution . ''

		He had a great heart and no conscience ; was fond of flowers , of birds , and of children ; pleased to chat of his pilfer - ings , liking the fun of the astonishment he thus caused ... He was by nature gifted with affec - tion , good sense , and courage .

		He had many deli - cacies of character , but that of which nature meant to make a gentleman and a man of refinement , de - sertion and evil fortune made a thief and a repro - bate . ''

		These sentences are the author 's own sum - mary of one of the most interesting and lovable characters in recent fiction , and they but faintly reflect the singular charm of this vagabond hero , who was all unconsciously mixed up with some of the greatest happenings in history , and whose career illustrates a phase of the Revolutionary period of which the writers of rhetorical romances seem quite unconscious .

		Even the most hackneyed features of the Terror become fresh in their interest when viewed from the standpoint of this child of nature , while his experiences and vicissitudes are surprising enough to keep the attention agog from beginning to end .

		Nothing that Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	has heretofore done deserves so cordial a greeting as this altogether delightful story .

		Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	, whose reputation as * writer of short stories and novelettes has so long been established , has now attempted work upon a more ambitions scale , and has given us , in '' Red Rock , '' one of the most satisfactory works of fiction that the South has ever produced .

		On all this crowded canvas
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 459 there is not a figure that is not drawn from the life , and given character by sympathy or insight into motive .

		The types delineated are not new , but they are thoroughly realized in accordance with the con - ventional models , and their fortunes are so skilfully interwoven as to make them present a vivid and trustworthy view of human nature in
Virginia	LOCATION	be - fore and after the war .

		We say in
Virginia	LOCATION	, for although Mr.
Page	PERSON	disclaims any attribution of a local habitation for his characters , it is pretty evident that they are taken from the society that he knows so well , to say nothing of the indications of prox - imity to the Capital which would hardly fit in with the suggestion of any other
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The real theme of '' Red Rock '' is the work of reconstruction the task so well-intentioned but so badly performed because undertaken and carried out by doctrinaires who knew nothing of the problems to be dealt with .

		The era of carpet-bagging is one of the blots upon our national history ; and , at the present distance of an entire generation , one may , without being suspected of disloyalty to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, make that admission .

		Of the horrors of that reign of terror , and of the struggle of the whites for the preserva - tion of civilization when menaced by an even greater curse than war , no stronger delineation than this has thus far found its way into our literature .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	's sympathies are passionately Southern , and we have no doubt that this fact colors his narrative to some extent that his Virginians are of finer mould , and his carpet-baggers more despicable , than the average truth would warrant ; but the fact re - mains that the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	policy of reconstruction , in the hands of the politicians who were intrusted with its details , was carried out with a degree of tactless - ness , and even of brutality , that left behind it a deeper bitterness than the victory of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	arms alone could have produced .

		We can meet the au - thor more than half way in his indignation , and thank him for his attempt to make us understand what it meant for the civilization of a
Southern State	ORGANIZATION	to place the reins of civil government in the hands of men who were utterly unfit to direct its course .

		And it is hardly to be laid up against Mr.
Page	PERSON	that , in his endeavor to arouse our sympathies for the people among whom he was reared , he should endow them with more of the manly and womanly virtues than ever yet fell to the lot of any section of American society .

		To do this was his duty as a novelist , and we are quite prepared to accept his idealized picture as good art , if not exactly the best of realism .

		We will close this review of an unusually import - ant selection of recent novels with a few words about the late
Harold Frederic	PERSON	's ''
Gloria Mundi	PERSON	. ''

		We have read it with disappointment , for it is inferior to several of
Frederic	PERSON	's earlier books , and for a reason not far to seek .

		In attempting to write of English society and particularly of a section of that society with which he had no intimate associations he ex - ceeded his powers , and allowed the journalist in him to get the better of the artist .

		But all the devices of the most resourceful and inventive journalism make a poor substitute for observation , and no amount of reading or talking about people , however earnestly or cleverly done , will suffice for depicting them as the novelist should .

		The lords and ladies of this novel are lay figures merely ; they are sketched from the outside and at a distance ; they have noth - ing of the glow and the vitality of the figures in the author 's American novels .

		Even the hero , in whose case something more closely approaching the cre - ative effect has been reached , remains baffling and elusive ; one never knows just what he thinks or what he is going to do .

		Nor is the story helped by the vein of didacticism that runs through it .

		A part of the narrative deals with a Ruskinian social sys - tem the hobby of one of the minor characters but of this we must say that either too much or too little is made .

		We can not find out whether or not the author believes in it , yet the prominence given it warrants a reader in asking the question .

		What we have said should not be taken as a condemnation of the story ; we mean simply that it is by no means as good a story as
Harold Frederic	PERSON	knew how to write .

		But it is always an interesting , and , in some of its episodes , a brilliant piece of narrative invention .

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		n .

		Mr.
Eric Pape	PERSON	's drawings in
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's luxurious new edition of General Wal - lace 's '' The Fair God '' are , like the novel itself , the result of imagination working upon the fruits of anti- quarian research .

		Mr.
Pape	PERSON	has been at great pains to secure for his pictures the highest degree of realism attainable .

		He has ransacked museums and libraries , and he has travelled widely in the countries in which the story is laid , retracing the steps of Cortes , and gathering with the aid of pencil and camera sketches and views of the relics of ancient Mexican civiliza - tion .

		Native Mexican Indians have served as models for the more imaginative and dramatic drawings .

		The decorative designs subserve the purpose of repre - senting the arts and implements of the Aztecs , and of their tribal predecessors who inhabited
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Central America	LOCATION	centuries before their regime in ancient Anahuac .

		The initials in red and black have a good effect , and on the whole , considering the inherent difficulties of his undertaking , Mr.
Pape	PERSON	must be said to have scored a decided success .

		The full-page pictures are of somewhat uneven merit , ranging from such fine ones as that facing page 40 of Volume I. , to the comparatively weak example facing page 86 of Volume II .

		But the pictorial average is very creditable to Mr.
Pape	PERSON	.

		Outwardly the volumes are gotten up in impeccable style , the chaste yet sufficiently decorative bindings being par - ticularly good .

		The work ranks among the hand - somest of the holiday publications of this year .

		The high degree of success in the pictorial inter - pretation of a great book that may be attained by 460 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the sympathetic and skilled illustrator saturated with the spirit of his author is exemplified in The
Century CO.	ORGANIZATION	' B remarkable folio edition of '' The Pilgrim 's Pro- gress '' of
Bunyan	PERSON	, illustrated by the brothers
Rhead George	PERSON	,
Louis	LOCATION	, and
Frederick	PERSON	.

		The original de - signs of these pictures were exhibited in
New York	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	some time ago , and there was a general desire then to see them made popularly attainable in their present form .

		These strong drawings over which the spirit of allegory appropriately broods are really Bunyanesque such drawings as the Inspired Tinker himself might have been glad to see wedded to his immortal text .

		The high average of merit is well sustained , though the artist 's fancy seems to flag in the plates facing pages 66 , 139 , and 78 , which seem relatively insipid .

		Notably good are the plates showing Vanity Fair , the home of '' Pliable , '' '' Talkative '' on the ale-bench and in his household , the Slough of Despond .

		Hogarth himself might have drawn the Jurymen of
Louis Rhead	LOCATION	, and Dor could not have bettered
George Rhead	PERSON	's `` Giant Despair . ''

		Very felicitous are tbe personifications '' The Lord Luxurious , '' '' Mr.
Worldly-Wiseman	PERSON	, '' '' Tbe Lord Carnal-Delight , '' etc. .

		There are thirty - six full-page illustrations , and seventy or more vig - nettes , together with a number of purely decorative designs , headbands , initials , marginal borders , etc. , the whole printed in brown ink on rather heavy paper .

		There is an Edition de luxe of this work , but the very moderate price of the regular edition puts these highly satisfactory illustrations within reach of all .

		Of the seven historic trails that cross the great plains of the interior of this continent , the old
Santa	LOCATION	Fe * route has the most stirring and romantic story .

		That story has already been picturesquely told by
Colonel Henry Inman	ORGANIZATION	.

		Encouraged by the success of that work , he now puts forth a kindred volume containing the story of the second in interest of these primitive highways of the far west , `` The Great Salt Lake Trail '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Col.
W. F. Cody	PERSON	, popularly known as '' Buffalo Bill , '' is joint author of the volume , and his quota has at least the distinctive merit of being drawn mainly from its narrator 's own experience .

		The frontispiece , a cap - ital photographic plate , shows the two collaborators bending over a chart of the storied route over which so many adventurous pilgrims made their way to the now populous valley of the salted inland sea .

		Most interesting , perhaps , of these pioneering ad - venturers were the Mormons ; and to the trials of these sectaries during their arduous march Colonel Inman devotes some interesting , let us add char - itable , pages .

		The Salt Lake Trail was also the route followed by the expeditions of
Fremont	LOCATION	, S tans - bury , and Lander , and by the famous
Pony Express	ORGANIZATION	, with its lumbering colleague , the Overland Stage .

		It is to the annals of the
Trail	ORGANIZATION	in this its romantic period , long before a railway through the wilderness of sage-brush and alkali dust was thought possible , that Colonel
Inman	PERSON	's story is devoted .

		It is hardly proper to call it a story : it is rather a collection of stories an informal conglomerate of frontier yarns and pen-pictures of frontier characters .

		The work has little claim to literary style ; it is essentially history in the rough , and fixes for the use of the future historian the salient features of a phase of peculiarly American life and manners now fading into history .

		The echoes of that stirring period are already dying ; for
America	LOCATION	is preeminently the land of change . ''

		The Great Salt Lake Trail '' is a book that
Young America	ORGANIZATION	, especially , will relish and profit by .

		It contains seven full-page illustrations by
F. Colburn Clarke	PERSON	, together with many rather roughly executed cuts in the text A map of the
Trail	ORGANIZATION	is of course included .

		If we should ever have an
Omar Khayyam Club	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	should be made its president by acclamation .

		His '' Vari - orum '' edition of Omar , so comprehensively planned and so skilfully edited ; his '' Bilingual '' edition , so happily conceived and so prettily executed ; and now , the holiday edition edited by him for
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, are titles to the aforementioned presidency such as no other American could offer .

		-LRB- We do not mention Mr.
Vedder	PERSON	because he lives in
Rome	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		The edition to which reference has just been made gives a full reprint of the first , second , and fifth versions of the quatrains , together with the variants found in the two others .

		It includes the regular FitzGerald essay and notes , besides an introductory paper and other apparatus supplied by the present editor .

		The volume is beautifully printed and bound , and has for illustrations , be - sides the frontispiece portrait of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, twelve original photo-etchings by Mr.
Gilbert James	PERSON	and Mr.
Edmund H. Garrett	PERSON	Mr.
James	PERSON	adopts a decorative style of design , which proves effective .

		Mr.
Garret	PERSON	, on the other hand , resorts to romantic idealization , and achieves prettiness in every case , and something more than prettiness in the cases in which he allows himself to be influenced by Mr.
Vedder	PERSON	's work .

		In other words , he is best when he is frankly imitative .

		There is no more charming book than this offered for the holiday season .

		One of the most sumptuous and sterling of the solider publications of the season is the new illus - trated edition of Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	's The Beginnings of
New England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Of the original merits of Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's standard historical study we need not speak ; and of the pictorial element now added little need be said beyond stating that the governing principle of illustration is the sound one followed in the same author 's '' The American Revo - lution . ''

		In the newer work , as in the older one , the pictures are real lights on the text , and absolute and material additions to the graphic quality and historical richness of the work .

		In the matter of portraits the present volume unavoidably falls some - what short , in point of comprehensiveness , of its well equipped predecessor , for the reason that in a number of cases authentic originals are lacking .

		We miss , for instance , from Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's interesting gallery such worthies as
William Bradford	PERSON	,
Roger 1898	PERSON	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 461
Williams	ORGANIZATION	, and
Thomas Hooker	PERSON	.

		On the other hand , there are a few agreeable surprises in the way of hitherto unpublished portraits notably an attrac - tive one of
Goffe	PERSON	, the regicide .

		Very interesting are the photographic reproductions of quaint title-pages , facsimiles of notable documents and sign manuals among the latter the '' marks '' of
Miantomo	LOCATION	, of Uncas and
Squaw	LOCATION	, of
King Philip	LOCATION	, etc. .

		But we can not attempt here to convey a fair notion of the pictorial scope and interest of this noble publication .

		The portraits are mainly full-page photogravures , which serve at once to embellish and illustrate this well con - ceived , elegant volume .

		The title of Mrs.
Mary Knight Potter	PERSON	's tasteful little book , '' Love in Art '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has afforded a wide scope of choice in the matter of illus - tration .

		There are thirty-six plates in all , and the subjects have been well selected .

		The bulk of the pictures are photographic reproductions of well - known masterpieces , such as the Venus of Melos , the Cupid of Praxiteles ,
Correggio	LOCATION	's Education of Cupid , Da
Vinci	PERSON	's
Mona Lisa	PERSON	,
Botticelli 's Birth of Venus	ORGANIZATION	, etc. ; but the inclusion of such works as The Lovers by Mrs.
Kenyon Cox	PERSON	,
Thumann	PERSON	's Springtime of Love , Brush 's Mother and Child , and
Millais	PERSON	's The Bride of Lammermoor , indicates at least some independence of taste on the author 's part , and im - parts a popular flavor to the book .

		A taste that might find
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	unpalatable will find its account in
Millais	LOCATION	and
Thumann	PERSON	.

		The author writes intelli - gently for the behoof of the general reader , with whom this comely volume should find ready accept - ance .

		The handsome print and delicate binding are especially noteworthy .

		The same firm publish in similar style Mrs.
Clara Erskine Clement	PERSON	's '' Angels in Art . ''

		This popularly instructive and attractively illustrated book sustains Mrs.
Clement	PERSON	's reputation as a discriminating and well informed writer in her chosen field .

		The illustrations are selected with irre - proachable taste .

		There are thirty-four of them in all , and nothing is included that the judicious reader is likely to wish away .

		This publication is certainly among the prettiest as well as the soundest moderate - priced art books on our list .

		A handsome book packed with information as to the household economy of Colonial times is Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	's '' Home Life in Colonial Days '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work is mainly and essentially an antiquarian account of the tools , implements , and utensils , as well as the processes , of Colonial domestic industry ; and it is full enough to serve as a moderate encyclopaedia in that kind .

		The feature of the book , it is perhaps fair to say , is the illustrations ; and a glance over the long list of these is enough to show to our modern view how remarkably self-sustaining and self-sufficing in respect of its material needs the Colonial family was .

		Nearly everything worn or used was made at home .

		The '' boughten '' article was a comparative rarity ; and the daughter of the well-regulated household was necessarily mistress of a score of small handicrafts .

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's pic - tures are in every case , as she tells us , '' from real articles and scenes , usually from those still in exist - ence rare relics of past days ... Many a curious article as nameless and incomprehensible as the totem of an extinct Indian tribe has been studied , compared , inquired about , and finally triumphantly named and placed in the list of obsolete domestic ap - purtenances .

		From the lofts of woodsheds , under attic eaves , in dairy cellars , out of old trunks and sea-chests from mouldering warehouses , have strangely shaped bits and combinations of wood , stuff , and metal been rescued and recognized . ''

		This useful and attractive book , with its profuse and interesting pictures , its fair typography , and its quaint binding imitative of an old-time sampler , should prove a holiday favorite .

		A pretty book with a '' catchy '' title , that will undoubtedly prove a prime favorite this season , is Mr.
Alexander Black	PERSON	's `` Miss America '' -LRB- Scrib - ner -RRB- , a collection of pen and camera sketches of types of the American Girl .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	appears to have more than a speaking acquaintance with his subject .

		He writes cleverly and with a vein of shrewd phil - osophy ; and he is plainly an adept with the camera .

		The pictures are decidedly attractive of course .

		They strike us as a fairly representative lot ; and we commend them to the American young man for careful inspection .

		They will refresh his patriot - ism , and make him glad that he was not born else - where .

		Outwardly , the volume is most enticing the prettiest and daintiest possible gift-book for
Miss America	LOCATION	herself .

		The cover is of pale-blue , with a medallion design showing one of the author 's most bewitching types .

		In his interestingly illustrated book entitled '' Woods and Dales of Derbyshire '' -LRB-
G. W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the Rev.
James S. Stone	PERSON	tells of his summer ramblings in that storied English county during the
summer of 1892	DATE	.

		Dr. Stone started on his tour with the mental equipment necessary to its full and intelligent enjoyment .

		He saw what was best worth seeing , and he writes suggestively and entertain - ingly , and with the due sprinkling of anecdote .

		We commend the book especially to tourists in the county described .

		It will serve both as guide-book and companion .

		There are a number of half-tone photographic plates of fair interest and quality .

		One of the most distinctive of the season 's gift - books is Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	's graceful literary fantasy , `` In the Forest of Arden '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , deco - rated by Mr.
Will H. Low	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Low	PERSON	's decorative work , head and tail pieces , scattered sprays and gar - lands of leaves and flowers , marginal borders , etc. , all printed in light-brown ink , is perhaps the best of its class this season .

		The clever full-page designs are conceived in the spirit of the text .

		We have nothing but praise for this specimen of delicate , artistic book-making .

		Replete with tender Christian sentiment and singularly in harmony with the spirit of the great Church festival is Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	's delicately fancied Christmas legend of `` The Lost Word '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

Chrysostom	PERSON	.

		The hero of the tale is
Hermas	LOCATION	, one of the golden youth of
Antioch	LOCATION	, con - verted by
John	PERSON	, and in consequence disinherited by his father , the rich pagan ,
Demetrius	PERSON	.

		The story turns upon the lapse of Hermas into paganism , and his eventual return to the fold of the faithful .

		The `` Lost Word '' is `` God '' a precious talis - man that is completely erased from the memory of the youth during the period of his apostasy , through the arts of the pagan sorcerer
Marcion	PERSON	, yet sorely needed at intervals of despair and threatened be - reavement , when the echo of a prayer struggles to his lips .

		He can utter his petition , indeed but to whom ?

		He gropes vainly in memory for the '' Lost Word , '' until it is too late .

		The story closes with the appearance of
Chrysostom	PERSON	at the bedside of the child of
Hermas	LOCATION	, who has been thrown from his father 's chariot during the races at Hippodrome .

		Hermas , heart-broken , is praying that the boy 's life may be spared ; but again the precious word eludes his memory .

		Chrysostom supplies it , just as the soul of the little sufferer is about to take flight ; and the prayer is answered .

		The story is grace - fully told , and the allegory is not too obtrusive .

		The volume is chastely decorative in style , and con - tains four pleasing photogravures after the designs of Mr.
Corwin Knapp	PERSON	Linson .

		The delightful Dent edition of '' The Ingoldsby Legends '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- should prove one of the season 's favorites .

		The several series are hand - somely printed in one handy octavo volume , which is prefaced by a brief introductory sketch of Barham by Mr.
F. J. Simmons	PERSON	.

		The illustrator is Mr.
Arthur Rack	PERSON	ham , and he has made the most of his excellent opportunities .

		There are fourteen full - page plates in colors , and ninety-five vignettes in black-and-white .

		Mr.
Rack	PERSON	ham 's work is very spir - ited , some of it -LRB- notably in the text cuts -RRB- being quite up to the work of the older tribe of illus - trators on wood '' Phiz , ''
Cruikshank	PERSON	, and the rest .

		Mr.
Rack	PERSON	ham has taken pains to understand his author .

		The half comic , half grewsome spirit characteristic of
Barbara	LOCATION	's curious medley is per - fectly caught , and altogether Mr.
Rackham	PERSON	's pic - tures form a needed and welcome condiment to these old favorites .

		The book is manufactured in the usual flawless taste of its publishers .

		One of the pretty books that come to us from time to time with the imprint of the Roycroft Shop is entitled '' Love Letters of a Musician , '' and
Miss Myrtle Reed	ORGANIZATION	is the author .

		It is a series of rhap - sodical outpourings , addressed to his lady love by a young violinist , and filled with dreamy and tender passion .

		Their secondary theme -LRB- for love is the first -RRB- is not so much music as nature , and the writer seems to spend his spare hours in the woods and field * , watching the annual procession of harvests and flowers , and finding in them a new inspiration for both his art and his love .

		An excess of senti - mentality sometimes mars the writing , and
Miss Reed	ORGANIZATION	has not yet learned to avoid certain desper - ately hackneyed words and phrases , but the feeling of her book is sincere , and her observation of nature singularly truthful .

		She is a young woman from whom excellent work may be expected , a prediction that we make with a confidence based not only upon the present production , but also upon a few stray poems to which her name is attached , and which we have noticed in periodical publications here and there .

		A brace of notably tasteful little volumes , either or both of them forming a suitable and modest gift for a friend of musical tastes , are Mr.
Louis C. Elson	PERSON	's `` Great Composers and their Work , '' and Mr.
Henry C. Lahee	PERSON	's '' Famous Singers of To-Day and Yester - day '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Elson	PERSON	gives a series of brief biographical notices , well spiced with anec - dote , of noted composers , beginning with the earliest ones known to fame , and running the gamut in chro - nological order down to the notabilities of the pres - ent day .

		The same description will serve , mutatis mutandis , for Mr.
Lahee	PERSON	's book .

		Both authors write pleasantly and intelligently but one is surprised to find Mr.
Elson	PERSON	speaking of one of his musical worthies as '' the first party who fairly deserves , '' etc. .

		The italics are ours .

		The volumes are finely printed on good paper , and each contains a generous quota of well - executed portraits .

		The bindings in maroon and gilt are especially rich and well designed .

		Mr.
Orson Lowell	PERSON	is the illustrator of the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	's holiday edition of Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	's fine story , '' The Choir Invisible . ''

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's pictures consist of eight washed drawings reproduced in photogravure , and a number of pen sketches , full-page and vignette .

		Except in one or two cases -LRB- notably the strong plate facing page 68 -RRB- the wash drawings lack depth or distance , but the general effect is pleasing , and altogether the pic - tures should enhance the reader 's enjoyment of the book .

		The text is fairly printed on smooth paper , and the cover design of conventionalized flowers is graceful and effective .

		Dr.
Theodore F. Wolfe	PERSON	's pleasant volumes about the homes of famous authors have won so much favor , and deservingly , that he has prepared a new collection of studies in similar vein .

		It is entitled `` Literary Haunts and Homes '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , and is devoted to American authors Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	being dragged in by virtue of his temporary so - journ in
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		The '' haunts '' of Poe ,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Cooper	PERSON	,
Whitman	PERSON	, and many others , are described , and four engravings provide the text with illustra - tions .

		An elegant and suitable gift to a clerical friend will be found in the two rather sumptuous volumes entitled '' The Cathedrals of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Each volume contains a series of historical and descriptive papers on
England	LOCATION	's most famous min - sters , liberally illustrated with pen-drawings by Mr.
Herbert Railton	PERSON	and others .

		Volume I. opens with a characteristic paper by
Archdeacon Farrar	PERSON	on
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, which is followed by briefer accounts of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	,
Durham	LOCATION	,
Wells	ORGANIZATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 463 Winchester , and
Gloucester Cathedrals	ORGANIZATION	, by
Canon Freemantle	ORGANIZATION	,
Canon Talbot	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
S. M. S. Pereira	PERSON	, Dr.
Venables	PERSON	,
Canon Benham	ORGANIZATION	, and the Dean of Glou - cester , respectively .

		Volume II .

		is devoted to
St. Paul 's Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	,
York Minster	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Alban	ORGANIZATION	's
Abbey	LOCATION	, and
Ely	PERSON	,
Norwich	LOCATION	,
Salisbury	LOCATION	,
Worcester	LOCATION	, and
Exeter Cathedrals	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes are richly bound in purple and white cloth stamped with a suitable design in gilt , and are enclosed in stout slip-covers .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	's comely two-volume edition of
Cooper	PERSON	's '' The Last of the Mohicans , '' with twenty-four colored plates by
H. M. Brock	PERSON	, forms a very acceptable gift-book for a boy , as well as an attractive medium through which the older reader may renew his acquaintance with this old favorite of romantic fiction .

		Print and paper are good , and Mr.
Brock	PERSON	's designs are pleasing , and not so determinedly realistic as to be out of harmony with his author .

		The cover is dull red , with a notably good side ornament in gilt and black .

		`` Cathedral Bells '' -LRB-
William R. Jenkins	PERSON	-RRB- is a copiously illustrated flat oblong volume containing a detailed account , by the Rev.
John Talbot Smith	PERSON	, of that striking architectural exotic ,
St. Patrick 's Cathedral of New York	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Walter Russell	PERSON	is the illustrator , and he has supplied a liberal number of plates that should interest the class likely to be attracted by the volume .

		Besides views of the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	, exterior and interior , there are a number of portraits of prominent ecclesiastics
Archbishops Hughes	PERSON	,
McCloskey	PERSON	, and
Corrigan	PERSON	,
Rectors Quinn	PERSON	,
Lavelle	LOCATION	, etc. .

		The wide margins are decorated with details of architecture and mural and window paint - ing , knick-knacks of ecclesiastical dress and equip - ment , etc. .

		The liberal tone of the text will com - mend the book to Protestant readers , who will find it an instructive and intelligent account of the noble pile that lends an element of antique dignity and distinction to
New York	LOCATION	's magnificent thoroughfare .

		New editions of the '' Rubiiiyiit '' have been legion of late , but we are nevertheless glad to welcome the Edition de liuxe of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's translation just pub - lished by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is a large octavo , bound in green sateen , with an elaborate cover design in gold .

		The quatrains are printed two to a page , each pair being enclosed by a striking deco - rative border , drawn by Mr.
W. B. Macdougall	PERSON	, an artist whose work is prominent in more than one of the holiday publications this year .

		The designs have been engraved on wood , and the printing is done from the original blocks in a manner that could hardly be improved upon .

		The volume is issued in a limited edition of
1000	DATE	copies , and is dedicated to the members of the
Omar Khayyam Club	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	.

		Bubbling over with fun and instinct with the sunny and jocund spirit of the artist is '' The Frank Lock - wood Sketch Book '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Edward Arnold	PERSON	-RRB- , an oblong quarto containing a selection from the pen - and-ink drawings of the late Sir
Frank Lockwood	PERSON	.

		The sketches are chance jottings , largely playful cari - catures of well-known people , thrown off by the artist as the humor seized him .

		They remind one some - times of Leech , but of tener of
Thackeray	LOCATION	; and they evince at their best considerable technical skill of the rough-and-ready order .

		But the best part of them is their unfailing good temper their stingless fun at the expense of their author 's associates .

		Indeed , so far as they are caricatures , they owe their preser - vation mainly to the care of the victims themselves , who were always the most eager competitors for their possession .

		The drawings were literally '' Fliegende Blaetter '' scribbled in note-books and diaries and on odd scraps of paper , and forgotten by everyone save their chance possessor .

		But they were well worth collecting , and the volume containing them is by all odds the cleverest and most original thing in its way this year .

		Among the American victims of Sir
Frank	PERSON	's sportive pencil we note Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	and Mr.
Olney	PERSON	, Mr.
Depew	PERSON	, Mr.
Edison	PERSON	, etc. .

		Other draw - ings show Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	, Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	, Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	,
Lord Coleridge	PERSON	,
Lord Russell	PERSON	, the Tichborne Claimant , Mr.
Balf	PERSON	our , and a host of legal lights under more or less amusing circumstances .

		Nor did the caricaturist spare himself .

		He is shown in the cover design as being run away with -LRB- in wig and gown -RRB- by a sorry nag , d la
Gilpin	PERSON	, and evi - dently in anything but '' merry pin . ''

		A reminis - cence , probably .

		The new volume -LRB- the third -RRB- of '' Life 's Comedy , '' published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , is as attractive and entertaining as either of its predeces - sors , and this is saying a great deal .

		It is made up of drawings selected from the pages of '' Life , '' the best of our humorous weeklies , and contains speci - mens of the work of some of the most prominent black-and-white illustrators of the day .

		For pure diversion , there is no other holiday book of the year that can compare with it .

		By adding the element of color to Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	's familiar illustrations of ``
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	have acceptably varied their edi - tion of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's delightful book .

		There are a hundred drawings in all , forty of them in colors , the rest in black-and-white .

		Mrs.
Anne Thackeray Ritchie	PERSON	's preface is a welcome adjunct to this pretty and convenient edition .

		The bizarre initial stanza that faces the title-page of Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	's clever booklet of humorous verse entitled `` The Bashful Earthquake '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- indicates a larger and bolder fancy than is ap - parent in the body of the volume .

		The drop from the lines in question to such a bardic flight as the following , for instance , is sudden , not to say severe : '' The Bunnies are a feeble folk Whose weakness is their strength .

		To shun a gun a Bun will run To almost any length . ''

		But Mr.
Herford	PERSON	's verses , we repeat , are clever , and so are his drawings , with which the pages are liber - ally peppered .

		There are forty-nine titles in all .

		The book is temptingly gotten up , and cunningly baited with a striking '' earthquake '' design in colors .

		The
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in connection with
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, have begun the 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, publication of a '' Temple '' edition of
Dickens	LOCATION	, to be complete in 40 volumes .

		Pickwick '' is the first to appear , and the convenient form and enticing appear - ance of the three trim little volumes containing it tempt one strongly to re-read for the twentieth time or so this cheery and wholesome old favorite .

		The volumes are bound in Turkey-red flexible leather cov - ers , and each contains a frontispiece in colors .

		The set , in its neat box , forms a timely and irreproach - able Christmas gift Lapses of style and a vein of not very happy jocu - larity mar somewhat Mr.
Elbert Hubbard	PERSON	's other - wise acceptable sheaf of biographical sketches entitled '' Little Journeys to the Homes of American Statesmen '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The book conveys , in a chatty , off-hand style , a fair amount of elementary information concerning the lives and opinions of such men as
Franklin	LOCATION	,
Hamilton	LOCATION	,
Jefferson	PERSON	, Clay ,
Webster	PERSON	,
Sam	PERSON	.

		Adams , etc. .

		The volume is taste - fully got up , and the publishers have been liberal in point of illustrations , which consist largely of por - traits .

		The frontispiece is a notably good and well - executed likeness of
Hamilton	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	reissue in new form their excellent edition of
Walton	PERSON	's '' Complete An - gler . ''

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's Introduction is retained , of course .

		This fine essay , the '' Angler '' proper , and
Cotton	ORGANIZATION	's supplement on fly-fishing , are now included in a single delectable yet moderate-priced volume .

		Selected Notes are given at the back , as are the familiar Commendatory Verses on
Izaak	PERSON	and his performance .

		There is an index , and altogether the edition is both comely and convenient .

		The old woodcuts are retained .

		The volume is of feathery lightness , and makes a pleasing show in its dainty cover of grass-green and gilt .

		If you have a friend who is a golfer , as of course you have , yon can hardly go amiss in se - lecting as a gift for him -LRB- or her -RRB- a copy of '' The Golfer 's Alphabet '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The humors of the '' links '' are cleverly brought out by both illustra - tor and rhymster Mr.
A. B. Frost	PERSON	and Mr.
W. G. Van Sutphen	PERSON	, respectively .

		There is a rhymed couplet with a picture for each letter of the alphabet Mr.
Frost	PERSON	's '' caddies '' are especially funny .

		`` By the Still Waters '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , is a comely booklet of thirty odd pages containing what its au - thor , the Rev.
J. R. Miller	PERSON	, styles a Meditation on the
Twenty-Third Psalm	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Miller	PERSON	's piety is of a cheery and wholesome cast , and his meditations are judiciously mingled with some telling descrip - tions of Oriental scenery , of which the anonymous illustrator takes due advantage .

		There are eleven full-page plates and six vignettes , all nicely done .

		The book is neatly bound in pale green with cover - design in dark green and gold , and forms a pretty gift for a friend of pious turn .

		Notably dainty and enticing are the two small volumes of specimens from the poets , entitled '' Wit and Wisdom from Many Minds '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The selections are made with taste and with commend - able independence of judgment , and the best of the humbler poets and the translators especially are not slighted .

		The text is finely printed on good paper , and pains have evidently been taken to secure accu - racy .

		One disastrous misprint , however , we note , in
Butler	PERSON	's description of
Holland	LOCATION	, which reads '' A land that rides at anchor , and in moor 'd ; In which men do not lire but go abroad . ''

		- Abroad , '' of course , should be '' aboard . ''

		The volumes are choicely bound in light-green ribbed cloth with gilt lettering and tracery .

		The Charming Auxiliary , a worthy philanthropic organization of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, issues each year a holiday pamphlet , or brochure , which makes its modest appeal , we trust not in vain , to discriminat - ing buyers .

		This year the subject , and a very appropriate one , is the late
E. R. Sill	PERSON	's poem on '' Christmas in
California	LOCATION	, '' which appears with numerous illustrations and decorations from pen - drawings by Miss
Helen Hyde	PERSON	.

		The tall , narrow leaves are of raw-edged hand-made paper , and the soft cover is of Japanese vellum ornamented with a graceful design in four colors showing two slightly conventionalized calla lilies with illuminated letters in the missal style .

		The drawings evince a delicate fancy and considerable artistic promise on the part of the illustrator .

		Miss
Kate Sanborn	PERSON	's `` Starlight Calendar '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is , properly speaking , a small an - thology of striking extracts in prose and verse , a pageful of them for each day of the year .

		The collection is a promiscuous one .

		The authors repre - sented range in philosophy from
Plato	LOCATION	to
Joseph Cook	PERSON	and in poetry from
Milton	LOCATION	to
Whitcomb Rtley	ORGANIZATION	.

		Shakespeare and
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	are excluded from
Miss Sanborn	LOCATION	's pantheon , while
Thurlow	PERSON	Weed ,
David Swing	PERSON	, and
Tupper	PERSON	are admitted .


Helen Hunt	PERSON	is perhaps the writer most favored in point of space , while
Immanuel Kant	PERSON	modestly brings up the rear with a line and a half .


E. P. Roe	PERSON	is recalled from the shades , and there are several pagefuls of ''
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	. ''

		Auerbach figures grandly as '' von ''
Auerbach	PERSON	.

		The prevailing cast of the selec - tions given is the serious-edificatory , an effect which is not relieved by the fact that the compiler of the book thoughtfully appends dated blank pages whereon '' to record the sacred days on which your friends have passed through death to life . ''

		Not a very cheery sort of a Christmas Calendar , we must say , but one providing abundant food for sober reflection .

		A dainty volume that comes with a certain appro - priateness at this season is Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new edition of '' The Little Flowers of Saint
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	, '' translated from the Italian and provided with a brief sketch of Saint
Francis	PERSON	by Mrs.
Abby Langdon Alger	PERSON	.

		The '' Little Flowers '' are legends of the Umbrian Saint and his disciples , and the book has long been a favorite with pious souls in
Italy	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		The present translation was made in
1887	DATE	, and we are glad to see it in its new setting .

		There are two plates , one after
Morello	PERSON	's painting in the
Milan Gallery	LOCATION	, the other
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 465 after
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	's quaint picture of Saint
Francis	PERSON	's Ser - mon to the Birds .

		There is a good deal of fun of the rough and popular kind in Mr.
E. W. Kemble	PERSON	's thin oblong volume of drawings entitled '' The
Billy Goat	PERSON	, and Other Comicalities '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The plates are divided in sets , each of which tells a story with a catastrophic ending that is usually of a painful or humiliating nature to the victim .

		The type is familiar to readers of the comic weeklies .

		An age , like the present one , rather given to sneer - ing at friendship and other primitive human senti - ments as '' obsolete , '' should find Mr.
Hugh Black	PERSON	's pretty and modest book on '' Friendship '' -LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- profitable reading .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	is a popular Scotch preacher ; but there is no twang of the conventicle in his style .

		He divides his subject under nine headings , such as '' The Miracle of Friendship , '' '' The Culture of Friendship , '' '' The Fruits of Friend - ship , '' '' The Choice of Friendship , '' and so forth .

		These sub-topics are treated in a limpid , virile , and stimulating way , that makes one rather envy Mr.
Black	PERSON	's parishioners the fortunate congregation , by the way , of Free St.
George	PERSON	's ,
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		The volume is a very presentable little duodecimo , soundly made , and suitably decorated .

		The light-red border enclosing the text of each page has a pleasing effect , as has the binding of olive-green-and-gold ribbed cloth .

		An odd looking booklet bound apparently in un - bleached crash contains Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's popular bal - lad of '' Mandalay , '' with drawings by
Miss Blanche McManus	PERSON	.

		The drawings are printed in light red on tinted paper , and are nicely done .

		This u catchy '' and not inartistic little production bids fair to score a success in its modest class this
Christmas	DATE	.

		-LRB-
M. F. Mansfield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- A rather pretty publication which will doubtless find admirers is the ''
Marie Corelli	PERSON	Birthday Book '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , compiled by Mr.
M. W. Davies	PERSON	and illustrated by Messrs.
Ernest Prater	PERSON	and
G. H. Ed	PERSON	- wards .

		The drawings , which depict Miss
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	's heroines , are fairly successful , and the extracts from her writings are carefully chosen .

		The vol - ume is bound in bottle-green cloth , and the text is printed in light-green ink .

		The `` Chinese Children 's Calendar , '' published by Mr.
R. H. Russell	PERSON	, is one of the most attractive of the season .

		It consists of four drawings , handsomely printed in colors , of Chinese children in costume , made from life by Miss
Bertha Stuart	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	also publishes the '' Colonial Soldier Calendar , '' an effective design , printed in colors on heavy card - board , that should find especial favor among the children .

		Mr.
William Doxey	PERSON	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	sends us the '' Lark Almanac '' for
1899	DATE	and a new edition of the popular '' Purple Cow . ''

		Both of these attractive booklets are made up of pictures and verses orig - inally contributed by Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	to the pages of that entertaining but short-lived little peri - odical , '' The Lark . ''

		BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		IL Somewhat apart from the mass of books for boys is Mr.
Edwin Pugh	PERSON	's `` Tony Drum '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		In the midst of the mediocrity and emptiness that are conjured up in the name of childhood , it is good to come upon a writer who has his hand on life .

		This story of the slums is the biography of the humpbacked sou of a wandering flute-player ; yet , with such temptations to sentimentality , the author is quite as plucky as his little hero .

		There is no sniffling , no exaggeration of the inevitable pathos .

		A kind of rugged simplicity is the note of the book .

		Its quality is expressed at once to the eye in the remarkable illustrations by Mr.
William Nicholson	PERSON	; for the author is as much of an artist as the picture-maker , and there is an extraordinary sym - pathy between the drawings and the text .

		The person - ality of
Michael Drum	PERSON	is as sharply presented in the frontispiece as it is in the story itself , and the single brief appearance of Tony 's grandfather in the text brings him before us as vividly as does Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's drawing .

		Tony himself is a creation , a real boy ; and they are very genuine emotions and imaginings and heartaches to which we are bluntly introduced .

		There is tenderness underneath the author 's admirable reserve , his heavy and rugged outlines ; and it makes the sensi - tive and imaginative little cripple vivid to one 's fancy .

		From this to any other book in the group is a long descent .

		Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	writes the conven - tional boy 's story well in '' Success against Odds '' -LRB- Apple ton -RRB- .

		Perhaps some boy will like the successful
Steve	PERSON	better than the hapless Tony , but ten years later his choice will be reversed Mr.
J. T. Trowbridge	PERSON	also knows how to please the average boy , and in '' Two Biddicut Boys '' -LRB- Century -RRB- his hero is a wonderful trick dog .

		He is the centre of the boyish pranks , and even takes an active part in them , to the endless delight of all boy lovers of dogs .

		Mr.
Herbert Elliott Hamblen	PERSON	gives us two books this year , but neither one of them is as interesting to boys as the stories of the building of railroads which he collected under the title of '' The General Manager 's Story . '' ''

		Tom
Benton	PERSON	's Luck '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- tells of many adventures on sea and land ; but somehow they are not convincing .

		The wrecks are too theatrical , and Tom 's experience in the tropics bears no evidence of reality .

		In spite of his manifold adven - tures , Tom is never quite alive , and one is consequently rather indifferent to his success even in the love affair , which seems hardly necessary in this kind of a book . ''

		The Story of a Yankee Boy '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by the same author , has more of life and movement , though the hero 's experiences are much more commonplace .

		They are not very pretty , some of them , but they are not un - natural to a boy with a good dash of original sin in him .

		Colonel
Henry Inman	PERSON	has a good subject in '' The Ranch on the Oxhide '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , but he uses it as a basis for hunting stories and battles with big game , rather than for the portrayal of ranch life .

		It is of the pioneer days in
Kansas	LOCATION	, however , that
Colonel Inman	ORGANIZATION	writes , when wolves and panthers , buffaloes and Indians were more familiar to the ranchman than they are to-day .

		He tells about them with some dash and evident knowl - edge It is frontier life , also , which interests Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	in ''
Dick	PERSON	in the Desert '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He intimates that the story is a true one , and dedicates the book to ''
Dick	PERSON	, '' who certainly has the modesty and courage necessary to real heroes .

		His lonely journey across the
Smoke Creek Desert	ORGANIZATION	in
Nevada	LOCATION	to procure 466 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, help for his wounded father is well described .

		Mr.
Otis	PERSON	's style is also good in ``
Joel Harford	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , where he finds his hero in one of the innumerable country boys who begin life in the city of
New York	LOCATION	.

		On the first day he is robbed of his small capital and thrown on the world .

		But he is plucky and industrious , and with the encouragement of two newsboy chums he makes a way and a place for himself .

		A still more ambitious young American , Mr.
Harry Steele Morrison	PERSON	, writes his own biography in '' A Yankee Boy 's Success '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- ; and a very unlovely and unpleasant sort of boy he seems to be .

		He interviews the Queen on the cover , the
Presi	LOCATION	- dent in the frontispiece , and Mr.
Chauncey Depew	PERSON	in the opening pages ; and shows that combination of impu - dence and ' enterprise '' which , when he gets older , ought to make him a great '' find '' for some '' yellow journal . ''

		Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	's book of travel is quite different . ''

		Lost in
Nicaragua	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- continues the travels of the Frobishers , who last year wandered `` Over the Andes , '' and relates especially the story of one of them who was lost in an ancient idol cave in his effort to capture a quetzel , the royal bird of the Aztecs .

		Many of the picturesque old legends and super - stitions are introduced , and some of the history and peculiarities of a country which promises to have a special interest for Americans .

		`` Yule Logs '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- has the recommendation of being edited by Mr.
G. A. Henty	PERSON	, and the Indian and tomahawk in the frontispiece will be enough , doubtless , to attract the average boy .

		The book is made up of a dozen stirring tales of adven - ture , by such well-known writers as
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	,
G. Manville Fenn	PERSON	,
J. Bloundelle-Burton	PERSON	, and Mr.
Henty	PERSON	himself .

		A book for boys of a serious and studious cast of mind is Mr.
John Trowbridge	PERSON	's '' Physical Science at Home '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , in which amusement and instruc - tion are combined in about the right proportions .

		To the writer of books for boys there seems to be no place where they may not travel , and even the forbid - ding
Klondike	ORGANIZATION	has drawn out two stories .

		Mr.
E. S. Ellis	PERSON	's `` Klondike Nuggets '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClnre Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is ornamented with many pictures by Mr.
Orson Lowell	PERSON	, which , however , are badly printed .

		The story is an entertaining and well - written one , dealing with the experiences of two adventurous boys in search of gold .

		They have good luck and bad , but succeed overwhelm - ingly at the end .

		They do it a bit too easily , perhaps , for the good of boys at home who read the story .

		Less rather than more than this can be said for Dr.
Gordon Stables	PERSON	's '' Off to Klondyke '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , dealing with sim - ilar material .

		From this new and excited civilization , The Lost City '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Joseph E. Badger , Jr.	PERSON	, carries us back to an old and calmer one .

		But we pass through some novel experiences to reach it .

		Carried in a flying machine into the heart of a tornado , we are whirled with it through space to come down finally upon the lost city of the Aztecs .

		An inhabited city it is , too , which makes the accounts of it an entertaining tissue of impossibilities Not less extraordinary is Mr.
Charles Frederick Holder	PERSON	's discovery of a new field for youthful investigation in '' The Treasure Divers '' -LRB- DoddV He equips a boat , like the
Holland	LOCATION	submarine torpedo boat , for the exploration of the depths of the sea .

		His picture of life in this larger world is interesting , and he asserts that , with the exception of the inevitable sea-serpent , the weird and terrible animals he shows us are scientifically accurate .

		It is a kind of natural history unusual to boys ' books .

		Another venture into the unknown is Mr.
Skel	PERSON	- ton Kuppard 's '' Uncharted Island '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is so filled with action , and the island so loaded with treas - ure , that few boys will complain at any apparent lack of reality in the narrative .

		The special charm of
F. Anstey	PERSON	's book is effectually concealed under the title , '' Paleface and Redskin , and Other Stories for Boys and Girls '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Instead of the blood-and - thunder article that we expect , we find a clever and laughable little story of mimic warriors and the dis - comfiture of their boastful general .

		The real boy and girl are present in all of the stories , and they talk as they do in life .

		And the author 's irony is launched against priggishness and affectation , and kindred faults , of which young people are sometimes rather proud .

		The stories are funny to the old as well as to the young , and they have a way of enforcing wholesome lessons without seeming to do so .

		Mr.
Gordon Browne	PERSON	's pic - tures rise to the cleverness of the text .

		Mr.
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	has written a new kind of boys ' book in '' The Lakerim Athletic Club '' -LRB- Century -RRB- .

		He tells how twelve sturdy boys learn to play football ; and then , as that game does not last all the year , he teaches them skating , bicycle polo , golf , and many another sport .

		But the best of it is that the boys are very much alive and are individualized with a good deal of skill .

		Tug and Bobbles and Sawed-off would appeal to any boy who has a wholesome love of athletics .

		For these also is `` The Boys of
Fairport	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , written by Mr.
Noah Brooks	PERSON	.

		It was originally published as `` The
Fairport	LOCATION	Nine , '' but as several new chapters , dealing with adventures outside the baseball field , were introduced , the name was changed In `` The Boy Mineral Col - lectors '' -LRB- Lippinoott -RRB- , Mr.
Jay G. Kelley	PERSON	,
M.E.	LOCATION	, invites the attention to a new , profitable , and absorbing source of amusement .

		Under the thin guise of a story , the book contains much useful information about the nature of minerals .

		Its value is increased by a good index .

		Miss
Effie W. Merriman	PERSON	's `` Sir Jefferson Nobody '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is guiltless of any intention to instruct .

		It is a prettily written story about a young fellow who does many generous things and finds that in the long run they pay better than selfishness '' Chilhowee Boys in Harness '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Sarah E. Mor	PERSON	- rison , is the last in the Chilhowee series , and follows the fortunes of the youngest son of
Parson Craig	PERSON	in the middle of the century '' Chums at Last '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
A. Forsyth Grant	PERSON	, is a story of English school life , and a jolly good story it is , too .

		There is a great deal of human nature in this crowd of boys , and their simple quarrels and difficulties are much more interest - ing than if they were prowling in the wilds of
Asia	LOCATION	or
Australia	LOCATION	.

		They are but simple adventures , also , in '' The Widow
O'Callaghan	PERSON	's Boys '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by Miss
Gulielma Zollinger	PERSON	, but they are pleasant to read of .

		The seven boys , whom the widow trains to be good and useful men , are as plucky as she ; and they have a good bit of the Irish loyalty as well as of the Irish brogue .

		The pictures , by
Miss S. Crosby	PERSON	, are good .

		Miss
Julia Magruder	PERSON	takes a rather sentimental view of life in '' Labor of Love '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , but she serves it up pret - tily '' The Young Supercargo '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
William Drysdale	PERSON	, is a new volume in the '' Brain and Brawn Series , '' and takes its hero on many long voy - ages In '' Six Young Hunters '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
W. Gordon Parker	PERSON	relates the adventures of the
Grey	LOCATION	- hound Club with game and outlaws in Indian Territory .

		`` The Young Bank Messenger '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Horatio Alger , Jr.	PERSON	, is also invaded by outlaws , and very stilted and impossible persons they prove to be .

		Mr.
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 467
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	has a new and exciting subject in '' The Copper Princess '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		His hero leaves college to find that his fortune has disappeared with the ex - ception of an interest in a Lake Superior mine .

		Though the mine is said to be worthless , he determines to find out the facts for himself , and he has an active time of it in learning the business and retrieving his fortune .

		Between the miners and the smugglers there is plenty of fighting , but it all makes for success in the end .

		The success is almost too complete , indeed , to be real .

		The cover of the book is capital , and there are good illus - trations by Mr.
W. A. Rogers	PERSON	Mrs.
Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	is nothing if not picturesque in her story of '' The Valiant Runaways '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		The scene of action is early
Cal	LOCATION	- ifornia , and
Roldan Castanada	PERSON	is the hero .

		His flight to escape the conscription is the motive of the plot , but he proves , pluckily enough , that he was not afraid of fighting .

		His valiant deeds are rather theatrical , and they do not quite convince the reader , as they seem to have convinced Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	, that he was born to be a leader of men .

		In spite of some forced and twisted English , there is much life and color in the book .

		Will
Allen Dromgoole	PERSON	, who is even more prolific this year than Mr.
Henty	PERSON	, has written three more books for boys .

		One is a tale of '' A
Moonshiner	ORGANIZATION	's Son '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- who , in spite of fate , is a good boy , almost preternaturally good .

		But his story is well told , and contains the figure of a kind old country store - keeper , which is the best thing in it .

		If one can recover from the shock produced by the cover , with its impossible boys against an impossible landscape , of '' Three Little Crackers from Down in Dixie '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , by the same author , an entertaining story of the
Florida	LOCATION	wilderness will be found .

		The adventures of these boy pioneers are chiefly with alligators and wild-cats and such unde - sirable companions .

		In '' The Fortunes of the Fellow '' -LRB- Page -RRB- ,
Will Allen Dromgoole	PERSON	tells the story of a waif who finds a father , and whose gradual transformation under the loving care of the old blacksmith is pleasant to read about .

		The author tries a bit too obviously to exert a moral influence , but he has a sense of character which makes up for it Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	has written a life of Oliver Hazard
Perry	PERSON	under the title of '' The Hero of Erie '' -LRB- Apple ton -RRB- .

		It is more exciting than any novel and better worth reading .

		Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	de - scribes the battle of
Lake Erie	LOCATION	in a way to make it impossible to forget .

		The pictures are capital , some of them being taken from old engravings .

		Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	is much more sensational and less true in `` A Young Volunteer in
Cuba	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is up to date , but that is about the best that may be said of it .

		Several tempting dishes are placed before the very little boys this year . ''

		Little Mr.
Van Vere	PERSON	of
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Harriet A. Cheever	PERSON	, is pleasant to the taste , with its pretty illustrations by
Miss Etheldred B. Barry	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the story of a little fellow who becomes a stowaway in the ship of a jolly old captain .

		The boy is a bit too good , perhaps , and his lot is made unnaturally smooth ; yet the story is rather pretty
Lucas Malet	PERSON	has woven a charming little story about the experience of '' Little Peter '' and his cat .

		They are French , both of them , and very wise and simple ; and their biography is written with so much grace and delicacy that none of us are too old to enjoy it -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- Will
Allen Dromgoole	PERSON	gives us two attractive little books . ''

		Hero - Chums '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- shows the friendship between an old man and a very little chap , and ends with the great sac - rifice made by the one for the other . ''

		A Boy 's Battle '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- has an older fellow for its hero ; the story centres in his struggle with his conscience , which ends in highly melodramatic fashion with the victory of conscience and the boy 's confession in open court .

		Mr.
Homer Greene	PERSON	's story of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	coal - miners , '' The Blind Brother '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , which won the `` Youth 's Com - panion '' large prize in
1886	DATE	, is brought out in a new edition There is a new edition also of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's `` Grandfather 's Chair '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , which is perennially interesting And the list closes with Mrs.
C. F. Eraser	PERSON	's '' Master Sunshine '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , which is written with the best intentions in the world , made a bit too manifest .

		To the girls , providence has been generous in books this year , but generous in number rather than in quality .

		The rule still holds that it is better for a girl to read her brother 's books than her own .

		Even at the worst , his have a certain virility which is more wholesome than the flab - biness so common in hers .

		It is only the exceptional writer who is able to avoid sentimentality in writing for girls .

		Some authors handle it well , and thus mitigate the offense ; but in one form or another , in a perverted view of life if not in actual love-making , it will slip in .

		There is something of it even in Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	's ''
Daddy Darwin	PERSON	's Dovecote '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , though here there are touches of beauty and of real life .

		But Mrs.
Ewing	PERSON	found her place years ago , and there are many to wel - come this new edition , with its pretty drawings by
Miss Etheldred B. Barry	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	was unfortunate enough to do a fine thing in '' Captain
January	DATE	, '' which makes each successor a disappointment . ''


Margaret Montf	PERSON	ort '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is a readable story about the efforts of one of the '' Three Margarets '' to keep house for her uncle .

		The motive is rather thin even for a girl 's book , and the aggressive cousin who inter - feres is a bit too aggressive to be natural .

		A delight - ful cover by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	attracts one at once to '' A Little Colonial Dame '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Agnes Carr	PERSON	Sage .

		And its quaintness is carried through the story .

		It is more Dutch than American , this tale of old
Manhattan	LOCATION	, and it suggests rather charmingly the transformation of the one into the other .

		Some of the climaxes are highly melodramatic , and the Dutch dialect and the quaint old English are insisted upon rather strongly .

		Yet the picture is novel and interesting , love-making and all .

		The illustrations , by Miss
Mabel Humphrey	PERSON	, are pretty but characterless In '' A Little New England Maid '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , Mrs.
Kate Tannatt Woods	PERSON	tries to carry one back to another section of the colonies .

		But she is too obviously of the present in deal - ing with the past ; one is too conscious of the author to believe in her story .

		And there is a prodigious deal about love and marriage , which is not interesting enough to be justifiable Mrs.
Amanda M. Douglas	PERSON	carries one down to a somewhat later date in '' A Little Girl in Old
Boston	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		Her story , which ends with the inevit - able marriage , is written for older girls with sweet sim - plicity .

		Doris is an attractive little woman , who is also good and wholesome .

		It is the kind of book that many girls will like , though it is very far from being a work of art .

		Mrs.
Douglas	PERSON	's popularity is attested by the appearance of the seventh volume in her '' Sherburne Series '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		`` Sherburne Girls `` is a good book of its kind .

		Plenty of things happen , and the girls make the proper sacrifices and do good to their neighbors ; yet the story is never very close to the actual and real , and a girl who is old enough to read it could spend the time much more profitably and happily with
Thackeray	PERSON	or 468 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Scott Under	PERSON	the title of
Hester Stanley	ORGANIZATION	' * Friends '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	has published a collection of short stories about girls .

		They are simply and prettily written , without pretension or gush .

		And if the goodness of some of these children is almost superhuman , still Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	has a way of making it seem natural .

		The moral effect of the book is all that the most careful mother could desire ; which makes it a pity that the pictures are so bad They are not bad in `` Katrina '' -LRB- Wilde -RRB- , for Mrs.
Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	knows how to draw .

		The story is written by Miss
Ellen Douglas Deland	PERSON	, and is of much the same calibre as Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	's work .

		The style is excel - lent , and the story interesting without sentimentality .

		Without being phenomenal ,
Katrina	ORGANIZATION	is attractive , and her life in town and country is exciting enough and yet simple and natural .

		This is one of the best of the books for girls Miss
Evelyn Raymond	PERSON	, in '' Among the Lin - dens '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , tells the story of a little girl who in some mysterious way saves an old man from being run over in the streets of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The old gentleman turns out to be eccentric , and takes it upon himself to act as her special providence .

		The first result is an enormous basket of chrysanthemums , the price of which the author is considerate enough to tell us .

		And the other results may be imagined , though not the mer - riment which the author succeeds in putting into her narrative .

		In '' The American Girls ' Handy Book '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- the Misses Lina and
Adelia Beard	ORGANIZATION	have sought to do for girls what has been so successfully done for boys by their brother , Mr.
Dan Beard	PERSON	, in his well-known `` American Boys ' Handy Book . ''

		The present work is carried out on the same general lines , and provides an interesting collection of games and amusements .

		It is well-illustrated , and should prove fully as popular as its predecessor .

		Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney	PERSON	continues her popular series with a timely book called '' Witch Winnie in
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		It is illustrated with reproductions of great paintings by
Velasquez	PERSON	,
Fortuny	ORGANIZATION	, and Rico , which alone are something of an education .

		The text includes much instruction about great men and great deeds in its description of the rambling tour of these young girls through a beautiful country .

		It is written in a varied and entertaining way , though without origi - nality It is even a longer journey that is taken by two little girls in '' The Musical Journey of
Dorothy	PERSON	and Delia '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Bradley Gilman	PERSON	.

		They are carried far off into Music - Land , where the treble clef turns into an old woman , and the bass clef into an old man with a twinkle in his eye , and the notes come to life and dance about in the merriest way .

		Under a gay and fanciful disguise , the book contains a good deal of practical instruction for beginners in music ; and it might give them a new imaginative interest in the necessary drudgery .

		The book has some charmingly clever pic - tures by Mr.
F. G. Attwood	PERSON	.

		In quite a different way , there is character also in the illustrations by Miss
Ellen B. Thompson	PERSON	for '' Twixt Yon and Me '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Miss Grace Le
Baron	PERSON	writes the stories , which are pretty but rather commonplace , and the poems , which have less of the one quality and more of the other .

		There are some graceful decorations by Miss
Katharine Pyle	PERSON	A new edition of Mrs.
Mary Mapes Dodge	PERSON	's `` Irvington Stories '' -LRB- Wm.
L. Allison Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be welcomed by all those children , now grown gray and dignified , who loved these stories of old , especially with the original illustrations by
F. O. C. Darley	PERSON	.

		Other stories have been added , but Captain
George	PERSON	, `` Old Pop , '' and Po-no-kah are still here , and Mrs.
Dodge	PERSON	knows how to make them delightful The moral of 11 A Little Turning Aside '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Barbara Yechton	PERSON	, is a trifle obscure , but in life also the moral is not always easy to see .

		Duty is a large word , and sometimes it does not lie in the most obvious direction .

		According to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, the development of the individual has the first claim , and there are others also who would justify
Hetty	PERSON	's desertion of her aunt in this little book to go to
New York	LOCATION	and study art .

		Her success , inter - rupted by her sudden blindness and the resulting enrich - ing of her character , makes quite an absorbing story .

		It is well written , and the persons of the play have some individuality and are faultily human .

		The cover of the book in white and reds , is capital .

		A German story is a rather interesting interlude , it is so different in character , so genuinely outspoken , and so frankly sentimental . ''

		An Obstinate Maid '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- is translated from the twenty-first edition of the novel by
Emma von Rhoden	PERSON	, by
Miss Mary E. Ireland	ORGANIZATION	.

		And it is a rather interesting story of the transformation of an untamed girl who is sent to boarding-school .

		The story is a little too rapid , perhaps , and too complete , and it winds up in the inevitable love-affairs ; but the girls are given a few wholesome faults as a concession to the frailty of humanity .

		Miss
Julie M. Lippmann	PERSON	's '' Dorothy Day '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is also a story of school pranks and home sacrifices .

		It is harmless enough and pretty enough , too , in spite of the highly sensational picture of the rescue of a young girl from the back of an astonishing runaway horse .

		The episode is quite as impossible in the text as in
Miss Waugh	LOCATION	's drawing , but the rest of the story is not so bad .

		It is refreshing to find a really charming little book about college life , in '' Three Freshmen '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by Miss
Jessie Anderson	PERSON	Chase .

		One of the three freshmen is from
Boston	LOCATION	, another from
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the third from
Chicago	LOCATION	; so there is variety enough to give interest to their meeting at
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The writer differentiates the characters admirably , and there is a delightful spark - ling gayety in her treatment of them .

		It is one of the most breezy and wholesome of this year 's books for girls .

		The sub-title of Miss
Anna Chapin	PERSON	Ray 's '' Teddy , Her Book , a Story of Sweet Sixteen '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is rather prejudicial , but the story is not so bad as one might expect .

		Most of the sentimentality is confined to the last chapters , and there is a good deal of truth in the descriptions of
Teddy	ORGANIZATION	's trials and ambi - tions .

		The talk of the children is lively and natural , but the book is handicapped with ridiculous pictures .

		So many of the pictures which appear in these books for the young would be more attractive if they were invisible . ''

		Everyday Honor '' -LRB- whatever that may mean -RRB- is another incipient novel , or another novel for incipient intellects .

		It is very diffuse and very talky , but if one does n't mind that , it is pleasant enough -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- Miss
Mary F. Leonard	PERSON	's '' The Story of the Big Front Door '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is much more wholesome .

		They are simple and harmless pranks that these children play , and the author describes them with sympathetic vivacity .

		Miss
Jessie E. Wright	PERSON	's '' Odd Little Lass '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a perverse and naughty child , but a plucky and clever one nevertheless .

		Her experi - ence in a '' Home , '' followed by life with several people who wish to adopt her , is the basis of the book . ''

		As in a Mirror '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is another of the '' Pansy books , '' by Mrs.
G. R. Alden	PERSON	.

		But the characters grow up and
1898	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 469 become hopelessly stilted and sentimental . ''


Katie	PERSON	, a Daughter of the King '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Mary A. Gilmore	PERSON	, is too obviously written for Sunday-schools .

		In spite of its pretty cover , there are not many of us who can endure such insistent and relentless virtue .

		Miss
Martha Finley	PERSON	continues the '' Elsie Books '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- with ''
Elsie	PERSON	on the Hudson , '' and continues also the instruction which is mixed up with that young wo - man 's experiences . ''


Pauline Wyman	PERSON	'' -LRB- Lee & Shep - ard -RRB- is by another writer who is familiar to the rising generation ,
Miss Sophie May	ORGANIZATION	.

		Her heroine is a
New England	LOCATION	girl , whose character is developed through many trials , none of them so great , however , as the cover of this book .

		There are several books , also , about very little girls , and none is more attractive than '' The Princess and
Joe Potter	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , with its clever illustrations by
Miss Violet Oakley	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	has written a charming little story about this Princess of three , who was lost , and the little fruit-vender , who found her and cared for her through adversity .

		The boys of the story are lively , spirited , and big-hearted , and Mr.
Otis	PERSON	likes and understands them .

		And it is easy to see why
Joe Potter	PERSON	loved the Princess The hero of ''
Denise	PERSON	and Ned Toodles '' -LRB- Century -RRB- , by Miss
Gabrielle E. Jackson	PERSON	, is a pony ; but he is much more intelligent than most heroes .

		His little mistress teaches him many things , but he teaches her more , and we can learn all about them both in this lively narrative . ''

		Marjory and her Neighbors '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , described by Miss
Louise E. Catlin	PERSON	, are little people , but they have very good times in the country town they live in .

		Yet their story is rather long and quiet for such restless mites . ''

		Dear Little Marchioness '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- has an introduction by Bishop
Gailor	PERSON	, who describes it as the story of a child 's faith and love .

		The scene is laid in the South , and an old negro is a prominent figure .

		A charming little autobiography of a canary-bird is concealed under the title of '' The Strange Adventures of Billy Trill '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Harriet A. Cheever	PERSON	, and a very blithe and merry little bird he proves to be It is a bit of a kitten who is the centre of Miss
Blanchard	PERSON	's ''
Kittyboy	PERSON	's Christmas '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- ; but even this book for wee girls winds up with a love-affair . ''

		The Story of Little
Jane	PERSON	and Me '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
M. E.	PERSON	, has the advantage of a quaint and lovely cover .

		And it has the further ad - vantage of being gracefully written , with much tender - ness and charm , but without a trace of sentimentality .

		It is full of a true childish naivete , which is rarely found in books In `` Rare Old Chums '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Will Allen Dromgoole	PERSON	has written the story of the friendship be - tween a little girl and an old man ''
Ruth	PERSON	and her Grandfadder '' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has much the same theme .

		The verses it begins with are bad , but the story is better , and it is decorated prettily by Mr.
Edward B. Edwards	PERSON	.

		The ingenuity which goes into the making of picture - books has not yet been exhausted , and some of the later ones of the season are exceedingly clever .

		The charm of its cover and colored pictures permit '' Alice in Won - derland , A Play '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- to be classed among them .

		Mrs.
Emily Prime Delafield	ORGANIZATION	has arranged
Lewis	PERSON	Car - roll 's inimitable stories into a drama , which is delightful to read and doubtless would be still more delightful in the performance .

		It was presented originally at the
Waldorf Hotel	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	for the benefit of the Society of Decorative Art , and made a success great enough to warrant this publication .

		The adaptation has been so well done that none of the flavor of the original is lost .

		It would be hard to find a more amusing play for children to act than this . ''

		The
New Noah	LOCATION	's Ark '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
J. J. Bell	PERSON	, has the advantage of a novel and highly decorative cover .

		It is a very ridicu - lous gallery of animals , somewhat after the manner of
Edward Lear	PERSON	, but without his whimsical ingenuity .

		The verses are funny , however , and the pictures , in bright yellows and purples and reds , are still funnier .

		Some of the animals are imaginary , and the others are even more so .

		The elephant and the cow are the cleverest of these creations , but the effort to be funny is a bit too evident .

		Mr.
Oliver P. Tunk	PERSON	does the same kind of thing in '' An Awful Alphabet '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , showing his animals also '' as they ought to be . ''

		But these , too , are rather too absurd and impossible .

		More ingenuity is used in their construction than in Mr.
Bell	PERSON	's drawings , but for the real thing in this kind of work one must go back to
Edward Lear	PERSON	The pictures by Mr.
Frank Ver Beck	PERSON	in '' The Arkansaw Bear '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , have much more genuine humor , partly because they have some relation to reality .

		The character in them is irresistible , and one makes friends at once with '' Bosephus and the Fiddle and the Old Black Bear . ''

		It is a musical trio , and they go singing through the book until they make us who read about them sing too .

		The verses they improvise are very taking and appropriate to all occasions .

		The story is a clever one , written with a great deal of spirit .

		There is no dearth of animals this year , and ''
Sybil	PERSON	's Garden of Pleasant Beasts '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , by
Sybil	PERSON	and
Katharine Corbet	PERSON	, is a diverting addition for little people .

		It is pure nonsense , but of an unexpected and ingenious sort .

		Imaginative little brains would love its whimsicalities .

		The beasts are even pleasanter in the pictures than in the story .

		It is quite a different kind of beast that Mr.
E. W. Kemble	PERSON	celebrates in '' A Coon Alphabet '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Exaggerated as they are , his darkies are certainly funny , and he has a keen enough sense of the ludicrous to place them in very ridiculous situations .

		But in this book his humor is in its most obvious and least subtle stage . ''

		The Sambo Book '' -LRB-
Baltimore	LOCATION	:
Williams	PERSON	and
Wilkins Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Isaac Coale	PERSON	, Jr. , deals with a member of the same race .

		With some idea of symbolism , probably , it is printed upon gray paper , and the clever drawings by Miss
Katharine Gassaway	PERSON	gain much from the juxtaposition of black and gray .

		The stories are pretty , naive , simple little tales about the unsophisticated Sambo One of the most attractive of the picture books is '' New Mother Goose Pictures '' -LRB- Russell -RRB- , drawn by Mr.
Chester Loomis	PERSON	.

		The familiar old verses are printed , and the pictures are very decorative and charming arrangements in black and white .

		They are not as imaginative as Mr.
Maxfield	PERSON	's
Parrish	PERSON	's of
last year	DATE	, but they have character , and they are artistic in the decorative use of flat tones .

		We learn how Simple
Simon	PERSON	went a ' fishing , and how Tom the
Piper	ORGANIZATION	's Son stole a pig , with special delight .

		Miss
Emilie Poulsson	PERSON	's '' Child Stories and Rhymes '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is illustrated in a much more commonplace way by Mr.
L. J. Bridgman	PERSON	.

		The verses are more commonplace , too , and even if they are '' welcomed with delight by mothers and kindergartners , '' we fancy that the children themselves will prefer good old
Mother Goose	ORGANIZATION	.

		And they would be wiser than some of their parents think . ''

		Stories True and Fancies New '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Mary Whitney Morrison	PERSON	, is a book full of verses which also are intended chiefly for the kinder - garten .

		They are well illustrated by Mr.
L. J. Bridgman	PERSON	.

		470 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, A few fairy books most be added to the list in our last number , and they are always welcome and nearly always healthful .

		Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	, who did such lovely things with
Eugene Field	PERSON	's '' Lullaby Land '' last year , has decorated '' King Long-Beard , or Annals of the Golden Dreamland '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , by Mr.
Harrington Macgregor	PERSON	.

		The work is admirably done , and preju - dices one at once in favor of the stories , which turn out to be delicate and quaint enough to deserve their setting .

		Mr.
John Habberton	PERSON	, who made himself famous with ''
Helen	PERSON	's Babies , '' prints a clever book this year , called '' With the Dream-Maker '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- .

		His little hero has a strange experience in discovering the country where dreams come from .

		He becomes the confidant of the dream-maker , and learns all of his secrets , to our intense delight .

		It is an amusing and spirited little tale , and the moral is skilfully concealed .

		The fairies and princesses and ogres are merely incidental to a pretty story of a little American girl in
France	LOCATION	, in '' The Gate of the Giant Scissors '' -LRB- Page -RRB- .

		Mrs.
Annie Fellows Johnston	PERSON	is the author , and it is a pleasant little glimpse of French customs that she gives us .

		There are more fairies and dwarfs and things in '' The Green Toby Jug '' -LRB- Nelson -RRB- , by Mrs.
Edwin Hohler	PERSON	, but it is a princess of flesh and blood who rules the book .

		The stories are written for little children in a rather taking manner .

		Much less wholesome food than this is found in Miss
Martha Baker Dunn	PERSON	's '' The Sleeping Beauty , a Modern Version '' -LRB- Page -RRB- .

		It is a sadly sentimental variation of the picturesque old tale , much too old for children and much too young for their elders Mr.
C. M. Dnppa	PERSON	's '' Stories from Lowly Life '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have a certain interest for everybody .

		We have all had some kind of a pet in childhood , and can find bis counterpart in one or another of these stories of animals .

		There is no affectation or exaggeration in them , and they do not relate extraordinary adventures .

		They are simple and pleasant accounts of the doings of dogs and ponies , birds and mice , written by one who loves them .

		Miss
Martha Finley	PERSON	's '' Twiddledetwit '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- belongs among the fairy tales more strictly than do the two books last men - tioned .

		The very name is enough to evoke fairies and witches even to the most sedate ; and the little children for whom this tale was written will be glad to find them good and generous They are not quite so faultless in
Miss Florence Paillou	LOCATION	's '' Captain Darning Needle , and Other Folks '' -LRB- Buffalo :
Charles Wells Moulton	PERSON	-RRB- , but then the little girls and boys who play with them have , fortunately , a few faults of their own .

		So they make a very entertaining crowd , especially the needles and pins who come to life to reprove and fascinate little
Jennie	PERSON	.

		Such old familiar friends as '' Hop o ' my Thumb , '' 11 Cinderella , '' and '' Puss in Boots , '' edited and re - written by the author of ''
John Halifax	PERSON	, Gentleman , '' are printed in '' The Fairy Book '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is pleasant to meet these old favorites in any guise , and the liberties Mrs.
Craig	PERSON	has taken with them are for the most part harm - less ones .

		It is a very charming sort of fairy story that Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	has translated from the Italian in '' Pinocchio 's Adventures in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	:
Jordan	PERSON	,
Marsh , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The little wooden puppet comes to life in the most natural way , and de - velopes attractively perverse and naughty qualities .

		He is so spirited a little fellow that he interests one at once , and be has individuality enough to hold one 's interest .

		It is a sunny little book .

		Fairies are good food for the imagination , but such a book as '' Heroes of Chivalry and Romance '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , by the Rev.
A. J. Church	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, is still better .

		This is of the right sort .

		Nothing more wholesome and stimulating could be found for boys and girls than these majestic old myths ; they are so closely interwoven with the arts , and are the foundations of so much that is beautiful in literature and music and painting , that one must be familiar with them .

		Heard in childhood in the simple and vivid way in which Mr.
Church	PERSON	tells them , they are not easily forgotten .

		They grow to be real ; we live with them , they have an actuality more precious to us than that of the common - place people who walk the streets .

		And later this familiarity helps us to be appreciative of many things which might otherwise remain dark ; for the stories of
Beowulf	LOCATION	, of the Knights of the
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	, of
Sieg	ORGANIZATION	- fried and the treasure of the
Nibelungs	LOCATION	, are of the very essence of poetry and romance .

		Mr.
George Morrow	PERSON	's pictures in color are a fitting accompaniment to the tales .

		Mr.
William H. Babcock	PERSON	has founded a romance upon the life of
King Arthur	PERSON	in '' Cian of the Chariots '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a fine rich story , and the style is pic - turesque .

		There is hardly less romance in some events of our own time as described in '' A Gunner Aboard the Yankee '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is edited by Mr.
H. H. Lewis	PERSON	from the diary of '' Number Five of the After Port Gun , '' and Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	has honored it with an introduction .

		Number Five is one of the
New York	LOCATION	Naval Reserves , and he not only knows how to fight but he knows how to write a lively and entertaining narrative .

		Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	also writes of the Spanish war in '' The First Cruiser Out '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- , a vigorous tale in which some Cuban women act an important part . ''

		Visitors at
Grampus Island	LOCATION	'' and `` The Tale of an Oar '' are printed in the same book , and Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	's name is a guarantee of good quality A life of '' Fridtjof Nansen '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- makes a novel book for boys , and a very wholesome and stimu - lating one .

		It is written by Mr.
Jacob B. Bull	PERSON	and translated by the Rev.
Mordaunt R. Barnard	PERSON	.

		The annual bound volume of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Round Table '' is the first to appear since that popular periodical was changed from a weekly to a monthly publication , and in consequence the present volume is considerably less bulky than its predecessors .

		What is lost in size , how - ever , is more than made up in interest and value of the contents .

		The three leading serials are by Mr.
H. B. Marriott Watson	PERSON	, Mr.
Albert Lee	PERSON	, and Mr.
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	.

		In addition to these , there are innumerable short stories , and articles on travel , history , and sport , all abund - antly illustrated .

		The books that remain must be dismissed with a word , as space is exhausted , even if the enterprise of publishers is not .

		The historical stories are '' Under the Rattle - snake Flag '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
F. H. Costello	PERSON	; '' The Boys with Old Hickory '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	; '' An Island Heroine , the Story of a Daughter of the Revolution '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Mary Breck Sleight	PERSON	; and two lives of Christ which might be desirable on a desert island where no Bible could be procured : `` The Prince of Peace '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , by Mrs.
Isabella M. Alden	PERSON	, who is better known as '' Pansy , '' and `` A Life of Christ for the Young '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
George Ludington	PERSON	Weed .

		There is also a book by the late
Harold Frederic	PERSON	which deserves more than a word .

		`` The Deserter and Other Stories '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains two tales of the Civil War and two of the English War of the Roses , and there is nothing senti - mental or forced or unnatural about them .

		The heroism

		ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .


London	LOCATION	,
Dec. 3 , 1898	DATE	.

		I must ask you to give me a little more space this time than usual , for the purpose of considering some of the points raised by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, in his letter in THE DIAL of
Nov. 16	DATE	, '' traversing certain statements and opinions '' contained in a letter by me in an earlier issue .

		This '' traversing '' of my statements and opinions consists , in Sir
Walter	PERSON	's '' Notes , '' in opposing to them his own opinions .

		Let me take his first two paragraphs : -LRB- / . -RRB-

		As to copyright .

		In my letter I stated certain facts with reference to the
Committee of the House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's criticism takes the form of belittling the facts and making statements which he does not and can not prove , namely , that '' the Com - mittee of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	was appointed in order to seem to do something . ''

		-LRB- / / . -RRB-

		As to a new Copyright Bill .

		I am quite aware that '' nothing is known of the intentions of the Govern - ment , '' and I did not say anything which revealed its inten - tions .

		What Sir
Walter	PERSON	goes on to say is merely to supply considerations which had long ago been considered .

		So far on a subject that has as yet to be settled .

		Now let me take the points raised on other matters upon which the distinguished gentleman speaks as one with authority .

		I. Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	considers as contrary to fact my statement that '' the magazine has almost ousted from the attention of the reading public all books other than those of the first importance '' ; and he very ingeniously reads me as if by a magazine I meant the '' Nineteenth Century , '' '' Quarterly , '' '' Temple Bar , '' and the rest of those so-called '' high class monthlies . ''

		He states that ''
Harmsworth	PERSON	and
Pearson	PERSON	and Newnes have discovered the new mass of readers created by the School Boards '' ; that my statement is '' ridiculous '' ; and that '' those who buy these magazines have never bought books . ''

		Of course , Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	can not support one of these assertions they are simply expressions of opinion , and of opinion by one who has never been actively en - gaged either as a general publisher or bookseller .

		Now I , on the contrary , speak from experience . ''

		Readers created by the School Boards '' lived long before
Newnes	PERSON	or
Pearson	LOCATION	or
Harmsworth	LOCATION	existed .

		What did they read prior to the establishing of these firms ?

		Perhaps
Besant	PERSON	and
Rice	ORGANIZATION	's novels .

		Do they read them now ?

		The new readers are as '' amused '' and as '' excited '' by the six-penny and three-penny magazines as were the old ones by '' The Golden Butterfly '' and '' Ready Money Mortiboy . '' ''

		More books are published now than were ever known before '' because there are more clever writers than there ever were before . ''

		Libraries are springing up all over the country '' because the rate - payers prefer to buy books at a farthing in the pound tax rather than pay whole pounds to purchase them for themselves ; and , as Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	says , `` these libraries are crowded with readers of books '' a fact which booksellers know to their sorrow .

		How Sir
Walter	PERSON	can say that '' those who buy these magazines have never bought books '' is beyond my comprehension .

		Has he interviewed every one of the hundreds of thous - ands of readers of the '' Strand , '' ''
Pearson	PERSON	's , '' '' Harms - worth 's , '' and '' The Royal '' magazines , and obtained from each the exact information thus boldly asserted ?

		II .

		I still think that the publishing of the future will be in the hands of a few large syndicates , in spite of the new publishers which have started up by the dozen in the last few years ; and Sir
Walter	PERSON	's paragraph '' traversing '' this opinion of mine contains nothing which in any way touches it .

		I may say that three-fourths of the publishers cited by Sir
Walter	PERSON	'' started up '' before the sixpenny and threepenny magazines were in existence .

		As an example of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's inaccuracy of statement , I wish to point out that Rivington did not '' start afresh the next day after Longmans absorbed Rivington , '' but many years after , and that
Percival	PERSON	is not a house distinct from
Rivington	LOCATION	.

		III .

		As to the three-volume novel , I admit Sir
Walter	PERSON	speaks with some authority ; for he once published his own novels .

		I do not mean by this that his name ap - peared on the title-pages as publisher and author ; but I mean that he tried the experiment , when in literary partnership with Mr.
James Rice	PERSON	, of obtaining a pub - lisher who would receive the printed sheets and sell them on commission .

		How far the experiment suc - ceeded can best be judged from subsequent events .

		Bnt this is neither here nor there .

		Let me trace the effect of publishing a three-volume novel on the old lines in comparison with the method now pursued ; and before I proceed further let me just point out that Sir
Walter	PERSON	always talks of the '' popular author '' and draws his conclusions of profits and sales from those made by the '' great many thousand copies '' which sell of a novel by a popular author .

		Seemingly , he quite forgets about the many authors who can not be called '' popular , '' but who contribute more than do the others to make good Sir
Walter	PERSON	's own statement that '' more books are pub - lished now than were ever known before . ''

		The publisher who issued a three-volume novel was pretty sure of sales to the libraries sufficient to recoup him for his outlay in the manufacture ; for royalties ad - vanced to the author ; and for a profit to go to himself .

		If he issued twenty or thirty such novels a year , he had an income .

		Of a very popular work , as Sir
Walter	PERSON	points out , twelve hundred to eighteen hundred and even two thousand copies might have been sold .

		All the more profit , then , for the author and the publisher .

		But the writer who was not so popular almost always found a pub - lisher and almost always was assured of a certain hono - rarium .

		Of a popular author 's books , there followed cheap editions at six shillings , or three-and-six , and even two shillings , and these were pretty sure to sell largely .

		They were bought by the '' readers created by the School 472 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Boards , '' or by those otherwise created who wished to possess a copy of the work of a favorite writer , and who probably could not afford to pay for the high priced library edition .

		Of the works of the second-rate and third-rate novelists , it often happened that the publisher never issued cheap editions because he felt they would not `` pay . ''

		If he did , he brought them out as `` yellow backs . ''

		But what happens now ?

		A popular author sells in his tens of thousands in six-shilling form , while the author not so popular counts his readers in scores or at most a few hundreds .

		Editions cheaper than the six - shilling editions have been practically abolished since they did not '' pay , '' and now that the more esteemed works of the better known writers have been published at sixpence , in rivalry of the sixpenny magazine , there is still less excuse for bringing out cheap editions of second and third-rate novelists .

		It comes to this : that the aboli - tion of the three-volume novel has practically ruined the chances of the second-rate and third-rate authors , who now feel that they must either accept ludicrously small 41 advances '' or be satisfied with the public and income which they obtain from '' serialising '' their stories .

		Pub - lishers are becoming more and more chary about '' touch - ing '' fiction .

		The popular author swallows up the profits ; the others are not worth the trouble expended on them .

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	says '' a great many novels are published which bring in nothing ; but they ought not to have been published at all . ''

		What does he mean by this ?

		Does he mean to say that Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's '' Far from the Madding Crowd , '' Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	's `` The Egoist , ''
Emily Bronte	PERSON	's `` Wuthering Heights , '' and others , should never have been published ?

		Certainly , these on their first editions brought nothing either to anthor or publisher .

		If his remark does not include this meaning , it contains very little for serious consideration .

		Publishers who show Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	returns of sales which amount to a great many thousand copies have their own reason for giving him the information .

		I am con - tent to let the relative values of publishing novels at thirty-one-and-six and at six shillings be judged from the sales of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's own books .

		Let Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	publish the actual sales in the British Isles of bis latest novel , '' The Changeling , '' side by side with the sales of '' All Sorts and Conditions of Men '' in three - volume and six-shilling forms ; and I feel assured that the result of the comparison will bear out my original statement TEMPLE SCOTT .

		The biogra - phy is such a chronicle of French home life as seldom finds its way into type , for
Daudet	ORGANIZATION	's house was his work - shop , wherein the services of all the inmates were his to command . ''

		My Brother and I , '' which is included in the same volume , is said to equal in interest the pictures of
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	given in his son 's work . ''

		The Home Life of Great Authors , '' published over ten years ago by Mrs.

		A companion volume , compiled upon the same plan , and called '' Personal Sketches of Recent Authors '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- has just been issued , and deserves a word of praise , both for its pleasant manner of narration and for the exceptionally good photographs which have been chosen to illustrate it .

		Mastodon tusks are found , extinct volcanoes discovered , caves fallen into , and all sorts of excit - ing happenings take place ... but it is also filled to the brim with information about the country , its customs , and history . ''

		... But ' Exiled for Lese Majest4 ' is , above all things , a story , and an exciting story at that .

		The incidents out of which it is woven are dramatic .

		The characters have many narrow escapes and thrilling adventures .

		The flight from the prison , the descent of the
Lena	PERSON	, and the many subsequent perils of the personages in whose fortunes the author has en - listed our sympathy are so vividly depicted that the reader finds himself in a sort of mental race , and so absorbed in these children of the imagination that he can not lay the book down . ' '

		`` BOB , SON OF BATTLE . ''

		T ITERAEY editors are the most difficult j class of people to interest in new novels : they have to review stupid ones till they get weary of the whole thing .

		Moreover , this is the season when the re - viewer grows dizzy with the rush of new books demanding attention .

		Yet we have received from the literary editors of two large news - papers letters inspired by their enthusiasm for ''
Bob	PERSON	, Son of Battle '' -LRB- a novel by a new writer ,
Alfred Ollivant	PERSON	-RRB- , which went to them in the ordinary routine .

		The letters come from
Maryland	LOCATION	and
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia .

		Both say the story is so remarkable that the writers wish to know if other people have appreciated it as they have .

		That the latter are beginning to do so is shown by the fact that a second edition of five thousand copies has just been printed .

		We 'd like to send you a copy of the book , postpaid , on approval .

		An interesting historical account of British Radicalism of the first half of the century fills a large part of the volume ... On the whole , we are able to praise the volume as a moderate and impartial view of the demo - cratixation of the Constitution Athenaeum .

		In dealing with his subject Mr.
Rose	PERSON	displays considerable independence of thought , joined to accuracy of detail and clearness of exposition .

		His style , too , is vigorous ; and on the whole he has made a good start for what promises to be a useful and instructive series .

		Mr.

John Bright	PERSON	, as far as possible , to speak for himself , and he has shown great discrimination in the selection of pithy typical passages from memorable speeches at critical junctures in the
Queen	LOCATION	's reign .

		Speaker .

		An excellent little life of Bright , with a chapter on Bright 's oratory which is admirable and most remarkable .

		It constitutes a brief but careful examination of the characteristics which made Bright the first orator of our time , and appears to us the best examination of the peculiarities of modern English oratory extant .

		Athtnceum .

		This little book seems to us , in its way , a remarkable success .

		It is a model of what such a sketch should be sober , well - written , with the matter well-ordered , and throughout a tone of judicial care not unmixed with enthusiasm .

		A cademy .

		Mr.
Vince	PERSON	's biography of Bright is a model of its kind .

		Extracts from the Preface : '' In presenting a memoir of
Robert	LOCATION	,
Earl Nugent	PERSON	, my purpose is rather to introduce his transactions with men whose names have become famous in history than to give a biography of the man himself .

		... It would be quite easy to represent him as a monster of profligacy ; it would not be difficult to picture him in the light of a large-minded , liberal , and judicious politician of high statesmanlike qualities .

		He has been virulently attacked , .

		__ _ _ _ , r ^ m. TT < koth on * ne mora ^ and * ne political side ; but there is considerable ground r ~ ^ ^ \ | c I ^ | ^ LJCj.bI ^ 1 ^ or sus pi c i n tk a t * ne onslaught on his morals was prompted by a desire ' to injure him as a politician .

		... It is in the letters that I venture to believe the main interest will be found .

		That is to say , not in
Nugent	PERSON	himself so much as in those brilliant and distinguished men with whom he was associated .

		The mere mention of the names of Pope ,

The history of his marriages is a remarkable one , and it is not surprising that ' his skill in marrying rich widows ' should have excited unfriendly comment ... There was also another side to
Robert Nugent	PERSON	's character .

		He was a poet , a bon vivant , and a wit . ''

		This book , which is not a translation , but an original work , is composed , as the title indicates , of three parts , each separate and complete in itself .

JEANNE G. PENNINGTON	PERSON	, Compiler of '' Do n't Worry '' Nuggets .

		`` The prelude gives a scene in a hospital office , on the arrival of a package of books for the entertainment of patients , which not only have been read but show underlined passages here and there .

		The effect of these ' marked passages ' on certain dramatically pictured cases among the patients gives opportunity for some keen study of human nature , and especially of mental pathology .

		The stories are of a curi - ous interest strong , clear , often pathetic , even tragic , and not without a subtle humor which adds to their attractiveness . ''
