		26 THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOOKS .

		Once more the plaint of the bookseller is heard in the land , and one would be indeed stony-hearted who could view his condition without concern .

		His occupation is slipping from him , through the action of irresistible economic laws , and the thoughtless public pays little heed to his plight .

		The great dealers in miscellaneous merchandise are slowly but surely absorbing the retail trade in books , and , not content to supply the customers who can come to their vast stores , are reaching out , by adver - tisements and other devices , to get possession of the customers who have hitherto supported the booksellers of the smaller towns .

		The old - fashioned type of bookseller is by way of join - ing the dodo and the megathesium , just as the old-fashioned college president , and the all - around lawyer , and the general medical prac - titioner , are passing from the places that soon shall know them no more .

		It is a melancholy sight for those who cling to old ways and old institutions , but '' there is no help for these things , '' as the poet has it , and we must learn to adapt ourselves to the new conditions .

		The quiet and venerable scholar who formerly ruled over his college as a world apart has given place to the energetic young man of business instincts and capacity for advertising his institution ; the professional man in whose hands you once placed your case , whatever it might be , with confidence that he would know how to deal with it , has given place to the specialist who nine times out of ten would n't understand your case at all .

		And , coming to the point of our pres - ent theme , the bookseller who used to think fifty per cent not too large a profit upon his wares , considering that he offered as a bonus his good advice and genial friendship , has given place to the merchant who can wax fat upon ten per cent , or less , of profit , but is too busy to have either advice or friendship to spare for you .

		It is evident that the entire business of the distribution of books is just now in a transition state , and that its immediate condition is dis - tressing , or at least has distressing features , to the more conservative and thoughtful part of the public .

		We are inclined to believe , as will be suggested later on , that this transition state 6 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, is not altogether unpromising for the future , and that the outcome may be of a nature not inimical to the best interests of culture .

		But the present condition of affairs is an unques - tionable hardship for the bookseller , who is a middleman , and who is bound to suffer from the , general and undiscriminating onslaught upon middlemen which is characteristic of the existing economic situation .

		As the organiza - tion of business becomes more and more com - plete , it is inevitable that the profits of the middleman should be reduced , and the more compact social arrangements toward which we are tending must mean for the bookseller , as for so many others , a sharper struggle for ex - istence than he has heretofore been called upon to make .

		One of the experiments most ominous to the bookseller is that recently made by a pub - lishing house which advertises broadcast its willingness to send any of its publications to any address upon the receipt of a postal card re - quest , trusting to the honesty of the prospective purchaser either to return the book or to pay for it .

		This plan shows a remarkable confi - dence in human nature at least in the human nature of the book-buying public and we shall be much interested to learn how successful it proves .

		Its general adoption by publishers would tend to eliminate retail bookselling from the list of business occupations .

		Still another experiment of which the bookseller makes com - plaint is that of selling books of the more ex - pensive sort upon the instalment plan , the entire work being delivered upon receipt of the order and the first payment .

		This method of depleting the book-buyer 's purse has long found favor with the publishers of works sold by subscription , and now certain publishers of the regular sort seem inclined to see what they can do with it .

		Such experiments as these , and others that might be mentioned , are extremely interesting to the economist , and both interest - ing and enjoyable to those tradesmen who profit by them directly , but they are '' death to the frogs , '' who may be excused for croaking rather more vociferously than usual at the ingenious devices of which they are victims .

		Still another onslaught upon the bookseller 's peace of mind , an onslaught so unexpected and so startling that it left him gasping for breath , was that made a few months ago by
Librarian Dewey	PERSON	, who calmly proposed that the public libraries throughout the country should become book-selling as well as book-circulating agen - cies .

		In other words , he proposed to sweep the private bookseller out of existence as completely as his namesake swept out of existence the Spanish fleet at
Manila	LOCATION	.

		Booksellers have always looked askance at public libraries , not understanding how they create an appetite for reading that is sure in the end to redound to the bookseller 's advantage , but their suspicious fears never anticipated the explosion in their camp of such a bombshell as this .

		Fortunately for them , the suggestion was not taken very seriously by those to whom it was made , its flavor of state socialism being too strong for the public mind , even in the lax and receptive con - dition to which that mind has become reduced of recent years .

		If the state or the municipality were to go into the business of selling books at cost , what should prevent it from doing the like with groceries ?

		All these insidious devices for supplanting the bookseller must be met , if they are to be met at all , by the more effective organization of his trade .

		The most promising suggestion put for - ward in his behalf has been `` made in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' or rather practised there , and explained to En - glish readers by Professor
J. G. Robertson	PERSON	in a recent number of '' Literature . '' ''

		So com - plete is the organization , '' we are informed , of the German retail bookselling trade , '' that a publisher can rely on having whatever special treatises he may undertake to publish brought directly under the eyes of every scholar in the country who is in the least likely to become a purchaser , and this without any trouble or expense for advertising on his part .

		Every retail bookseller , even in the smallest German town , is , thanks to the excellence of the German system , in a position to send , and , as a matter of course , does send , his customers copies on approbation -LRB- Exemplare zur Ansicht -RRB- of all new books in which they are interested . ''

		Com - pare such a practice with that of the American bookseller , whose utmost effort in this direction is to send to his customers a classified list of all the publications of the month , leaving the cus - tomers to hunt out the titles that seem attract - ive , and to order the books on the chances of their proving satisfactory .

		If our booksellers would cooperate in such fashion as this with our publishers , there would be small danger of the publishers ' resorting to ingenious methods for the elimination of the booksellers from the field of competition .

		Or rather , there would no longer be any real competition between the two classes , but a relation of mutual helpfulness that would impel each of them to cherish the interests of the other .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 7 We said , early in this discussion , that the future of bookselling does not seem to us , on the whole , unpromising .

		Beyond such special suggestions , as have already been made and that might be made , looking toward an improved organization and a closer cooperation , there is the broad general fact that the appetite for books is constantly growing among our popu - lation .

		The increasing importance of books as a part of the household furnishings is a phenom - enon that can not fail to attract the attention of all observers .

		The sort of household that , a generation ago , had only a few nondescript vol - umes piled away upon the shelf of some closet now has a neat and well-filled bookcase .

		The household that then had a few shelves now has as many cases .

		They may be cheap books but books they are and the proportion among them of really good literature is surprising .

		This seems to be an entirely natural develop - ment , and the time is coming when reading - matter will be as staple a commodity as gro - ceries , and as necessary for the daily needs .

		Nor will these needs be supplied , in the long run , by newspapers and magazines , or by the providence of the public libraries .

		These things merely create an appetite which nothing but books can eventually satisfy .

		It is folly , then , to assume that bookstores will be lacking to satisfy this appetite for the possession of liter - ature , since the book - buyer , as a rule , wants to inspect his books before buying , and the retail trade in books is as sure of customers as the retail trade in eggs and poultry .

		That trade , we have not the least doubt , will emerge tri - umphant from its seeming temporary eclipse , but it will be adapted to the new conditions , it will be reorganized to meet the new demands , and it will be willing to find in its larger sales a compensation for its lessened percentage of profit .

		EDWARD GAY
MASON	PERSON	.

		In the death of
Edward Gay Mason	ORGANIZATION	, on the eighteenth of
December	DATE	, THE DIAL lost a valued contributor , and
Chicago	LOCATION	one of its most distin - guished citizens .

		Men of his type are not common in any community , and are rare indeed in such a place as
Chicago	LOCATION	, where the hitherto all-important spirit of commercialism is but just beginning to recognize the claims of other than business interests upon the life of man .

		It was in this city that Mr.
Mason	PERSON	, a native of
Connecticut	LOCATION	, lived for nearly forty of the best years of the fifty-nine allotted him .

		And it is this city alone that realizes to the full the loss that comes from his untimely taking-off .

		The outside world heard of him from time to time as an eminent lawyer , as a member of the governing body of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, and as a specialist in American history .

		Chicago knew - him continuously and intimately , as the active friend of all worthy enterprises , as an intel - lectual force in the society of which he was a part , as a good citizen in the highest sense of the term .

		As a leader of the
Chicago	LOCATION	bar , as a controlling spirit in the higher club life of the city , as a brilliant public speaker upon occasions both formal and informal , his memory will fade as those who knew him in these activities pass from the stage .

		But one monument , at least , remains to keep his memory green and that is the impressive building of the
Chicago Histori	LOCATION	-
cal Society	ORGANIZATION	, which , with its rich collection of books and manuscripts , of portraits and autographs , relat - ing to the early
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, is a memorial of his zeal as a collector , his enthusiasm as a student , and his power to enlist the aid of his fellows in giving per - manent embodiment to a fine conception .

		He was by no means the only man deserving of remembrance in this connection , but for a score of years past his was the leading spirit in the common endeavor of the members of the Society to bring together for future historians the mass of material now contained within the fine structure in
Dearborn Avenue	LOCATION	.

		Since the Society had , upon two occasions in its earlier days , lost all of its collections by fire , he was determined to make a third disaster of the sort impossible , and it was due to his insistence upon Ibis point that the permanent home of the organization is a building into whose construction nothing combustible enters , a building fireproof in the literal sense of the word .

		As a writer , Mr.
Mason	PERSON	never found time to do the work that it was in him to perform .

		His publica - tions take the fugitive form of such papers and pamphlets as '' The
March	DATE	of the Spaniards across
Illinois	LOCATION	, '' `` Old Fort Chartres , '' `` Illinois in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' ''
Kaskaskia	LOCATION	and its Parish Records , '' and many other titles .

		Some years ago he was commissioned by
Messrs. Houghton , Miffiin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	to write the history of '' Illinois '' for the '' American Commonwealths '' series , and accepted the task .

		No man was better equipped for this work , and it is cause for deep regret that he should not have lived to complete it .

		A portion of the manuscript exists , and it is possible that the work is sufficiently advanced to make its completion by another hand a work of no great difficulty .

		If this be the case , no time should be lost in carrying out the plan , and in utilizing whatever it still be possible to utilize of the material collected by him .

		If , more particularly , the portion of the work substantially completed covers the early period of
Illinois	LOCATION	history , with which no other man was so competent to deal , it should not be a matter of great difficulty to supply chapters upon the later period , and thus bring the work down to our own times .

		The performance of this task would be the best possible service to his memory , besides making an important contribution to Amer - ican historical literature .

		THE PROPOSED GOETHE MONUMENT IN
STRASSBURG	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The year
1899	DATE	brings with it the 150th anniversary of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		An influential German committee , under the protectorate of the Grand Duke
Carl Alex	PERSON	- ander of
Weimar	LOCATION	, has invited not only the inhabitants of
Alsace	LOCATION	, German students , and patriotic Germans in general , but also people of culture everywhere who acknowledge a debt to the great author , to lend their aid toward erecting a statue of '' the young Goethe '' in
Strassburg	LOCATION	.

		The project is progressing steadily , and already more than 12,000 marks have been subscribed in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Many Americans recall with great pleasure the very active interest and participation shown by a number of the most influential professors and scholars of
Berlin	LOCATION	last year at the time when our students instituted a celebra - tion of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's birthday , an interest which carried the project to a distinct success which it could not have hoped for otherwise .

		Doubtless many who have responded to the idyllic charm of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's imperishable Sesenheim idyl , who recall that ''
Goetz	PERSON	'' and '' Faust '' were planned while the poet was a student at
Strassburg	LOCATION	, and who have had pleasure in his delightful descriptions of that city and
Alsace	LOCATION	, will be glad to add some share to the noble and substantial tribute which is to be erected .

		To give Americans this opportunity , an
American committee	ORGANIZATION	has been named , to assist in making the plan known , and to receive any contributions , however small , which are in - spired by the idea .

		The committee consists of Professor
Kuno Francke	PERSON	of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Horatio S. White	PERSON	of
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, and the undersigned .

		Contributions can be sent directly to any member of the committee , or to Messrs.

		A STATESMAN 'S RETROSPECT .

		*
Bismarck	PERSON	's autobiography , at last before us , is a better book than Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's discouraging forecast led us to expect .

		Doubtless
Busch	PERSON	foresaw in it , or fancied that he foresaw , a dangerous rival of his own performance ; and , not being bred in a school of over-scrupulosity , he did not hesitate to brand by innuendo the impending competitor in advance as a dull book .

		He might have spared himself the trouble .

		The work is of a quite different cast and genre from his own racy and scandal - mongering volumes , and so is not likely to enter into , or at least to remain long in , competition with them .

		One can not imagine Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	writing an autobiography , however good , that would have supplanted
Boswell	PERSON	's book ; and what
Boswell	PERSON	did for the lexicographer ,
Busch	PERSON	has done , in a comparatively limited way of course , for the great Chancellor .

		Bismarck 's book is essentially one for the student of po - litical history , who wants clews and explana - tions , and cares little for the lighter matters of personality and anecdote .

		It is a complete key to the Bismarckian system of politics -LRB- it a scheme so tempered or alloyed with opportun - ism can properly be called a system -RRB- , as car - ried into practice during the period of its hold - er 's ascendency in Prussian counsels .

		There need in the future be no debate as to why the masterful Chancellor acted so or so in this or that important political juncture .

		Such doubts are now solved for us in the most authoritative way .

		Of narrative proper the autobiography contains but little .

		It presupposes in the reader a competent knowledge of the events of which it supplies , in so far as the author 's own share in them went , the rationale .

		Those who look to it mainly for the spectacle of a discarded and embittered statesman indulging his turn for satire at the expense of his whilom foes will be disappointed .

		Compared with
Busch	PERSON	's examples of the Chancellor 's ordinary manner of speech , these two volumes seem even elabo - rately circumspect in phrase and temperate in judgment .

		What the deferred third and con - cluding volume , in which the present Emperor is to be brought upon the scene , may develop , *
BISMARCK	LOCATION	, the Man and the Statesman : Being the Re - flections and Reminiscences of Otto ,
Prince von Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	.

		Written and dictated by himself .

		Translated from the Ger - man under the supervision of
A. J. Butler	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , with portraits .


New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 9 we can only conjecture .

		But in the present instalment of the memoirs there seems to be little that ''
Herr Lehmann	PERSON	'' himself , the touchiest of created mortals -LRB- if one may ven - ture to call Him mortal -RRB- can take umbrage at which must be a comfort to the judicious editor ,
Herr Kohl	PERSON	.

		In his youth
Bismarck	PERSON	did not altogether escape the liberal contagion , then in the air , and he had brought away with him from the preparatory school , which was conducted on
Jahn	PERSON	's principles , certain German-National im - pressions on which , he says , '' I lived from my sixth to my twelfth year . ''

		These impressions remained in the stage of theoretical reflections , his historical and innate sympathies leaning to the side of authority as embodied in the Prussian monarchy .

		Nevertheless , on entering the
University	ORGANIZATION	, he joined a students ' corps whose watchword was German nationalism .

		Mingled with the Germanism of these young men , however , were certain social and political extravagances not so much to the taste of the well-born Prussian Junker , on whose nerves , too , the under-bred ways of his democratically minded associates grated .

		Their ideas gave him a lasting impression of an '' association between Utopian theories and defective breed - ing . ''

		But he managed to retain a sound leaven of practical National sentiment , and a belief that events would lead in the not remote future to German unity . ''

		I made , '' he says , '' a bet with my American friend Coffin that this aim would be attained in twenty years . ''

		Bismarck 's always modest stock of liberalism was percep - tibly lessened by the
Frankfort	LOCATION	riot of
1833	DATE	, and dwindled to a for the time quite negligible quantity when the tocsin of actual revolution affrighted
Berlin	LOCATION	in the
March days of 1848	DATE	.

		The Prussian capital , which once cowered under the rattan stick of a decrepit and half-crazy tyrant , now fairly took the bit in its teeth , and seemed , while the fit was on , not unlikely to furnish a clumsy German analogue of the
Paris	LOCATION	drama of
' 89	DATE	.

		The part enacted by
Bismarck	PERSON	in that momentous year is well known .

		The course he favored as against the riotous Ber - liners is well indicated in the marginal note made by the King against his name in a list of suggested Councillors : '' Only to be employed when the bayonet governs unrestricted . ''

		A conversation
Bismarck	PERSON	had with the
King	ORGANIZATION	in
June	DATE	at Sans-Souci is worth recording : '' After dinner the
King	PERSON	took me onto the terrace , and asked me in a friendly way : ' How are you getting on ? '

		In the irritable state I had been in ever since the
March days	DATE	, I replied : ` Badly . '

		The
King	PERSON	said : ' I think the feeling is good in your parts . '

		Thereupon , under the impression made by some regulations , the contents of which I do not remember , I replied : ' The feeling was very good , but since we have been inocu - lated with the revolution by the
King	ORGANIZATION	's officials under the royal sign-manual , it has become bad .

		What we lack is confidence in the support of the
King	LOCATION	. '

		At that moment the Queen stepped out from the shrubbery and said : ' How can you speak so to the
King	LOCATION	. '

		` Let me alone ,
Elise	PERSON	, ' replied the King , ' I shall soon settle his business ' ; and turning to me , he said : ` What do you really reproach me with , then ? ' '

		The evacuation of
Berlin	LOCATION	. ' '

		I did not want it done , ' replied the King ; and the Queen , who had remained within hearing , added : ' Of that the
King	ORGANIZATION	is quite innocent .

		He had not slept for three days . '

		A King ought to be able to sleep , ' I replied .

		Unmoved by this blunt remark , the
King	PERSON	said : ' It is always easier to prophesy when you know .

		What would be gained if I admitted that I had behaved like a donkey ?

		Something more than reproaches is needed to set an overturned throne up again .

		To do that I need assistance and active devotion , not criticism ? '

		The kindness with which he said all this , and more to the same effect , overpowered me .

		I had come in the spirit of afrondeur , who would not have cared if he had been dismissed ungraciously ; I went away completely dis - armed and won over . ''

		In his interesting chapter setting forth the opinions he held and the course he advocated as to the conduct of the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	,
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck states that in the
Council of War Roon	ORGANIZATION	was the only supporter of his view that the sur - render of the city should be forced at once by a bombardment .

		The slower '' method of fam - ine '' -LRB- as being the '' humaner '' one -RRB- found powerful support '' in the circles where exalted ladies met , '' and where '' philanthropic hypoc - risy , '' harping on the `` English catchwords ' Humanity and Civilization , ' '' held sway .

		The intervention of neutrals , taking the form of a congress which in the name of justice and mod - eration should rob
Germany	LOCATION	of the substantial fruits of victory , was what
Bismarck	PERSON	dreaded .

		He accordingly reversed his moderate counsels of
1866	DATE	, and pressed for vigorous action .

		His opinion , backed by
Roon	PERSON	, prevailed ; and with the bombardment of
Mont Avron	PERSON	came the be - ginning of the end .

		Bismarck 's reflections on these matters are characteristic : `` In setting one 's - self the question as to what can have induced other generals to oppose
Roon	PERSON	's view , it is difficult to discover any technical reasons for the de - lay in the measures taken towards the close of the year ... The notion that
Paris	LOCATION	, although fortified and the strongest bulwark of our opponents , might not be attacked in the same way as any other fortress had been imported into our camp from
England	LOCATION	by the roundabout route of
Berlin	LOCATION	, together with the phrase about the ' Mecca of civilization , ' and other expressions of human - itarian feeling rife and effective in the cant of English public opinion a feeling which
England	ORGANIZATION	expects other Powers to respect , though she does not always allow 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, her opponents to have the benefit of it .

		It was from
London	LOCATION	that representations were received in our most influential circles that the capitulation of
Paris	LOCATION	ought not to be brought about by bombardment , but only by hunger ... Trustworthy information from
Berlin	LOCATION	ap - prised me that the cessation of our activity gave rise to anxiety and dissatisfaction in expert circles , and that
Queen Augusta	PERSON	was said to be influencing her royal hus - band by letters , in the interests of humanity .

		An allu - sion to information of this kind which I made to the
King	ORGANIZATION	occasioned a violent outburst of anger , not to the effect that the rumors were untrue , but in a sharp rep - rimand against the utterance of any such dissatisfaction respecting the Queen . ''

		Discussing universal suffrage
Bismarck	PERSON	avers the principle to be a just one , not only in theory but also in practice , '' provided always that vot - ing be not secret , for secresy is a quality incom - patible with the best characteristics of German blood '' : '' The influences and the dependence on others that the practical life of man brings in its train are God-given re - alities which we can not and must not ignore .

		If we refuse to transfer them to political life , and base the public life of the country on the belief in the secret insight of all , we fall into a contradiction between public law and the realities of human life which practically leads to constant frictions , and finally to an explosion , and to which there is no theoretical solution except in the way of the insani - ties of social-democracy , the support given to which rests on the fact that the judgment of the masses is sufficiently stultified and undeveloped to allow them , with the assist - ance of their own greed , to be continually caught by the rhetoric of clever and ambitious leaders .

		... A state , the control of which lies in the hands of the greedy , of the novarum rerum cupidi , and of orators who have the capac - ity for deceiving the unreasoning masses in a higher degree than others , will constantly be doomed to a rest - lessness of development , which so ponderous a mass as the commonwealth of the state can not follow with injury to its organism . ''

		The Chancellor 's satiric turn peeps out occa - sionally , as in his references to Gortchakoff : '' His subordinates in the ministry said of Gortchakoff : < II se mire dans son encrier , ' just as
Bettina	PERSON	used to say of her brother-in-law ,
Savigny	LOCATION	, He can not cross a gutter without looking at himself in it . '

		... When he dictated he used to take a regular pose , which he introduced with the word ' ecrivez ' !

		and if the secretary thoroughly ap - preciated his position he turned at particularly well - rounded phrases an admiring glance on his chief , who was very sensible to it . ''

		When
Gortchakoff	PERSON	accepted the presidency of the diplomatic conference at
Berlin	LOCATION	in
May , 1876	DATE	,
Bismarck	PERSON	relates that during the delivery of the presidential address * ' I wrote in pencil : ' Pompous , pompo , pomp , pom , po . '

		My neighbor ,
Lord Odo Russell	PERSON	, snatched the paper from me and kept it . ''

		A striking anecdote is told of Emperor
Nicholas	PERSON	of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Bismarck had it from
Frederick William IV.	PERSON	: '' The Emperor
Nicholas	PERSON	asked him to send two cor - porals of the Prussian guard for the purpose of per - forming a certain massage treatment prescribed by the doctors , which was to be carried out on the back of the patient while he lay on his stomach .

		He added : I can always manage my Russians when I can look them in the face , but on my back and without eyes , I should not like them to come near me . '

		The corporals were sent confidentially , and were employed and handsomely paid .

		This shows how , in spite of the religious devotion of the Russian people to their Czar , the Emperor
Nicholas	PERSON	did not absolutely trust his personal safety in a tete-a-tete even to the ordinary man among his subjects ; and it is a sign of great strength of character that up to the end of his life he did not allow himself to be depressed by these feelings . ''

		The impression of Bismarck that one gathers from these volumes quite bears out the
Gladston	PERSON	- ian verdict : '' A big man , but very unscrupu - lous . ''

		They fail to disclose , so far as we can dis - cern , a single distinctive humane , amiable trait on the part of their author .

		It was in his time , and apparently still is , to the advantage of
Prussia	LOCATION	that the guidance of her affairs fell into the powerful hands of this Colossus .

		So far she has been a great gainer , in prestige at least ; and in this gain the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	has shared .

		But there are nevertheless those who maintain that the cynically confessed unscrupulosity with which the Chancellor sought and gained his ends will bear its natural fruit in the fulness of time ; and that as those who live by the sword shall perish by the sword , so a political struc - ture welded through '' blood and iron '' is shad - owed by no uncertain Nemesis .

		The powerful bond of the common danger that lowers over
Germany	LOCATION	from the North and the South once removed , the formal federal tie may prove to be a rope of sand .

		Dynastic jealousies , reli - gious differences , inbred sectional patriotisms far more intense and deeply rooted than the
State	ORGANIZATION	sentiment that once threatened to wreck our own
Federal Union	ORGANIZATION	, are centrifugal forces constantly tending to drag the still sovereign German states from their new orbit ; and that the spectre of '' Particularism '' will not down was forcibly shown only the other day by the petty but significant Lippe-Detmold incident .

		The smallest German house refuses to be dra - gooned in respect of its own local and dynastic concerns by the Emperor ; and the larger ones , glad of an opportunity to indirectly assert their own dignities , ostentatiously support the recal - citrant , to the infinite chagrin of the Hallowed Person at
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		We can not unreservedly praise the present translation of this important work , nor can we accept as a sufficient excuse for its imperfec - tions the English editor 's statement that the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 work was '' produced under severe pressure of time . ''

		Mechanically the volumes are satisfac - tory , though we notice a few misprints , notably an absurd one -LRB- '' Ylarr '' for Year -RRB- in the
Table of Contents	ORGANIZATION	of the opening volume .

		There are a brace of fine portraits of the Chancellor , and a specimen leaf of his handwriting .

		E G SOME RECENT ILLUSTRATIONS OF SHAKESPEARE .

		* In his introduction to the last book on our present list , Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	expresses the opinion that most intelligent people are acquainted with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	chiefly through the half-dozen plays that are commonly put upon the stage .

		This view has been often expressed , notably by
Robert Browning	PERSON	in one of his epilogues : '' For see your cellarage !

		There are forty barrels with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's brand .

		Some five or six are abroach : the rest Stand spigoted , fauceted .

		Try and test What yourselves call of the very best !

		How comes it that still untouched they stand ?

		Why do n't you try tap , advance a stage With the rest in cellarage ? ''

		It was in
1876	DATE	that this taunt , which then had , doubtless , the sting of truth , was flung at the British public .

		Since then , what battalions of annotated editions of the plays , bristling with scholastic weapons , have been thrown forward in support of the supremacy of Shakespeare ! ''

		Advanced in view they stand a horrid front Of dreadful length '' Truly '' the kingdom of heaven suffereth vio - lence '' ; and there is a certain mournful justice in the circumstance that one of the most promi - nent leaders in this attempt to force special scholarship upon a bewildered public should now admit by implication the defeat of the enterprise .

		I would not be understood as dis - paraging the labors of so excellent a Shake - pearian as Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	.

Rolfe	PERSON	avers that the majority of cultivated people who fancy they know
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	well `` have only a smattering of this education , '' we understand what the standard of judgment is .

		Few persons , indeed , are in readiness to sub - mit to an English civil-service examination in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, or , what amounts to the same thing , to such a test as Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	would impose .

		It is likewise probable that few intelligent Greeks of the time of Pericles could have passed such an examination in Homer as a modern pro- fessor would exact .

		But unless some signs fail , popular interest in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is steadily widening , and with that interest Shakespeare scholarship itself is sus - taining a healthy growth .

		Of the many signs that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	appeals now to the popular mind and heart more widely than ever before , I instance only the immediate and enormous success of the beautiful ''
Temple Edition	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Attractive to the eye , seductive to the touch , provided with all necessary and no superfluous apparatus , this edition captivates learned and unlearned alike .

		It has been argued plausibly , but , I think , paradoxically , that the success is due to the outward form of these dainty little volumes .

		Any well-bound edition in tall vol - umes makes , however , a greater show in the library .

		The ''
Temple Edition	ORGANIZATION	, '' being handy to carry to the fireside , to the brookside , or to bed , appeals to the appetite of the actual reader .

		Of the spread of Shakespeare scholarship , in the best sense , the progress of the magnum opus of Dr.
Furness	PERSON	is a cheering sign .

		That the '' New Variorum Shakespeare '' is one of the signal monuments of American scholarship was long ago agreed by those qualified to judge , at home and abroad .

		In relation to the plays whereof they treat , these noble volumes are a veritable library , '' The best that has been thought and said in the world '' on these sub - jects .

		A brief recapitulation of the history of this great work may be of interest .

		The ten plays thus far edited , with the dates of publica - tion , are as follows : Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	-LRB- 1871 -RRB- , Macbeth -LRB- 1873 -RRB- , Hamlet -LRB- 2 vols. , 1877 -RRB- ,
King Lear	PERSON	-LRB- 1880 -RRB- , Othello -LRB- 1886 -RRB- , The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	-LRB- 1888 -RRB- , As You Like It -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , The Tempest -LRB- 1892 -RRB- , A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream -LRB- 1895 -RRB- , The
Winter	DATE	's Tale -LRB- 1898 -RRB- .

		It will be noticed that , except in the cases of Hamlet and Othello , these editions have followed one another quite regularly at inter - vals of two or three years .

		In the cases of the first four plays , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	followed the tra - ditional practice of editors in presenting us with 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, a text of his own .

		Beginning with Othello , he introduced a notable innovation , from which he has not since seen reason to swerve .

		This inno - vation consisted in the reprint , line for line , word for word , letter for letter , point for point , error for error , of the text of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, with all its imperfections on its head .

		The inno - vation had the boldness as well as the simplicity of genius , and has amply justified itself .

		It is not too much to say that this is one of the most valuable features of the great work , although the earlier volumes , which lacked this feature , were sufficient to win for the author recognition as one of the first Shakespearians of the world .

		In an edition which gives on every page a con - spectus of all the variant readings , and which is intended solely for the student , there is indeed no reason why an original text should not be lit - erally reprinted .

		Yet such is the force of custom and opinion that it was only after he had spent years upon the work and had completed the edition of four of the most important plays , that Dr.
Furness	PERSON	came to see what now , partly by virtue of his example , seems so obvious .

		This edition of the
Winter	ORGANIZATION	's Tale contains then , first , a minutely accurate reprint of the text of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1623 -RRB- , in the case of this play , the earliest known text .

		Fortunately , in spite of the compression of the style , frequently amounting to crabbeduess , the text is unusually accurate , presenting almost none of the cruces which are the despair of the reader and the opportunity of the commentator .

		The commen - tators have , however , not allowed themselves to be discouraged by so small a circumstance ; Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's citations from them indicate that they have been as busy over this play as over some of those whose texts are less pure .

		The most apposite comments of all the editors are cited in chronological order , the banquet being frequently sauced with excellent foolery which is none the less entertaining for being so seriously meant .

		Over all , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	presides with wis - dom , moderation , and an unfailing good-temper , which contrasts wholesomely with the '' savage and tartar ly '' tone of some of the eighteenth - century editors , while not excluding a vein of delightful irony .

		A marked feature of the en - tire work , from first to last , is the growing con - fidence of the modest editor in his own judgment .

		In the later volumes he more frequently cuts short the droning commentators and gives us of his own , but never a word too much .

		Surely Dr.
Furness	PERSON	is the most genial of editors ; and I think it not too much to add that he is for the most part the most convincing .

		Unlike Homer , he never nods ; at least , after communing with him for several years I have never caught him napping .

		His fault is of an opposite character , and might be said to be a fault that leans to virtue 's side : namely , supersubtlety .

		The acute - ness that renders him formidable in detecting the fallacies of other commentators sometimes makes him over-ingenious in his own interpre - tations .

		It is the defect of his quality .

		Inas - much as his criticism of his venerated author is habitually constructive , this subtlety spends itself in the discovery of possible meanings , and is never seriously misleading .

		In many cases in which the commentators with their darkness do affront
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's light , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	scatters the fog in a masterly way .

		Take for example the passage from Her - mione 's last speech at the trial , thought by Hudson to be '' the solidest piece of eloquence in the language '' : * `` Now -LRB- my
Liege	LOCATION	-RRB- Tell me what blessings I have here alive That I should feare to die ?

		Therefore proceed : But yet heare this : mistake me not : no Life , -LRB- I prize it not a straw -RRB- but for mine Honor , Which I would free : if I shall be condemn 'd Upon surmizes -LRB- all proof es sleeping else , But what your Jealousies awake -RRB- I tell you 'T is Rigor , and not Law . ''

		-LRB- III. , ii. , 113 . -RRB-

		The commentators all stick upon the exclama - tion '' no Life '' : some of them scent a misprint .

		White and Hudson read '' my life '' ; Dyce and
Rolfe	PERSON	, '' for life . ''

		Whereupon Dr.
Furness	PERSON	: '' I can not but believe that this phrase has been mis - understood .

		With line 115 ,
Hermione	PERSON	ends her defence , by commanding the trial to proceed .

		Then the thought of a sullied name flashes upon her , and that she has not with sufficient emphasis contended for the preservation of her honour ; she hastily resumes , but fearing lest the king should misinterpret , and suppose that it is to plead for life , and not for what was , for her boy 's sake , infinitely dearer to her , she exclaims : ` Mistake me not !

		No life !

		Give me not that !

		I prize it not a straw ! '

		It is really the climax of the speech .

		Self-commiseration has vanished , and she speaks for her honour with the last fire of her exhausted strength .

		The lines from ' mistake me not ' to ' I would free , ' inclusive , are parenthetical .

		'T is rigor and not law ! '

		the last words she ever ad - dresses throughout the play to her husband , are full of the sternness of Fate , and mean , of course , that her honour will remain unblemished . ''

		Mr.
Justice Madden	PERSON	's '' Study of Shake - speare and of Elizabethan Sport '' may be pro- nounced a fair model of what such a book should be .

		It is exact without being pedantic and systematic without being tedious , bearing evidence on every page that
Ingram	PERSON	and Dow - den are not , in our time , the only representa - tives of Shakespeare scholarship connected with * The quotations from the
Winter	DATE	's Tale in this article are uniformly from Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's reprint of the Folio text .

		THE DIAL 13
the University of Dublin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Through the whole runs an agreeable vein of fiction based upon the fragment of a diary supposed to have been written by
William Silence	PERSON	, which contains allusions to the presence at Shallow -LRB-
Chatel	PERSON	- hault -RRB-
Hall	PERSON	in Gloucestershire of another Will - iam , a quiet observant young gentleman from
Stratford	LOCATION	on Avon -LRB- See the
Second Part of Henry IV.	ORGANIZATION	, Act III. , Scene ii . -RRB-

		.

		Not the least interesting feature of the book is the by no means baseless suggestion that , at one time or another ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	spent a good deal of time in
Gloucestershire	LOCATION	; that he there partici - pated in the field sports of country gentlemen and yeomen ; and that in this particular way he picked up his astonishing knowledge of all matters connected with falconry , horseman - ship , and the chase .

		The author maintains that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's allusions to these matters differ from those of all other writers , ancient and modern , both in number and , on the whole , in quality .

		True , there are hundreds of such allusions which appear in themselves of an or - dinary kind , but even these acquire significance '' from the circumstance that they are seldom suggested by any necessary action of the drama , but seem to spring forth out of the abundance of the poet 's heart . ''

		Those which are more distinctly Shakespearian are divided into five classes , accordingly as they embody '' 1 , a secret of woodcraft or horsemanship ; 2 , an illustration therefrom of human nature and conduct ; 3 , a lively image ; 4 , a conceit ; or , 5 , an irrelevance ; by which I mean an idea some - what out of place with its surroundings '' -LRB- p. 313 -RRB- .

		The accumulation of illustrations of all these classes of allusions , and the very great clearing up of obscurities which results from their systematic treatment by an expert in field sports , give - very high and doubtless permanent value to the book .

		In the follow - ing metaphor of
Hermione	LOCATION	, for example , he finds a secret both of horsemanship and of human conduct : '' You may ride 's With one soft kisse a thousand Furlongs , ere With Spur we heat an Acre . ''

		-LRB- I. , ii. , 117 -RRB- .

		It is interesting that both
Madden	PERSON	and
Furness	PERSON	accept without question the reading of the Folio , although
Furness	PERSON	quotes without com - ment from
Capell	LOCATION	the statement that the phrase `` heat an acre '' has not been traced .

		Is it pos - sible that the French parallel , bruler le pave , has never been suggested by any commentator ?

		Had the
Diary of Master Silence	ORGANIZATION	been given to the world a little earlier , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	might have found his account in it for his edition of the
Winter	DATE	's Tale .

		Referring to
Leontes	PERSON	's '' note infallible of breaking honesty '' '' Stopping the Cariere Of Laughter , with a sigh . ''

		-LRB- I. , ii. , 332 -RRB- , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	annotates merely as follows : ''
Cariere	PERSON	, A term of horsemanship , meaning a gallop at full speed . ''

		Madden points out that our present use of the word `` career , '' as defined by Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, is not at all what was present to the mind of Shakespeare . ''

		We mean something that continues for an indefi - nite time .

		He meant something that soon comes to an abrupt ending ... The length of the career was four or five score yards at the most .

		The essential charac - teristic of the career , wherein it differed from the ordi - nary gallop , was its abrupt ending , technically known as ' the stop , ' by which the horse was suddenly and firmly thrown upon his haunches .

		Wherever Shakespeare uses the word , this stop is present to his mind '' -LRB- p. 298 -RRB- .

		Thus the word '' stop , '' no less than the word `` career , '' is a term of manage , a term used again by
Leontes	PERSON	near the end of the first scene of Act II. : '' Now , from the
Oracle	ORGANIZATION	They will bring all , whose spirituall counsaile had Shall stop , or spurreme . ''

		Dr.
Furness	PERSON	would also have found here some - thing to add to his note upon `` The Mort o ' th ' Deere '' -LRB- I. , ii. , 144 -RRB- , which words , he thinks , refer '' to the dying sighs of the deer rather than to the raucous sound of a horn . ''


Madden	PERSON	contributes a third interpretation , ac - cording to which the sound of the sighing is compared neither to the sound of a horn nor to the sighing of the deer .

		He says : '' To some , the notes which tell that all is over with a noble beast of venery summon up sad associations , for Leonatus -LRB- sic -RRB- , among the tokens of woman 's frailty , includes 4 To sigh , as ` twere The Mort o ' th '
Deere	PERSON	. '

		This feeling was certainly not generally shared by sports - men , '' etc. .

		In other words , the sighs of the supposed lovers are such sighs as would escape a person of effeminate sympathies at hearing the blast of the horns in token that the deer was slain .


Madden	PERSON	also suggests a metaphor from the chase as the key to some words of Hermione which have been regarded as among the ob - scurest in the play : '' With what encounter so uncurrant , I Have strayn 'd t ' appeare thus . ''

		-LRB- III. , ii. , 51 -RRB- .

		He quotes from `` The Noble Arte of Venerie '' : '' When he -LRB- the hart -RRB- runneth verie fast , then he streyneth . ''

		Madden is probably right in thinking that this interpretation of the word 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, `` strayn 'd '' disposes of the guesses of some of the commentators -LRB- strayed , stained -RRB- ; but the real stumbling-block is in the preceding line , and one still gets no convincing answer to the question what `` encounter so uncurrant '' ?

		Mr.
Justice Madden	PERSON	's researches , in the light of his special knowledge of field-sports , have disclosed many other facts of interest to stu - dents of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The race-horse is , it appears , '' the only horse in whom and in whose doings Shakespeare took no interest , and the horse-race is the only popular pastime to which no allusion can be found in his writings . ''

		To bear-baiting there are many allusions , all of which suggest dislike or contempt for the sport .

		Baconian fanatics will get little comfort from the discovery that in
Bacon	LOCATION	there are no references of any significance to field-sports , for which even the '' studious recluse '' who wrote the `` Anatomy of Melancholy '' mani - fests some enthusiasm -LRB- p. 223 -RRB- .


Madden	PERSON	makes a half-humorous classification of Shakes - peare 's works upon the basis of his allusions to horses , and the classification is as judicious as some others that have been made .

		In ''
Venus	PERSON	and Adonis '' he celebrates the home-bred En - glish horse ; but before beginning his English historical plays he becomes acquainted with the merits of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	horse and his conception of the perfect horse was changed .

		The roan
Barb	PERSON	, `` prince of palfreys , '' appears and re - appears in these plays .

		Madden thinks that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was personally able to say , as early as
1592	DATE	, `` This roan shall be my throne . '' ''

		Indeed , if I were disposed to adopt the language of criticism , I should class the historical plays as the roan
Barbary	ORGANIZATION	group .

		In the tragedies we meet with
Barbary	ORGANIZATION	horses now and then , but ' the bonny beast he loved so well ' is no more .

		Can one wonder that the period when they were written was , in Professor Dow - den 's language , a period of depression and gloom ? ''

		-LRB- p. 262 ^ .

		Perhaps the most interesting result of these researches is that they have led in all cases of dispute to the support of the readings of the Folio as opposed to those of the quartos .

		In view of this , it seems strange that
Madden	PERSON	should twice refer to the '' thirty-four '' plays in the Folio -LRB- there are thirty-six -RRB- , and should twice silently alter the Folio reading in a quota - tion from the
Winter	DATE	's Tale .

		In borrowing the words of the shepherd , '' I would there were no age between ten and three and twenty , ''
Madden	PERSON	in two places prints , '' age between sixteen and three and twenty . ''

		These and a few other oversights , one of which has already been ex - emplified -LRB- Leonatus for Leontes -RRB- , are very nearly the only faults I can find in this inter - esting and instructive book .

		I have left myself too little space in which to speak adequately of Mr.
George Wyndham	PERSON	's edition of the Poems of Shakespeare * - a work certainly not second in importance to either of those we have been considering .

		Let me say at once , without going into detail , that this seems to me to be the completest edition for the student .

		For enjoyment of the poetry , nothing could be better than the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	edition .

		In his notes Mr.
Wyndham	PERSON	has met the main difficul - ties with the patience and acuteness of a scholar .

		He discusses in detail the identity of the rival poet -LRB- or poets -RRB- and of the youth addressed in the first series of sonnets .

		He inclines to
Dray	PERSON	ton as the rival poet , and thinks that
Tyler	PERSON	's argu - ment for
William Herbert	PERSON	and
Mary Fitton	PERSON	might win a verdict from a Scotch jury .

		If he means that the verdict would be '' not proven , '' I heartily agree with him .

		He believes , however , that such attempts at identification must `` prove detrimental to an aesthetic appreciation '' of the lyrical excellence of the Sonnets .

		He admits , what so many critics have urged , that the Sonnets '' express
Shakespeare	PERSON	's own feelings in his own person '' -LRB-
Dowden	PERSON	-RRB- .

		But he deems it '' equally true , and vastly more important , that the Sonnets are not an Autobiography . ''

		Accordingly , at least half of the hundred and forty pages of his sympathetic and well-written introduction are devoted to a consideration of the poems as works of art .

		This is a refresh - ing innovation ; would that it might mark an epoch !

		His texts are based upon the earliest editions , the readings of which he has adhered to , whenever possible , and all the variations are conscientiously set down in the notes .

		The chief weakness of Mr.
Wyndham	PERSON	is that he seems unable to find the holes in Tyler 's argu - ments .

		But he has a true appreciation of the Sonnets and the other poems , and his remarks upon these are at once instructive and com - forting .

		Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's
Life of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is based upon the already well-known article which ap - peared last year in the '' Dictionary of National Biography , '' and which is here expanded and provided with a long appendix , containing ex - haustive discussions of several interesting ques - tions .

		It is especially significant that , after '' very narrow scrutiny , '' Mr.
Lee	PERSON	rejects the claim made for the Sonnets to rank as autobio - graphical material .

		His detailed discussion of this subject is of interest to all students of the great poet .

		Perhaps by virtue of his patient

		It is provided with a good index .

		Mr.
Fleming	PERSON	's '' How to Study Shakespeare '' may be commended with some confidence to read - ing-clubs and to individual beginners .

		Its prin - cipal features are , first , a collection of selected annotations to eight of the more popular plays ; secondly , a number of questions upon the plot and structure of each of these plays , questions which will encourage the student to think about what he has read .

		THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION .

		* The first volume of Mr.
Hannis Taylor	PERSON	's history of the English Constitution , which now extends to twelve hundred octavo pages , was published nearly ten years ago .

		In the preface to that volume , as on the title-page to both first and second , the reader is informed that here '' is drawn out '' the '' development of the En - glish constitutional system , and the growth out of that system of the federal republic of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		This is '' a large order '' even for twelve hundred pages ; and a survey of the contents does not justify the statement .

		Aside from an introductory chapter of eighty pages , in which `` the English origin of the federal republic '' is necessarily somewhat scantily treated , this history is occupied with the growth of English institutions on English soil .

		It may be said at the outset that Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	has made a useful compend .

		Among the mul - titude of works on the English Constitution which have seen the light since Dr.
Stubbs	PERSON	made the subject popular in
1875	DATE	, there has been produced no adequate sketch of the whole field .


Stubbs	PERSON	's great work in three volumes was intended only to bring the student to the point where
Hallam	PERSON	began his work with the Tudors ; and
Hallam	PERSON	, wonderful as his genius was in his day , is too ancient to be a guide for the present age inquirer .

		tution '' deals with things as they are , rather than as they have come to be .

		Medley 's text - book , made only four years ago , would be just the needed work , if he had not adopted the bewildering method of chasing up and down the centuries to trace each institution from start to finish in a separate section .

		One who reads is in the state of mind of
Yankee Doodle	ORGANIZATION	, who could not see the town for the houses .

		This is most unfortunate , for Mr.
Medley	PERSON	covers the ground , and is judicious and critical in his dependence upon authorities .

		Moreover , he has read his subject and is up to date .

		Taswell -
Langmead	ORGANIZATION	's one-volume history is a fine piece of work , but neglects some important aspects of the subject , and is now twenty-three years old , and therefore hardly up to date .

		Only the great master ,
Stubbs	PERSON	, in the face of the large additions made to our knowledge in the last fifteen years by
Maitland	PERSON	and Round ,
Vino	PERSON	- gradoff and
Liebermann	PERSON	, and the school of '' diggers '' which they represent , can grow old creditably .

		Gneist is nearly as shelf-worn as
Taswell	ORGANIZATION	, and in addition has that color blind - ness to the inner truth of English institutions not to be wondered at in one nursed under the shadow of the Prussian bureaucracy .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	is not so much a scholar as a popularizer of the work of scholars .

		It would be hard to find in his pages anything original , and his references show that he has worked largely , not with '' sources , '' but with authorities .

		In the main he has chosen his authorities well , and although not as keen in his evaluation of them as is
Medley	LOCATION	, he cites continually the master workers , from
Stubbs	PERSON	down .

		Still , one would hardly guess through his guidance that
Green	ORGANIZATION	is not an authority for any period since the Conquest , or that he does not rank with
Gardiner	PERSON	, or even with
Lingard	PERSON	on the seven - teenth century .

		One misses the flavor , too , of the great scholars mentioned after
Stubbs	PERSON	in the preceding paragraph , and finds himself wondering if Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	knows them well .

		In the light of what they have done since he first began to publish , a large portion of his first volume will need to be rewritten for a new edition , and that speedily , if this work is to hold its place as a convenient vade mecum .

		It is not a light undertaking to provide a readable and accurate sketch of the many cen - turies that such a history as this covers , and the critic who himself has spent many years of study in this field is likely to be the most char - itable one .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	has put this story of the constitution into the vigorous and graceful 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, English of which he is a master , and he has also kept always before him the larger move - ment of the national life whose details he dis - cusses , so that the inexperienced reader may be entrusted to his guidance with the assurance that he will not miss the '' form and pressure '' of the times through which he passes .

		And yet at times there is blundering in details which makes one feel that portions of the nar - rative deal with subjects that were '' gotten up '' solely for this narrative , and that the writer of it has never entered their atmosphere .

		When one reads in the first volume about ven - derers in connection with the forest courts , even although the word is repeated in this mis - spelled form in the margin and in the table of contents , he lays the blunder to the account of careless proof-reading ; but when , after eight years of waiting , he comes to the index in the second volume , and , looking in vain for verder - ers > reads only the old error repeated , he is inclined to wonder .

		When one reads at the beginning of this second volume , just as he did in the earlier volume , that '' the development of military tenures in
England	LOCATION	was gradual , '' and that '' the transition from the military sys - tem by the thegn 's service to the new system by knight service was also gradual , '' he feels that all the words so recently and so well said by Mr. Round on that subject have been writ - ten in vain .

		So the recent pushing back by Mr.
Round	PERSON	of the scutage composition from the fourth year of
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		to a date at least as early as the reign of
Henry I.	PERSON	, finds no recog - nition ; and the author , in spite even of
Stubbs	LOCATION	, finds the last vestiges of scutage in
1332	DATE	.

		Tal - lage is a good enough word for
Stubbs	PERSON	and
Maitland	PERSON	,
Vinogradoff	PERSON	and
Dowell	PERSON	; we see no reason for giving us tattiage .


Hubert Hall	PERSON	on the '' Customs Revenues '' might correct the statement that '' prisage '' was '' the right to take from each English or foreign wine ship one cask out of every ten '' the italics are ours .

		In the third line , on page 39 , the occurrence of the word '' and , '' when '' but '' is the proper word , makes nonsense ; and even with the cor - rection one does not learn what is vital to an understanding of the statement that
Henry Prince of Wales	ORGANIZATION	, when fourteen years of age , was required to repudiate his betrothal to
Katharine	PERSON	, that his father 's foreign policy had changed since the betrothal .

		The doubt that is apparently expressed on page 82 , whether the appropriation by the crown of the lands of the monastic houses in
1536	DATE	was confiscation , seems to be grounded on the contention that it was not unconstitutional , and in its confound - ing of principles suggests the remarkable posi - tion maintained by Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	in a recent num - ber of the '' North American Review '' concern - ing the moral quality of our '' steal '' from
Mexico	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	.

		The writer knows no more in the second volume than he did in the first that the court baron was probably not coeval in its beginnings with the court leet and the customary court , and yet Viuogradoff pub - lished his English edition of '' Villainage in
England	LOCATION	'' in
1892	DATE	.

		We are told that commis - sioners of array were '' employed by the crown as early as the fourteenth century , '' and referred in a footnote to
1324	DATE	, although
Stubbs	PERSON	in his second volume has much to say about them from
1282	DATE	on .

		One of the things that need most to be done for students of American institutions is to trace adequately the evolution of English local insti - tutions down to the time when the founders of our American states came away .

		This is espe - cially needed for the system of courts .

		Pollock and
Maitland	PERSON	have done the work exhaustively down to 1272 in their great '' History of En - glish Law , '' but a more general survey of the whole field is desirable to thread the way through the maze of local jurisdictions and itin - erant commissions which gradually gave place to the more modern system which our fathers brought to the new home over seas .

		One looks with assurance for this in a work designed to trace the growth of the federal republic out of the English system .

		But this work is still to be done , although Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's occasional ex - cursions into that field suggest that he might have given a satisfactory account had he es - sayed the task .

		In fact , throughout the book one feels that the institutional side has not been sufficiently recognized , and is inclined to class this work rather with
Gardiner	PERSON	and
Froude	PERSON	and
Green	ORGANIZATION	, among the narrative histories which deal principally with political history , than with the treatises of
Hallam	PERSON	and
Stubbs	PERSON	.

		The two chapters which treat of the Civil War and the Protectorate are outside the Constitution , and the space might better have been utilized in presenting some of the interesting constitu - tional conflicts of the Stuart period between the two houses or between the houses and the law courts .

		Attention to
Pike	ORGANIZATION	's recent work on the '' Constitutional History of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, '' which finds no recognition , might have been fruitful of suggestion in that direc - tion .

		Still , it may be said that no better nar - rative of the bulk and scope of this one can be

Laun	PERSON	- celot and Guenevere , '' which he began some years ago , practically offers his work to a very searching test .

		I may as well say at once that much of it does not appeal to me .

		Why mingle Scandinavian and German and Greek mythol - ogy with Celtic mysteries ?

		I am as confused as poor old
Merlin	PERSON	was by this kaleidoscope of Norns and Goblins and Angels and Bassarids .

		Or , in the second play , why spend so much trouble in showing the world that
Arthur	PERSON	was the real adulterer , not Launcelot ?

		I fear that not even a mystical moralist will be thus pla - cated .

		Then why , when all 's over and done , is there no end ?

		I believe there are to be other plays , but I mean an end to this third play .

		What has all the scheming and plotting done but throw a little more dust into the already darkened eyes of the king ?

		These objections seem to me to go pretty deep , for they show a lack of creative power .

		They also show what is more to the present purpose , namely , an absence of character of the time .

		Our time will stand visions , and also a certain amount of material anachronism .

		But the mingling together of half-a-dozen mythol - ogies , pagan and Christian , is an artistic incon - gruity very uncharacteristic of the present .

		Further , however , our time will stand a good deal of immorality , or even of cynical disdain of current morals ; but it does not care to have passion try to justify itself by other laws than its own .

		`` The Marriage of Guenevere '' is based on the idea that Guenevere was truly married to
Launcelot	LOCATION	; which is a matter of no importance in the minds of most people nowadays .

		We can stand justification by fate , as with
Tristram	ORGANIZATION	and Isolde ; but justification by accident seems , to me at least , absurd and even gross .

		Then , lastly , the present time will stand even heroics ; but it wants the old - time swordsman to be approved by some law higher than the sword .

		We do not want alle - gory , to be sure , but we do want something a little more grown-up than fights and rescues and escapes and love-trysts .

		Taken by and large , then , we can hardly accept this rendering .

		I do not say every ren - dering of the Arthurian legend must be char - acteristic of its time .

		But the great ones have been , and any rendering that is not runs the danger of being the outcome of a striving to be different , which rarely brings about large re - sults .

		So I am not much taken by these poems in general : in the details , on the other hand , I find much that is delightful .

		I feel the charm of the girlhood of Guenevere , and also -LRB- al - though an anti-neo-celticist -RRB- of her song in the palace of Cameliard .

		I think the last words of '' The Marriage of Guenevere '' make a fine ending .

		I like especially to look out on the fresh barbarian British from the crumbling walls of the worn-out empire .

		These things are good and typical , and other things , too , are good , as the reader will easily see for himself .

		So far , however , nothing has been said that might not have been said were these plays poQms and nothing more ; and this is manifestly wrong .

		For we have here , obviously , productions in - tended for the stage .

		At any rate , they are fortified by copyright '' as dramatic composi - tion , '' and , indeed , I believe that Mr.
Hovey	PERSON	18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, considers himself more of a playwright than a poet .

		Doubtless he meant these plays to be acted .

		This is a matter which interests me .

		Can we read these plays with a satisfaction perfect in its kind and of a good kind , or must we lay them by with an unfinished feeling while we wait for an appreciative manager who will bring them out somewhere where we may never see them ?

		Or , in other words , is it ever really worth while to read a play ?

		These dramas of Mr.
Hovey	PERSON	's furnish mate - rial for some observations on this point .

		Let us take the first one , `` The Quest of Merlin , a Masque . ''

		As we all know , the Masque vanished from the public stage some time since .

		If this masque ever comes to be performed , it will , however , in a measure answer the same tastes on the part of an audience that the old masques did .

		These tastes were , I suppose , speaking very generally , the same that exist in the mind of an audience nowadays that gathers at the performance of any grand spectacular play .

		The masques were not exactly ballets , but they depended immensely on costume , dancing , and scenery .

		They had the accompaniment , also , of music and of poetry , sometimes of very beau - tiful poetry .

		But the spectacular elements were very important and often enormously elaborate .

		Indeed , I think that the poetry , even when by
John Milton	PERSON	, was a minor consideration with the on-lookers .

		It seems almost as if this must have been so .

		Consider an audience , even of the most cultivated : what will seize their immediate in - terest when both are offered at once ; beautiful dancing , elaborate and gorgeous scenery and costume , things that strike the passive eye and mind irresistibly , or poetry , of which the greatest charm is that it stimulates the imagi - nation and makes the mind active through the unconscious service of the eye or ear ?

		I can not resist the idea that the poetry in a masque must have always passed more or less unappreciated .

		It is true that the Elizabethans had a taste for oratorical poetry , if I may so call it , which we have not ; but I fancy that even an Elizabethan , like anyone else , must have given his attention chiefly to the beautiful things that presented themselves outright to his eye and ear , and only in a minor way to the poetry which would have forced him to imagine , to feel , to sympathize .

		Now , in Mr.
Hovey	PERSON	's masque the poetry is the main thing .

		Yet I can not conceive these succes - sive entries on the stage of angels , bassarids , maenads , fairies , elves , loves , valkyrs , maidens , these anti-masques of satyrs , fauns , goblins , gnomes , without at the same time imagining the poetry relegated to a wholly secondary place .

		I think of myself at a production of the masque , probably not catching much of what was sung , not noticing what was accompanied by a charm - ing dance , and in various natural ways overlook - ing the poetry .

		On the other hand , as I read it , the masques and the anti-masques are second - ary : I imagine them but feebly , for my mind is taken up with the poetry , is taken up with those little black characters * that demand in - terpretation by me , by the very mind that is vaguely conceiving the bassarids and gnomes .

		Here the poetry has a chance : I can pause over it , think over it , dream over it , if I so de - sire .

		In other words , I am doing an entirely different thing from sitting passively at a theatre with some hundreds of others .

		I am alone , and my mind has to work if it expects to get anything .

		Two different things we have here .

		This par - ticular masque is good , if it suits either case .

		The greatest masques serve both .

		And not so very different is the case with '' The Marriage of Guenevere , a Tragedy , '' and '' The Birth of
Galahad	LOCATION	, a Romantic Drama . ''

		Here in a less degree , could we see them on the stage , would the poetry as poetry be lost .

		I take what seems to me the best scene in the first play , that in which Guenevere first appears .

		The beauty of the opening song would be lost or subordinated in a performance , but the dialogue between the handsome girl and the disappointed woman of the world would be much more effect - ive ; Dagonet might be humorous in a perform - ance according to the actor and the business , but the full sense of his jesting can be perceived only in reading ; the general entry of king , queen , and court would be much more effective on the stage , but the succeeding scenes ,
Guene	PERSON	- vere and her mother , Guenevere alone , and then with her brother , these are very different things as seen and as read , and it is hard to say that either would be better : the end of the act would probably be more effective on the stage .

		The stage performance would give something , certainly , but it would as certainly lack some - thing .

		I am very fond of the theatre .

		I incline to think that I enjoy seeing a play more than I do reading one.f But I believe the reason for this lies largely in the many attendant circumstances that always accompany theatre-going : the un - conscious effect of the public place , the people * I beg to acknowledge a hint from
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	.

		f I find at least that I habitually pay more for the privilege .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 you go with , the other people there , the lights , and what not .

		I doubt if I should enjoy a play in the same way if I could look out of my win - dow at any time and see a stage with a play upon it , as I sat in my room by myself .

		But aside from that matter , I can hardly think that the pleasure at the theatre and the pleasure of read - ing poetry have so very much in common .

		This is , perhaps , something of an excursus .

		But here are plays meant to be acted ; and I have not seen them acted .

		What am I to do ?

		Read them and say , '' In a tentative , general , and altogether indecisive way , I imagine that the plays , if they ever reach the stage , may be thus and so ? ''

		Could I say that ?

		Of course not .

		Here are poems .

		They are printed in books ; as books they come to me , and as books I read them .

		They are poems : but the author has chosen to write them in dramatic form .

		It pleased him , or it enabled him to put certain things he could not otherwise , or he thought it would call ideas to my mind in such and such a way , or something of the sort .

		Will anyone ever act these plays ?

		I have no idea , nor , for the purposes of present enjoyment , do I in the least care .

		If ever the dramatic performance comes , I will welcome it gladly and allow myself to be stirred and moved by the glittering magic of the charm put in action by poet , actor , musician , scene-painter , costumer , property - man , and I do n't know who else .

		But now I am by myself , and I read ; the books , for the moment , are all I know , or need to know , either .

		But why so much bother on a matter that nobody ever troubles his head about ?

		Why not tell us whether they are good plays or not ?

		Ah , that is another matter : I fear I have written enough already .

		THE experiment of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	in es - tablishing a down town college , and arranging its courses at such times as would suit the convenience of the teachers of the city and others who could not enter the regular classes at the
University	ORGANIZATION	, has met with a success beyond the expectations of the warmest friends of the movement .

		The determination of
the University	ORGANIZATION	to admit without examination all teachers who are gradu - ates of the
Chicago High Schools	ORGANIZATION	, or an equivalent course , and the lowering of the fees to them , has helped both the
University	ORGANIZATION	and the public .

		At the opening of the College few thought that the enrollment would be more than 100 or 150 , but there are already 286 ma - triculants , nearly all teachers , and about 150 schools are represented .

		All the classes begun in
October	DATE	will continue until the first of
April	DATE	, and new classes will begin with the present month .

		DISCUSSIONS OF THE SOCIAL , MOVEMENT , THEORETICAL , AND PRACTICAL , .

		* In '' The Logical Process of Social Development '' we have , in the words of the author , '' a theoretical attempt to introduce orderly arrangement into the study of the phenomena of social life by the rigid application of a single logical hypothesis the selec - tive survival of sociological types . ''

		The main topics are the societary process , the sociological postulates , the sociological axioms , and the sociological prin - ciples .

		The societary process is from the natural , organic or animal , upward to the ideal , and involves in succession consciousness of typal kinship , of typal conditions , of typal relations , and of typal possibili - ties .

		Progress is mediated by sociological types which are defined to be either '' a potentially normal type of personality or a theoretically superior type of social organization projected as a goal of practice . ''

		The sociological postulates are the social situation , which secures the type from dissolution ; the social interests , which set up a tendency to variation ; the social system , in which tendencies are coordinated ; and the social mind , in which the ideals of a higher state become curative and harmonizing forces .

		Under the head of sociological axioms are dis - cussed typicality , normality , institutionality , and ideality .

		The main purpose of the work is to show that human association rises above and upon a purely organic state toward an ideal state of personality and organization , by a constant process of selecting and acting upon new types of being .

		It is the function of sociology to formulate the materials of the various sciences in a way to guide this process .

		The normal tendency toward the higher type can be compre - hended by scientific method , and errors of direction may be corrected .

		When these ideals and methods have been thus formulated we have a more reliable basis for the pedagogic art . ''

Jan. 1	DATE	, take into account -LRB- 1 -RRB- the facts or conditions of natu - ral association , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the forces that belong to social organization , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the coordination of these fac - tors in the individuation of the type of character that normally tends to prevail toward the ideal .

		The social process being a type-developing process , educational policy must organize knowledge and its uses to that supreme end . ''

		The practised student of sociology will derive many original and thought-provoking hints from this orderly and systematic treatment .

		In the circles of specialists it will be one of the books for fruitful criticism and debate .

		For persons not already well equipped for close reasoning , the book will require a translator ; for the technical terms and the words used in a sense peculiar to the author will bewilder the amateur .

		Under a hard crust there is solid food for adults .

		The formulas or principles proposed need to be used with great caution .

		It is so easy to accept imaginative constructions as verified laws of reality .

		It is true that the author calls his theory a hypothesis , and warns us that it is to be used as a guide to induc - tion .

		But the mode of discussion is such that the incautious student may be strongly tempted to em - ploy this hypothesis as a premiss for deduction , and in some parts of the book the author himself seems under control of this tendency .

		The corrective , however , is suggested in the array of the scientific preparation required for discovery of the ideal type and of the necessary means of its realization .

		In the treatment of the social ideal , does our author give a suitable place of dignity and value to the creative minds in literature ?

		He declares that science and religion are the two sources of the ideals toward which progressive society normally tends .

		But in no place is a distinct or at least adequate place assigned to the greatest poets and literary artists who , apart from beautiful forms of speech , have helped us to see life as it is and to see it as a whole .

		Without Shakespeare ,
Goethe , Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Tennyson	PERSON	, the scientific and philosoph - ical and theological formulations of social ideals would be empty as a drum and cold as steel .

		Ab - stract thinkers , system-builders , offer us a strong osseous skeleton , but great literature reveals the warm heart , the sensitive nerves , the rounded flesh , the perfect form , and , best of all , the endlessly va - ried yet harmonious world of sentiments , hopes , fears , and mysteries of the inmost spirit .

		It is the mind of a master which carries us for - ward in the lucid argument of '' Democracy and Social Growth in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The appeal is to facts commonly known ; the interpretation is that of a man familiar with economic and political history .

		Equality belongs to simple rural conditions , and those conditions gave us a democracy .

		Industrial revolution has caused inequality and complexity and a pure democracy is impossible .

		There is an inev - itable tendency to bring industry under some form of political control , and so far the Socialists have rightly interpreted the process of history .

		But those who imagine that Socialism will make presi - dents of railroads and section-hands change places each month or year , or who fancy that the highest places will be easily reached , build on the shadows of dreams .

		Inequality and conflict will continue under all forms of government .

		The last chapter is a noble plea for a '' political revival , '' for the preaching of social duty above individual rights , for simplicity of living , for standards of goodness , intelligence , and taste , to compete with the social criterion of wealth , and for religion as a necessary conservative force .

		The teaching of this volume should be pondered by everyone who desires to appre - ciate and promote the most sane , elevated , and inspir - ing ideals of our economic and political movement .

		Sombart 's popular and sympathetic lectures on Socialism have been translated in a delightful way by Rev.
Anson P. Atterbury	PERSON	, and Professor
J. B. Clark	PERSON	thinks the book worth a special introduction from his pen .

		A social movement is defined to be '' the aggregate of all those endeavors of a social class which are directed to a rational overturning of an existing social order to suit the interests of a class . ''

		The central aim of the movement in this century is toward a socialistic , communal order of society , in place of the existing method of private ownership .

		The formation of the proletariat is shown to be the inevitable result of capitalistic modes of production .

		Misery , contrast , uncertainty
spring	DATE	from the same system , and the intensity of all life heightens class feeling .

		The Utopian forms of Socialism , the agitation of
Lassalle	LOCATION	, the masterly discussions of
Marx	PERSON	, and the tendencies toward unity in all lands where the wage-class has been formed , are neatly described .

		The lesson from the history of Socialism is that class strife is the cause of move - ment and progress , but that strife should be carried on within legal limits and without the poisoned weapons of hate , revenge , and misrepresentation .

		Monsieur
Louis Proal	PERSON	is a French judge who has contributed important works to the discussion of crime and punishment .

		In the work on Political Crime the main topics are the anti-social actions done in the name of government ,
Machiavelism	ORGANIZATION	, assassination and tyrannicide , anarchism , political hatreds and hypocrisy , spoilation under legal forms , partisan corruption , electoral corruption , corruption of law and justice by politics , and the corruption of morals by evil example in high places .

		The plan of the author is to present historical illustrations of these subjects from ancient , mediaeval , and modern sources .

		The result is a rogue 's gallery of very forbidding pictures , and the effect is depressing .

		Strictly speaking , many of these actions are not legally criminal , because they do not come under the condemnation and penalty of particular statutes ; but they are all instances of violation of the '' higher law '' of social and international morality .

		At this moment we have experience of the subversive influ - ence of war , even in as righteous a cause as one can imagine .

		Acts which in times of peace were called lying , treachery , robbery , and murder are now the duty and the business of representatives of national

		THE DIAJL 21 honor .

		The contradictions of the situation , if long continued , would destroy the socializing and elevat - ing influences of generations of peaceful education .

		So awful is the responsibility for world-wide retro - gression of those who force upon us war .

		Monsieur
Proal	PERSON	has massed his illustrations in an effective way , and he has compelled us to judge all the con - duct of parties , rulers , and nations by the standards of ideal ethics .

		The author misses no opportunity to expose the destructive tendency of social agitators who poison and irritate the minds of men and sub - vert the moral judgments on which the security of life , person , property , and culture rest .

		He believes the ills of society are far more due to defective ideals and morals than to economic suffering .

		He sees clearly that educated men must take hold of the work of social education in earnest . ''

		Those who do not defend society betray it .

		To the proselytism of evil must be opposed the proselytism of good .

		It is the strict duty of all those who have the good fortune to hold salutary beliefs , derived from their education , their family , or their studies , to propa - gate them , and not to allow sophisms to pass with - out challenge ... The real remedy for the crisis we are traversing is a return to Christianity . ''

		The wage-worker is daily haunted by the fear of sickness or accident which may reduce or suspend his earning power , by the dread of old age and death , with all their possible consequences to his family .

		The process of saving a sufficient hoard to provide for all these emergencies is painfully slow and un - certain .

		For the vast majority of men it is next to impossible to erect a fortress of accumulated wealth whose interest will be a wall of protection against extreme destitution .

		Americans have not yet been compelled to face this situation , because most men could escape from the vicissitudes of city life to the relatively certain income of the isolated farm home - stead .

		The rapid transformation of a great popu - lation into a manufacturing community is compelling reflecting and far-seeing men to cast about for meas - ures which will remove the terrors of poverty and beggary in times of feebleness and loss of bread - winning power .


Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	's method was to save the pennies and lend the capital .

		That would be adequate for his age , but it is not applicable in our conditions .

		Individualism breaks down under the circumstances of urban life and the factory system , and men have the choice between some form of col - lectivism and pauperism , which is itself communism in disgrace .

		At this point of transition we may avail ourselves of the experience of older countries , and when we come to organize our insurance against sickness , accident , old age , death , and even unem - ployment , or shall not be compelled to try experi - ments in the dark .

		Mr.
W. F. Willoughby	PERSON	has set before the American reader and student a clear , concise , and accurate account of the aims , scope , methods , and results of '' Workingmen 's Insurance '' in all civilized countries .

		Mr.
John Graham Brooks	PERSON	had already presented an admirable account of the German system of
State	ORGANIZATION	insurance , and his book is not altogether superseded by this work , which covers wider ground .

		Perhaps there is no single measure relating to the welfare of the wage-workers in Amer - ica , next to the question of wages , so important as this matter of insurance .

		Our Building and Loan Associations are growing in wealth and favor ; but they are by no means adequate , and they do riot touch the demand of the average urban laborer .

		The trade unions of the better class do very much in case of unemployment and sickness ; but their insurance work is still based on crude actuarial cal - culations and is avowedly subordinate to the fighting function of the union .

		The '' benevolent '' societies and some of the great railroad companies have made fair beginnings in the right direction .

		The author rightly directs attention to the vital principle of acci - dent insurance , now universally accepted in
Europe	LOCATION	but scarcely discussed in the
United States	LOCATION	: that each business should provide for losses incurred by acci - dents incident to it .

		Every prudent manufacturer sets aside in each inventory a certain per cent for repairs , restoration , and loss of machinery , because experi - ence shows this to be inevitable .

		But a similar loss is caused to the human beings who make the ma - chinery effective , and it is reasonable that this cer - tain waste should be borne by the business .

		Our - employer 's liability laws are no longer abreast with economic conditions .

		They are based on the old conditions , when each man worked alone or in a small group , and was responsible for exposure to danger .

		But in a huge factory or on a railroad the individual workman is a fixed part of a mass which is under military orders and rigid discipline .

		It is unjust to compel him to have a lawsuit with his em - ployer every time he crushes a finger or is poisoned by chemical fumes .

		The business should insure each workman , and the cost be charged in the price of goods to the community .

		Professor
Davidson	PERSON	, author of '' The Bargain Theory of Wages , '' discusses the wages problem in its historical and theoretical aspects .

		He offers an exposition of the subsistence theory , the wages-fund theory , the productivity theory , and the bargain theory , and shows that these various views are not antagonistic but complementary .

		The phenomena to be explained are not social conditions of former ages but of our own time .

		Many of the illustrations would be understood most clearly by a resident of the maritime provinces of
British America	LOCATION	, where the book was prepared ; but nothing is obscure , and the author is constantly in touch with reality .

		The chapter on the mobility of labor should be read by those who are free enough from the prejudices of capitalistic employers , and also of wage-earners , to study impartially the hidden causes of the troubles in
Illinois	LOCATION	coal-fields , where the maddened miners and the demagogues are seeking by illegal methods to correct the abuses of excessive mobility of labor .

		There is no longer the excuse for migration of work - men which existed when Mr.
Greeley	PERSON	gave his famous advice about going West .

		Statistics collected by Professor
Willcox	PERSON	, and given by the author , show 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, that steady home-making is coming to be the habit of our people .

		Trade-unions are discouraging the tramp habit among their own members on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The moral consequences of greater sta - bility justify the policy .

		The problem is to promote stability by legislation without restricting liberty of travel in search of better conditions .

		The author gives a suggestive illustration of legal restriction of imported labor by a heavy tax on the interlopers who hurt the trade-unions .

		The chapters on the influence of trade-unions and of methods of remuneration on the rate of wages and industrial efficiency of working - men are full of fresh and important materials .

		In his work on '' Labor Copartnership , '' Mr.
Henry D. Lloyd	PERSON	has set before the public , in his usual forceful way , the more recent developments of one form of the cooperative movement in
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		The materials were collected during a personal visit to the chief centres of the movement in
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	.

		The author is an enthusiastic advocate and prophet of that form of cooperation in which the producing agents , the direct workers , share in profits , responsibilities , and management .

		The arguments of Mrs.
Webb	PERSON	on the side of the English custom of dividing profits among shareholders are not fully set forth , and Mrs.
Webb	PERSON	's book must be read along with this one in order to have the whole case in mind .

		Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	writes with the faith and fervor of a socialistic seer , but he certainly gives solid statistical grounds for his hopes .

		Those who are content to measure the future of industrial democracy by the past are quite likely to miss the germinating forces of the present .

		A de - voted coOperationist may be a dreamer of dreams , but when one-seventh of the population of a great realm has become interested in a scheme which is backed already by one hundred millions of property , and has more capital than it can invest , we may excuse the enthusiasm .

		All who sincerely desire to see general growth in business ability , self-govern - ment , and independent position of the workers , are justified in studying British cooperation with hope and confidence .

		If the '' proletariate '' really has the power and ability to direct the gigantic enter - prises of modern business , it must prove this by cooperative success in production , not by mere blus - ter and flattery of demagogues .

		The conservative doubt and scorn and the optimist 's hope are not to the point : action must be decisive .

		In '' Problems of Modern Industry , '' Mr. and Mrs.
Webb	PERSON	have published a series of interesting essays on various aspects of the labor question , ten - ement house life , women 's wages , factory acts , hours of labor , surating system , poor law , cooperation , trade-unions , and the theory of Felian socialism .

		The chapters are crowded with interesting and sug - gestive materials , and the closing papers reveal the most recent phases of English collectivism .

		A new and enlarged edition of Mr.
Thomas G. Shearman	PERSON	's '' Natural Taxation '' brings before the public a modified form of
Henry George	PERSON	's theory of taxation .

		Mr.
Shearman	PERSON	's doctrine , in contrast with that of Mr.
George	PERSON	, is thus stated -LRB- p. 226 -RRB- : `` The ob - jection to the alleged inelasticity of the tax applies to that full and rather forced measure of taxation advo - cated by
Henry George	PERSON	, taking the whole economic rent , so far as it is possible to do so , for the use of the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The additions in the new edition are replies to objections and an analysis of the incidence of tax - ation .

		The refutation of the single tax , by Professor
Seligman	PERSON	, is the text of this fresh presentation of the plea for making land-values the sole object of the assessor 's zeal .

		The matter is presented in the con - cise , clear , and cogent , if somewhat one-sided , style of a very able lawyer advocate .

		There is much just criticism of the iniquities of current methods , and the book deserves careful and candid consideration .

		The British archives have preserved most inter - esting records of the commercial dealings between the colonies and the mother country .

		In '' Industrial Experiments , '' by
Eleanor Louisa Lord	PERSON	, the author draws upon these documents of the period previous to the Revolution for materials which throw light on the economical causes of the conflict which issued in political independence .

		The chief topic of this mono - graph is the attempt of the British government to compel or induce
New England	LOCATION	to furnish it naval supplies .

		The statesmen in control imagined that they understood the economic interests of the colonies better than the colonists .

		Gradually the children were becoming industrially independent , and when the time came to enforce a fiscal policy which seemed unjust , the young and vigorous communities revealed their economic power in war .

		The monograph pre - sents evidence , in a limited field , for the assertion that the economists and statesmen of
England	LOCATION	failed to understand the situation in
North America	LOCATION	, and that their error cost the mother country her most valu - able dependency .

		The book called `` Reality , '' by Mr.
George A. San	PERSON	- ders , is put forward as a `` reply to
Edward Bellamy	PERSON	's ` Looking Backward ' and ` Equality , ' '' an optimistic presentation for the existing industrial system .

		It can hardly be claimed as a novel or profound discussion of a well-worn theme .

		Mr.
Bellamy	PERSON	is regarded by this author as an impracticable dreamer ; the basis of civilization is character and culture ; our indus - trial order is the best possible .

		A chapter of statis - tics from Mr.
Mulhall	PERSON	is printed .

		The law of evolution is stated .

		The perils and advantages of mammon - ism are set in the balance .

		The parable of the '' Masters of Bread '' is dissected on a marble table , but '' brotherly love '' comes immediately after as a counterpoise .

		Theological speculation on '' what God might have done '' closes the book .

		Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	's work on '' The Christian Pastor and the Working Church , '' although published in a theological series , is an important contribution to the study of social tendencies and institutions .

		The eminent writer has given explicit form to certain beliefs and convictions which have been gradually shaping themselves in the minds of religious people and manifesting themselves in institutions .

		The distinction between '' sacred '' and '' secular '' has
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 broken down at every point , as the church has come to believe in the transmutation of species .

		The abandonment of theories of ecclesiastical authority and of logical systems of theological speculation has driven the people to concentrate attention upon practical applications of common religious principles to the life of the world .

		The creeds have been condensed from many unverifiable articles into a few directly ethical declarations relating to the meaning of the universe and the duty of man .

		It was inevitable that the text-books on pastoral duties and church work must be re-written .

		The institu - tional church , the organization of voluntary chari - ties , the various attempts to socialize selfish conduct in politics and business , the recognition of health and innocent recreation as suitable subjects for ecclesiastical discussion and action , found small place in the earlier works which formulated the technical education of the preacher and pastor .

		The publishers who selected Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	for the task of re-stating the theory of the pastoral office according to modern lights have made a most happy choice .

		While the discussion is radical and at points revo - lutionary , the tone is moderate , the style free from exaggeration , the argument considerate , and the vital matters of positive Christian conviction are not obscured or feebly set forth .

		The range of thought is considerably wider than that covered by traditional text-books on pastoral duties .

		The sub - title , '' Working Church , '' indicates the fact that the pastor is only one factor in the institution of religion .

		The duties of the pastor and the best methods of his professional work are , indeed , carefully treated .

		We see him in his study , in the pulpit , as conductor of public services , and as counsellor and guide of those who trust him as friend .

		But the modern activities of the other members have vastly increased .

		The
Sunday	DATE	school , the midweek service , evangeli - zation , social life , woman 's work , associations of youth , societies of children , missionary organization s. philanthropic enterprises of many forms have grown up in response to new social needs and out of the inspirations of a renaissance of primitive Christian impulse .

		The Church is simply an instrument of service , not an end in itself .

		In some points the volume requires to be supplemented by other works .

		The discussion of charity methods is very brief and meagre , although the author insists on the social importance of this work .

		Those who desire to know more about the '' institutional church '' will do well to consult
Mead	PERSON	's `` Modern Methods of Church Work , '' which is not mentioned in this book .

		The plan of the volume did not permit a treatment of the many social problems in which the church is more or less directly interested as inspirer and or - ganizer of the conscience .

		It is not to be expected that all the statements and teachings will be greeted with nnanimous approval .

		Yet one fact remains clear : that we have here , for the pastor , the most modern practical treatise yet published , sagacious , bal - anced , devout , inspiring .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Still another '' Life of Marie An - toinette '' !

		There is apparently to be no end of repetitions of the story of the career of this questionable `` martyr . ''

		This time the biographer of '' Madame Veto '' is Miss
Clara Tschudi	PERSON	, a popular Norwegian author ; and the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers of a translation of her book by Mr.
E. M. Cope	PERSON	.

		Miss
Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	is a decidedly pleasant writer , and the translator -LRB- despite occasional flaws in his English -RRB- echoes very cleverly her easy , rippling style .

		Aside from its unusual readableness , the best thing about Miss
Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	's book is its sanity of view .

		Her heroine is neither martyr nor monster , but a quite intelligible woman who was forced to play a part in history that was far too large for her .

		Miss
Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	's book is thus neither soaked in tears , like the tomes of M. de la Rocheterie , whose lamentations for his '' martyr queen '' remind one of
Mark Twain	PERSON	at the tomb of
Adam	PERSON	, nor does it defer too much to the republican view of this bad sovereign and pity-compelling victim .

		A `` tigress ''
Marie	PERSON	An - toinette certainly was not ; but she was a giddy , shallow creature , as ill-fitted as possible for the high station to which an ironic destiny called her .

		While deploring her all too tragic end , impartial history can not forget that , in her day of triumph , she had no thought for the hard lot of the toiling poor who lacked bread while she and her worthless favorites were squandering the revenues of
France	LOCATION	.

		But her nature was a shallow rather than a bad one ; and with a better training she would have been a better queen .

		The '' Widow Capet '' paid in tears and blood for the follies of the mistress of the Little Trianon ; and we may agree with our author that in the hour of misfortune
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	devel - oped qualities of soul worthy of a daughter of
Maria Theresa	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	's book is accurate , sensible , vivacious ; there is perhaps no better popular Life of its heroine .

		The book is well printed , but an occasional slip in the proof-reading must be noted .

		Vergniaud , for instance , is printed '' Verginaud . ''

		There is an attractive frontispiece portrait in colors .

		Ever since the appearance of the Revised Version of the Old
Testa	PERSON	- ment in
1885	DATE	, there has been a de - sire on the part of Bible students for this same ver - sion provided with a new set of marginal references .

		Just now , thirteen years after its first appearance , we have the desired book .

		It has been prepared by scholars connected with the Universities of Ox - ford and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and issued from the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the British edition newly set with the American Preferences at the end , as in the regular British Revised Version .

		The principles governing the matter of marginal references in this volume are five , as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Quotations , or exact verbal parallels ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- Passages referred to for sim - ilarity of idea or of expression ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- Passages re - A new reference Bible .

		24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ferred to by way of explanation or illustration ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- Historical or geographical references : names of persons , places , etc. , which recur ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- Passages referred to as illustrating differences of rendering between
the Authorized and Revised Versions	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ap - propriate signs are used to indicate the character of each of the references , so that the reader may know in advance just what he is looking for .

		These same principles of reference will save the margins of our Bible from the numerous misinterpretations and bad exegeses found in the Authorized Version .

		No - tably in the '' Song of Songs '' do we find the tracks of clear-headed workmen , who have not , as in the old version , foisted upon us a groundless symbolical interpretation .

		Another commendable feature of this
Bible	LOCATION	is the printing of the verse-numbers in black-faced type in the prose text , and not on the margins .

		This feature meets the objection of many people to the use of the
Revised Version	ORGANIZATION	.

		If , now , this Bible embodied in the text the American Com - mittee 's preferences , we should be content for the time being with this admirable book .

		`` The Golden Maiden '' -LRB-
Helman	PERSON	- Foik-taie ,
Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of Ar - of
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		. '

		.

		meman folk tales written by one who is himself an Armenian , Mr.
A. G. Seklemian	PERSON	.

		The antiquity of the people , the tenacity with which they have kept their ideas and customs , the retention of race characteristics , which may be likened to the Jewish race-survival , and the fact that the
Armenian Church	ORGANIZATION	is the oldest national
Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	in the world , all lend interest to the study of the country .

		The reader is at once struck by resemblances to the folk-lore of other Aryan peoples .

		Traces of Persian , Arabic , and Turkish influence are found , since Ar - menia was successively conquered by those nations .

		The book abounds in stories of magic swords and rings , treacherous elder brothers , jealous and wicked stepmothers , kindly old fairies , and hazardous expe - ditions undertaken by disguised princes to rescue beautiful captive princesses after killing dragons , and giants even to the number of forty .

		From a literary point of view , this collection suffers , of course , from comparison with such works as
Hans Andersen	PERSON	's fairy tales .

		To be sure ,
Andersen	PERSON	did not gather all his tales from the lips of peasants and make a great effort , for scientific purposes , to secure fidelity to the original .

		Many of his stories are conscious creations with the element of feeling strong in them creations of a man of genius with a deep love for humanity and nature .

		Mr.
Seklemian	PERSON	's book is a distinct addition to the existing collection of folk - lore literature .

		In these times so popular is the p ntle ^ of eay.writing !

		- the book of slender , clever , half loitering criticism is by no means a rarity , though , very often , a pleasant thing to have at hand .

		Such a book is the collection of essays by Mr.
Leon H. Vincent	PERSON	, entitled `` The Bibliotaph and Other People '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- .

		The subjects chosen are , for the most part , literary subjects , but , except in the essay on
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	and in one on
Stevenson	PERSON	's ''
St. Ives	LOCATION	, '' there is no attempt at serious literary criti - cism .

		Seriousness , indeed , is not in any sense a leading quality of the book , which is distinguished rather by a disposition toward the blither and more humorous aspects of life .

		The author 's fancy has led him to themes widely different as different , for example , as the letters of a poet and the me - moirs of a man of science ; but from each he selects the same wholesome elements , and the same vein of gayety may be observed in all his treatment .

		Of the distinctly critical essays , that on
Hardy	PERSON	is the more noticeable , showing a complete appreciation of the powerful imaginative realism which is
Hardy	LOCATION	's main strength .

		In his essay on
Stevenson	PERSON	, Mr.
Vin	PERSON	- cent says what anyone is expected to say ; in the one on
Keats	PERSON	's letters , he says what is expected only from the close lovers of that young and manly genius .

		The first three essays the hero of which is the Bibliotaph have too much of the air which we know as '' off-hand , '' and a humor which is de - cidedly too insistent .

		Their task , however , is diffi - cult ; for the portrait they have to paint is that of a large , mirthful , and erratic character , much harder of delineation than one delicate and subtle .

		The selection from the Bibliotaph 's speeches seems un - fortunate , but all that he said was doubtless very delightful in the hearing .

Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a liberal selection from
Hancock	PERSON	's commercial correspondence , as taken from his letter-book , the letters being strung together by the compiler on a slender thread of explanatory and biographical narrative .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	does not pretend to call his book a life of
Hancock	PERSON	, but merely a contribution to such a work , which he hopes may ere long be written by another hand .

		Unlike many of our latter-day '' Freemanikins , '' he does not pre - sume to dignify with the name of history original documents which are but its raw material .

		Different readers will find different food for entertainment and instruction in these business letters of a wholesale dealer in tar , oyl , pott ash , codd fish , etc. .

		Their quaint spelling and phraseology and grammar can not but arrest the attention .

		Occasional indignant refer - ences to the Stamp Act of
1765	DATE	bespeak the patriot who , with
Samuel Adams	PERSON	, enjoyed the distinction of being excluded from General
Gage	PERSON	's proclama - tion of amnesty .

		The orders for household and fam - ily supplies show the comfortable , even luxurious , style of living at the
Hancock	PERSON	mansion .

		The nu - merous illustrations in the book add no little to its value .

		It is a singular fact that the first signer of the Declaration of Independence , the first Governor of the State of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and one of her foremost patriots , should have been so long neglected by biog - raphers , and that even his grave should have been , until very recently , without an enduring monument .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 25 The latest To write a book on
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	biographer of which shall have all the human in -
Generai Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		terest of that remarkable character , preserving all the well-known facts without diminu - tion and adding to them from a great store of per - sonal gleanings , is no slight nor unworthy achieve - ment .

		This Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	, in his '' Life and Character of General
U. S. Grant	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has done .

		One fact that Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- land 's vivid succession of pictures brings to mind is the possibility of the sword-and-cloak romance with an every-day American for hero : Grant , plain and simple to a degree , would make such an one , with adventures undreamed of by
Dumas	PERSON	.

		Another point is , that here was a man who was , above everything , staunch and loyal to his friends , his family , and his country .

		And another is that he was a man who always held much besides language in reserve .

		There is hardly an interesting phase of Grant in either his public or private career , his civic or mili - tary life , which is not brought out plainly in this work .

		If , under the circumstances , the biographer has fallen in love with the character he has evolved from so much study and research , he is little to be blamed .

		A popular ^ confusion of methods , or , rather , treatment of the attempt to treat in a popular manner subjects set apart from popu - lar discussion by convention , has made Dr.
Woods Hutchinson	PERSON	's '' Gospel according to Darwin '' -LRB- The Open Court -RRB- neither popular nor scientific .

		It affords a proof of the hold which conventionality has obtained upon us , to feel a distinct sense of shock at the setting forth in everyday phrase of some forbidden topics not taken in the least amiss when clad in more scholarly phrase .

		The writer is a thorough - going Darwinian with the courage of his convictions , and rather to be suspected of an endeavor to stir up the feelings of those who cling to an older faith .

		What he says is not novel in substance nor prepossessing in form ; but it may do some good in the same way that a breaking plough does when the soil is some - what too hard for receptivity and subsequent germi - nation .

		An essay on a lost art is apt to be more curious than interesting , but '' Our Conversational Circle '' -LRB- Cen - tury Co. -RRB- is an exception to this rule .

		The author ,
Agnes H. Morton	PERSON	, applies herself , not to the decline of true conversation , but to the means of its revival , and her suggestions are , in the main , wise and prac - tical .

		She shows very clearly the nature of conversa - tion as distinguished from debate and from public address , defining it as '' the exchange of views with - out the spirit of antagonism . ''

		The book is quite deserving of the graceful praise given it by Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's introduction a praise which he sums up by saying , '' The book ought to be read because it brings into clear view a resource which many people have lost , and because it shows clearly how that re - source may be developed . ''

		DEMOCRACY A
Study of Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
JAMES H. HYSLOP	PERSON	, Ph.D. , Professor of Logic and Ethics in
Columbia Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity .

		Crown 8vo ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The present work is an attack upon Democracy by a native American who does not accept Monarchy as a necessary alternative .

		It is not merely a destructive piece of writing , but is an attempt at a thorough reconstruction of our political institutions .

		The author insists that the issue can not longer be evaded and squarely attacks democratic institutions as the first step in drawing attention to the problem before us ; and he here proposes a substitute or modification of the present form of government without favoring a reactionary policy .

		The work is destined to arouse wide discussion , especially in view of the bearing of its arguments upon the new policy of territorial expansion .

		Its method is exegetical , the study including substantially every important Scripture which contains the phrase , '' Kingdom of God . ''

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's treatment of history is from a new and entirely modern point of view .

		The well-known political leader says in his Preface that it has been his purpose to lay before his readers '' a clear narrative of the gradual development of a great people ... to note the varying forms of government , to trace the ancient origins of modern laws and customs , to mark the encroachments of absolutism upon popular rights , to describe the long continued struggle of the many to throw off the yoke of the few , to emphasize the corrupting influence of the union between
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	; to illustrate once more the blighting effects of superstition , ignorance , blind obedience , unjust laws , confiscation under the disguise of unequal taxes , and a systematic plunder year by year of the weaker classes by the stronger . ''

		The author is in very keen sympathy with the mass of the people , and for the first time we have the historical point of view of the laborer and mechanic told in a style that is bold , racy , and unconventional .

		It is a vigorous and democratic presentation of history .

		.61 THE REPORT OF
THE CHICAGO ED UCA TIONAL COMMISSION	ORGANIZATION	.

		The public schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	constitute one of the two largest city systems in the
United States	LOCATION	, and , previous to the very recent infusion of new methods and progressive ideas into the management of the
New York	LOCATION	schools , the
Chicago	LOCATION	system might fairly claim the place of first importance , both for the efficiency of its work and for its exemplification of that gener - osity of public support given to the cause of education which is the highest mark of Amer - ican civilization .

		Recently , the attention of the educational world has been focussed more sharply than ever upon the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools , owing to a series of incidents connected with the appointment of the former president of
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	to the superintendency , and to the energetic way in which Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	has asserted the prerogatives that should rightfully attach to the high office which he holds .

		Dur - ing the few months that have passed since his tenure began , he has not only impressed a vig - orous personality upon the management of the schools under his charge , but also , which is still more noteworthy , he has gained the suffrages of those who were at the outset most strongly opposed to his appointment .

		The call of Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	to
Chicago	LOCATION	, for which Mayor
Harrison	PERSON	was largely responsible , must be considered , in one sense at least , as but an incident in a far-reaching plan of school reorganization conceived by the latter early in the term of his executive office .

		For the pur - pose of giving effect to this plan , the Mayor , with the authority of the
City Council	ORGANIZATION	, ap - pointed , more than a year ago , an
Educational Commission	ORGANIZATION	of eleven members , headed by President
Harper	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		This
Commission	ORGANIZATION	was directed to make a thor - ough examination of the school system , as well as of the statutes under which it is conducted , to deliberate , with the aid of the best expert opinion anywhere obtainable , upon the changes in law and organization made desirable by the growth of the city as well as by the progress of educational methods and ideals , and to embody the conclusions reached in a report which might become the basis of future action .

		The Com - mission , consisting of members of the
Chicago	LOCATION	38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	,
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	and the
Chicago Council	ORGANIZATION	, of men prominent in affairs and the professions , entered with enthusiasm upon the work assigned it , invited suggestions from all quarters that seemed to promise help , held weekly sessions , and sometimes daily sessions , all through the year just ended , and has at last published its conclusions in a Report of nearly three hundred pages addressed to the Mayor and the
City Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		The result of all this labor is one of the most important educational documents ever produced ; it can not fail to attract widespread attention and excite deep interest wherever the importance of public education is understood .

		It affords a striking example of a necessary piece of work done in the right way , and it is much to the credit of Mayor
Harrison	PERSON	that he should have taken the initiative in this com - mendable enterprise .

		We have said more than once that of the duties incumbent upon the chief executive of a great city those which re - late to the conduct of the public schools are paramount to all others , and in the present case , as perhaps never before in the history of
Chicago	LOCATION	, the importance of these duties seems to have been realized .

		Of the Report as a whole , two or three pre - liminary general statements should be made .

		In the first place , it does not assume that things have been going badly in school affairs up to the present time , but rather gives full recogni - tion to the efficiency already attained and to the self-sacrificing devotion of past and present
Boards of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it recognizes also the fact that both the school law of the
State	ORGANIZATION	and the school machinery of the city have become defective by the mere process of be - coming outgrown .

		As is remarked by Dr.
G. F. James	PERSON	, who has served as Secretary to the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and prepared the Report for publication , '' the city has grown at a rapid rate , and in this department , as in some others , a plan of administration has been retained which , although good for a city of moderate size , is entirely inadequate for one of nearly two millions . ''

		Mayor
Harrison	PERSON	gave expres - sion to the same thought when he said , in ask - ing for authority to create the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, that '' with the continual growth of the city , addi - tional burdens keep coming to the door of the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, which is seriously handi - capped by having to deal with new conditions and difficult developments in the harness of antiquated methods . ''

		The spirit of the entire Report is thus not complainingly critical , for it aims far more at construction than at destruc - tion , and all those who have heretofore been working for the good of the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools , under adverse conditions , will find in it the fullest sympathy with what they have done , and the most cordial recognition of their disinter - ested devotion .

		A reconstruction of the school law of the
State	ORGANIZATION	is essential to the carrying out of the recommendations of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and it has been an important part of the work done by that body to draft , under competent legal advice , a new and comprehensive statute .

		Since the most important of the recommendations made find a place in the proposed new legislation , we may as well direct attention at once to those pages of the Report in which this draft of a law is found .

		It takes the form of '' an act to amend '' the act of
1889	DATE	by repealing twelve sections of the sixth article , and substituting therefor nineteen new sections .

		Applying only to cities of more than one hundred thousand inhabitants , it would affect
Chicago	LOCATION	alone , and afford one more illus - tration of the way in which the special legisla - tion , denied by the Constitution of
Illinois	LOCATION	, may be had without doing violence to the funda - mental law of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most important features of the proposed law are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- A reduc - tion of membership in the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	from twenty-one to eleven .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- The power to exercise the right of eminent domain in the ac - quisition of land needed for school purposes .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- The duty of establishing several kinds of schools not specifically named under preceding legislation .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- The creation of a defin ite status for the Superintendent , with a tenure of six years , a right to participate in the discussions of the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, and full executive power -LRB- subject only to a two-thirds vote of dis - approval -RRB- in all educational matters .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- The creation of a similar status , with ample powers , for the Business Manager .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- The creation of a
Board of Examiners	ORGANIZATION	for the purpose of cer - tificating eligible candidates for appointment and promotion .

		There are , of course , many other provisions , but these six are of prime im - portance , and deserve to be thus singled out from the rest .

		It will be evident enough to all readers who are in touch with the best edu - cational thought of the age that these recom - mendations are not merely sound , but that they are absolutely necessary for the proper admin - istration of a great municipal system of schools .

		We can hardly imagine a serious argument directed against any one of them , and no effort should be spared to give them the force of law at the earliest opportunity .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 There are , indeed , a few minor points in all this suggested legislation that may need modi - fication before the final action is taken .

		This fact is realized by the members of the Commis - sion , who unite in saying that '' the interests which are here involved are so weighty and are of such supreme import to the community that hasty and inconsiderate action in these matters is above all to be deprecated .

		We hope , there - fore , that the system of school management which is here proposed will be entirely and thoroughly reviewed , before any attempt is made to embody its provisions in the school law . ''

		These are counsels of soberness , and , while we believe that the proposed law would , as a whole , prove inestimably valuable to the interests of the public , we are in doubt con - cerning the substance of two or three among the minor provisions , and concerning the exact wording of some of the more significant ones .

		At present we will call attention to but two points , of which the first relates to appointment upon the
Board of Examiners	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		To be eligi - ble as a special examiner , an applicant must possess either a bachelor 's degree from a college or university , or an equivalent educational training , together with at least five years ' suc - cessful experience in teaching since gradua - tion . ''

		These qualifications are certainly not too high , and possibly are not high enough .

		The required number of years of experience might be doubled without doing harm , and a great deal more than the amount of education represented by the bachelor 's degree might reasonably be demanded .

		Our doubt relates to the construction of the words '' or an equiva - lent educational training . ''

		They do not seem to make sufficiently emphatic the idea that the education itself , however got , '' is the thing , '' and not the particular way in which the begin - nings of it happened to be acquired .

		The ques - tion arises , would Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, for example , who had no '' training '' in the nar - row technical sense , be eligible for appointment under this provision ?

		If he would not , some modification of the phrase is obviously called for .

		Our other point relates to the power to dismiss teachers , which is given to the Superin - tendent .

		Here is an ambiguity that should be cleared away , for the closing section of the pro- posed law provides that '' nothing herein con - tained shall be construed as repealing '' the Pension Act of
1895	DATE	.

		Now , the latter act ex - pressly declares that teachers shall not be dis - missed '' except for cause upon written charges , which shall be investigated and determined by the said
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, whose action and decision in the matter shall be final . ''

		This would certainly lead to troublesome litigation were the new law to contradict the old one as is now proposed .

		Between these two conflicting ways of dealing with this difficult question , we must decide for the law as it now stands .

		It ought to be difficult to dismiss a teacher .

		The responsibility of appointment is greater than is commonly realized , and this fact can not be brought too forcibly home to those upon whom the responsibility devolves .

		Let appointments be safe-guarded in every way , by academic and physical examinations , by certificates of moral character , by probationary periods under reg - ular supervision , but let them also , when once definitely made , bring with them the same se - curity of tenure that is enjoyed by a Federal judge .

		The retention of poor teachers in the service is a heavy penalty to pay for laxity in the methods of their appointment ; but the arbitrary power of dismissal , lodged in the hands of any one official , would embody a still greater wrong .

		We have said so much about the legislative appendix of this Report that we have but little space to devote to the elaborate discussions which make up its * substance .

		Not only the matters which reappear in the proposed law , but many others , are discussed from every point of view , and in the most elaborate fashion .

		The Report consists of an introduction , twenty arti - cles , and eleven appendices .

		Most of the articles have numerous sections , each of the latter with its own thesis , argument , and illustrative mate - rial .

		We would like to dwell at much greater length than is at present possible upon this illus - trative material .

		It appears in the form of lengthy footnotes , and consists of apposite ex - tracts from the best recent educational litera - ture , of resolutions sent to the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	by the various professional bodies of the city , and of the opinions upon special points , solicited for the purpose , of a great number of experts in the art pedagogical .

		There is nothing so discouraging as the feeling , which often comes over those who are in contact with large edu - cational systems , that the most vital thought upon the subject seems to produce no visible effect upon the machinery .

		There is so much inertia to overcome , and the impact of the force seems so inadequate .

		The right way of doing things is pointed out so clearly , as well as so frequently , that one almost wearies of reading about it ; yet the wrong way continues to be practised despite all logic and all enlightened THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, leadership .

		It is , then , peculiarly refreshing to read an educational document which , like the one before us , actually goes to the best sources for light and counsel , and seeks to make a direct practical application , upon the very largest scale , of the ideas thus obtained .

		It gives heart to the educational thinker , making him feel that his work may not have been done in vain after all , that the empty air , which seemed to swallow up his words , has really wafted them to a fruitful soil , where they may hope to be productive after their kind .

		Over and over again , in reading this Report -LRB- and we have studied it from the first page to the last -RRB- , we have found both in the argument itself and in the passages adduced in support thereof , ideas so enlightened , so far in advance of any - thing that has heretofore come within the range of practical possibilities , so full of promise to the toilers in a profession that has often been made , through wantonness or mere indiffer - ence , far more thankless than was necessary , that we have stopped to wonder if it could all be real , if in very fact it could be true that these things were actually included in a plan offered for serious consideration by a body of practically-minded men , and under auspices that bid fair to bring about its adoption .

		Upon some future occasion we shall probably call specific attention to some of these matters , as well as point out a few things here and there that seem to us mistakes , but we must now be content to conclude by saying that the Report is one of the strongest educational documents that we have ever seen ; as a model of compact statement and cogent reasoning it is a product of the trained intelligence that can not fail to impress all who examine it , and is sure to exert a wide influence upon the administration of public education in our great cities .

		THE AMERICAN REJECTION OF
POE	ORGANIZATION	.

		Accepted authors are like those old estates which were held by the annual rent of a rose or a piece of fruit : we have nothing to do but to enjoy them and pay them a passing tribute of praise .

		A poet such as
Poe	PERSON	, however , is like the feudal tenures which were retained on condition of service at arms .

		Every new admirer has to fight against the prejudices and lingering malignities which obscure and injure his chief .

		Burke complained that with all his services to the state he could get no credence or acceptance anywhere .

		At every gate he had to show his pass - port .

		In his own country , at least , Foe 's fame is continually under arrest , and his friends have always to be giving bail for him .

		Perhaps this demand for defense evokes a love and loyalty which are in them - selves a reward .

		Why is it that
America	LOCATION	has always set its face against Poe ?

		What defect was there in his life and art , or what deficiency in the American character and aesthetic sense , or what incompatibility between these factors in the case , to produce such a result ?

		That to a great extent he is ignored and repudiated is unquestionable .

		His life has been written and his works edited of late in a spirit of cold hostility .

		Volumes of specimen selections of prose or verse appear with his work omitted .

		In those foolish lists of American great men which it was the fashion recently to cause school-children to memorize , he was always left out .

		Meanwhile ,
Europe	LOCATION	has but one opinion in the matter ; and whereas
Tennyson	PERSON	is domesticated in English-speaking lands ,
Poe	PERSON	is domi - ciled and a dominant force wherever there is a living literature .

		Poe never had a good back , such as the
New England	LOCATION	writers obtained , to push him to the front and keep him there .

		He was of the South the very incarnation of the South ; and
the South	ORGANIZATION	has always ordered its authors to move on , for fear they might die on the parish .

		The South wreaked itself on politics ruined itself by politics and has never had the will or desire to stand up for its great - est son .

		The North has always had plenty of plain livers and high thinkers who ought to have wel - comed the martyr of thought and imagination ; but something exotic in
Poe	LOCATION	, which hinted of another clime and age , repelled these cold and clannish spirits .

		So , homeless in his life ,
Poe	PERSON	is still beating about like the Flying Dutchman , ever seeking and always denied a harbor in his country-people 's hearts .

		Poe had of course a part in this tragedy of errors and misconceptions , but , as I should judge , an entirely honorable one .

		There are three excellent ways in which a man can get himself disliked by his fellows : he may stand aloof from them , he may indulge in the practice of irony , and he may be '' ever right , Menenius , ever right . ''

		Poe was an offender in all these respects .

		He never seems to have had an intimate friend anyone who could do for him what Hamlet craved of Horatio with his dying breath .

		Somebody said of
Calhoun	PERSON	that he looked like one who had lost the power of communi - cating with his fellow beings .

		A like spell of isola - tion is upon
Poe	PERSON	.

		Wanting in humor , he sometimes tried to range his mind with others by the use of irony ; or he assumed an air which I suppose he thought that of a man of the world , but which is quite detestable .

		He wrote an essay on Diddling as an exact science , and people jumped to the conclusion that he was
Jeremy	PERSON	himself in person .

		He took a grim delight in scenes of horror , and people imag - ined he acted them in life . ''

		The Raven '' has been described as an utterance of remorse .

		Remorse for what ?

		I have read everything that has been gathered about
Poe	PERSON	, and I can not , for my life , imagine him as
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL anything but a stainless and chivalrous knight .

		The few , trivial , and usually unsubstantiated smutches which microscopic industry has found on his armor would not show at all against a panoply less pure and white .

		I remember reading an anecdote of a lieutenant in the
British Navy	ORGANIZATION	who entertained
Byron	PERSON	on his ship in the
Levant	LOCATION	.

		Byron was proud of his sea - manship , and the acute officer would carefully have something disarranged in the top hamper of the ship before the poet came on deck in the morn - ing .

		When the latter did so , he would cock his eye aloft and immediately discover and point out the irregularity .

		The lieutenant would apologize , and have it remedied .

		Byron liked that lieutenant , and men in general like those who give them some - thing to forgive .

		Poe , a logic machine , was abso - lutely incapable of those pleasing flaws and defi - ciencies which allow other people to have a good opinion of themselves .

		He always added up true .

		The tradition is that he was a drunkard .

		There is not evidence enough against him to hang a dog .

		All the testimony actually produced all the witnesses who give their names and addresses , people who lived with him and knew him best , deny it .

		That he was easily affected by liquor and sometimes over - come by it , is possible , and what does it matter ?

		That there was any debauchery is impossible .

		His poverty proves it the amount of work he did proves it ; and , most of all , the quality of what he wrote , which grew in power and concentration to the last .

		There is more plausibility in the accusa - tion of irregularity in money matters .

		In a life so harassed as Foe 's , a few ragged debts might easily be left .

		But here again there is nothing definite .

		Nobody has come forward with notes of hand or evidences of defalcation .

		On the contrary , letter after letter has come to light showing Foe 's scrup - ulous exactitude about obligations .

		Practically , he was cheated by almost everyone with whom he came in contact and then these , to shield themselves , cried after him '' Stop thief ! ''

		He built up two or three magazines for others , and when , dissatisfied with the pittance thrown him , he designed a maga - zine of his own , he was laughed at and decried .

		Really , my only grievance against
Poe	PERSON	is that he was too good .

		He ought to have taken to the road and compelled a just tribute at the point of the pistol .

		Foe 's principles of criticism are true enough within limits , but they are far from being the whole truth .

		His lack of humor , deficient knowledge of human nature , and insensibility to that side of great - ness which results from mere mass , quite incapaci - tated him from criticising the mightiest works of literature .

		But he never attempted such criticism ; and for the work he had to do the appreciation of our modern English or American masters he was almost infallible .

		And surely no writer has ever praised his contemporaries and rivals as he did .

		He seems to have written with no thought of self , with a humility almost pathetic .

		He may be said to have discovered
Hawthorne	PERSON	, and he crowned him king of the short story .

		His article on
Bryant	PERSON	is still a just estimate .

		The innocently imitative quality of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's genius offended him , but he speaks of the
New England	LOCATION	poet otherwise with respect , and calls him the leading poet of the day .

		He fairly returned
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's praise .

		His enthusiasm for
Tennyson	PERSON	was excessive : it was idolatry .

		He pointed out Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's faults , but wrote of her with a fervor which no one else has imitated .

		His eulogy of the singularly neglected
R. H. Home	PERSON	sets one in a glow .

		This high and generous appreciation of the best in contemporary literature was coupled with a decided distaste for trash , and , unfortunately , his calling as a critic compelled him to deal more with trash than with excellence .

		He wrote his Dunciad , and after his death the dunces had their revenge .

		Every one of
Foe	ORGANIZATION	's greater poems is a distinct and original effort .

		He could not repeat himself .

		In the case of the majority of poets , the style is the same throughout or at most they have two or three different manners .

		It would not be difficult , for example , to piece together , into a seamless whole , portions of separate poems by
Wordsworth	PERSON	or Ten - nyson .

		But each one of Foe 's is a vital entity born once , and not again .

		He is not , in poetry , one of those constellations which spread over half the sky , which hold their heads in the zenith while their skirts are obscured below the horizon , rather , he is a small compact cluster of stars .

		If we could imagine the stars of the Pleiades differently colored one red , one yellow , one green , and so forth , but each one vividly aflame in its several hue we should get a good image of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's poetry .

		He is not , like
Shelley	PERSON	, a poet of the fourth dimension , yet neither is he distinctly sensuous , and he furnishes but few copy-book maxims or proverbial phrases .

		Rather in him imagery , diction , music , merge into one effect , as fire is a compound of a hundred dif - ferent things .

		His thought , too , does not obtrude itself .

		He has , indeed , what I might call the senti - ment of profundity rather than special precision of thought .

		Poe 's tales seem to me the third collection in point of merit in literature the other two being the Arabian Nights and
Boccaccio	PERSON	.

		He has not the humor of the one nor the human nature of the other ; but he surpasses them both in depth and imagina - tion , and for originality he is unrivalled anywhere .

		No one else has opened so many paths , burst into - so many new regions of romance .

		Indeed , as one sees authors all over the world painfully following in his tracks , each one exploring a single region which
Poe	PERSON	discovered and dismissed in a few pages , one feels that he was the compendium of all possible literary pioneers and explorers a dozen
Colum	PERSON	- buses rolled into one .

		There is a small group of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's tales , usually passed over , which is worth a moment 's mention .

		It consists of '' The Power of Words , '' '' The Col - loquy of
Monus	PERSON	and Una , '' '' The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion , '' '' Shadow , a Fable , '' and 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, '' Silence , a Parable . ''

		They are not wanting in a certain alloy of De Quinceyism which at times mars Foe 's style of perfect plainness ; but they are singu - larly impressive in thought .

		They have that man - ner or sentiment of profundity which I have spoken of , more even than his poems ; and they lead up to
Poe	PERSON	's final work , '' Eureka . '' ''

		Eureka '' has , I judge , been less read than any - thing else
Poe	PERSON	wrote .

		Certainly it has been little dis - cussed .

		The average critic probably finds it difficult to place , and so lets it alone .

		It is difficult to place .

		It is too scientific for rhapsody too plain for mysticism ; and yet it is hardly either science or metaphysics .

		It might be tersely described as the ideas of Spinoza in the language of
Newton	LOCATION	.

		Poe as a thinker resembles those old Greek philosophers Pythagoras ,
Parmenides	LOCATION	, or Empedocles who chanted in verse their luminous guesses as to the origin and constitution of things , without troubling themselves as to any analysis of their knowledge .


Coleridge	PERSON	said of Spinoza that if It rather than I was the central fact of existence ,
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	would be right .

		It and not I was the basis of the Pre-Socratic Greek thinkers ; and perhaps our most modern philosophy has the same foundation .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	's substitution of Will for Consciousness as the final fact , and the Darwinian theory , both tend that way .

		Without knowing anything of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, and anterior to
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	's thought also tends that way .

		He has nothing of the mathematical pedantry of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, and of course none of the immense sci - entific detail of the evolutionists ; but I do not see why his guess is not as good as theirs .

		In one very startling idea he seems to have been anticipated .

		Deducing that the Universe is finite mainly be - cause laws can not be conceived to exist in the unlimited he goes on to say there may yet exist other worlds and other universes , each in the bosom of its own private and peculiar God .

		Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	is authority for the statement that
Franklin	PERSON	used to dally with this idea in conversation .

		Poe , while in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, may possibly have heard of
Franklin	PERSON	's speculation .

		I can recall nothing like it elsewhere .

		I have not space to follow
Poe	PERSON	into the other spheres of his intellectual activity into his studies in Landscape Gardening and
Household Decoration	ORGANIZATION	, on Versification and the
Philosophy of Composition	ORGANIZATION	, and much else .

		Poe , in my judgment , was the great - est intellect
America	LOCATION	has produced assuredly the best artist .

		He reminds me of a sower stalking down a furrow and scattering broadcast seed which a mul - titude of crows attendant upon him appropriate to their own use and behoof without a single croak of thanks .

		In a crude new world , a spirit was born to whom even the old world , where time has mellowed and enriched men 's lives by layer on layer of myth and metaphysic , drift after drift of legend and his - tory , decay above decay of citadels and cities and empires , to whom even this soil and surrounding would have seemed harsh and strange .

		The crude new world could make nothing of this spirit , except that it was not worth while to waste good provisions on such an uninvited guest , and that it was best to huddle him into his grave with lies .

		But enough !

		The little that
Poe	PERSON	got is gone .

		The much that he gave remains a glory forever .

		THE
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	MEETING OF THE MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION .

		The most important feature of the sixteenth annual meeting of the
Modern Language Association of Amer	ORGANIZATION	- ica , which was held
December 27	DATE	, 28 , and 29 , in the buildings of the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, at
Charlottes	PERSON	- ville , was the announcement of the completion of the Report of the
Committee of Twelve	ORGANIZATION	, which had been appointed
two years ago	DATE	at the meeting held in
Cleve	LOCATION	- land .

		As stated in the resolution creating the Com - mittee , the object was , '' -LRB- a -RRB- to consider the position of the Modern Languages French and German in Secondary Education ; -LRB- ft -RRB- to examine into and make recommendations upon methods of instruction , the train - ing of teachers , and such other questions connected with the teaching of the Modern Languages in the Secondary Schools and the Colleges as in the judgment of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	may require consideration . ''

		The personnel of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	was as follows : Prof.
Calvin Thomas	PERSON	,
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, Chairman ;
E. H. Babbitt	PERSON	,
Secre	PERSON	- tary ;
B. L. Bowen	PERSON	,
H. C. G. Brandt	PERSON	,
W. H. Carruth	PERSON	,
S. W. Cutting	PERSON	,
A. M. Elliott	PERSON	,
C. H. Grandgent	PERSON	,
G. A. Hench	PERSON	,
H. A. Rennert	PERSON	,
W. B. Snow	PERSON	, and
B. W. Wells	PERSON	.

		The Report is about twenty-five thousand words in length , and its presentation in full was therefore impos - sible .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	gave a summary , which showed the thoroughness with which every phase of the subject had been studied , and indicated conclusively that the document must be considered as final and decisive for many of the points investigated .

		The historical part of the paper is of very great interest , while the con - structive value of the suggestions will depend upon their general adoption .

		The Report has been asked for by the
United States Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, and will doubtless be published in the series of educational pub - lications .

		It will be finally acted upon by the
Associa	LOCATION	- tion at its next annual meeting .

		The attendance at the meeting was in round numbers one hundred , which must be regarded as a large repre - sentation .

		The various
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	universities and colleges all sent good delegations .

		Harvard had an unusually strong representation , while
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	contributed materially to the success of the meeting .

		As was to be expected , the Southern colleges were also represented in large numbers .

		The great number of papers read made it necessary to limit each speaker to twenty minutes .

		This was felt to be a hardship by some of the delegates , but most of those who came with papers had reduced their studies to the form of abstracts or presented merely a part of their investigations .

		To these the shortness of the time allowed was in no sense an inconvenience .

		An unusual number of the papers had more than special interest , and there can be observed from year to year a distinct effort to select topics which will be of value to the larger body of the delegates present .

		Until this effort is con - sistently carried out , the reading of the essays will not attract the attention that they in most cases merit .

Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the year
1900	DATE	.

		The election of Professor
H. C. G. von Jagemann	PERSON	, one of the founders of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, to the Presidency for next year was generally regarded as peculiarly ap - propriate .

		The other changes in officers included merely the substitution of Messrs.
L. E. Menger	PERSON	,
H. S. White	PERSON	, and W. D. Toy , for Messrs.
C. T. Winchester	PERSON	,
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, and
A. R. Hohlfeld	PERSON	, on the
Executive Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		The social arrangements , which were in the hands of the local committee , Professors
Charles W. Kent	PERSON	,
James A. Harrison	PERSON	, and
Paul B. Barringer	PERSON	, included two very handsome receptions , a luncheon , and an excursion to the home of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	at
Monticello	LOCATION	.

		The gen - uine Southern hospitality accorded on all hands to the members contributed greatly to the success of one of the best meetings ever held by
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE
NEBRASKA	LOCATION	MEETING OF THE CENTRAL MODERN LANGUAGE ASSOCIATION .

		The fourth annual meeting of the
Central Division of the Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	was held
December 27	DATE	, 28 , and 29 , in the library building of the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	, at
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		There was a relatively small attendance , as was to be expected at a meeting held so far to one side of the district , yet there was a representation of many states and of all the departments interested .

		Moreover , there was some gain in the way of closer contact and greater freedom of intercourse and discussion , due perhaps to the smaller circle .

		Doubtless one element in determining the choice of Lincoln as a meeting-place was the presence of that veteran scholar , Professor
Edgren	PERSON	, and his participation was a powerful attraction of the sessions .

		In addition to the address by the President , Professor
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	, of the
University of Louisiana	ORGANIZATION	, on '' The Work of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' the following papers were read : '' Certain Peculiarities of the Structure of the I-Novel , '' by Miss
Katherine Mer	PERSON	- rill , of
Austin	LOCATION	, 111 .

		; '' The Root-changing Verbs in Span - ish '' and '' Historical Dictionaries , '' by Professor
A. H. Edgren	PERSON	, of the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	; ``
Leonard Cox	PERSON	and the First English Rhetoric , '' by Dr.
F. I. Carpenter	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	; `` Tense Limitations of the Modal Auxiliaries in German , '' by Professor
W. H. Carruth	PERSON	, of the
University of Kansas	ORGANIZATION	; '' The Poetic Value of Long Words , '' by Professor
A. H. Tolman	PERSON	, of the

H. M. Belden	PERSON	, of the
University	ORGANIZATION	of
Missouri	LOCATION	; and '' The Concord of Collectives , '' by Professor
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	, of
the University of Louisiana	ORGANIZATION	.

		Several other papers that were announced did not arrive in time to be presented , or were read by title .

		In addition to these papers , Professor
Starr W. Cutting	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, on behalf of the
Committee of Twelve	ORGANIZATION	, pre - sented its report on
Entrance Requirements	ORGANIZATION	in Modern Languages .

		This is a committee of the whole
Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , which has been working for two years on the sub - ject named , and the report , which is to be printed by the
National Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, will probably go far toward establishing approximate standards in modern language teaching , while tending to improve the quality of the work done as well as of the ideals for the future .

		It would be impossible in the space of such a notice as this even to mark the striking features of the many interesting papers read .

		Besides the scholarly and charming address of the President , some of the papers that aroused particular interest and discussion were those by Miss
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Morton	PERSON	, Dr.
Allen	PERSON	, and Dr.
Carpenter	PERSON	.

		President
Smith	PERSON	and Secretary
Schmidt	PERSON	-

		BOOK DISTRIBUTION : A SUGGESTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your editorial of
January 1	DATE	on the
Distribution of Books	ORGANIZATION	reminds me of a letter which I had in my hands a year or two ago , in which Mr.
Caleb Atwater	PERSON	gave a contemporaneous account of his method of disposing of his '' History of
Ohio	LOCATION	. ''

		He simply loaded the edition into a wagon , took the lines into his own hands , and drove up and down the settled portions of the state dis - posing of copies wherever he could find a buyer , as any honest farmer might dispose of his surplus cabbages .

		There was no furnishing of innumerable copies to hun - gry reviewers , no tribute to the newspapers for adver - tising , no division of income with the middle-man in any shape or form .

		Now here is a bonanza for some literary celebrity who is bold enough to embrace it .

		Imagine Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	drawing up to your door in a Roman chariot with a supply of ''
Ave Roma Immortalis	PERSON	, '' or Mr.
Manilla Garland	PERSON	in an ox-cart with his newest illustra - tion of Western freshness and unconventionality in lit - erature , or Mr.
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	in a jinrikisba with a lap full of his latest Japanese studies , or Colonel Roosevelt dashing up on a mustang with a knapsack full of his forthcoming '' Rough Riders '' and a commissary wagon with the rest of the edition following behind !

		Who could resist the temptation to buy , especially when the distinguished author could without any extra charge put his autograph on the fly-leaf while you were fumbling in your pockets for the money ?

		We have been told again and again that the production of literature is a business and should be conducted on business principles , and we have seen a growing tendency to adopt any method of securing a market which has proved success - ful in other lines of business : now here is something which will be an attractive novelty to a novelty-loving generation , let us see who will be the first to start .

		44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	,
UNEXPLORED ASIA	LOCATION	.

		* The appetite of the public , which has been whetted for Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	's book , `` Through
Asia	LOCATION	, '' by some preliminary tid-bits , can now judge of the feast as a whole .

		Certainly we find here an interesting record of very large achievements , perhaps we might say unique achievements , in exploration .

		By quite primitive means of travel , Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	, between
1893	DATE	and
1897	DATE	, covered more than 6500 miles of rough and desert country , and over
2000	DATE	miles of this was through regions wholly unexplored , while the rest was only very partially known through one , two , or at the most three predecessors .

		The field of Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	's very remarkable exploits was the largest unknown territory on the globe .

		We know more of
Central Africa	LOCATION	, perhaps even of
Central South America	LOCATION	, than of the vast central plateau of
Asia	LOCATION	, called the Pamirs , and of the great mountain systems radiating thence , the Hindu-Kush , Kwen-Lun , Kara-Korum , and
Himalayas	LOCATION	.

		In these stu - pendous solitudes , in the immense weird wastes of this '' Roof of the World , '' amidst awful scenery , more lunar than terrestrial , Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	, alone save for a few native guides , journeyed for months and years , observing , measuring , and mapping , with unfaltering scientific enthu - siasm .

		The most salient episode in these volumes is undoubtedly Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	's account of his well - nigh disastrous trip across a portion of the
Gobi Desert	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lost in the desert , he records in his diary ,
April 30 , 1895	DATE	: '' Rested on a bigh dune , where the camels gave up .

		We scanned the eastern horizon with a field-glass nothing but mountains of sand in every direction ; not a blade of vegetation , not a sign of life .

		Nothing heard of
Yollehi	LOCATION	, either in the evening or during the night .

		My men maintained he had gone back to the stores we had left behind , intending to keep himself alive on the tinned provisions , while he fetched help to carry off the rest .

		Islam believed he was dead .

		There were still a few drops of water left from the
morning	TIME	, about a tum - blerful in all .

		Half of this was used in moistening the men 's lips .

		The little that remained was to be divided equally between us all in the
evening	TIME	.

		But when even - ing came we discovered that
Kasim	PERSON	and
Mohammed Shah	PERSON	, who led the caravan , had stolen every drop !

		We were all terribly weak , men as well as camels .

		God help us all ! ''

		The days immediately succeeding were ter - rible days , most of his men and animals per - * THROUGH ASIA .

		ishing with thirst .

		At length , on
May 5	DATE	, his faithful companion Kasim failed him , and he crawled and hobbled painfully through a forest to the dry bed of the
Khotan-daria River	LOCATION	.

		However , after searching he found a pool in a thicket . ''

		It would be in vain for me to try to describe the feelings which now overpowered me .

		They may be imagined ; they can not be described .

		Before drinking I counted my pulse : it was forty-nine .

		Then I took the tin box out of my pocket , filled it , and drank .

		How sweet that water tasted !

		Nobody can conceive it who has not been within an ace of dying of thirst .

		I lifted the tin to my lips , calmly , slowly , deliberately , and drank , drank , drank , time after time .

		How delicious !

		What exquisite pleasure !

		The noblest wine ever pressed out of the grape , the divinest nectar ever made , was never half so sweet .

		My hopes had not deceived me .

		The star of my fortunes shone brightly as ever it did .

		I do not think that I at all exaggerate if I say that dur - ing the first ten minutes I drank between five and six pints .

		The tin box held not quite an ordinary tumbler - ful , and I emptied it quite a score of times .

		At that moment it never entered my head that , after such a long fast , it might be dangerous to drink in such a quantity .

		But I experienced not the slightest ill effects from it .

		On the contrary , I felt that cold , clear , delicious water infused new energy into me .

		Every blood-vessel and tissue of my body sucked up the life-giving liquid like a sponge .

		My pulse , which had been so feeble , now beat strong again .

		At the end of a few minutes it was already fifty-six .

		My blood , which had lately been so sluggish and so slow that it was scarce able to creep through the capillaries , now coursed easily through every blood-vessel .

		My hands , which had been dry , parched , and hard as wood , swelled out again .

		My skin , which had been like parchment , turned moist and elastic .

		And soon afterwards an active prespiration broke out upon my brow .

		In a word , I felt my whole body was imbib - ing fresh life and fresh strength .

		It was a solemn and awe-inspiring moment . ''

		Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	then filled his water-proof boots with the water , and went back for Kasim , but did not find him till the following morning . ''

		When I came to
Kasim	LOCATION	, he was lying in the same position in which I left him .

		He glared at me with the wild , startled eyes of a faun ; but upon recognizing me , made an effort , and crept a yard or two nearer , gasping out , ' I am dying . ' '

		Would you like some water ? '

		I asked , quite calmly .

		He merely shook his head , and collapsed again .

		He had no conception of what was in the boots .

		I placed one of the boots near him , and shook it so that he might hear the splashing of the water .

		He started , uttered an inarticulate cry ; and when I put the boot to his lips , he emptied it at one draught without once stopping ; and the next moment he emptied the second . ''

		Having revived Kasim and started him toward the pool , Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	set out to find assistance , and proceeded along the river bed for more than two days , subsisting on grass , reeds , and frogs , and drinking from occasional pools , till he fell in with some shepherds , and at length
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 recovered
Kasim	PERSON	and a second companion
Islam Bai	PERSON	, and one camel with its load .

		Another salient episode is the account of the discovery of buried cities in the Gobi desert .

		Of these cities other travellers have reported rumors , but Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	is , we believe , the first traveller to find and explore them .

		He found a portion of the desert which contained dead forests , dead rivers , their beds filled with sand , and dead and buried cities .

		A flourishing re - gion had been engulfed by the ever-shifting sands .

		Of the first city he says : '' This city of Takla-raakan , for that is the name my guides gave to it we will retain the name , for it is instinct with a wealth of mysterious secrets , of puzzling problems , which it is reserved for future inquiry to solve this city , of whose existence no European had hitherto any inkling , was one of the most unexpected discoveries that I made throughout the whole of my travel in
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Who could have imagined that in the interior of the dread Desert of
Gobi	ORGANIZATION	, and precisely in that part of it which in dreariness and desolation ex - ceeds all other deserts on the face of the earth , actual cities slumbered under the sand , cities wind-driven for thousands of years , the ruined survivals of a once flour - ishing civilization ?

		And yet there stood I amid the wreck and devastation of an ancient people , within whose dwellings none had entered save the sandstorm in its days of maddest revelry ; there stood I like the Prince in the enchanted wood , having awakened to new life the city which had slumbered for a thousand years , or at any rate rescued the memory of its existence from oblivion . ''

		He gives reasons , from the remains found , for thinking that this city dates back perhaps
1500	DATE	years and was the work of Buddhistic Aryans .

		Further on in the desert another city was found .

		The party continued on the way to the north across the desert , and fell in with numbers of wild camels , which , however , Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	thinks are descended from tame animals .

		He crossed the desert successfully , reaching the
Tarim River	LOCATION	, and explored in the region of the Lop - nor Lakes .

		In one marshy place he notes that the reeds were '' As tightly packed together as the palings in a wooden palisade .

		In some places they were indeed so densely matted together , and so strong , that we actually walked along the top of the tangled mat they made , without for a single instant being reminded that there was ten feet of water immediately under our feet . ''

		Shortly after this expedition he made his final trip , going through unexplored
Northern Tibet	LOCATION	and Tsaidam to
China	LOCATION	.

		In this high barren plateau region he travelled for two months with - out seeing men , and even animals were rather rare .

		He describes quite fully the wild asses and wild yaks .

		The latter he pictures as the Royal monarch of the desolate wilds of
Tibet	LOCATION	an animal which excites our admiration not only in virtue of its imposing appearance , but also because it alone of living creatures is able to defy the loftiest altitudes , the bitterest cold , the most violent snow-storms and hail - storms which occur in any part of the earth .

		To all these things the wild yak is indifferent .

		He seems rather to enjoy it when the hail pelts down upon his back ; and when the snows envelope him in their blind - ing whirl he goes on quietly grazing as though nothing were the matter .

		The only extremity of climate which seems to disturb his equanimity is the
summer	DATE	sunshine .

		When it gets too warm for him he takes a bath in the nearest stream , climbs up the mountains to the cool ex - panses of the snow-fields and the curving hollows of the glaciers , where he finds an especial pleasure in rolling himself , and lying down to rest in the powdery snows of the neves '' In this Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	rather forgets the musk-ox , which has similar habits .

		We could wish that Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	had given a fuller account of the natives of the various countries he visited ; but his notices of them are mainly incidental .

		He throws , however , some light on the Kirghiz of the Pamirs , and on the shepherds , hunters , and fishermen of the
Tarim Basin	LOCATION	, and we have some interesting and even amusing accounts of the Chinese in
Turke	LOCATION	- stan .

		He thus describes a Chinese dinner at Kashgar : '' I recollect something about an ancient Greek deity who swallowed his own offspring .

		I have read in Persian legend about the giant Zohak , who devoured two men 's brains every day at a meal !

		I have heard rumors of certain African savages who invite missionaries to din - ner and give their guests the place of honor inside the pot .

		I have been set agape by stories of monstrous big eaters , who at a single meal could dispose of broken ale-bottles , open pen-knives , and old boots .

		But where are all these things as compared with a Chinese dinner of state , with its six-and-forty courses , embracing the most extraordinary products of the animal and vegetable worlds it is possible to imagine ?

		For one thing , to mention no more , you need to be blessed with an extra - ordinarily fine appetite or else be a Chinaman to appreciate smoked ham dripping with molasses ... On one of the walls there were painted two or three black flourishes .

		I enquired what they signified , and was told that they meant , ' Drink and tell racy stories . '

		There was no need for any such admonition , for the spirit which reigned over the company was so hilarious , and we transgressed so wantonly against the strict rules of Chinese etiquette , that the
Dao Tai	PERSON	and his compa - triots must surely have blushed for us a score of times had not their skins been from infancy as yellow as sun - dried haddocks . ''

		As to the accessories and manufacture of these volumes , we have a word of criticism .

		The many illustrations from photographs and sketches are fairly good , and the maps are ex - cellent .

		The map of the route is divided into two parts , one being appended to each volume ; but it would have served the reader much better to have had one large map of the whole in a 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, pocket .

		The volumes are bulky and heavy , and the paper so highly glazed as to be un - pleasant and even painful to the eye .

		We wish our American publishers could take lessons from the English in these regards , say from
Bentley	LOCATION	, whose books are both easy to the hand and a delight to the eye .

		As to the matter , the main defect of this work of
1200	DATE	pages is , strange to say , its undue brevity .

		The author evidently has abundance of material for a half-dozen such books , and , in the effort to cover the ground in one , the work suffers greatly from compression .

		A sketchy summary takes us along too fast .

		We do not want to ride at sixty miles an hour through charming scenery .

		Besides , in his endeavor to address both scientists and the general public , Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	fails to satisfy either fully .

		If he could have devoted one volume to his journeys in the
Gobi Desert	ORGANIZATION	, written up on the same detailed scale as that used to de - scribe his narrow escape from death on his first journey , and if he had given a second volume to a scientific summary of all his travels , it might have been an improvement .

		However , Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	has certainly shown that he is one of the most remarkable explorers of this cen - tury , and this book is much the most important work on
Central Asia	LOCATION	that has appeared of recent years , and so deserves the attention of the specialist and the general reader alike .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		MR.
LESLIE STEPHEN	PERSON	'S STUDIES OF A BIOGRAPHER .

		* Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	always amply repays us for time spent in his perusal , and this is emi - nently true of .

		his latest work , a collection , in two handsome volumes , of recent essays and occasional addresses which have in most cases already appeared in different periodicals .

		The contents embrace a range of subjects as wide apart as the causes of
Scott	PERSON	's financial ruin and the history of the English newspaper , and a space of time bounded by
Pascal	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		The introductory essay , entitled '' National Biography , '' suggests Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's editorship of '' The Dictionary of National Biography , '' which contains the fruits of so many years of his literary activity .

		The author starts out by quoting a contemptuous remark of Cowper on * STUDIES OF A BIOGRAPHER .

		By
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Q. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		the ''
Biographia Britannica	PERSON	, '' the forerunner of the '' Dictionary , '' that it was '' A fond attempt to give a deathless lot To names ignoble , born to be forgot . ''

		With reference to his own labors in increasing the length of this long procession of the hope - lessly insignificant , Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	first looks at the matter from the point of view of a certain
Simon Browne	PERSON	, a Non-conformist divine of the last century , who had received a terrible shock of such a nature that his mind became affected . ''

		He fancied that his ' spiritual substance ' had been annihilated ; he was a mere empty shell , a body without a soul . ''

		Under these distress - ing circumstances he turned to an employment which did not require a soul : he became a dic - tionary-maker !

		The author then proceeds to justify his own dictionary-making in a delight - ful essay , which might very well be the preface to the '' Dictionary of National Biography . ''

		The sound sense is spiced with biographical lore , which no soulless dictionary-maker of the
Browne	PERSON	variety could ever have amassed .

		The study entitled ''
John Byrom	PERSON	'' is a prac - tical illustration of Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's belief in & justification of rescuing pastworthies from ob - livion .

		Every reader will thank him heartily for reviving the memory of a man who , to his long-forgotten merits , has added the new one of calling forth a most enjoyable essay from one of the best of living prose writers .

		The reader also learns , if he did not already know -LRB- as probably he did not -RRB- , who was the author of '' tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee . '' ''

		Johnsoniana '' is primarily a review of the '' Johnsonian Miscellanies , '' the concluding vol - ume of Dr.
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	's great work on the life of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	; secondarily , although first in point of interest , it is a resume of
Johnson	PERSON	- ian anecdotes not to be found in
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's Life .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	has brought together most inter - esting extracts from
Miss Reynolds	PERSON	, who em - phasizes the '' asperous '' side of her brother 's friend , from Mrs.
Piozzi	PERSON	,
Madame D'Arblay	PERSON	, and other lesser lights of the Johnsonian circle .

		In a few keen sentences the author analyzes the genius which made a vain little toady the most celebrated of modern biographers .

		The essay is a valuable supplement to the author 's own '' Life of
Johnson	PERSON	. ''

		Two of the articles are valuable as sources of information . ''

		THE DIAL 47 tation of German '' is a brief account of the intro - duction of the German language and literature into
England	LOCATION	.

		It suggests a similar history of the importation of German into
America	LOCATION	.

		The study of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, originally delivered as an address before an academic body , is full of interest as coming from a man of an entirely different intellectual type .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	insists , with frequent repetition , that he is himself a good
Philistine	LOCATION	, that he certainly would have been pronounced such by
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		This is , of course , a pardonable bit of self - banter that we do not take seriously ; but the lack of intellectual sympathy is unmistakable .

		As the author himself puts it , it is the funda - mental difference between the poetic and the prosaic , or , as we would say , scientific mind .

		While expressing the highest esteem for Ar - nold , whom he knew personally , Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	can not help regarding him as the '' over-fastid - ious don , '' and must have his little fling at '' intellectual coxcombry and dandyism . ''

		His contempt for that great '' movement '' which was so potent a factor in
Arnold	LOCATION	's development , he does not conceal .

		Nevertheless , he renders full justice to
Arnold	LOCATION	's powers as poet and critic , and freely acknowledges his services as the prophet of culture .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's criti - cism of
Arnold	LOCATION	's criticism is keen and search - ing .

		Arnold 's strength as a critic was also his weakness .

		He was '' too much inclined to trust to his intuitions , as if they were equivalent to scientific and measurable statements . ''

		Instead of scientific analysis , we are told ,
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's pro- cess was to fix a certain aspect of things by an appropriate phrase , thus substituting one set of prejudices for another .

		These '' appropriate phrases '' are repeated to weariness , '' with a certain air of laying down a genuine scientific distinction as clear-cut and unequivocal as a chemist 's analysis . ''

		Arnold 's merits as a critic are thus summed up : '' His criticism is anything but final , but it is to be taken into account by every man who believes in the importance of really civilising the coming world .

		How the huge all-devouring monster which we call Democ - racy is to be dealt with , how he is to be coaxed or lec - tured or preached into taking as large a dose as possible of culture , is really one of the most pressing of prob - lems .

		Some look on with despair , doubting only by whatever particular process we shall be crushed into a dead level of monotonous mediocrity .

		I do not suppose that Arnold or anyone else could give any solution of the great problems ; what he could do , and did , I think more effectually than anyone , was to wake us out of our dull complacency to help to break through the solid crust , whatever seeds may be sown by other hands . ''

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	has naturally little or no sym - pathy with
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's criticism of religion .

		As a member of the '' prosaic class of mankind , '' he does not think that
Arnold	LOCATION	has solved the great problem by relegating religion to the sphere of poetry .

		The prosaic mind -LRB- and the majority of mankind are prosaic -RRB- requires plain state - ments of facts as well as poetic statements of moral ideals .

		Arnold 's mode of treating great problems is too '' airy and bewildering '' for Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's acceptance ; the poet has got the upper hand of the critic .

		Whether the reader will agree with this estimate of the great apostle of culture , will depend a good deal on his hav - ing the prosaic or the poetic temperament .

		But whatever his personal attitude to
Arnold	LOCATION	, he will feel the sincerity of Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's con - cluding remark : '' Putting on a mask , sometimes of levity , sometimes of mere literary dandyism , with an irony which some - times is a little too elaborate , but which often expresses the keenest intelligence trying to pass itself off as sim - plicity , he was a skirmisher , but a skirmisher who did more than most heavily-armed warriors , against the vast oppressive reign of stupidity and prejudice . ''

		The essay on
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	is another brilliant piece of criticism .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	is not an un - qualified admirer of the late Laureate , or , as he himself puts it , '' not quite of the inner circle of true worshippers . ''

		He can not call him a vates .

		His own type of mind prevents this , his intellectual dissent from
Tennyson	LOCATION	being as marked as in the case of
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		He does not like
Tennyson	PERSON	's philosophy ; in his judgment the poet `` is always haunted by the fear of depriving your sister of her ' happy views , ' and praises a philosopher for keeping his doubts to himself . '' ''

		Tennyson , even in the In Memoriam , always seems to me to be like a man clinging to a spar left floating after a shipwreck , knowing that it will not support him , and yet never able to make up his mind to strike out and take his chance of sinking .

		That may be infinitely affecting , but it is not the attitude of the poet who can give a war-cry to his followers , or of the philosopher who really dares to ' face the spectres of the mind . ' ''

		Those who have read Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's essay entitled '' An Apology for Plainspeaking '' will understand this criticism more fully .

		In
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's phrase , it is the judgment of incompatibility , and but few would be willing to accept it as a final word on
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	.

		u The judgment of gratitude and sympathy '' and that of conscientious incompatibility must supple - ment and rectify each other .

		The ardent
Tenny	PERSON	- sonian will resent an estimate of the Laureate which excludes him from the rank of the '' great sage poets , '' but can hardly refuse to accept the explanation of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's extraordinary popu - THE DIAL -LSB-

		CHINA IN HISTORY AND IN FACT .

		* Now that the ancient empire of the
Middle Kingdom	LOCATION	seems to be crumbling in decay , a History of
China	LOCATION	which bears evidence of con - scientious study and a judicial habit of mind deserves a cordial welcome .

		Such appears to be the character of the work which Mr.
Boul	PERSON	- ger reissues after a thorough revision .

		The narrative is well sustained , the style lucid , and the author has done what he could to relieve from dulness a work constructed upon the lines which the scope of this history required .

		The sources of all ancient history lie in the realms of myths and mystery ; and we can not expect Chinese history to be an exception .

		It is a comfort to learn that we may go back so far before we strike the debatable border-land .

		The first ruler of
China	LOCATION	who seems to have se - cured for his nation a position of influence was one
Hwangti	PERSON	, who lived 2637-2577 B. C .

		It is said of him that he subdued his enemies , built roads for traffic and ships for commerce , revised the calendar , regulated weights , meas - ures , and provinces upon a decimal system , and that to his inspirations and aspirations much of the subsequent glory of
China	LOCATION	may be attrib - uted .

		There is also mention of an earlier Em - peror ,
Fohi	PERSON	, whose date was
2950	DATE	B. C. , and whose authenticity was approved by
Confucius	ORGANIZATION	.

		These dates take us at a bound beyond most of the periods whose history we are accustomed to consider ancient .

		They reach beyond the founding of
Rome	LOCATION	, the siege of Troy , the sheik - ship of
Abraham	LOCATION	, five hundred years beyond
Sargon of Babylon	ORGANIZATION	, to the time of Amenemhat * THE HISTORY OF
CHINA	LOCATION	.

		of
Egypt	LOCATION	, when
Thebes	LOCATION	was in her glory .

		From the reign of Hwangti until this day the sceptre has not departed from
China	LOCATION	.

		For more than four and a half millenniums , the
Middle King	LOCATION	- dom has been governed by a continuous suc - cession of rulers , numbering nearly two hun - dred and sixty princes belonging to twenty - eight dynasties .

		Other than Chinamen have sat upon the throne , including Tartars , Mon - gols , and Manchus ; but the ruler of
China	LOCATION	has always been within
China	LOCATION	.

		She was never the vassal of a government seated in a foreign land .

		The position of
China	LOCATION	is , and has always been , geographically unique .

		She has occupied the broad area of southeastern
Asia	LOCATION	, a country well watered and fertile , diversified in aspect , climate , soil , and productions , unrivalled in its capacity to support a teeming population .

		Northwardly this country extended to arctic
Siberia	LOCATION	, inhabited by nomadic and untutored tribes ; east and south lay the oriental seas , which until the fifteenth century were never fur - rowed by an occidental keel ; to the southwest were a few disunited peoples with no cohesion to make them formidable ; while along the western borders lay the vast mountain ranges of the
Himalayah	PERSON	and the Karakorum , the '' roof of the world , '' which no western horde ever traversed , and none from the east ever passed save when
Genghis Khan	PERSON	led his victorious Mongols beyond the remotest borders of the Caspian and the
Euxine	LOCATION	seas , to the conquest of
Russia	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	, and
Poland	LOCATION	.

		China was thus enclosed within a large but limited area , and this area she usually domin - ated .

		Her quarrels were with the neighbors who dwelt with her within these natural boundaries .

		Otherwise she had no commerce nor contact with the nations of the world .

		Children who grow up in isolation lack a certain sturdy discipline gained in conflicts with other children .

		It is not strange that
China	LOCATION	should come to estimate at more than its true value her culture , her prowess , and her right of empire .

		Until the
earlier years of the seventeeth century	DATE	the lit - terati of
China	LOCATION	had not learned that the round world had another side , where dwelt people both strong and learned .

		Still less did they imagine that such people would come to chal - lenge their authority or to disturb the internal economy of their empire .

		During twenty-seven of her twenty-eight dy - nasties ,
China	LOCATION	was self-contained .

		Her political history , which is all that Mr.
Boulger	PERSON	attempts to give , is merely an account of the rise and demise of families and princes .

		Kingti sue -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 ceeded
Wenti	PERSON	and was succeeded by
Vouti	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some rulers were good , some bad , some worse .

		The only parallel is the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of
Israel	LOCATION	.

		No one can realize the utter nakedness of history sitting in the rattling panoply of her bones , so fully as when he fol - lows this procession of two hundred and fifty kings in their weary march through five hun - dred octavo pages .

		There is little sign of flesh and blood , of the humanity that lived and loved or hated and suffered in those ancient days .

		A new element entered into the life of
China	LOCATION	when the western nations , in their quest of dis - covery , trade , and colonies , began to push their ships into Chinese ports .

		For two centuries these nations came in peaceful ways upon mis - sions of peace .

		They asked the privilege of trade , to buy the commodities which
China	LOCATION	had in abundance to sell ; to sell such merchandise as Chinamen might wish to buy .

		Especially did they wish that their representatives might be received by the Emperor , and might treat on equal and honorable terms with function - aries of suitable rank whom he might deign to appoint .

		From the first the western nations determined to allow their representatives to submit to no ceremony degrading in form or meant to typify homage or vassalage towards a superior .

		For a long time the Chinese author - ities evidenced a purpose not to permit any approach to the emperor under other conditions .

		There was also a rooted aversion to trade .

		The Chinese feared and believed that the bal - ance of trade would be against them ; that her people would buy more than they could sell , the balance to be paid by the withdrawal of coin , which they were convinced would result in bankruptcy .

		They had not learned that trade begets trade .

		From time to time these conflicts of ideas developed into conflicts of arms , in which the Chinese were unable to contend successfully .

		The first passage at arms was with
England	LOCATION	in
1840	DATE	.

		Unfortunately , the admission of opium was one of the points at issue .

		As to this , Mr.
Boulger	PERSON	contends , and with apparent reason , that the opium question was raised by the Chi - nese only as a pretext .

		In the discussions which preceded the appeal to arms , English merchants gave up opium to the amount of
$ 10,000,000	MONEY	for confiscation ; but the lives of eighteen En - glishmen , to be yielded without trial or pro- cess of law , they would not concede .

		After a critical study of the facts , our own ex-President
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	asserted that the real issue of this so-called opium war was not opium but the Kotow , and that the English were in the right .

		The English were victorious , and a treaty of amity was negotiated at
Nankin	LOCATION	, only to be evaded , and its ratification avoided , until , in a later resort to arms , the English forced the defenses at
Pekin	LOCATION	and dictated terms of sur - render .

		Conflicts with other nations have re - sulted in like misfortune to the Chinese .

		An interesting chapter describes the rise and progress of the
Taeping Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	, and its desultory character , too weak to succeed , yet fighting a government too weak to overcome it .

		An American named
Ward	ORGANIZATION	collected and drilled a force of 5000 Chinese , to which he gave , by way of bravado , the name of the Ever
Victo	PERSON	- rious
Army	ORGANIZATION	, a name which it presently earned the right to wear .

		Ward was killed in action .

		His successor , an adventurer named Burgevine , after hiring himself in turn to both rebels and the imperial power , was repudiated by both .

		Then began the remarkable career of one Cap - tain
Charles Gordon	PERSON	, afterwards known as '' Chinese ''
Gordon	PERSON	.

		He gathered , drilled , disciplined , and fought an army of Chinese with phenomenal success , and destroyed the rebellion .

		His sad fortune when , in
Africa	LOCATION	, he was abandoned to the fury of the Mahdists , is too well remembered .

		The story of the war with
Japan	LOCATION	, sharp , short , and decisive , is told with a true appre - ciation of this highly dramatic event .

		The lessons taught by this war only repeat those which should have been learned before .

		Under stress of suffering ,
China	LOCATION	spent her treasure for weapons of the best manufacture , ships of the most approved design , and fortresses which by nature and art should have been impregnable .

		The only use she has been able to make of her forts , her ships , and her guns , is to hand them over to her victorious foes .

		Her soldiers can fight under proper officers , and they can die ; but they did not avail against the Japanese .

		Her officers and diplomats appear to be equally deficient .

		Defeats teach them no principles of public policy .

		The logic of artillery is effect - ive only within the range of the piece .

		The distressing feature of the Chinese situ - ation exists in the conditions of its intellectual life .

		For centuries this has suffered from a sort of creeping paralysis .

		It is permeated by an intellectual dry-rot , which has consumed all personal , social , and political vitality .

		The ex - terior may have been fair to see , but when the armor of exclusiveness is pierced the whole structure crumbles .

		The cause of the disease 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	r must be coextensive with the disease .

		It will be found in the combined systems of civil ser - vice and of education .

		Much has been heard in praise of both .

		Every public officer must win his appointment by merit , and that merit is judged by the accuracy of his education .

		Without considering the utilities which might grow out of such conditions , we observe that they fail to follow here because the education required is that of the Chinese type , an educa - tion which does not educate .

		It is an education that is purely formal and without vitality .

		It has no stimulus , no power of development , no illumination .

		Its vision is ever backward , never forward .

		Only the thing that hath been is that which shall be .

		The wise maxims of Confucius and of Mencius appear to have little influence upon life and action .

		The scientific phase is conspicuously absent .

		The stimulus of the science of the nineteenth century has not been felt in
China	LOCATION	.

		In marked contrast has been the action of the Japanese .

		After an earnest resistance , sud - denly the Japanese saw a great light , and be - gan to glean from the science and the discipline of the Occident whatever could be adapted in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		The whole nation rejoices in the consequent revival .

		But the Chinese persist - ently debars not merely Western merchandise but also Western science and
Western	ORGANIZATION	culture as well .

		The impending fall of the Manchu dynasty need cause no regrets .

		It had no natural rights in
China	LOCATION	, and it has been an insurmountable barrier to national development .

		The world must wish that a better fate might befall an empire so ancient and venerable .

		The situation is thus stated by Mr.
Boulger	PERSON	: '' If the Chinese realized their position there would be ground for hope ; but so far as can be judged , there is not a public man in
China	LOCATION	who perceives that the state is on the verge of dissolution , and that nothing short of the most strenuous exertion will avail to save not the dynasty but the country from death . ''

		RECENT POETRY .

		* A few reminiscences of a sojourn '' In Palestine '' gives the title to a new volume of verse now put forth , by Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	, after a silence of nearly five years .

		The volume contains , besides versified memories of
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Provence	LOCATION	, songs of the finer heroism , and many of those per - sonal and occasional pieces in the writing of which Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	is an adept .

		The following irregular sonnet may he taken as an example of the best of the work here offered us . ''

		Love 's look finds loveliness in all the world : Ah , who shall say This , this is loveliest !

		Forgetting that pure beauty is impearled A thousand perfect ways , and none is best .

		Sometimes I deem that dawn upon the ocean Thrills deeper than all else ; but , sudden , there , With serpent gleam and hue , and fixed motion ,
Niagara	LOCATION	curves its scimetar in air .

		So when I dream of sunset , oft I gaze Again from
Bellosguardo	LOCATION	's misty height , Or memory ends once more one day of days

		There is no loveliest , dear Love , but thee Through whom all loveliness I breathe and see . ''

		THE DIAL The following passage , from '' A
Winter	DATE	Twilight in
Provence	LOCATION	'' a poem inspired by thought of the wars that once ravaged that fair land was written two years ago , and is not without an ironic applica - tion to the events of the past few months . ''

		Dear country mine !

		far in that viewless west , And ocean-warded , strife thou too hast known ; But may thy sun hereafter bloodless shine , And may thy way be onward without wrath , And upward on no carcass of the slain ; And if thou smitest , let it be for peace And justice not in hate , or pride , or lust Of empire .

		Mayst thou ever be , O land , Noble and pure as thou art free and strong !

		So shalt thou lift a light for all the world And for all time , and bring the Age of Peace . ''

		Two years ago these ideals seemed to earnest Amer - icans not impossible of realization ; to-day , they are clearly considered by great numbers of our fellow - citizens as the merest counsels of perfection , not to be taken into serious account by the practical statesman .

		Will not Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	write for us a new '' Ichabod , '' inscribed this time , not to an individual , but to a nation , in danger of proving recreant ?

		Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	has put forth numerous volumes of verse , and the last of them is like the first and all the others in the general impression left by their perusal .

		That impression is of marked poetical powers carelessly employed .

		The author has sensibility , and even passion ; he has also con - siderable facility in the use of poetic diction ; but he has none of the restraint that should go with these qualities , and it is obvious that much of his verse is hastily flung from him with little care for its fate .

		In his new volume of '' Idyllic Mono - logues , '' for example , there is no justification for so rough a line as this from '' The Moated Manse , '' `` The year-old scars , made by the Royalists ' balls , '' or for the violence of language that characterizes the greater part of this poem .

		Half a dozen or more of these versified narratives fill all but a few pages of the volume .

		In these few latter pages the author gets greatly excited about the destruction of the ''
Maine	LOCATION	'' and the atrocities of Spanish rule , showing that his verse can be as hot-tempered when it deals with actual history as when it is concerned with vain romantic imaginings .

		For an extract since there should be one we will take a stanza in which Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	is at his best , because at his simplest . ''

		Here where the season turns the land to gold , Among the fields our feet have known of old , When we were children who could laugh and run , Glad little playmates of the wind and sun , Before came toil and care and years went ill , And one forgot and one remembered still , Heart of my heart , among the old fields here , Give me your hands and let me draw you near , Heart of my heart . ''

		Early in the examination of Mr.
George Cabot Lodge	PERSON	's volume of verse , on two pages that face each other , we find this stanza , the ocean speaking : '' I have lavished my largess of comfort , Taken earth in mine arms like a child , Taught the children of life of its splendour , Brought their eyes to the light unbeguiled . ''

		And this , of the wave : '' This is the song of the wave !

		the mighty one !

		Child of the soul of silence , beating the air to sound : White as a live terror , as a drawn sword , This is the wave . ''

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	and Mr.
Henley	PERSON	, we say at once , and these names are suggested many times over in what follows .

		A little later , we come upon an '' After - Word '' in this strain : '' What of life-songs then , and what of death-songs ?

		Sound and fury down the babbling ages , They shall cease , the echoes pass and perish ; On the void the ` stablishment eternal Bides alone the Soul 's gigantic silence , '' and we know that Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	has taken his
Brown	PERSON	- ing to heart .

		These things , and work so frankly imitative as '' The Gates of Life , '' which is a vari - ation upon Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's ''
Hesperia	LOCATION	, '' are not set down to Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	's discredit .

		He is clearly a young writer such gloom and world - weariness , such echoes of Leconte de 1 ` Isle and
Leopardi	LOCATION	, are the certain evidence of that , and he is without the saving sense of humor , as one may see from the appeal to his own soul to '' be stern and adequate , '' which somehow reminds us of the `` Terrible , indigne '' , calme , extraordinaire '' of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, who thus describes the attitude which he will assume when face to face with God .

		But Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	has studied good models of the sort of poetry young men most affect , and most poets find themselves by first sitting at the feet of their masters .

		In spite of all that we have said , Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	's work seems to us to be full of promise ; its utterance is large , and its rhythmic power is unde - niable .

		He is most clearly himself in such a poem as '' Fall , '' from which we extract , with genuine pleasure , these closing lines , inspired by an autumn dawn : `` This moment stolen from the centuries , This foretaste of the soul 's oblivion We hold and cherish , and because of this Are life and death made perfect , and thy woes Turn lyric through the glory we have won .

		The morning flower that drew its petals close And slept the cold night through is now unfurled To catch the breathless moment ; big and sane Our
autumn	DATE	day forsakes the gates of rose , And like a lion shakes its golden mane And leaps upon the world . ''

		Mr.
Claude Fayette Bragdon	PERSON	's book is easily re - viewed .

		There are about forty pages of it , averag - ing seven lines to a page . ''

		The Golden Person in the Heart , '' the titular poem , is a versified statement of the essentials of Brahmanism .

		This is the sort of thing : '' A man , to cleanse this inward mirror , should Before all else , learn and obey the law , And next acquire a blameless livelihood : Steadfast in duty and in doing good , His mind from things of sense let him withdraw . ''

		A captious person might think that the author of this poem had complied with the counsel of the last line , but
Emerson	PERSON	's '' Brahma '' met with the same criticism .

		Our objection is that it is not poetry .

		52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, The rest of the book consists of such things as '' Cities . '' ''


New York	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, Seemed vast and grand while I staid home , But seeing them , I soon found that I held them all beneath my hat . ''

		All of which is not very promising .

		The sheaf of verses gleaned by Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	from the growth of many years of preoccupation with poetical matters contains a number of skilfully - wrought pieces . ''

		Chryseis on the Sands '' is partic - ularly charming , and here is the last of its three stanzas : '' Ages ago old Chryses clasped his daughter , Happy that she was his and not the
King	PERSON	's ; Smiling through tears beside that Asian water Lovely Chryseis , home at last , still stands .

		Many another bard some maiden sings Dearer to me Chryseis on the sands , Ages ago . ''

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	has been the artificer of many sonnets , but with rare restraint has adjudged only one of them deserving of a place in this little volume .

		Would that other poets might submit their work to this process of natural selection !

		The sonnet in ques - tion is a fine improvisation upon the greatest of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	's great words . ''

		No freeman , saith the wise , thinks much on death : No man with soul he dareth call his own Liveth in dread lest there be no atone In time to come for yesterday 's warm breath , No more than he for such end hungereth As falls to those who speed their souls a-groan ; Death may be King , to sit a tottering throne And hale men hence let cowards cringe to Death ! ''

		Who giveth , taketh ; and the days go by , No seed sowed we ; let him who did come reap : Sweet peace is ours and everlastingly , A little sleep , a little slumber :
Aye	PERSON	, This much is known : there is for thee and me A little folding of the hands to sleep . ''

		Songs and sonnets alternate , with almost unfailing regularity , in Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	's fifty pages of new verse . ''

		Summer by the Sea '' is one of the best of the sonnets . ''

		If thou wonldst win the rhythmic heart of things , Go sit in solitude beside the shore , Giving thine ear to the eternal roar And every mystic message that it brings Eddas of ancient , nnremembered kings , And runes that ring with long-forgotten lore .

		All myths and mysteries from the years of yore Ere Time grew weary on his journeyings . ''

		And more from that imperious sibyl , Sea , Thou mayest learn if thou wilt hearken well , When God 's white star-fires beacon home the ships : The solemn secrets of infinity , Unto the inner sense translatable , Hang trembling ever on her darkling lips . ''

		This might have for its text the '' Time 's self it is , made audible , '' of
Rossetti	PERSON	's matchless lyric .

		The poems of Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	have been collected into a volume which bears the title '' From Sunset Ridge . '' ''

		Of all my verses , say that one is good '' is her modest plea to the critic , but the author of the '' Battle-Hymn of the Republic '' may safely await a larger measure of approval than that .

		Still , the famous poem just named remains almost the only one in the volume that makes the impression of spontaneity ; no doubt it was thought out , like the others ; but the difference is that the others show that they have been studied , and the '' Battle - Hymn '' does not .

		The poems are mostly personal or occasional , strongly infused with religious senti - ment , and pointing some very marked moral .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	is at her best in such verses as these addressed to Pio Nono : '' Where glory should have crowned thee , failure whelms , Truth judges thee , that should have made thee great ; Thine is the doom of souls that can not bring Their highest courage to their highest fate , '' or these upon Dante : `` See , beneath the hood of grief , Muffled bays engird the brow .

		Fame shall yield her topmost bough Ere that laurel moult a leaf . ''

		At first sight Mrs.
Higginson	PERSON	's collection of poems , '' When the Birds Go North Again , '' seems to be the usual sort of thing .

		There are sonnets , and lyrics , and bits of religious or didactic verse all upon such themes as every versifier attempts .

		A closer examination , however , reveals the fact that this writer , while often amateurish in manner and crude in technique , has an unusual gift of passionate imag - ination , and at her best rises high above the plane whereon most minor poets disport themselves .

		We take Mrs.
Higginson	PERSON	's best to be such work as this : '' God , let me be a mountain when I die , Stung by the hail , lashed by tormenting rains !

		Let lava fires surge , turbulent and high , With fiercest torture thro ' my bursting veins ; Let lightnings flame around my lonely brow , And mighty storm-clouds race , and break , and roar About me ; let the melted lava plough Raw furrows in my breast , torment me sore , O God !

		Let me hate loneliness , yet see My very forest felled beneath my eyes .

		Give me all
Time	ORGANIZATION	's distilled agony , Yet let me still stand , mute , beneath the skies ; Thro ' storms that beat and inward fires that burn , Tortured , yet silent ; suffering , yet pure , That torn and tempted hearts may lift and learn The noble meaning of the word , endure .

		1 ' The ending is feeble enough , but what precedes has no small measure of daring strength . ''

		A Thank - Offering '' is another poem from which we must quote three stanzas : ''
Lord God	PERSON	, for some of us the days and years Have bitter been ; For some of us the burden and the tears .

		The gnawing sin . ''

		For some of us , God , the scanty store , The failing bin ; For some of us the gray wolf at the door , The red , within ! ''

		But to the hungry Thou hast given meat , Hast clothed the cold ; And Thou hast given courage strong and sweet To the sad and old . ''

		If we had space for further quotation , the two son - nets , '' Yet Am I not for Pity , '' should be given , but
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 53 we must be content to say that the volume which contains them will well repay examination , and is a promising addition to American minor poetry .

		Mrs.
Perry	PERSON	's '' Impressions '' are lyrical pieces , taking the form of the song , the sonnet , or the ron - deau , and embodying in graceful verse many a mood of rapture , tenderness , and spiritual aspiration .

		We choose for our example the lines which go with '' A Flower from Carnac . '' ''

		I plucked this bit of yellow gorse for thee By a huge menhir where on
Carnac	ORGANIZATION	's shore The long waves murmur dirges evermore For men dead ere the birth of history .

		Here once they lived whom
Time	ORGANIZATION	's immensity Hath quite o'erwhelmed , and blotted out their page From the world 's book !

		On them may learned sage Descant , and poet dream , here by the sea ! ''

		But none may know what were their thoughts , their lives None e'er may know !

		none living or unborn !

		Were these their tombs built where the strong sea strives In vain to hold the warm elusive sands ?

		Were these hard by their altars , where forlorn They stretched to Heaven imploring empty hands ? ''

		The spiritual quality , so marked in this sonnet , is the predominant characteristic of Mrs.
Perry	PERSON	's pure and heartfelt song .

		A slight volume of sonnets and lyrics by
Miss Guiney	PERSON	, entitled ''
England	LOCATION	and
Yesterday	DATE	, '' proves one of the most acceptable collections of the year ; its finished and delicate art may be illustrated by '' A Porch in
Belgravia	LOCATION	. '' ''

		When , after dawn , the lordly houses hide Till you fall foul of it , some piteous guest , -LRB- Some girl the damp stones gather to their breast , Her gold hair rough , her rebel garment wide , Who sleeps , with all that luck and life denied Camped round , and dreams how seaward and southwest Blue over
Devon	LOCATION	farms the smoke - rings rest , And sheep and lambs ascend the lit hillside -RRB- , Dear , of your charity , speak low , step soft , Pray for a sinner .

		Planet-like and still , Best hearts of all are sometimes set aloft Only to see and pass , nor yet deplore Even Wrong itself , crowned Wrong inscrutable , Which can not but have been , forever more . ''

		Suggestions of the history and literature of
England	LOCATION	provide themes for most of these poems , the one we have quoted being made somewhat exceptional , not so much by its sympathy with suffering as by its note of modernity .

		Two neat volumes contain the verses left by two men , residents of
Chicago	LOCATION	, who died at an early age .


Ben King	PERSON	, who died in
1894	DATE	, and whose literary remains are gathered up and edited by three of his devoted friends , was a journalist whose marked talent found expression in dialect verses of the rustic type , in rollicking negro songs , and in such broadly pointed jests as '' That Valentine . '' ''

		Once , I remember , years ago , I sent a tender valentine ; I know it caused a deal of woe .

		Once , I remember , years ago , Her father 's boots were large , you know .

		I do regret the hasty line , Once , I remember , years ago , I sent a tender valentine . ''

		The best-known pieces of this writer are the two beginning '' If I should die to-night '' and '' Nothing to do but work , Nothing to eat but food . ''

		These have been widely reprinted and praised by his admirers .

		The '' Poems '' left by
Francis Brooks	PERSON	, who died early last year , make a volume far more serious and significant than the one just mentioned .

		The inter - esting introductory memoir supplied by the editor , Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	, tells us of the life of the poet , how he became , first a lawyer , then a physician , and how , when '' professional success was in his very grasp , the voice within him grew too strong to be disregarded , '' and he set about becoming a poet .


Nearly two years ago	DATE	, the first-fruits of his literary labors took shape in a small volume called '' Mar - gins . ''

		It was distinctly promising , but the writer still knew that he had much to learn , of both nature and life , and determined upon an experiment simi - lar to that made by Mr.
Walter Wyckoff	PERSON	, the results of which are recorded in the fascinating volumes of '' The Workers . ''

		In a word ,
Brooks	PERSON	set out to work his way from
Chicago	LOCATION	to
California	LOCATION	, and to learn the common lot of mankind by accepting to the full its responsibilities and its hardships .

		The under - taking was too much for his physical powers , and he returned to his home in the grasp of a fever that resulted in his untimely death at the age of thirty - one .

		Of the three sections which comprise this volume of his work , the first reproduces the '' Mar - gins '' that formed his only publication during life .

		They are somewhat too irregular to be good poetry , and betray the influence of Whitman , although in attitude and spirit rather than in form .

		They were , in fact , dedicated '' To Him '' '' Whose plenteous hand and fertile brain Bid flowers that fade to bloom again , Whose eyes are sanctity , whose brow Doth wear the aureole e ` en now . ''

		The second section , called '' Preludes , '' reveals an advance in finish and an increasing depth of thought , and closes with four really remarkable quatorzains suggested by the life of Christ .

		One of them '' Jesus Wept '' we quote . ''

		At eve He rested there amidst the grass , And as the stars shone out He dreamed of God , His destiny , the distant kingdom all of glass And gold ; He watched the reapers homeward plod ; Became aware of strength for holy deeds Astir within Him ; turned His eyes to where The Great Sea rolled a sight that ever breeds A hunger for deep powers ; felt that there A symbol was of His far-spreading mind , His restless strong desire , and marked perchance The tiny specks of moving sail ; divined Of time and space the secret circumstance , And when His gaze was wearied , softly wept And was consoled then to His shelter crept . ''

		The third section contains nearly a hundred pieces , all in the same simple yet elaborate form of verse , a variation devised by the author upon the basis of THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, the roundel .

		We may take '' The Reformer '' to illustrate at once the form of the verse and the ar - dent aspiration of the writer for a purer national life . ''

		He sought not fame , he made no claim , He longed to see the spirit 's flame Burn out a venal nation 's shame , He sought not fame . ''

		But faithful still through scorn , neglect , Through ridicule and dear hopes wrecked .

		Always with love he struck the lyre , Ne'er in revenge , hatred , nor ire .

		11 Here but a shard I bring the bard , Misfortune 's own and evil-starred Burnt in the glaze , unbroken , hard .

		He sought not fame . '' ''

		Blots on the fair fame of his country , '' says the editor , '' affected him like personal disgrace , and , next to singleness of purpose , patriotism sounds the fundamental note of his best lines . ''

		We may add that we have rarely been so impressed with a poet 's absolute sincerity as we have in reading this volume .

		Bhartrihari was a Brahman of princely lineage , who is said to have reigned in Oujein early in the Christian era .

		Like Buddha , he forsook his state , and went to cultivate philosophy in a cave for the rest of his life .

		A little book of epigrams bearing his name has come down to us , and Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	has put an even hundred of them into English verse , not , however , without taking liberties like those taken by
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	in his dealings with the Tent-maker .

		The motive that made a philosopher of the prince is given in this quatrain : `` Better , I said , in trackless woods to roam With chattering apes or the dumb grazing herds , Than dwell with fools , though in a prince 's home , And bear the dropping of their ceaseless words . ''

		It is the full-grown philosopher who speaks in the following verses : '' Like as our outworn garments we discard , And other new ones don : So doth the Soul these bodies doff when marred And others new put on . ''

		Fire doth not kindle It , nor sword divides , Nor winds nor waters harm ; Eternal and unchanged the One abides , And smiles at all alarm . ''

		Finally , it is the deepest of all spiritual experiences that is reflected in this counsel : '' Like an uneasy fool thou wanderest far Into the nether deeps , Or upward climbest where the dim-lit star Of utmost heaven sleeps .

		`` Through all the world thou rangest , O my soul , Seeking and wilt not rest ;
Behold	LOCATION	, the peace of
Brahma	LOCATION	, and thy goal , Hideth in thine own breast . ''

		The thought of this Sanskrit sage is well worth studying in Mr.
More	PERSON	's agreeable transcription .

		Yiddish is the dialect , compounded of German and Hebrew , with some admixture of
Slavonic	ORGANIZATION	, spoken by many of the Jews in
Russia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	.

		It has had a sort of literature of its own for some four centuries , but nothing noteworthy until of late , when it has become the vehicle of a considerable amount of folk-song .

		Its most remarkable achieve - ment , however , is found in the songs of Mr.
Morris Rosenfeld	PERSON	, a Polish Jew who learned the tailor 's trade , and as an American immigrant spent many years of weary toil in the sweat-shops of
New York	LOCATION	.

		His verses , recently brought to the attention of the critic by Mr.
Leo Wiener	PERSON	, are now published in a volume that sets the Yiddish and the English trans - lation face to face with one another .

		They are true lyrical treasure-trove , and , lest the name of Yiddish terrify our reader overmuch , we hasten to explain that to read these poems is merely to read German and hunt up an occasional unfamiliar word in the glossary .

		An illustration will make this clear . ''

		Nit vun
Friihling	ORGANIZATION	's siissen Wetter ,
Nit vun Engel	PERSON	, nit vun Gotter Singt der ehrlicher Poet ; Nit vun
Felder	PERSON	, nit vun Teichen , Was gehoren jetzt zum
Reichen	PERSON	, Nor vun
Kworin	PERSON	, was er seht . ''

		Elend seht er , Not un '
Schmerzen	PERSON	, Wunden tragt er tief im
Herzen	ORGANIZATION	, Nit gelindert , nit gestillt ; Auf dem grossen Welt-bessalmen Kraehzt er trauerige Psalmen , Sfeimmt er an sein
Harf	PERSON	un ' spielt . ''

		Given '' Bessalmen '' = cemetery , and '' Kworim '' = graves , the rest is plain enough .

		It must be said , however , that the poet fails to live up to his own principles , for he does sing , and very melodiously , of
spring	DATE	and green fields and nightingales .

		Still , the most insistent note of his song is doubtless that of sympathy for the toiler , a sympathy born from bitter personal experience , and poignant in its pathos .

		He might almost be called the
Heine	PERSON	of the sweat-shop and the factory , and his message is one that should strike deep into the heart of every generous reader .

		Dr.
William Henry Drummond	PERSON	, of
Montreal	LOCATION	, whose verses in portrayal of the life and dialect of the Canadian habitant have won so much favor for both author and subject , now publishes a small illus - trated volume containing two poems .

		The first , called '' Phil-o-rum 's Canoe , '' is in the dialect the author knows so intimately , the last stanza being : '' You can only steer , an ' if rock be near , wit ' wave dashin ' all aroun ' , Better mak ' leetle prayer , for on Dead Riviere , some very smart man get drown ; But if you be locky an ' watch yourse ' f , mebbe reever wo n't seem so wide , An firse t ` ing you know you '11 ronne ashore , safe on de ` nodder side . '' ''

		Madeleine Vercheres , '' on the other hand , is in orthodox English , and tells a stirring tale of how a French maiden defended a fort from the Iroquois for six days , and until succor came from a distance .

		It is a ballad not unlike those of which
Whittier	LOCATION	had so many to tell .

		Few poets get so near as Mr.
Duncan Campbell Scott	PERSON	to the very heart of nature . ''

		In every heart the heart of
spring	DATE	Bursts into leaf and bud ; The heart of love in every heart Leaps with its eager flood . ''

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 55 His new volume , '' Labor and the Angel , '' is full of lovely songs , and none of them are more captivating than the four inscribed to the four seasons , and to the singer 's '' love
Armitage	PERSON	. ''

		We reluctantly pass the first three by , to select the '' Winter Song '' which follows : `` Sing me a song of the dead world , Of the great frost deep and still , Of the sword of fire the wind hurled On the iron hill . ''

		Sing me a song of the driving snow , Of the reeling cloud and the smoky drift , Where the sheeted wraiths like ghosts go Through the gloomy rift .

		* ' Sing me a song of the ringing blade , Of the snarl and shatter the light ice makes , Of the whoop and the swing of the snow-shoe raid Through the cedar brakes .

		44 Sing me a song of the apple-loft , Of the corn and the nuts and the mounds of meal , Of the sweeping whir of the spindle soft , And the spinning-wheel . '

		Sing me a song of the open page , Where the ruddy gleams of the firelight dance , Where bends my love
Armitage	PERSON	, Reading an old romance . ''

		Sing me a song of the still nights , Of the large stars steady and high , The aurora darting its phosphor lights In the purple sky . ''

		Of this poet we may safely say that the vision of the world is his , and the sentiment that lends beauty to the interpretation .

		Toward the close of the year 1870 , Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	wrote an ode to
France	LOCATION	, then suffering the double humiliation of defeat and invasion .

		It was a noble poem , perhaps the finest that Mr.
Mere	PERSON	- dith has ever written .

		This we said when it made its first appearance in one of the author 's books , and ` this we repeat after thinking the matter over for a number of years .

		Such a passage as the following would probably have been accepted by
Matthew	PERSON	.

		Arnold as an example of the grand style in poetry . ''

		Forgetful is green earth ; the Gods alone Remember everlastingly : they strike Remorselessly , and ever like for like .

		By their great memories Gods are known . ''

		.

		Nearly thirty years have passed since this ode was written , and the author now gives us three new `` Odes in Contribution to the Song of French History , '' .

		their subjects being '' The Revolution , '' ''
Napoleon	PERSON	, '' and ''
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	. ''

		In the volume that con - tains them he defiantly reprints the ''
France	LOCATION	'' of
1870	DATE	, deliberately forcing a comparison between the two manners thus illustrated .

		We have made a quotation from the early poem , let us now extract a characteristic passage from one of the later odes .

		The subject of the passage we surmise to be
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- , leon ; but this is a world of uncertainties , and we will , not be dogmatic . ''

		Hugest of engines , a much limited man , She saw the Lustrous , her great lord , appear Through that smoked glass her last privation brought To point her critic eye and spur her thought : A heart but to propel Leviathan ; A spirit that breathed but in earth 's atmosphere .

		Amid the plumed and sceptred ones Irradiatingly Jovian , The mountain tower capped by the floating cloud ; A nursery screamer where dialectics ruled : Mannerless , graceless , laughterless , unlike Herself in all , yet with such power to strike That she the various features she could scan , Dared not to sum , though seeing : and befooled By power that beamed omnipotent , she bowed , Subservient as roused echo round his guns . ''

		In the name of all that is clear and sane and sym - metrical , we feel bound to protest against this riot of the parts of speech .

		We have not singled out an extremely unintelligible passage ; the poems con - tain scores of others just as muddy as this , and com - pared with them the most violent conceits of
Donne	PERSON	or Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	would seem to be reading for infant minds .

		We have no doubt that this pas - sage and its fellows have meanings ; we have no doubt that many readers might with due diligence work out those meanings ; but we have also no doubt that such an effort would be a woeful misap - plication of energy .

		These tailings of Mr.
Mere	PERSON	- dith 's ore are not rich enough to be worth treatment .

		What was once merely an affectation with him has become a disease , and we have no wish to inquire too curiously into his understanding of '' incalescent scorpions '' and '' hydrocephalic aerolites , '' or to ask his interpretation of that Jabberwocky verse , `` The friable and the grumous , dizzards both . ''

		But it may be observed , in concluding these remarks about a most perverse book , that not only have lucidity and proportion and style disappeared from Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's verse , but even music has accompa - nied them in their dismayed flight . ''

		Rightly , then , should
France	LOCATION	worship , and deafen the disaccord of those who dare withstand an irresistible sword to thwart his predestined subjection of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Would anyone , reading this , have the remotest sus - picion that it claimed to be poetry ?

		And of such verbiage as this are the '' Odes '' largely composed .

		If we have ever read verses more stale , flat , and unprofitable than Mr.
Mackenzie Bell	PERSON	's '' Pictures of Travel , and Other Poems , '' we can not now recall the occasion .

		Why on earth should a man write and publish such stuff as this ? ''

		'T is true amid our earthly life there runs A tangled thread of strange perplexity And much injustice ; yet comes by and by A nobler state of being , when that which seems Unjust will be explained or set aright . ''

		Or this ? ''

		Yet God who gave the pureness To yon fair mountain snow Gives also the secureness Whereby these roses blow . ''

		We have found nothing in the entire volume that rises much above the bald commonplace of these extracts .

		Yet it is a printed book . ''

		This also is a mystery of life , '' as Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	says .

		If Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	has any regard for what is left of his literary reputation , he will allow his '' Songs of Action '' to remain the only volume of verses to which his name is attached .

		He is not a 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, poet , and could never by any possibility become one .

		We have looked through this volume in vain for a single gleam of poetic feeling or a single instance of felicitous expression .

		We get instead martial episodes done in verse , horsey ballads , a poor imitation of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's patriotic fervor , but nothing much nearer poetry than this '' Parable '' : '' The cheese-mites asked how the cheese got there , And warmly debated the matter ;
The Orthodox	ORGANIZATION	said that it came from the air , And the heretics said from the platter .

		They argued it long and they argued it strong , And I hear they are arguing now ; But of all the choice spirits who lived in the cheese , Not one of them thought of a cow . ''

		Mr.
Charles Camp Tarelli	PERSON	's '' Persephone '' is a metrical version of the familiar form of the myth , done in easy hexameters like these : '' Wide is the peopled earth , and many the hosts of the living ; Wider the realms of the shade , and the crowded legions of silent , Pale , and bodiless ghosts more numberless far than the toiling , Striving , rejoicing men who bless thee for prosperous har - vests . ''

		The poem is a pleasing performance , but praise must end with that statement .

		It is followed by two longish pieces , '' Magna Mater '' and '' A Song of Arrival and Departure , '' which have in common the minor chord of Weltschmerz , which in both cases works into a crashing and triumphant resolution .

		The remaining contents are short things , sonnets , rondeaus , sestinas , and the like .

		The elegiac ode to Catullus is happily achieved , both as verse and characterization , and is not un suggestive of the classical experiments of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps the most distinctive feature of these charming poems is the ever-recurring appeal to Nature as the sure refuge of the soul in distress . ''

		O Mother !

		lift again my head low - bowed , My aching head the bitter garland binds ; Quicken me with new life ; let thy great winds Blow on me through the swaying of thy trees ; Sweep by me with thy pageants of grey cloud , And rock me with the rolling of thy seas . ''

		This note occurs again and again , ringing and clear ; it is the final word of the poet 's philosophy .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		A
Briton	ORGANIZATION	's Readers of that fascinating work , view of his
Baedeker	PERSON	's `` United States , '' will American kin .

		welcome a new book by the author , Mr.
James Fullarton Muirhead	PERSON	, who now , in a less formal style than that conditioned by the guide - book , gives us '' a Briton 's view of his American kin '' in a volume entitled '' The Land of Contrasts '' -LRB-
Lamson	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is an attractive volume throughout , and not the least so in the penultimate chapter of '' Baedekeriana , '' which empties the ragbag of the writer 's recollections into the receptive lap of the reader .

		Why the book is entitled as it is may be illustrated by one of the many reasons given . ''

		I have hailed with delight the democratic spirit dis - played in the greeting of my friend and myself by the porter of a hotel as ' You fellows , ' and then had the cup of pleasure dashed from my lips by being told by the same porter that ` the other gentleman would attend to my baggage ! ''

		A great many other contrasts are noted with similar good-humored acceptance of the conditions of life in a strange country .

		Mr.
Muirhead	PERSON	knows us better than do most of the Englishmen who undertake to write about '' the States , '' for he gave three years of travel and observation to the preparation of his ''
Bae	ORGANIZATION	- deker , '' and has since then become almost as good an American as the rest of us .

		He is as fair-minded as Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, and is ever ready to match our short - comings with those of his own people .

		Like most visitors from other countries , he is amazed at the easy-going way with which we put up with nuisances . ''

		Americans invented the slang word ' kicker , ' but so far as I could see , their vocabulary is here miles ahead of their practice ; they dream noble deeds , but do not do them .

		Englishmen ' kick ' much better , without having a name for it . ''

		Mr.
Muir	PERSON	- head 's tribute to the beauty of the
White City	LOCATION	is worth quoting in part . ''

		We expected that
America	LOCATION	would produce the largest , most costly , and most gorgeous of all international exhibitions ; but who expected that she would produce anything so inex - pressibly poetic , chaste , and restrained , such an absolutely refined and soul-satisfying picture , as the Court of Honour , with its lagoon and gondolas , its white marble steps and balustrades , its varied yet harmonious buildings , its colonnaded vista of the great lake , its impressive fountain , its fairy-like out - lining after dark by the gems of electricity , its spacious and well-modulated proportions which made the largest crowd in it but an unobtrusive detail , its air of spontaneity and inevitableness which suggested nature itself , rather than art ?

		... It will to all time remain impossibly ridiculous to speak of a country or a city as wholly given over to the worship of Mammon which almost involuntarily gave birth to this ethereal emanation of pure and uneconomic beauty . ''

		It is still another of the au - thor 's '' contrasts '' which impels him , on the next page , to speak of
Chicago	LOCATION	church architecture as '' a studied insult to religion , '' a criticism which we must admit to be only too true .

		One of Mr.
Muir	PERSON	- head 's meatiest chapters is devoted to that calamity of our civilization that is known as American jour - nalism .

		The
Sunday	DATE	newspaper is pleasantly styled a '' hog-trough , '' which it frequently is , and the severest strictures are made upon the sensational - ism , the vulgarity , the puerility , the flippant bru - tality , and the general disregard of everything that is true and lovely so characteristic of the '' enter - prise '' of our newspaper proprietors .

		All this , too , we must admit is richly deserved , and we thank the author for saying it .

		One more observation , timely and well framed , must close these extracts .

		It was made before the outbreak of the recent war , and is even more apposite now than it was when the words
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 57 were written down . ''

		The spectacle of a section in the
United States	LOCATION	apparently ready to step down from its pedestal of honorable neutrality , and run its head into the ignoble web of European compli - cations , was indeed one to make both gods and mortals weep . ''

		Whereby we may see that edifica - tion , as well as entertainment , is to be got from this most readable book .

		Readers of the last series of '' Fors The predecessor of Clavigera , '' some fifteen years ago ,
Major Marchand	ORGANIZATION	.

		M i i i ,1 .

		- r T will perhaps remember that Mr.
Kus	PERSON	- kin had some words on
Mungo Park	LOCATION	.

		In writing of
Scott	LOCATION	, Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	tells of some conversations which Sir
Walter	PERSON	had with the famous explorer , and speaks severely of the man who was willing to quit the devoted work of a country doctor by the Tweed for the sake of tracing '' the lonely brinks of useless rivers . ''

		Mungo Park was a loyal and unselfish man in the performance of his duties among the hills of Selkirkshire .

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	thought it was the desire for personal gain that forced him into his fatal jour - ney .

		Such an idea is by no means given in the sketch of Mungo Park written by Mr.
T. Banks Maclachan	PERSON	for the '' Famous Scots '' series -LRB- imported by
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- , and we are inclined to think that Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was in this one case mistaken .

		The fascination of exploration and the curiosity of science , these were the causes of
Mungo Park	LOCATION	's embarking on his second expedition , these and the desire to carry out what he had worthily begun .

		Mungo Park was the discoverer of the
Niger	LOCATION	.

		When Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	calls the
Niger	LOCATION	a useless river , he speaks as many Englishmen would have spoken fifteen years ago .

		Last
spring	DATE	, however , a different opinion was prevalent .

		This book , contain - ing a good account of
Mungo Park	LOCATION	's explorations on behalf of
England	LOCATION	a hundred years ago , is especially pertinent now that
England	LOCATION	is beginning to be vexed that the French are taking to themselves all the ad - vantages of those discoveries .

		All the upper
Niger	LOCATION	, the whole of the course that
Mungo Park	LOCATION	in
1805	DATE	sailed to his death , is now claimed and exploited by the French .

		From
St. Louis	LOCATION	they went to the
Niger	LOCATION	, from the
Niger	LOCATION	to
Lake Chad	LOCATION	and the
Upper Congo	LOCATION	, from the
Upper Congo	ORGANIZATION	to
Fashoda	LOCATION	.

		Even Timbuctu , which
Tennyson	PERSON	discovered for poetry , was discov - ered for commerce by the French , and perhaps with equal advantage .

		However that may be , this little book will be read just now , as much as a sort of political pamphlet as for any other reason .

		But although present affairs on the
Niger	LOCATION	are of instant interest ,
Mungo Park	LOCATION	should not be forgotten .

		He journeyed from
Gambia	LOCATION	, almost alone , and discov - ered the upper waters of the river that had been so long a mystery .

		He went again ten years afterwards with a company of forty-four , found the
Niger	LOCATION	again , and sailed down it .

		From that expedition no one ever returned , nor did any account of the death of
Mungo Park reach Europe	LOCATION	for some years .

		One by one his men had perished , till at the last there were but three with him , when the remnant of the expe - dition was swallowed up in the great river in a des - perate attempt to escape from unnumbered enemies .

		It was a heroic end : nor shall we take it upon our - selves to say that
Mungo Park	LOCATION	would have done better to have lived and died a country doctor by the Tweed .

		A man who is willing to die in pursuit of his duty has some right to say what that duty is .

		Birds and ^ n a nea * vo ^ ume entitled '' Bird bird-worship Gods '' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr. in antiquity .

		Charles De Kay presents some at - tractive essays discussing the ideas held in ancient
Europe	LOCATION	regarding birds .

		The subject has been strangely neglected by folk-lorists and anthropolo - gists .

		Many of the heroes and gods of antiquity are accompanied by or associated with bird compan - ions , messengers , or servants .

		These birds share more or less the divinity of their masters .

		Mr.
De Kay	PERSON	thinks that in many cases the birds are themselves regarded as divine , and that the respect and worship shown their masters or companions were originally theirs alone .

		A number of cases are cited where the god-character of the birds them - selves is clearly shown .

		The birds most respected by the ancients appear to be the dove , woodpecker , cuckoo , peacock , owl , swan , and eagle .

		Their inde - pendent attributes are usually well distinguished , but considerable confusion of them exists both in the popular ideas and in Mr.
De Kay	PERSON	's treatment .

		Some of the author 's suggestions are striking and original .

		Thus , he connects our vulgar expression '' I swan '' with an ancient practice of '' swearing by the swan . ''

		His effort to explain the couvade by popular ideas concerning the brooding bird and the cuckoo is ingenious .

		Unfortunately , however , this chapter '' The Couvade in
Ireland	LOCATION	and
Persia	LOCATION	'' is so lacking in clearness that it must be consid - ered simply as a suggestion along a line which , clearly developed , may prove important .

		While admitting the great interest and value of the book , we feel that the author somewhat overrates the weight of his evidence regarding bird - worship , although the previous neglect of so interesting a field is some excuse for this over-estimate .

		It is also interesting to see how easily ingenious authors can use the same data to support extremely diver - gent theories .

		What Mr.
George Cox	PERSON	insists are sun-myths are equally well interpreted as dawn - stories by Professor
Max Mtiller	PERSON	or as bird-god tales by Mr.
De Kay	PERSON	.

		The decorations of this book really deserve the special mention they hold in the title .

		They are original , quaint , and truly artistic .

		The artist 's ingenuity in his pictures is almost equal to that of the author in his text .

		On the whole , '' Bird Gods '' is distinctly interesting , alike to folk-lorists , students of mythology , and general readers .

		Horse-shoe Another volume of folk-lore studies magic and other is presented by Dr.
Robert M. Law	PERSON	- joik-iore .

		rence , under the title of the opening chapter , '' The Magic of the Horse-shoe '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- .

		Dr.
Lawrence	PERSON	has chosen a popular subject and treats it popularly .

		His book consists of a 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, tn En number of essays covering a considerable range of topics .

		In the first of them he traces the history of the horse-shoe , states the superstitions connected with it , and discusses the theories regarding their origin .

		While always interesting , the argument lacks definiteness and coherence .

		The other essays are : '' Fortune and Luck , '' '' Folk-lore of Common Salt , '' '' Omens of Sneezing , '' '' Days of Good and Evil Omen , '' '' Superstitious Dealings with Ani - mals , '' and '' The Luck of Odd Numbers . ''

		These are uneven in interest and treatment , although all of them show diligence in gathering data and some originality in treatment .

		A rather tiresome feature of Dr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's work is the homily thrown into most of his essays , in which he deplores the exist - ence of the ideas and superstitions studied .

		This seems an unnecessary regret .

		A streak of super - stition is human : it will last while man lasts .

		A nation which has delighted in
Dietrich Knickerbocker	ORGANIZATION	, and has ' taken to its heart Sleepy Hollow and Rip
Van Winkle	PERSON	, rather owes it to itself to become acquainted with
Vondel	PERSON	and his '' Lucifer . ''

		Look - ing back to the Dutch episode in our history , we sometimes fail to estimate rightly that vigorous people which produced
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, De
Ruyter	PERSON	,
Huy	PERSON	- gens , and various other noteworthy persons , among whom we might mention also
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, since he was cast out by his own people .

		These gained wide fame largely because they did not have to trust to the feeble powers of speech : pictures , sea-fights , pendulums , philosophies , are all independent of lin - guistic boundaries .

		Like
Milton	PERSON	,
Vondel	PERSON	had the courage to write his great poem in his own tongue .

		Mr.
Leonard C. Van Noppen	PERSON	has just translated it into ours -LRB-
Vondel	ORGANIZATION	's Lucifer :
Continental Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in a book that deserves mention for a number of reasons .

		It is excellently printed and bound , interestingly illustrated , and enriched with an Intro - duction by Professor
W. H. Carpenter	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, an Essay by Dr.
G. Kalff	PERSON	of
Utrecht	LOCATION	, a sketch of
Vondel	ORGANIZATION	's life and times by the author , and also an Interpretation of the poem by him .

		There is , there - fore , everything that one would ask for in such a book .

		Or , rather porro unum , we had almost forgotten everything that one could ask , provided that the translation be good .

		There is always a moment of suspense , in turning to a well-published translation , in which we wonder whether it will be readable .

		Mr.
Van Noppen	PERSON	has in this matter been singularly successful : his translation seems almost like an original .

		We do not mean that it has pre - cisely the poetic character of Vondel himself ; that would be a risky assertion .

		But it does have a poetic character , it is not obviously a translation , it will be read by many , we suspect , without that frantic desire to know the original which accom - panies the reading of some translations .

		There is much more to say about this book .

		We would gladly speak of the pictures , curious things like old wood engravings , by
John Aarts	PERSON	.

		We would gladly say a word on the position taken as to
Milton	LOCATION	's poetic relations with
Vondel	PERSON	, but the parallel pas - sages cited give others a good opportunity to judge .

		We regret also that we have not room for a few words of comment on the poem itself , which might show that it was just now worth reading .

		But the exigencies of time and space must be our apology for merely calling attention to a book that will come into relation with a good many lines of reading .

		There are not a few English ladies German Elisabeth wno nave married German husbands , and her garden .

		, .

		, , , , - mi - i .1 > and we imagine that ''
Elizabeth	PERSON	is one of them .

		Further , we believe that
Elizabeth	PERSON	-LRB- rather bored with kaffeeklatches and other German festivities -RRB- spent most of her time in her garden , and there allowed herself to write down things about it and herself .

		Then her friends in
England	LOCATION	, to whom on visits she read select portions , kept saying '' Oh , that is so charming !

		Really , you must publish it '' ; and the result was ''
Elizabeth	PERSON	and her German Garden '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		So much is our opinion of course , more or less doubtful : more like a fact is it that
Elizabeth	PERSON	-LRB- whoever she may be -RRB- had a genuine love of flowers and gardens , and a keen appreciation of the colors of nature .

		We are sure that all garden - lovers will detect this in her .

		She may not have known very much about flowers probably she did not but she appreciated them , and for a rambling sort of garden - journal her book is very pleasant .

		So far as the garden is concerned , the author may well enough remain impersonal .

		But her opinions on other matters , or rather her mental attitudes , are such that it is of interest to know whether she is really German or not .

		If we may judge from the book , she is the wife of a man of good family , living upon his estate in
Pomerania	LOCATION	.

		She speaks of herself as a German .

		But we think it would be unlikely that a German girl of fifteen should have the chance to fall in love with the parish organist who wore a sur - plice on
Sundays	DATE	and a frockcoat and '' bowler '' hat other days , or that a German mother should call her children 's mixture of German and English '' Justice tempered with Mercy , '' or that any Ger - man at all should speak of a '' German gardening - book , '' a '' German
Sunday	DATE	, '' a '' German rose , '' as this lady does , or in general show the same contempt for
Germany	LOCATION	.

		As an Englishwoman exiled to Ger - many ,
Elizabeth	PERSON	's ideas and ways of thought and life are not so very remarkable .

		But they are not uninteresting therefor ; in fact , there is enough in them to induce a second reading .

		A really good life of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	will find many readers .

		We look forward to its appearance , that we may be able to go over the chances and triumphs of that life with the help of someone who knows ; that we may try to see just the way it was that
Stevenson	PERSON	's work took shape and was moulded into form , to appreciate just the place he filled among us , to estimate , it may be , his genius .

		We
A. Scotch life of Stevenson	ORGANIZATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL turned to the volume on
Stevenson	PERSON	by
Margaret Moyes Black	PERSON	in the '' Famous Scots '' series -LRB- im - ported by Scribner -RRB- , with the hope of finding some - thing which should put us in the right direction .

		A Life need not be long to be useful .

		A thorough knowledge of the facts of your man 's life , a keen appreciation of his books if he be a man of letters , and a matured estimate of his genius , will give motive power and character for an interesting narrative , which may be very short , as the plan of this series requires .

		Miss Black hardly reaches the ideal of such attainment , although she has written a not uninte ` resting book .

		There are some minor annoy - ances : she almost always speaks of '' Mr.
Steven	PERSON	- son '' ; she describes his writings as if to people quite unfamiliar with them ; and so on .

		Nor does she quite meet one 's desire in ease of narration -LRB- not to demand charm -RRB- , or in critical power .

		One element , however , her book does have which we in
America	LOCATION	more than others , perhaps , should value : namely , a familiarity with the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	life of which
Stev	PERSON	- enson made a part until his health sent him else - where .

		We are apt not to appreciate enough the Scottish temper of one whom we are rather inclined to think of as a great writer in our own language .

		But here is the intimate and almost unconscious familiarity with
Edinburgh	LOCATION	that is needed to fill out our remembrance of
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Had it noth - ing more than this ,
Miss Black	ORGANIZATION	's book would not be without interest to the many who love the greatest of the romancers of our generation .

		A natural ^ Among our lighter essayists who deal in the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	with themes belonging to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	,
Alleghanie	PERSON	, .

		gift Q f greater degree than Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	.

		There is a delicacy , a humor , a grace in expression , an aptness in allusion , and a genial disposition appar - ent in his writings which give them a distinctive fascination .

		His latest volume , `` A World of Green Hills '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is an itinerary , in sepa - rate yet coherent sketches , of a series of rambles in the
Southern Alleghanies	LOCATION	in quest of birds and flowers and mountain scenery . ''

		I sauntered along , '' he .

		writes , `` with frequent interruptions , of course -LRB- that was part of the game -RRB- , here for a bird , there for a flower , a tree , or a bit of landscape . ''

		The main object which inspired him was the study of the raven , said to be common in the highlands of
North Carolina	LOCATION	. ''

		But ravens or no ravens , I meant to enjoy myself , '' he declares ; and he did enjoy everything that came to him with such zest , and he tells the story of it with such quiet feeling , that the reader becomes an active sharer in his experi - ence .

		Unfortunately , no ravens appeared to crown the naturalist 's satisfaction ; indeed , '' as far as ravens were concerned '' he carried home '' a lean bag a brace of interrogation points '' only .

		His readers have little occasion to lament this fact , how - ever , so abundant are the subjects of his observation and so magical is the interest he manages to throw around every incident in his adventures . ''

		I relish natural country talk , '' he says , and hence he accosts every man and woman and child met on the lonely highway , and calls from each by his friendly man - ner the best that lay under the rustic exterior , gain - ing thereby many a glimpse of a strong and pleasing individuality .

		If
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	's assertion be true , that '' infection is a sure sign of art , '' then Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	is an artist of the finest type , for there is not a page in his volume which fails to communicate the subtle contagion of his cheerful , tranquil , serious spirit .

Roediger	PERSON	, and afterwards by Professor
Emil Kautzsch	PERSON	of
the University of Halle	ORGANIZATION	.

		This English edition was translated by the late Rev.
G. W. Collins	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, from the twenty-fifth German edition , and after his death was replenished by the new material of the twenty-sixth German edition , by
A. E. Cowley	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		So that the book is now entitled ''
Kautzsch	PERSON	's Gesenius 's Hebrew Grammar '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , translated by
Collins	PERSON	and
Cowley	PERSON	.

		As it now stands , this is the best up-to-date compre - hensive Hebrew grammar in existence .

		The work of translating the German into English , never an easy task , seems to have been well done , though there are some idioms upon which translators can never agree .

		The type of the book is skilfully arranged , the larger representing the statements of principles , and the smaller the citations of examples and their translations .

		We are somewhat amazed to note that the Clarendon Press should not have required and published a Hebrew index to a gram - mar which it was desired to make as complete as possible .

		This is a serious omission , and detracts greatly from the usefulness of a book which the student desires as a vade mecum in Hebrew work .

Henry Esmond	PERSON	, '' '' The English Humourists , '' `` The Four
Georges	PERSON	, '' and the brief essay on '' Charity and Humour . ''

		The introduction , by Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	, is rather longer than usual , with many illustrations , and particularly interesting to us because it deals , in part , with
Thackeray	PERSON	's American lecture tour .

		He liked
Boston	LOCATION	society , and said that it was '' like the society of a rich Cathedral-town in
England	LOCATION	grave and de - corous , and very pleasant and well read . ''

		He found that a man might lecture in
America	LOCATION	without being thought infra dig .

		He also had this experience : `` When I came here they told me it was usual for lecturers -LRB- Mr.
B.	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	had done it -RRB- to call upon all the editors of all the papers , hat in hand , and ask them to puff my lectures .

		Says I , ` I 'll see them all , ' here I used a strong expression , which you will find in the Athanasian Creed .

		Well , they were pleased rather than otherwise , and now 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, the papers are puffing me so as to make me blush . ''

		Finally , he got very tired of the business -LRB- although he was to repeat it two years later -RRB- , and wrote : '' The idleness of the life is dreary and demoralizing all through , and the bore and humiliation of deliv - ering these stale old lectures is growing intolerable .

		Why , what a superior heroism is
Albert Smith	PERSON	's who has ascended Mont Blanc four hundred times ! ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		In one sense , there can not be too many translations of Homer , yet it is difficult to discover wherein Mr.
Samuel Butler	PERSON	, in his recent prose version of the '' Iliad '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , has improved upon the translation of Messrs. Leaf ,
Lang	PERSON	, and
Myers	PERSON	.

		But Mr.
Butler	PERSON	has his own ideas about translation , and had a right to give them shape .

		His version is rather freer than others of recent making , and he seeks to avoid hackneyed epi - thets and phrases .

		At all events he is better employed in this task than in his endeavor to prove that
Nausicao	PERSON	wrote the '' Odyssey . ''

		The
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	has just issued a gift-book as beautiful in execution as it is unusual in character .

		It consists of a series of eight colored repro - ductions of paintings representing '' Scenes in the Life of Buddha , '' the work of Professor
Keichyu Yamada	PERSON	of
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		These paintings are selected from a series made by the artist to illustrate the Japanese translation of '' The Gospel of Buddha , '' by Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	, which work is used as a text-book in some of the Buddhist schools of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The present reproduction is highly successful as to the coloring , which is exceptionally deli - cate .

		The collection of '' Songs of Life and Nature '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which has been made by
Eleanor Smith	PERSON	for the use of schools for girls , is a work which displays intelligence and good taste in unusual degree .

		Classical selections and folk-songs are interspersed with good modern compositions , and the selections are made with reference , not only to their musical value , but also with regard to the literary value of the texts , the eth - ical inspiration to be derived from them , and their fit - ness to the general plan of educational work adopted in progressive schools .

		The book is one to be heartily commended . '

		Mr.
M. E. Lowndes	PERSON	is the author of a biographical ; study of ''
Michel de Montaigne	PERSON	, '' which is published at the

		This essay embodies the facts unearthed by the researches of MM .


Payen	PERSON	aud Malvezin , and interprets them in the light of the immortal '' Essays '' themselves .

		The author ` is in full sympathy with his subject , and has produced what is probably the most readable account existing in English of the pleasant egotist whose name this study bears .

		A considerable body of notes supplements the text of this monograph .

		Mr.
Lorenzo Sears	PERSON	is the author of a treatise , running to some three hundred and fifty pages , upon the ''
Prin	PERSON	- ciples and Methods of Literary Criticism '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The work has grown , we are told , out of '' an attempt to guide a class in literature in making critical estimates of their reading . ''

		The subject is dealt with in a care - fully classified and logically grouped series of chapters , characterized by admirable good sense , but by no strik - ing literary excellence .

		The work is a plain and not particularly attractive statement of obvious truths and commonplace judgments .

		It will probably be useful to students who are beginning the study of literature .

		Mr.
Joseph Shaylor	PERSON	is the compiler of a small book , for which Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has penned an introduction , which gives a selection of extracts pertinent to the sub - ject of '' The Pleasures of Literature and the Solace of Books '' -LRB-

		The work is like Mr.

Italy	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	, '' '' Sketches and Studies in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' and '' Italian Byways . ''

		Readers of
Symonds	PERSON	know that these collections comprise much of his most fascin - ating and suggestive writing , and will be glad to have their contents topographically arranged , as they are now to be .

		Long experience in the popular exposition of the principles of political economy has given Dr.
Edward Thomas Devine	PERSON	peculiar qualifications for the prepara - tion of a text-book upon this subject , and his recently published '' Economics '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an excellent book of its sort .

		While not perhaps the best kind of a book for daily use in the schools , it would serve admir - ably to supplement some more formal text-book , and for this purpose , as well as for the use of the general reader , it may be warmly recommended .

		It is , in the main , a treatise readable , lucid , and sound in doctrine .

		Mr.
Stopford A. Brooke	PERSON	's '' English Literature from the Beginning to the Norman Conquest '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is essentially a recast of the author 's previous work on '' Early English Literature up to the Days of Alfred . ''

		The original text has been shortened , rewritten , and rearranged , besides being supplemented for the present volume by a long chapter on
Alfred	PERSON	, and four other chapters on the subsequent period .

		There are many translated passages in the text , and a number of others in the appendix , where we find '' The Wanderer '' and '' The Battle of Maldon . ''

		A bibliography is appended .

		Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	's edition of '' The Writings of Thomas Jeiferson '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- has reached its ninth volume , and already draws near the close of the great President 's life .

		The correspondence ' for the years 1807-1815 is given in this volume , and we should sup - pose that one more volume ought to complete the col - lection .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's services to American historical scholarship are so many and varied that we hardly need to characterize them with every new book that bears his name .

		Possessors of the set now in question will be glad to learn that it will soon stand complete upon their shelves .

		A revised edition of Professor
Edward Channing	PERSON	's '' Students ' History of the United States '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with additions taking in the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, has re - cently come to us , and we are once more impressed with the admirable character of the book .

		The recent ten - dency to include in the
last year	DATE	of secondary school work a serious study of American history can not fail to receive new impetus from the mere fact that such a volume as this of Mr.
Channing	PERSON	, so suitable for the purpose , is to be had .

		Mathematical Essays and Recreations .

		By
HERMANN SCHUBERT	PERSON	; from the German by
THOMAS J. McCoRM ACK	ORGANIZATION	.

		A collection of six articles bearing the following titles : -LRB- 1 -RRB- '' The Defi - nition and Notion of Number '' ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- '' Monism in Arithmetic '' ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- '' On the Nature of Mathematical Knowledge '' ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- `` Magic Squares '' ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- '' The Fourth Dimension '' ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- '' The History of the Squaring of the Circle . ''

		The first three articles are concerned with the construction of arithmetic as a monistic science , all the consequences of which flow as a matter of pure logic from a few simple principles .

		The article on the '' Fourth Dimension '' is popular and shows clearly what is meant by '' dimension '' in science and what the legitimate function of a '' fourth dimension '' is in mathematics ; of the claims of spiritualism to this beautiful and convenient concept , it disposes definitely .

		The article on '' Magic Squares '' is a pleasing recreation .

		That on the '' Squaring of the Circle '' gives the history of one of the most instructive and inter - esting episodes in the history of human thought .

		Both these essays are very complete popular accounts of their subjects , more complete per - haps than any generally accessible accounts in English .

		91 NEW PHASES OF THE ROMANCE .

		When the Wizard of the North laid aside his pen and closed his series of romantic fiction , the reading world had already accorded him a unique place in modern literature .

		He had done for letters a work unequalled in value by that of any writer since Shakespeare ; he had advanced the historical romance to eminence , and shown it to be worthy of discriminating criticism .

		Romance was no longer to be repre - sented by '' The Castle of
Otranto	LOCATION	. ''

		Scott had re-created Romance .

		Nor was current opinion satisfied with con - ferring this meed of praise ; there were those who felt that so brilliant a genius must have exhausted the resources of Romance , and that
Scott	PERSON	could have no successor .

		This record of Romantic tales began with a novel .

		It was in the life of an era then only sixty years past that
Scott	PERSON	found the mate - rial for his '' Waverley . ''

		Does it seem incon - gruous that his entire series of fiction should have come to bear the title of the '' Waverley Novels '' ?

		It will be remembered that the genius for Romance which made him illustrious had shown itself in that initial novel .

		It was the romantic element in '' Waverley '' which convinced the reading world that a new era in fiction had opened .

		Sixty years have passed since the close of that series of romances , and the belief that
Scott	PERSON	is to have no rival seems to be more and more confirmed .

		Dumas has surpassed and others have emulated him in fertility of produc - tion .

		Nevertheless , there is no real rivalry ; the charm of the Wizard 's style remains his own .

		But Romance does not die ; and though
Scott	PERSON	stands alone in his chosen field , new op - portunities are revealed for the work of the romancer , and new achievements crown his fertile imagination .

		Great as was
Scott	PERSON	's departure from the earlier canons of romantic fiction , the romance of the present time exhibits even greater departure from the
Waverley	LOCATION	pattern .

		In the old Romance , realism had no proper place .

		The more unreal the events chronicled , and the farther removed from the actualities of life , the greater the credit to the imagination of 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, the romancer .

		Tried by this standard , '' The Castle of
Otranto	LOCATION	'' was awarded place and fame .

		As Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	said : '' In the romance formerly written , every transaction and senti - ment was so remote from all that passes among men , that the reader was in little danger of making any application to himself . ''

		But there is no necessity which compels the Imagination to bear false witness in order that it may be honored .

		The modern historical romance , by its faithful representations of the characters and motives and deeds of past eras , has shown the imagination at work in con - formity to realistic standards .

		Scott 's followers have sedulously observed this essential of their art , and truthfulness has become an accepted canon of the historical romance .

		Bulwer 's '' Last Days of
Pompeii	LOCATION	'' and '' Last of the Barons , '' and
Thackeray	PERSON	's ''
Henry Esmond	PERSON	'' and '' The Virginians , '' attest its admitted au - thority .

		Hawthorne came , and an avenue was opened to new fields for the work of the Romancer .

		The imagination now found its required mate - rial in the social life of a new world , a world with no history , in which there were no ruins , no venerable traditions .

		The ancient , the un - known , the mysterious , the startling , were the elements theretofore conceded to be essential to romantic fiction .

		Hawthorne found , in the simple life of
New England	LOCATION	, sufficient of these elements to constitute real Romance .

		Even with his exuberant imagination , this was no light task , as his own words declare . ''

		No author , without a trial , can conceive of the difficulty of writing a romance about a country where there is no shadow , no antiquity , no mystery , no picturesque and gloomy wrong , nor anything but a commonplace prosperity , in broad and simple daylight , as is happily the case with my dear native land . ''

		This inevitable difficulty , once conquered by Haw - thorne , has seemed less formidable to later romancers .

		But
Hawthorne	PERSON	did even a greater service to romantic fiction .

		In the
New England	LOCATION	life not only of the past , but of to-day , he found the elements of romance latent , and brought them into play .

		His quick imagination had flashed upon the romantic elements in his own life at Brook Farm ; and he employed these and sim - ilar features in other personal episodes , in weaving for us a tale of modern life , the ''
Blithedale Romance	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has opened up for the present age a new phase of romantic literature .

		Doubtless some will say that the Romance of Real Life is a contradiction in terms , and that the Romantic and the Realistic are not only anti- thetic but antagonistic .

		Realism has been well exploited in late years , and its disciples seem disposed to conquer , and by conquering to con - vert the world .

		The recent novel has been almost uniformly realistic , and this is usually claimed as its chief merit .


George Eliot	PERSON	's novels of real life have won her the highest rank as a novelist , and the leadership of an army of admiring followers ; and '' Marcella '' is pronounced the greatest novel of the realistic school since '' Middlemarch , '' entitling its au - thor to succeed to
George Eliot	PERSON	's honors .

		But even realism as thus expounded fails to satisfy some honest critics .

		A new school charges the realists with giving too loose rein to fancy , and advocates a fiction so faithfully true to actual life that it is to be properly called veritism .

		The imagination is so dangerous a steed that it must be effectually curbed and bridled ; the truth , the very truth only , must be told ; and the realist must confess his failure to be exact , and must abandon the field of fiction to the veritist .

		Gradgrind reappears , and again insists upon the inestimable value and the prime importance of facts .

		At the very time of this exaltation of Real - ism , there comes a revival of the Romance .

		We observe not only a renewed feeling among authors that this form of fiction has still a career before it , and a revived interest in it among readers of fiction , but indications also of new worlds to be opened to its conquests .

		It should be noted first , that the novelists themselves , even the realists , do not despise the Romance .


George Eliot	PERSON	was not wholly satis - fied with depicting real life , and she went back to the romantic period in Florentine history for her '' Romola , '' a romance which well contends with her novels for high place .

		The romances of
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Bulwer	PERSON	were children of their affection , and still find appreciative readers no less than their novels .

		Novelists like Black ,
Hardy	LOCATION	, and
Besant	PERSON	turn aside from the attrac - tions of real life to revel in romance .


Charles Reade	PERSON	wins more fame by '' The Cloister and the Hearth '' than by any other of his novels , and the industrious Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	begins his career by introducing '' Mr.
Isaacs	PERSON	, '' a tale well suiting the old definition of romance .

		Again , a new school of writers has appeared , who have adopted the historical romance as their field , and seek to assure us of its renewed claims to our attention .

		In
England	LOCATION	, Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71
Weyman	PERSON	presents a series of romantic tales , founded upon some of the remarkable episodes in French history , which improve upon earlier efforts in the same class , in illustrating the de - velopment of high traits of character under the stress of adverse circumstances .

		In
America	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Mary Hartwell Catherwood	PERSON	has felt the inspiration of strange episodes in the early French occupation of our northern frontier , and in her historical sketches has well reinforced
Hawthorne	PERSON	's testimony to the romantic features of the settlement epoch in this country .

		In the conflicts between the English and French civ - ilizations on this and another continent , Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	has found the materials for more extended romances , in relating which he has caught the secret of that picturesque presenta - tion of situations which suggests more than it expresses .


Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	's '' Ramona '' is , on its literary side , an enthusiastic outburst of appreciation of the essentially romantic inci - dents attending the American dispossession of the Indian holdings in
California	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Arthur Sherburne Hardy	PERSON	, in his '' Passe Rose , '' takes his readers back to the era of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	, amid the adventurous phases of a state of so - ciety in which civilization was struggling with barbarism .

		Gen.
Lew Wallace	PERSON	found in Mex - ican history the material for his '' Fair God , '' and in the advent of Christ the inspiration for his ''
Ben Hur	PERSON	. ''

		Later , he has felt the fasci - nation of the old myth of the
Wandering Jew	ORGANIZATION	, a subject essentially romantic , and one which has allured so many romancers ; and in his '' Prince of
India	LOCATION	'' he has invested this myth - ical character with new and engaging attri - butes , and has made him an actor in the intricacies of that most romantic epoch , the fall of
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		We have still another school , who aim to show us the romantic features of the everyday life around us ; who find the romantic in the midst of the real ; in a word , who transmute the Novel into the Romance .

		Their tales may or may not be labelled romantic , but such is their character .

		Those elements of the adventurous , the marvel - lous , or the mysterious , which the romancer is accustomed to seek afar off , among groups of people little known , or in past epochs , these writers find in their own time and among their own acquaintance .

		The marvels of the pre - sent day in science , in the arts , in psychology , and in occult learning and the dreams of the mystic , the ambitions of the philosopher , and the schemes of the social reformer , all these are proved to have their romantic phases , which are illustrated for the reading world of to-day .

		Thus , Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, in his ''
Elsie Venner	PERSON	, '' has pressed medical science into the service of the romance .


Jules Verne	PERSON	has made free with not only the achievements , but also the aims and the ambitions , of modern skill in median ics and engineering .

		Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's detec - tive stories are , in an eminent degree , what
Poe	PERSON	's similar efforts already were in a small way , studies in the recent accomplishments of psychology .

		Mr.
W. H. Mallock	PERSON	has found romantic characteristics in the manner in which , at this very hour , '' The Old Order Changes '' and a new social fabric takes its place .


Charles Egbert Craddock	PERSON	's tales of life in the
Tennes	PERSON	- see mountains would be tiresome indeed , but for the subtle manner in which those heights breed romantic feelings and sentiments in their mountain-dwellers .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's '' Children of the King '' picturesquely exhibits the essen - tially romantic characteristics and experiences of life in southern
Italy	LOCATION	, in our own time .

		Miss
Anna Fuller	PERSON	's group of sketches , '' Peak and Prairie , '' each but a little dash of color upon a bit of canvas , are of similar character , and show the romantic features inherent in the ranch and mining camp life of
Colorado	LOCATION	.

		In this new tendency of
Romance	ORGANIZATION	, we find it competing with Realism in its own field .

		The realists , to champion the superiority of the , Novel , argue that `` truth is stranger than fic - tion . ''

		But it is the truth that is stranger than fiction , in modern life , which furnishes the mate - rial for these new exploits in Romance .

		The ex - traordinary , the marvellous , the startling , which always distinguished the romantic , were never found in chivalric strife , in feudal contests , or in internecine warfare , in greater abundance or more ready to the cunning hand of the story - teller , than they are now in the everyday inci - dents of this wonderful era .

		Now comes Ro - mance and says to this age , '' I find at your very doors , and in your very homes , the warp and woof for my web , which I once went so far to seek . ''

		The Possible disputing ground with the Im - probable , and pushing it to the rear , this is always the basis of the marvellous , this is always involved in the romantic as its fundamental characteristic .

		The romancer is an explorer , a skirmisher ; he is always on the farther verge of neutral ground , always apparently in peril .

		As
Hawthorne	PERSON	said of his own work , while writing '' The House of the Seven Gables '' : '' In writing a romance , a man is always , or 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, always ought to be , careering on the utmost verge of a precipitous absurdity , and the skill lies in coming as close as possible without actu - ally tumbling over . ''

		The present age does not cease to startle us with new developments , crowding close , one upon another , in all fields open to the investi - gations of the human intellect .

		Every day we see new territory wrested from the Improbable and occupied by the Possible .

		The Imagina - tion does not sleep while the Intellect is at work ; and the precipitous absurdity of the romancer is daily a step further removed .

		This new field of the romancer 's work is that upon which
Hawthorne	PERSON	ventured in the '' Blithe - dale Romance . ''

		Psychology , with its myste - ries so little appreciated , so slightly explored , so often quite undiscovered , furnished the basis for those elements of the marvellous which made that tale a Romance .

		So wonderful are the recent developments in psychology that it is but natural that much of the work of the modern romancer should take him into the same field .

		It will be remembered that
Hawthorne	PERSON	in that story anticipated many of the recent disclosures in hypnotism .

		So the Romantic has left the realm of tradi - tion and myth , and has come to sit down with us by the firesides of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		Distinctions between Realism and
Romanti	PERSON	- cism are now but definitions ; the old antag - onism vanishes .

		While the Real occupies one chimney-corner in our libraries , the Romantic is at home in the other .

		Literature is still One , and the Imagination is to remain one of its high-priests .

		It may , doubtless will , have new work for Romance to do , such as has never before been attempted .

		THE NOTES TO THE
CAMBRIDGE TENNYSON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have delayed asking permission to comment on the criticism of the ''
Cambridge Tennyson	PERSON	, '' in THE DIAL of
December 16	DATE	, partly that I might correspond with the writer , and partly that I might reexamine my work on the book and find out how far it deserved the un - qualified condemnation it had received .

		One might infer from the tone of the criticism that I was a literary charlatan whom the writer felt it his duty to show up ; but he assures me that this was not the case .

		He says : '' I was confident all the time , as will all be who know your work , that you were the victim of misplaced confidence in assistants . ''

		It happens that this is true of the poems -LRB- with one exception -RRB- referred to in the criticism ; and I may add that it is the only instance in which I have ever had such assistance in the collation of texts , or , indeed , in any work I have done as an editor .

		In collating
Tennyson	PERSON	's volumes of
1830	DATE	and
1833	DATE	at the British Museum some years ago , as I had not time -LRB- to say nothing of the strain upon my eyes in the poor light of the reading-room in average English weather -RRB- to examine all the poems thoroughly , I worked chiefly on the longer ones -LRB- '' The Lady of Shalott , '' The Mil - ler 's Daughter , '' '' The Palace of Art , '' the Dream of Fair Women , '' etc. -RRB- in which I was most interested , and which had been most altered by the author .

		After I came home I had the collation of the remaining poems done by a person recommended for the purpose by the Museum authorities .

		Suspecting some errors in the work , I returned it for revision , and , as I remember , ten or twelve corrections were made .

		It appears now that there were other errors or omissions which I did not suspect , and did not detect when , later , I had the loan of copies of the original volumes for a short time ; but then , as at the Museum , I gave my attention almost exclusively to the longer poems ; and these , which he '' had not noted before , '' Professor
Jack	PERSON	tells me he finds '' substantially correct . ''

		I find , after carefully verify - ing my notes , that this is also true of '' The Princess '' and '' In Memoriam , '' and I do not doubt that I shall find it true of the '' Idylls of the King '' and the other poems that I have studied somewhat thoroughly .

		It should be understood , however , that the book makes no pretensions to being a complete '' variorum '' edition .

		The '' Publishers ' Note '' -LRB- which I did not write -RRB- states that the collation of texts has been limited to the edi - tions '' accessible '' to me , and these -LRB- English editions I mean -RRB- except the very earliest and the latest -LRB- from
1884	DATE	to 1898 -RRB- have been comparatively few .

		For instance , I have never been able to get hold of the edi - tion of
1851	DATE	, in which the lines '' To the Queen '' first appeared .

		For the reading of the '' Crystal Palace '' stanza I had to depend on quotations in criticisms and commentaries , and four of these -LRB- Shepherd 's ''
Tenny	PERSON	- soniana , '' second edition ,
1879	DATE	;
Wace	ORGANIZATION	's
Alfred Tenny	PERSON	- son , ''
1881	DATE	;
Luce	PERSON	's `` Handbook to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, ''
1895	DATE	; and
Miss E. L. Gary	PERSON	's ''
Tennyson	PERSON	, ''
1898	DATE	, the only authorities accessible to me -RRB- give '' did meet as friends '' ; and
Luce	PERSON	remarks : `` The stanza has defects , the exple - tive did meet , for example . ''

		No authority refers to the subsequent insertion of the fourth stanza ; and
Luce	PERSON	distinctly says that the stanzas were '' one more in num - ber '' in
1851	DATE	than subsequently , on account of the '' Crystal Palace '' one .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 I have found and corrected many errors in
Luce	LOCATION	,
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	, and the rest , but this one I did not suspect and had no means of correcting .

		It is a curious ques - tion , by the by , how this error originated , since the stanza appeared only in the edition of
1851	DATE	.

		There is no such stanza in the first manuscript version of the poem printed by Professor
Jones	PERSON	in his '' Growth of the Idylls , ''
1895	DATE	.

		That no complete '' variorum '' edition was attempted by me ought to be clear to any reader of the notes from such carefully qualified statements as that on ''
Mari	PERSON	- ana , '' quoted in the criticism -LRB- '' The line was changed in the printed poem at least as early as
1875	DATE	. '' -RRB-

		Professor
Jack	PERSON	says it is '' not correct '' for me to assert that '' the original ' sung i ' the pane ' was retained in all the editions I have seen down to 1875 '' ; but I include American editions -LRB- the '' authorized ''
Boston	LOCATION	ones only -RRB- , and one now in my possession dated
1856	DATE	has that reading , and I feel quite sure that it must have been in the edition of
1875	DATE	, which has somehow disappeared from my library .

		His statement that it is in '' none of the editions be - tween
1850	DATE	and
1875	DATE	'' is doubtless true of the English editions .

		I was rash in saying , in a number of instances besides those pointed out by Professor
Jack	PERSON	, that '' the only changes '' in the text are those I mentioned .

		Having found Shepherd and others so often wrong in statements of this kind , I ought to have verified them , if possible , in every instance .

		Thus far , however , in my reexam - ination of my notes on the minor poems , I have found only two or three various readings that seem to me worth recording in an edition not intended to be com - plete in this respect .

		These , and any others like them which I may detect hereafter , will be duly incor - porated in the notes , together with corrections of the occasional misprints and other little errors inevitable in a first edition .

		If any reader of THE DIAL dis - covers such errors , I shall be grateful for a memoran - dum of them .

		For myself , I have always felt it a duty to send authors or publishers information of this kind concerning books that I read or use for reference .

		In the
last forty years	DATE	or more I must have sent them several thousand such corrections sometimes from fifty to a hundred in a single work involving many minute details .

		In my own books I have detected and corrected many more misprints and mistakes than have been kindly pointed out to me by others ; and finding that my literary work , though faithfully done as well as I know how , is far from perfect , I learn , in printed re - views -LRB- of which I write many -RRB- to be charitable in crit - icising the little shortcomings of others , preferring often to call attention to these in a private letter rather than in a public journal .


W. J. ROLFE	PERSON	.


Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
Jan. 16 , 1899	DATE	.

		IS POE `` REJECTED '' IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	, in his very well-put article on '' The American Rejection of Poe '' in your last issue , has , I believe , somewhat overstated his case in his eagerness to state it strongly .

		That
Poe	PERSON	is at the present day '' to a great extent ignored or repudiated '' by the American public seems to me very questionable , instead of unquestionable , as Mr.
Moore	PERSON	thinks .

		In proof of this I need only cite the innumerable editions of his poems and tales , in every conceivable shape , from those in paper covers at
five cents	MONEY	a copy to editions de luxe at fancy or fabulous prices .

		If Mr.
Moore	PERSON	would attempt a collection of even the cheaper editions of
Poe	PERSON	, I think he would at least modify his point of view .

		Nor have I ever yet examined any reputable volume of specimen selections of American prose or verse in which he was unrepresented .

		And is not '' The Raven '' as inevitable in every school '' reader '' or '' speaker '' as the `` Psalm of Life '' or `` Charge of the Light Bri - gade '' ?

		There can also be small doubt that '' The Raven '' and '' The Bells '' have been recited more dif - ferent times by more different '' elocutionists '' in these
United States	LOCATION	than any other two poems by any other American poet .

		As for the popularity of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's prose , it may be recalled that not long since a literary period - ical offered a prize for the best list of ten short stories by American authors , the ten to be selected from those receiving the highest number of votes ; and in the prize list there were two of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's tales .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	is undoubtedly correct in his complaint that
Poe	PERSON	has never been taken into the heart of his native public as , for instance ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	was .

		But the man who '' never had an intimate friend , '' who seemed to have a positive genius for alienating friendship , could hardly be expected to pose as the intimate of his public which has , nevertheless , both critically and popularly stamped him a classic and quite sui generis .

		If the acceptance of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	is in any way doubtful , it is not because of the antique
Poe	PERSON	legends , not because his mastery of technic or imaginative power ever fails of appreciation , but because of the apotheosis of the '' gro - tesque and arabesque , '' miasmas of the pit and the charnel-house , the ghastly light of the baleful planets from which the work of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	the name of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	may never be disassociated .


Poe	PERSON	's metier was his of delib - erate choice ; his atmosphere is of his own creation ; there is not a breath of plain air in it .

		The '' fascina - tion of corruption '' was strong upon him , his work reeks of it ; and it would be strange indeed if
Poe	PERSON	the man were ever to escape from the atmosphere of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	the artist .

		The '' seeds scattered broadcast '' by him have brought forth the fleurs du mal whose blossom is not the dew-drenched rose with head lifted to the sunshine in the garden of the world .

		THACKERAY AND THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Apropos of
Thackeray	PERSON	's confession , as quoted in a current periodical , that the American papers were puff - ing him so as to make him blush , in spite of his neglect to throw a sop to
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	, it may be amusing to re - member that the ''
Boston Courier	ORGANIZATION	'' in
1853	DATE	advised its readers that these American lectures of
Thackeray	PERSON	's were '' a mere retailing of old anecdotes , fragments without originality or any sense of judgment , containing nothing which anybody with a file of old newspapers and magazines might not have said . ''

		Which shows that
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	preserves the tradition of being many-headed .

PARNELL	LOCATION	, IRISH PATRIOT NATIONALIST .

		* In one respect Mr.
R. Barry O'Brien	PERSON	's inter - esting
Life of Parnell	ORGANIZATION	recalls Dr.
Busch	PERSON	's '' Bismarck '' : it leaves with the reader a dis - agreeable impression of the man its author means to eulogize .

		We have always thought that Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	was a patriot in the higher and correcter sense of the term , and that his extraordinary public career , his '' really great career , '' as Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	expressed it , was inspired primarily by love of his country and the desire to advance what he conceived to be her interests ; nor are we yet prepared to sur - render that opinion .

		But the hero of Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's pages , if we have read them aright , so far from being actuated mainly by the gen - erous emotions which the world rightly asso - ciates with patriotism , was spurred primarily by a mere fanatical hatred of
England	LOCATION	, partly inherited from his mother and partly grounded in his foolish early notion that people '' despised him because he was an Irishman , '' and which did not have even a rudimentary knowledge of Irish history to justify it for , be it said , the story of English rule in
Ireland	LOCATION	, from Strong - bow 's day down to the
Smith O'Brien	PERSON	fiasco in the famous cabbage garden at
Ballingarry	LOCATION	, was a sealed book to this man who came within an ace of putting an end to it .

		If hatred for an entire nation was ever incarnate in a man , that man was
Parnell	PERSON	, as our present author por - trays him ; nor does Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	, so far as we can discern , furnish any evidence of
Parnell	ORGANIZATION	's actually loving anything or anyone barring , of course , a notorious and fatal exception in the case of the wife of his political associate , Captain
O'Shea	PERSON	.

		We confess we find it impossible to believe that the career of this great parliamentary leader , whose genius and persistency brought his party within actual view of their political
Goshen	LOCATION	, was mainly prompted by an ignoble emotion such as might incite a
Kerry	PERSON	peasant to fire a rick or shoot a bailiff .

		A lover of
England Parnell	ORGANIZATION	certainly was not .

		But his course in
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, his very policy of obstruc - tion , goes to show his faith in the ultimate soundness and honesty of the English people , and his belief that if , from the forum of the *

House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, he could once really gain the ear of the English electorate the conscience of the nation would be roused to the justice of the Irish national appeal .

		Nothing could be more untrue than the charge that
Parnell	PERSON	was a mere sower of discord who loved obstruction for its own sake and took a malignant pleasure in thwarting the deliberations and blocking the business of the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		If
Parnell	PERSON	disapproved of the rose-water methods of Butt , he also dis - approved of the uncouth and brutal methods of
Biggar	PERSON	from whom , however , he really took his cue .

		His ground idea was , as we have said , that the real reason why the Irish question , as it presented itself in his day , had not been satis - factorily settled was that it had not had a hear - ing .

		To force that question upon the attention of the English democracy through constitu - tional methods was his plan .

		Therefore , he in effect served notice upon the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Com - mons that until the demands of
Ireland	LOCATION	had been duly heard dhd passed upon no other ques - tion whatever should be discussed by it as long as he and his colleagues could prevent it .

		Par - nell 's attitude has been well illustrated by the story of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	woman who , having long tried in vain to get a petition to the Sultan , at last took her station in the public street with her little children , and when the Sultan rode that way flung herself in the road before him , declaring that he must either listen to her ap - peal or trample her and her babes to death beneath his horse 's hoofs .

		In his concluding chapter Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	quotes some interesting statements regarding
Parnell	PERSON	made by Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	in the course of a spe - cial interview in
1890	DATE	.

		Asked what it was that first attracted his attention to
Parnell	PERSON	, Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	replied : ''
Parnell	PERSON	was the most remarkable man I ever met .

		I do not say the ablest man ; I say the most remarkable and most interesting .

		He was an intellectual phenom - enon .

		He was unlike anyone I ever met .

		He did things and he said things unlike other men ... There was no one in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	I would place with him .

		As I have said , he was an intellectual phe - nomenon . ''

		As to
Parnell	PERSON	's much debated release from
Kilmainham	LOCATION	, Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	said : '' ... What is this they call it ?

		The
Kilmainham	LOCATION	treaty .

		How ridiculous !

		There was no treaty .

		* There could not be a treaty .

		Just think what the Habeas Corpus Act means .

		You put a man into gaol on suspi - * Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	, on the contrary , said , when questioned on this point : '' There was a treaty .

		And the terms on our side were that we should deal with some phases of the land question . ''


Parnell	PERSON	's agreement seems to have been that he would `` slow down the agitation . ''

		1899 . -RSB-

		75 cion .

		You are bound to let him out when the circum - stances justifying your suspicion have changed .

		And that was the case with
Parnell	PERSON	. ''

		Replying to the question as to the time when his attention was first seriously turned to the demand for Home Rule , Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	went on to say : '' ... I could not , of course , support Butt 's move - ment , because it was not a national movement .

		I had no evidence that
Ireland	LOCATION	was behind it .

		ParnelFs move - ment was very different .

		It came to this : we granted a fuller franchise to
Ireland	LOCATION	in
1884	DATE	, and
Ireland	LOCATION	then sent eighty-five members to the
Imperial Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		That settled the question .

		When the people express their determination in that decisive way , you must give them what they ask .

		It would be the same in
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		I do n't say that Home Rule is necessary for the Scotch .

		But if ever they ask for it , as the Irish have asked for it , they must get it .

		... The union with
Ireland	LOCATION	has no moral force .

		It has the force of law , no doubt , but it rests on no moral basis .

		That is the line which I should always take , were I an Irishman .

		That is the line which as an Englishman I take now .

		Ah !

		had
Parnell	PERSON	lived , had there been no divorce proceedings , J do solemnly believe there would be a Parliament in
Ireland	LOCATION	now . ''

		To Parn ell 's admirers , Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's dra - matic account of his fight to retain the lead - ership of his party after he had forfeited it through his misconduct in the
O'Shea	PERSON	matter makes painful reading .

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	was sufficiently explicit in regard to the course
Parnell	PERSON	ought to have taken : '' ... I do not say that the private question ought to have affected the public movement .

		What I say is , it did affect it , and , having affected it ,
Parnell	PERSON	was bound to go .

		... All said it would be impossible for the movement to go on with him .

		... I think
Parnell	PERSON	acted badly .

		I think he ought to have gone right away .

		He would have come back , nothing could have prevented him ; he would have been as supreme as ever , for he was a most extraordinary man .

		Was he callous to every - thing ?

		I never could tell how much he felt , or how much he did not feel .

		He was generally immovable . ''


Parnell	PERSON	was originally a poor speaker the poorest of speakers .

		He had a harsh , if strong and penetrating , voice , and absolutely no flow of words .

		As time went on he acquired a con - cise , effective style of oratory an eloquence which consists in saying all that needs to be said in the fewest and strongest words .

		But his debut as a speaker , at the time of the
Dublin	LOCATION	election in
1874	DATE	, was most unpromising .

		Mr.
Sullivan	PERSON	describes the scene : '' ... To our dismay ,
Parnell	PERSON	broke down utterly .

		He faltered , he paused , went on , got confused , and , pale with intense but subdued nervous anxiety , caused every - one to feel deep sympathy for him .

		The audience saw it all , and cheered him kindly and heartily ; but many on the platform shook their heads sagely , prophesying that if he ever got to Westminster , no matter how long he stayed there , he would either be a ' silent member ' or be known as ' single-speech
Parnell	PERSON	. ' ''

		Equally unfavorable was the impression made by the young candidate upon Mr.
O'Connor	PERSON	Power .

		He says : ''
Parnell	PERSON	seemed to me a nice gentlemanly fellow , but he was hopelessly ignorant , and seemed to me to have no political capacity whatever .

		He could not speak at all .

		He was hardly able to get up and say , Gen - tlemen , I am a candidate for the representation of the county of
Dublin	LOCATION	. '

		We all listened to him with pain while he was on his legs , and felt immensely relieved when he sat down .

		No one ever thought he would cut a figure in politics .

		We thought he would be a respect - able mediocrity . ''

		So much for early promises .

		It was not long before this feeble stammerer acquired the power to hold his Irish audiences , great open - air meetings , such as had been swept along on the torrent of
O'Connell	PERSON	's eloquence , hanging upon his words , and even to fix the attention of the critical and hostile
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	upon every sentence he uttered .

		Defeated at
Dublin	LOCATION	in
1874	DATE	,
Parnell	PERSON	was returned at the head of the poll for Meath in the following year .

		His maiden speech in
Parliament	LOCATION	was '' short , modest , spoken in a thin voice and with manifest nervousness '' ; but it went to the root of the business , as he saw it : '' I trust that
England	LOCATION	will give to Irishmen the right which they claim the right of self-government .

		Why should
Ireland	LOCATION	be treated as a geographical fragment of
England	LOCATION	, as I heard an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer call her some time ago ?


Ireland	LOCATION	is not a geographical fragment .

		She is a nation . ''


Parnell	PERSON	has at least one claim upon the re - gard of the entire American nation .

		He was opposed to what was known as the '' dynamite policy '' a crude and murderous scheme based on the childish notion that
England	LOCATION	could be terrified into granting Irish demands by ex - ploding dynamite in the streets of
London	LOCATION	.

		That such a plan was hatched , fostered , and allowed to be publicly advocated in the press and from the platform in this country would have been a burning disgrace to us were it not for the fact that American humor refused to take the vaporings of the '' professional patriot '' seriously .

		He was regarded as a '' blather - skite , '' a passing nuisance that could easily be abated when he grew too offensive , and politi - cians cynically stooped to humor his vagaries when they wanted his vote .

		His real objective was believed to be , not Irish freedom , but Irish pocket-books ; and so the law left Irish morality and Irish good sense to deal with him .

		Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	, we are sorry to say , appears to have opposed the dynamitard line of action more on the ground of its impolicy than of its odious and cowardly criminality .

		He knew the iron 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, temper of
England	LOCATION	well enough to see that nothing would be more certain to turn back the hands of the clock of Home Rule than the detestable methods of the `` outrage men '' methods which would be far more likely to land him and his friends in an English jail than in the coveted national '' Parliament on
College Green	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Therefore , while his native caution and his conviction of the necessity of keeping the various Irish political clans and sections '' pulling together '' prompted him to keep in touch so far as possible with them all , he did not -LRB- as Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	states -RRB- '' conceal his pri - vate repugnance to the methods of the Amer - ican extremists .

		He spoke of
Ford	ORGANIZATION	and
Finerty	PERSON	as d d fools . ''

		Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	's epithet is not just the one Americans are commonly accus - tomed to use in the case .

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	has given us a good and an ex - tremely readable biography , as well as a fairly comprehensive account , largely from the inside , of the political movement to which
Parnell	PERSON	gave his life , and which now seems to be , if an American may be permitted to say so , percepti - bly and happily on the wane .

		It appears not improbable that in the course of time and through the exercise of wise and liberal states - manship
Ireland	LOCATION	may come to rest under the
Union	ORGANIZATION	as contentedly and with as little sense of racial degradation as
Scotland	LOCATION	does .

		To that end a consummation , as we venture to think , devoutly to be wished
Parnell	PERSON	, though his aim was otherwise , will have materially con - tributed .

		For it was he , more than any other Irish party leader , who roused
England	LOCATION	to the necessity of devising a more rational and right - eous remedy for Irish unrest than perpetual coercion .

		A TIMELT POLITICAL , TONIC .

		* Now that the election is long over and the Governors and other servants of the people have sworn to do their duty , one may turn again to Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's account of the state of things here in
America	LOCATION	, with a mind more unbiassed than was probable when the book was pub - lished . ''

		Causes and Consequences '' is a book that had certain relations to the politics of
New York	LOCATION	and of the city of
New York	LOCATION	.

		It was begun , says the author , '' in an attempt to explain an election , '' namely , the first municipal election in
Greater New York	LOCATION	under the new * CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES .

		By
John Jay Chapman	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		charter , in which Mr.
Seth Low	PERSON	, on an Inde - pendent ticket , was defeated .

		It was published on the eve of the last state campaign , in which Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, who had by many been regarded as the obvious Independ - ent candidate , refused the Independent nom - ination for governor and was elected on the Republican ticket .

		Its particular relation to the campaign lies in the fact that Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	was one of the Independents who offered Col - onel
Roosevelt	PERSON	the nomination , and who , when the nomination was refused , helped to put an Independent ticket into the field .

		During the campaign , then , anyone who knew something of the conditions that gave rise to the book was likely to be especially interested on one side or the other , and thus the book was probably prejudged by many .

		Now that the election is long past , there will be less prejudice .

		Further , however , it is well enough to know something of these things before reading Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's book , not because the politics of
New York	LOCATION	are necessarily of singular import - ance to the rest of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, but because we are thereby assured that we have here the pro- duction of a man practically acquainted with what he is writing about .

		It does not follow from a man 's being practically acquainted with anything that he knows all about it in any large and intelligent way the reverse is often enough the case ; and it does not follow from the fact that Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	has had his hand in poli - tics that the nation should be led by his views any more than by the views of any district leader or state boss .

		The importance of the matter lies in the fact that we thus have here , not the product of scholarly seclusion nor of club conversation , but of actual daily activity .

		And such an origin gives reality to a work .

		Doubtless the especial kind of activity will not by some readers be esteemed much more prac - tical than the intellectual activity of the aca - demic theorist or the linguistic activity of the man in the smoking-room .

		But on the whole it is more practical .

		If I , for instance , should write a book on American politics , I should feel the want of all that stored-up result of absolute everyday impression that Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	pos - sesses .

		We should , therefore , consider his book as expert testimony , recollecting all the time the way expert testimony should be considered .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's book is the statement of what will be the character of the reformation of American public life .

		The book and its author will be variously regarded .

		Some will think of Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	as wearing a white plume and
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 77 bearing an oriflamme of war .

		Others will regard him as the leader of a forlorn hope , and will expect only after a long time to find his body by the wall of the fallen fort .

		Others still will consider him a sort of
Richard Harding Davis	ORGANIZATION	in politics .

		But none of these figures exactly suits the case .

		In fact , it is better to get the matter out of politics for the moment , to consider the book only .

		So here are some very simple im - pressions , put down , as nearly as I can manage , in the order in which they occurred to me .

		In the first place , the book is eminently interesting , a matter that might , perhaps , have been expected .

		I am not so sure of that , though : books on political and social conditions rarely attract lay readers unless their main ideas are distinctly popular .

		Now , the fundamental idea of this book is not at all popular : it is , on the other hand , a little recondite , I should say .

		Yet the book is so well written , it is so clearly the natural and current expression of the work - ing of a brilliant mind , that almost of necessity it starts up that counter-working in the mind of the reader which we call '' interest . ''

		Mr.
Chap	PERSON	- man 's style is by this time well enough known : it is naturally effervescing , or perhaps we should say fermenting .

		It is true also that it is Emer - sonian ; but that is probably an accident .

		So much occurs to one who reads along in the book , through Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's account of present politics and of social life .

		Next comes the essay on Education ; and this essay I take to be cardinal to the book .

		It is a development of the principles of
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	on which the Kin - dergarten is based .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	employed a governess for his children . ''

		After a couple of months , '' says he , '' I discovered that it was I who was being educated . ''

		He is pretty sure that anyone else who gets hold of these ideas will be educated , too .

		Of one of them he re - marks that '' the consequences of a belief in it are so tremendous , that no man who is not pre - pared to spend his life completely dominated by the idea , ought even to pause to consider it . ''

		As to the value of these ideas , as to the sound - ness of Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's exposition of them , I shall not make even an effort to decide , much less to make any statement .

		I will , however , indulge myself so far as to make one remark .

		The influence of action upon belief is , I sup - pose , unquestionable .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	, for in - stance , writes well because he realizes his idea ; and he realizes his idea because it has taken form through action .

		But why did he act thus and so ?

		Not , I imagine , from accident , but from belief .

		And whence that belief ?

		from previous action only ?

		and so on back ?

		That must land in chance somewhere .

		Now , I have , on the whole , thought it prob - able that a man 's action was as often the result as the cause of his belief .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	would perhaps say that this is because I am a logician , a professor of rhetoric , a student , a theorizer , a doctrinaire , one who fancies that an idea is a definite something that may be dropped into the mind , much as a little medicine may be dropped into a glass of water , or , rather , a tonic into a person .

		Well , it is true that I am all those things more or less , and doubtless that is one reason why I prefer to wander with
Plato	ORGANIZATION	.

		But why this trouble as to which comes first , idea or act ?

		Because Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	would seem to infer from his view that right action -LRB- spon - taneously induced , pefhaps , or perhaps from right example -RRB- will bring about a right dispo - sition here in
America	LOCATION	, and particularly that action in reform movements will give us all such a feeling about Democracy that the
United States	LOCATION	will become really what she now is only potentially .

		That is his theory , as far as I can see .

		He shows that politics is debased through selfishness encouraged by commerce ; he shows that society is debased by the low tone of pol - itics .

		Then he propounds the great truth that , to be , men must do ; and also that they must do for others , and not only that they must do so , but that they want to do so , and that they do do so .

		This is the constant tendency ; commercialism is temporary and will pass away .

		Men will be brought to right action by -LRB- among other things -RRB- reform movements .

		More and more will people learn to act in politics unselfishly , and thus they will become individualized and independent , and the nation as a whole will be purified .

		This rather puts the boot on the other leg : Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	is now the logician and all the other kinds of star-gazer noted above .

		Why should we have right action ? ''

		Let it take care of itself , '' Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	seems to say ; '' people prefer to be unselfish ; they will insist on being so ; they can ' t help it in the long run . ''

		That is to some degree true .

		Still , people will be a little better for good advice in the matter of government as in other matters .

		For it is worth noting that Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	seems to regard government almost as an end in itself .

		He says : '' Here is the American people ill-governed .

		It is a shameful thing .

		But by a certain means the American people will surely be so toned up that they will govern themselves well .

		Then it will be all right . ''

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	believes '' a virtuous ruler to be 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, the prototype of all possible human fulfilment . ''

		Now , of course every man thinks that his own trade is the most important .

		The schoolmaster says that education is the panacea .

		The clergy - man says that religion will reconstitute society .

		The politician thinks that government is the main thing .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	likes good govern - ment : he agrees with the poet -LRB- may for aught I know be the poet -RRB- who sings : '' Tilings are there that I wish and I mast have Will have them for they suit me .

		It 's my whim .

		A decent class of men in public life , Some tolerably honest courts of law , A friend or two that would not steal a watch , And above all a riot of free speech Where every man may revel to his fill And not be hounded for a lunatic . ''

		Those are good things , to be sure ; but there are other things more satisfying to me , and in reading the book I could n't help thinking : ' * This government is only machinery , after all .

		If the government only is improved , people will go wrong in other ways .

		If the whole plane of living is lifted up , government is merely a de - tail . ''

		It is true that something like this may be said to everybody who tries to better man - kind in some special direction .

		I rather think it can not be said of what may be called the fourth dimensional method , which works in a direction quite unperceivable to most of us .

		But I had no intention of going so far in criticism .

		The idea that in a couple of columns you can criticize fairly and fully what a man ^ has thought out and expressed in two hundred pages , arouses little enthusiasm in me .

		I do n't feel that there is a fair show for either .

		Nor would I try to summarize the book , for that might make people think that they knew what was in it without a reading .

		It must be enough if I have given something of an idea as to the kind of book it is .

		Then those who like that kind will go and read it , and , it may be added , they will find it very entertaining and also beneficial .

		THE SUCCESSORS OF HOMER .

		* Professor
Lawton	PERSON	's little volume on '' The Successors of Homer , '' a companion and sequel to his '' Art and Humanity in Homer , '' offers the English student an untechnical and very readable survey of the remains of Greek hexa - meter poetry outside of the two great epics .

		In successive chapters he treats of the lost epics of the '' Cycle , '' the Works and Days and Theo - * THE SUCCESSORS OF HOMER .

		By

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		gony of
Hesiod	ORGANIZATION	, the so-called Homeric Hymns , and the hexameters of the pre-Socratic philo - sophical poets Parmenides and Empedocles .

		Professor
Lawton	PERSON	is right in claiming a cer - tain unity for his theme , whether we find that unity in the metre , the prolongation and grad - ual decay of the epic tradition , or the conven - ience of the modern student .

		The epic Cycle is discussed in
Lang	PERSON	's '' Homer and the Epic . ''

		There is a fair account of Hesiod in
Black	LOCATION	- wood 's Ancient Classics , and there are excel - lent short chapters on him in
Jebb	LOCATION	and Sy - monds .

		The Hymn to
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	is the theme of one of
Walter Pater	PERSON	's fascinating studies , and is enthusiastically interpreted in Professor
Dyer	PERSON	's '' Gods in
Greece	LOCATION	. ''

		The Hymn to Homer is accessible in
Shelley	LOCATION	's delicious trans - lation .

		But there is no one work in English so well adapted as the one before us to bridge over for the general reader and young student the gap between Homer and the lyric and dramatic poetry of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Lawton	PERSON	's method resembles that of the well-known '' Ancient Classics for English Readers , '' and is for its purpose more effective than a more pretentious and less direct way of approach would be .

		The reader who desires information about books which he can not study in the original tongue does not want a double distillation of subtle critical epithets .

		He wishes to get at the content of the books with as little hindrance as possible from the scholastic and critical scaffoldings that have been built up about them .

		This want Professor
Lawton	PERSON	meets by translating in the metre of the orig - inal all the more beautiful or significant pas - sages .

		The translations are prefaced or accom - panied by just enough prologue and commentary to make them intelligible , and connected by a running summary of the duller or more tech - nical omitted passages .

		These translations bring up again the eternal question of the English hexameter .

		We may say at once that we like Professor
Lawton	PERSON	's hexameters here better than in his Homer .

		The English hexameter , except as an occasional ex - periment in the hands of a great poet , not only fails to satisfy a nice ear but is fatally lacking in distinction .

		Such a line , for example , as '' Zeus , Who as he sits with Themis engages in chat confidential , '' may pass in a Homeric Hymn .

		In the Iliad it would be intolerable .

		Professor
Lawton	PERSON	, of course , has better lines than this .

		It would be a very sensitive ear indeed that felt a jar in the description of Apollo ,

		THE DIAL 79 `` Stepping graceful and high , and the splendor glimmers about him , Flash of the gleaming feet , and of garments cunningly woven . ''

		And when the critic has said his worst , it re - mains true that the line-for-line translation in the measure , if not quite the metre , of the orig - inal , conveys a truer average impression than could easily be given in any other way .

		What , for example , could be done in English rhyme or iambic blank verse with such lines as : ''
Glaukonome	PERSON	, who in laughter delights , and
Pontoporeia	LOCATION	, Leiagore and Euagore and Laomedeia '' ?

		At the close of each chapter , Professor Law - ton gives brief references to the chief German authorities .

		The commentary is enlivened by modern touches and a few poetic parallels .

		We miss an allusion to the beautiful imitation of the Hesiodic prologue found in Matthew Ar - nold 's '' Empedocles . ''

		A DISTINGUISHED WORKER FOR THE INSANE .

		*
Pliny Earle	PERSON	was born in
1809	DATE	that annus mirdbilis so prolific in great men the world over ; and in his field , which was a restricted one , his talents were great , while , if he had not genius , he had the industry and power of taking pains , which , we are told , are of the essence of genius .

		He did not have a great part to play , yet he was as remarkable in his field as many of the great men of
1809	DATE	were in their larger fields .

		It was in work among and for the insane that the significance of Dr.
Earle	PERSON	's life lay ; yet there are many scenes and episodes related in his memoirs which have an interest and a charm for every reader .


Pliny Earle	PERSON	was of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	parentage , being descended from
Ralph Earle	PERSON	, one of the found - ers of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	; and through life he main - tained the best characteristics and traditions of the
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	, though , apparently , not formally adhering to that communion .

		His early travels in
Europe	LOCATION	brought him into con - tact , in both
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, with many of the makers of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	history , and many other men and women who left their impress on their time , and the reception he had from * MEMOIRS OF

		There is some - thing most refreshing in the account of these European travels at a period -LRB-
1839	DATE	-RRB- when
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope would seem to have been more interesting to the tourist than it is now .

		The pictures given in this book of the official life in
Washington	LOCATION	during the administrations of
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	,
Buchanan	PERSON	, and
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and of social scenes in
Washington	LOCATION	and
Charleston	LOCATION	, are also most interesting .

		To read at one 's ease to-day about being '' jammed '' through the various colored rooms of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	at the official receptions in the days of crinoline mingled with Republican simplicity not to say rudeness is more amusing than the actual experience could have been ; for Dr.
Earle	PERSON	tells of seeing people go and come by jumping through the windows , and of a foreign Ambassador and his lady climbing over piles of coats when an effective blockade of humanity barred all the doors , at a reception of President
Pierce	PERSON	.

		Again , the accounts of the trip to
Cuba	LOCATION	in
1852	DATE	, and of the visit to
Havana	LOCATION	,
Cardenas	PERSON	, and
Matanzas	LOCATION	, have an especial interest in the light of more recent events .

		Dr.
Earle	PERSON	found
Cuba	LOCATION	most attractive as it was then in its brief hey - day of prosperity .

		Incidentally , one learns with interest that President Polk made an offer to
Spain	LOCATION	of
$ 100,000,000	MONEY	for the island now so disastrously lost to her .

		Dr.
Earle	PERSON	was '' brought during his visit to

William Tuke	PERSON	in
1790	DATE	to 1800 , forms as famous an historical landmark of philanthropy in
England	LOCATION	as does
Pinel	ORGANIZATION	's universally ap - plauded contemporary heroism in
France	LOCATION	, in being the first to remove , and at his personal risk , the chains from the mad men and women who had worn them for years in the '' bedlams '' of
Paris	LOCATION	, the Bicetre and Salpetriere .

		Dr.
Earle	PERSON	met
Samuel Tuke	PERSON	, a son of
William	LOCATION	; and in becoming familiar with the progress wrought at the York Retreat he no doubt de - rived inspiration further intensifying his inter - est in the insane , and leading him later not only to oppose the abuses of mechanical restraint in caring for these unfortunates , but also to speak and write against the scarcely less abhor - rent '' chemical '' restraint by use of nauseating and narcotizing drugs , and also of blood-letting , which , under the teachings of Rush , the leading 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, American authority at this time in the treat - ment of insanity , was commonly practiced .

		Dr.
Earle	PERSON	met
Elizabeth Fry	PERSON	,
Fowell Bux	ORGANIZATION	- ton , and other famous Quakers and philan - thropists in
England	LOCATION	.

		He visited institutions for the insane in
England	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	, and even the Island of
Malta	LOCATION	.

		In the Turkish asylum , hard by the Mosque of Suleiman at
Constantinople	LOCATION	, he found the un - happy insane with chains round their necks to the number of over thirty .

		All , indeed , were chained but one , and that one was securely locked up because he had so often broken his chains .

		This seems barbarous now ; but it does not mean that
Turkey	LOCATION	was more barbarous than other countries in that day , for barbarity toward the insane was then well-nigh universal .

		Nothing was attempted for any of the insane except those dangerous to life and limb , and in
Turkey	LOCATION	mild cases were looked upon as sacred objects .

		Even in civilized
Paris	LOCATION	, a worse abuse than chains was practiced , or authorized , in the
Bicetre	LOCATION	, by the son of the illustrious friend of the insane ,
Pinel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here patients affected with delusions , or neglectful of their tasks , were fastened in bath-tubs with covers over the tops through which their heads projected , and if they insisted upon their delusions or were other - wise intractable , the cold-water douche was thrown upon them until they would deny their delusions or promise to perform what was re - quired of them .

		In
1840	DATE	, shortly after his return home , Dr.
Earle	PERSON	was engaged to care for the institution of the Friends at
Frankford	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		This was not a '' lunatic asylum , '' as such establish - ments were generally called in that day , but a '' Retreat for Persons deprived of the Use of their Reason . ''

		Here he had an invaluable experience , preparing him well for the larger work to which he was called in
1847	DATE	, when he took charge of the
Bloomingdale Asylum	ORGANIZATION	, the department for the insane of the Hospital of the City of
New York	LOCATION	.

		His five years ' service at this latter place where he saw and de - scribed the first case of '' paresis '' brought to light in
America	LOCATION	, which malady has become so common since was marked by noteworthy labors and researches .

		After resigning from
Bloomingdale	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Earle	PERSON	engaged in studies , travels , practice , and work as an expert on insanity cases , for the years from
1849	DATE	to
1864	DATE	, and spent much time at the
Government Hos	ORGANIZATION	- pital for the Insane , having charge of a portion of the work , and meeting with many remarka - ble experiences in the development of this institution which received and cared for all the insane of the army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here he met many of the famous officials , legislators , and persons of scientific and social distinction abounding in
Washington	LOCATION	at this period .

		It is in this portion of the book that we get some of the cleverest touches of nature and interesting side-lights on historical times and persons .

		In
1864	DATE	Dr.
Earle	PERSON	was made the head of the
State Asylum	ORGANIZATION	for the Insane at
Northampton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and there he spent twenty-one years of rare usefulness and renown .

		Dr.
Earle	PERSON	is presented to us in the portrai - ture of his biographer as a man with few fail - ings .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	is not like some biographers who have the air of saying throughout their work , '' Oh , how good ! ''

		He does not seem to unduly exalt his hero , but gives us , as a rule , an exceptionally sedate and sober-minded por - trayal ; hence , a letter incorporated in the
Washington	LOCATION	reminiscences , from Dr.
Godding	PERSON	, an associate of Dr.
Earle	PERSON	at the
Government Hospital	ORGANIZATION	for the Insane , which refreshingly shows some of the human foibles of our subject , is especially interesting .

		Dr.
Godding	PERSON	tells us that the renowned alienist chewed tobacco , and that he endeavored for some time to leave off by weighing out a few grains less daily , but finally desisted ; also that he hated inordinately to be beaten at any game of skill or hazard .

		We also learn in another connection that Dr.
Earle	PERSON	was a punster , and a depraved one at that .

		This , and the laconic way of telling of some unseemly things in
Cuba	LOCATION	like a cocking main , a bull-baiting , or
Sunday	DATE	festivities by saying , '' My barber related these things , '' or , '' A man who was in
Europe	LOCATION	when I was saw so and so '' -LRB- meaning himself -RRB- , these , as I said , are pleasingly humorous touches .

		We have not left ourselves space to speak of Dr.
Earle	PERSON	's great work at
Northampton	LOCATION	, where he introduced economy , order , industry , com - fort , enjoyment , and beauty into the work of caring for the insane , and made an establish - ment famous the world over .

		Dr.
Earle	PERSON	was the first to introduce lectures and readings be - fore the insane ; he even lectured to them upon insanity with interest and advantage .

		He was also the first to occupy a chair of psychiatry in a medical school in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Earle	PERSON	could hardly have had a better biographer than Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	, whose biog - raphies of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
John Brown	PERSON	, and others , are so well known .

		The material is handled with excellent judgment , and from his abound - ing stores of knowledge he gives us many side -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 81 lights , not to speak of digressions into scarcely related fields .

		The virtues of a biographer and those of his subject are so different that we may often see very interesting lives rendered dull , vicious lives made saintly , charming lives divested of every attraction , and simple lives made complex ; and one does not wonder that
Thackeray	PERSON	left commands that no biography of him should be prepared , to inform , or mis - inform , coming generations .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's book may be commended to all who are inter - ested in social , industrial and educational con - ditions during the middle third of our century , and especially to philanthropists and others who wish to follow the development of men and institutions devoted to the care of the insane during the same period at home and abroad .

		BOOKS ABOUT DANTE .

		*
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, in an address made upon the occasion of the unveiling of the
Milton Memorial Window	ORGANIZATION	in
St. Margaret 's Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Westminster	ORGANIZATION	, made the following weighty sug - gestion : '' In our race there are thousands of readers , pres - ently there will be millions , who know not a word of Greek and Latin , and will never learn those languages .

		If this host of readers are ever to gain any sense of the power and charm of the great poets of antiquity , their way to gain it is not through translations of the ancients , but through the original poetry of
Milton	LOCATION	, who has the like power and charm , because he has the like great style . ''

		We call this a weighty saying , because it points out a path whereby the education of the future , accepting as inevitable the relegation of clas - sical studies to a band of scholars growing ever smaller and smaller in their proportion to the whole body of educated men , may yet remain possessed of a key to unlock the doors of a cul - ture not wholly different in kind from that hith - erto chiefly obtainable by the study of Homer and Sophocles , of
Horace	PERSON	and
Virgil	PERSON	.

		Now , there is one other modern poet , and only one , who may in this respect be ranked with

Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		and who offers in addition the great advantage of being approachable only through the medium of a foreign language .

		It is almost needless to add that this poet is
Dante	LOCATION	, or to say that a student bent upon attaining the special type of culture known as '' classical , '' yet determined to get it through the modern rather than through the ancient languages through the tongues that are still spoken rather than through the tongues that are no longer heard can most nearly accomplish his purpose by devoting him - self to the works of the immortal Florentine .

		The substitute will not be an an exact one , for the spirit of medievalism is not the spirit of classical antiquity , but it is a closer substitute than most people imagine , and
Arnold	LOCATION	's plea for the study of Milton applies with twofold force to the study of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is , then , with much satisfaction that we note the signs , multiplying upon every hand , of the growing hold of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	upon the world of modern culture , and especially of the increase of interest with which the study of this poet is being pursued in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Re - viewing Mr.
T. W. Koch	PERSON	's '' Dante in Amer - ica , '' a year or two ago , we commented upon the American phase of Dante studies , and we are now called upon to give a brief account of sev - eral Dante publications that have recently come from the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Foremost in importance among them is the ''
Dante Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary '' of Mr.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	, a work fore - shadowed by the index of '' nomi propri e cose notabili '' prepared by Mr.
Toynbee	PERSON	for Dr.
Moore	PERSON	's '' Oxford ''
Dante	PERSON	, and now expanded from the few pages which it occupied in that work to the dimensions of a quarto volume .

		The amount of industry that has gone to the making of this book , henceforth an indispens - able adjunct to the labors of every student of
Dante	PERSON	and his period , is something enormous .

		Besides the 565 double-columned pages of the '' Dictionary '' proper , there are about fifty more of tables , genealogies , plates , indexes , and the like .

		The articles average several to the page , and include not only the proper names occurring in
Dante	LOCATION	, but also such miscellaneous subjects as '' Rosa celestiale , '' ''
Carnali	PERSON	pec - catori , '' ''
Imperio Romano	PERSON	, '' as well as the titles of all the books mentioned in the works of the poet .

		The material has been brought together from the most varied sources , includ - ing the scattered Dante literature found in periodicals .

		The ''
Vocabolario Dantesco	PERSON	'' of Blanc suggested the '' Dictionary , '' which , how - ever , differs from the former work in its restric - THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, tion to the matters described by the title , while , on the other hand , it is not confined to the '' Divina Commedia '' alone .

		We note , in pass - ing , that Mr.
Toynbee	PERSON	is now engaged upon the preparation of a ''
Dante Vocabulary	ORGANIZATION	'' of his own .

		Together with Mr.
Fay	PERSON	's '' Concordance , '' and the '' Enciclopedia Dantesca '' of
Herr Scartazzini	PERSON	-LRB- the latter now in course of publi - cation -RRB- , the new '' Dictionary '' takes its place among the half-dozen of reference works abso - lutely indispensable to the student of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Edmund Gardner	PERSON	's ''
Dante	PERSON	's Ten Heavens '' is a running commentary upon the '' Paradiso , '' with a supplementary chapter de - voted to the '' Epistolae . ''

		We are particularly glad to find , in the publication of this and other recent works , an increasing attention given to that section of the Sacred Poem which has suf - fered the most from neglect .

		While the best students and critics have never failed to appre - ciate the ineffable beauty of the '' Paradiso , '' there is no doubt that the general reader has come to be more familiar with the first two cantiche * or with the first alone , than with the third .

		We still meet with the curious opinion that
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's essential characteristics were cruelty and vindictiveness ; we still find , even among spiritually-minded people , a lack of sympathetic understanding of the poet only to be accounted for by their undue attention to the more lurid and forbidding aspects of the '' Inferno . ''

		That
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, so far from being cruel by nature , was the very soul of tenderness , and that his alleged vindictiveness is in truth a quality so far removed from that base passion that it is in reality a revelation of the justice of God made through the utterance of an inspired spokesman , if such there ever were , are propo - sitions so self-evident to all who have penetrated into the secret chambers of the poet 's conscious - ness that one almost scorns to support them by argument .

		The vulgar view of this matter is akin to the self-revelation of those who charac - terize Othello as jealous , unconscious of the fact that they thereby place themselves upon the moral level of lago , to whom , indeed , the noble
Moor	ORGANIZATION	is but a man of like passions to his own .

		A reverent study of the whole of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is the best corrective of the grotesque popular judgment , and such books as this of Mr.
Gardner	PERSON	are exceedingly helpful to the student who is in good earnest desirous of en - tering into communion with the loftiest of poets .

		The author 's attitude toward his subject is expressed in the following passage : '' Here , perhaps more than in any other part of the poem , does
Dante	ORGANIZATION	show himself in thorough sympathy with his age , its doctrines and rudi - mentary science , its yearning for knowledge , its delight in the beauty of intellectual satisfaction .

		It is such works as the ' Paradiso ' that enable us to realise what were the noblest thoughts and aspirations of those ages whose exceeding light has so dazzled weak modern eyesight that they have sometimes been called dark , for in them '' L'occhio si smarria Come virtii che a troppo si confonda . ' ''

		To the discerning critic , certainly , the '' Para - diso '' appears , not merely a part of the great Epic of the Soul absolutely necessary for the comprehension of the other parts , but , consid - ered as poetry and nothing else , from its initial vision of '' La gloria di Colui che tutto muove , '' to its final glorification of '' L'Amor che muove il sole e 1 ` altre stelle , '' one long outpouring of divinely rapturous song .

		Miss Phillimore 's '' Dante at
Ravenna	LOCATION	, '' the third book upon our list , is modestly '' offered as a humble contribution to the mass of litera - ture and research which centres in that great name . ''

		It is based , in the main , upon Signer
Ricci	PERSON	's `` I/Ultimo Rifugio di
Dante Alighieri	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has been to some extent supplemented by the researches of the writer , made in
London	LOCATION	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, in
Paris	LOCATION	and
Ravenna	LOCATION	.

		The book must be described as a pleasant performance , but a discursive and amateurish one , not as scrupulous as it should have been in the veri - fication of its statements , and fitted rather for a popular than for a scholarly audience .

		The most interesting part of the book is the closing chapter , which gives the strange history of the mortal remains of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and of their discovery in our own time .

		The poet himself , his tomb , and his beloved Pineta , supply subjects for the three illustrations of the volume .

		We owe to the collaboration of Mr.
Philip H. Wicksteed	PERSON	and
Miss C. Mabel Lawrence	PERSON	the last work upon our list , which is a translation of certain '' Essays on Dante , '' selected from the voluminous writings of
Karl Witte	PERSON	.

		It is not too much to say , with Mr.
Wicksteed	PERSON	, that '' if the history of the revival of interest in
Dante	LOCATION	which has characterized this century should ever be written ,
Karl Witte	PERSON	will be the chief hero of the tale . ''

		It is to his efforts , more than to those of any other man , that the study of the poet was brought out of the morass of allegorical interpretation and mystical spec - ulation to be set upon the firm path of sound
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		83 and sane scholarship .

		The list of his writings upon the subject , in German , Italian , and Latin , begins with the classical essay '' Ueber das
Missverstandniss Dantes	PERSON	, '' published in
1823	DATE	, and extends to the close of
Witte	ORGANIZATION	's long and useful life in
1883	DATE	, when his years num - bered those of the century in which he lived .

		The writings include twenty-five separate pub - lications , ranging from articles in the '' Dante Jahrbuch '' to the great critical edition of the ''
Gottliche Kombdie	PERSON	, '' besides the two thick vol - umes of ''
Dan te-Forschungen	PERSON	, '' from which Mr.
Wicksteed	PERSON	has selected sixteen of the fifty-two .

		There are some interesting things about
Witte	PERSON	's life .

		His father gave him a
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	education , preparing him to enter the
Univer	PERSON	- sity of
Leipzig	LOCATION	at the age of nine and a half , and to take the doctor 's degree , with a mathe - matical thesis , before he was fourteen .

		And as Mill claimed that whatever he had accom - plished was the result , not of special abilities , but of proper training , so
Witte	PERSON	's father claimed that his son had no exceptional talents , and was so delighted with what his system had produced that he published a work in two vol - umes upon the development of the boy 's intel - lect .

		It is not strange , then , that at eighteen
Witte	PERSON	found his way to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, or that at twenty - three , by publishing the essay already mentioned , he '' entered the lists against existing Dante scholars , all and sundry , demonstrated that there was not one of them that knew his trade , and announced his readiness to teach it to them . ''

		This essay stands second among the six - teen in Mr.
Wicksteed	PERSON	's selection , and among the most important of the others are ''
Dante	PERSON	's Trilogy , '' ''
Dante	PERSON	's Cosmography , '' '' The Eth - ical Systems of the Inferno and the
Purga	LOCATION	- torio , '' `` The Topography of
Florence	LOCATION	about the Year 1300 , '' and `` Dante and
United Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		Most of these chapters are not merely monographs of the pedantic German type , but rather essays of a highly readable sort , brilliant and even eloquent in their manner .

		In the matter of extracts , Mr.
Wicksteed	PERSON	has , reluct - antly , adopted the plan of translating every - thing , Italian , Latin , and French , into English , although he admits that '' the logic is all the other way . ''

		We do not think him well-advised in so doing ; the translations are not objection - able in themselves , but they should have been accompanied by the originals , even at the cost of adding another fifty pages to the volume .

		In dealing with matters of controversy he has shown better judgment , avoiding the '' running corrective and refuting commentary '' which disfigure so many scholarly works of this de - scription , yet supplying footnotes where abso - lutely indispensable , and discussing in an ap - pendix the main difficulties involved in
Witte	ORGANIZATION	's positions upon controverted themes .

		On the whole , we are extremely grateful to the trans - lators for this book , which provides what is certainly the best of
Witte	ORGANIZATION	's work , and prac - tically all of it that students who will not take the trouble to learn German have a right to expect .

		PRESENT TENDENCIES IN ECONOMIC THOUGHT .

		* One of the most successful professors of English literature used to advise his students to read only the one best novel of any author , and then to read a book of the same general sort by some other writer of prominence : having read ''
John Halifax	PERSON	, Gen - tleman , '' for example , as the one work on which its author 's reputation in the main rests , follow it with ''
Felix Holt	PERSON	'' ; or , if you have been enjoying
Scott	PERSON	's '' Legend of
Montrose	LOCATION	, '' then , and not till then , read
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Kidnapped . ''

		This advice to read books in pairs is particularly applicable to works relating to economics and to the many schemes of political and social reform which are so forcibly and so persistently urged upon the public .

		Such an essay in American economic history , for in - stance , as that by Professor
Hammond	PERSON	on '' The Cot - ton Industry , '' in our present category , is a most sav - ory dish with which to supplement the dry bones of German economic theory in Professor Crook 's ex - amination of '' Wage Theories , '' especially as the one book is excellent of its kind and the other is at best only indifferently well done ; while books like Mr.
Gronlund	PERSON	's '' New Economy '' and Mrs.

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, tise on '' Social Elements '' to help us maintain a stable mental equilibrium . ''

		The New Economy '' is an exceptionally clever bit of special pleading ; '' Social Elements '' is a judicial review of the several and often discordant phases of our complex social life .

		The author of the one is preaching a doctrine , and he naturally writes with all the ardor of a reformer and even of an evangelist ; the author of the other is writing a text-book , or , rather , he is lecturing to students , for his book still retains many of the marks of the lecture form .

		He therefore carefully avoids argu - ing the case , but takes you up on the mountain-peak of highest scholarship and gives you a comprehen - sive view of the whole field of social activities , point - ing out the peculiar institutions , with the character - istics and significance of each .

		Professor
Henderson	PERSON	has also given a distinctly literary flavor to his book , not only by crowding his pages with the noble thoughts of the poets and prose writers of all ages and of every nation , but by having a care to his own thought , giving it beauty of form as well as strength of substance .

		This does not mean that he has attempted any of that '' fine writing '' which disfigures , but that he has chosen his words and phrases with that simplicity which gives elegance to his style and pleasure to his readers ; he has not forgotten that books are written to be read , and that the aim of an author should be to have his thoughts easily understood .

		His work consequently com - mends itself to those '' whom extended experience in the classroom has taught to view with profound - est respect the infinite capability of the human mind to resist the introduction of knowledge . ''

		There is , moreover , a skilful arrangement of chapters , by which we are led easily up from the simple and the familiar things about us to those less known and more difficult of comprehension , our interest never flagging , until at last we find ourselves wrestling with '' Some Problems of Social Psychology , '' in Chapter XV .

		Mr.
Gronlund	PERSON	's logic is simple in the extreme , and his programme of social reform sounds so per - fectly feasible and so thoroughly practical that the wonder is we do not adopt it at once .

		Indeed , the casual reader , differing though he might with the author at nearly every conclusion he reaches , would find it difficult to tell why they should have parted company , and where or how one can admit the pre - mises of Mr.
Gronlund	PERSON	-LRB- 1 -RRB- that `` something must be done , '' and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that `` industrial democracy is inevitable '' and still deny the truth of his appar - ently logical inference , -LRB- 3 -RRB- that '' collectivism is the climax '' and the noble ideal toward which we should all strive with every means in our power .

		Our im - mediate aim , he says , should be to give to our work - ingmen as much security and independence as pos - sible short of the
Cooperative Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, so that we may soften , though not solve , the labor problem -LRB- p. 135 -RRB- .

		To this end he proposes a party programme of eleven measures , six of state -LRB- p. 150 -RRB- and five of national activity -LRB- p. 227 -RRB- , as follows : 1 .

		Obligatory Industrial Arbitration .

		2 .


Effective Labor Organizations	ORGANIZATION	.

		3 .

		State Productive Work for Unemployed -LRB- Road - mak - ing , e. g. -RRB- 4 .

		Municipal Enterprises under
State Control	ORGANIZATION	water , gas , and electric light supply , street-car accommodation , telephone service , etc. .

		5 .


State Control of the Liquor Traffic	ORGANIZATION	.

		This `` is right , mainly because it will abolish the saloon while not depriving any one of the indulgence in moderate drinking , which the
State	ORGANIZATION	has no right to do '' -LRB- p. 209 -RRB- .

		6 .


State Socialization of Mines	ORGANIZATION	.

		7 .

		Nationalization of the
Telegraph and Express Business	ORGANIZATION	.

		8 .

		Government Banking in its two divisions -LRB- a -RRB- savings - banks , -LRB- b -RRB- loan-offices , to which 9 .

		Postal Savings Banks afford a first step .

		10 .

		National Control of all Fares and Freight Rates , as a step to the Nationalization of the Railroads .

		11 .

		The
Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	constituted an effective organ for the farmers , `` for buying them the machinery , the fertilizers , the seeds , the breeding animals which they may need , their organ for selling their surplus products for them '' -LRB- p. 291 -RRB- .

		For each of these steps Mr.
Gronlund	PERSON	offers careful explanation of how it has worked , and ample justi - fication of how it would work for the uplift of hu - manity and the betterment of the race .

		He urges , moreover , that the peculiar note of collectivism is wholly absent from these measures , and that there is a good deal more collectivism in any one of our trusts than in all of them -LRB- p. 296 -RRB- .

		Singularly enough , the means by which Mr.
Gronlund	PERSON	expects to secure the adoption of this platform with eleven planks is popular education in the public school : the substitution , that is , of Kindergarten and Man - ual Training methods for the present undemocratic system of primary and secondary education .

		In addition to this pedagogical campaign to secure higher ideals in the next generation , Mr.
Gronlund	PERSON	proposes civic churches -LRB- p. 350 -RRB- where '' well - informed , thoughtful men and women will on Sun - days listen to lectures by competent , trained teach - ers on political , economical , and educational sub - jects , and take part in sober discussions thereon not with a sort of apology as is done even in so-called ` People 's Churches , ' but conscious that they are acting in unison with the powers and forces that are working out the destiny of humanity . ''

		`` It should not be difficult to make every public - spirited citizen see that , if we could gather the squalid children teeming in the tenements of our large cities into sunny Kindergartens , teach them neatness and gen - tleness , open their eyes to beauty , train their hands in useful activities aud develop their minds naturally and by an orderly method , the gravest dangers to our civili - zation would be averted '' -LRB- p. 313 -RRB- . ''

		Manual training will finally solve the problem we have set ourselves .

		It will , in the first place , give the pupil power to make the most of himself , to know some - thing thoroughly , and this it will accomplish by leading the youthful mind to form habits of observation , of self - activity , of self-development , and thus to become a self - educator .

		And , in the second place , it will actually make of the youth an all-around man and an all-around woman , too , for that matter ; it is in very truth itself a liberal education ; manual training , properly understood , opens up the whole universe of knowledge and culture '' -LRB- pp. 323-324 -RRB- .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 Mr.
Gronlund	PERSON	is confident that a fourteen-year-old boy , educated as he suggests -LRB- and the experiment has already been tried , both in
Boston	LOCATION	and in a suburb of
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- '' will be fully the peer in knowl - edge , in mental acumen and moral perceptions , of any of our young men of twenty-one who has just graduated from Harvard '' -LRB- p. 325 -RRB- .

		But it is not on this account that he advocates a new education ; it is , rather , as his sub-title suggests , as a means to the peaceful solution of the social problem .

		A higher body of ideals and a growing consciousness of our being social functionaries will alone '' relegate pay , profits , and property to the secondary position , where in fact they belong '' -LRB- p. 42 -RRB- .

		He depends upon the school to supply the one , and the civic church the other .

		Both are essential , he insists , as the only means of preventing that civil war of classes for which socialists are preparing us . ''

		The plain fact is , that every one of us , industrially or socially employed , whether as a banker , a baker , a teacher , or a hod-carrier , is doing his work , because so - ciety , and only because society , needs his services and needs them then and there .

		A man may choose his function in the community , but its duties are not of his choosing '' -LRB- p. 40 -RRB- .

		It is the conscious social recognition of this fact that will bring about and will mark the new economy . ''

		The Trust is the last evolutionary term of the pres - ent social order .

		Democracy in any real sense is as yet but a tendency , though an irresistible tendency '' -LRB- p. 27 -RRB- .

		This practical programme Mr.
Gronlund	PERSON	proposes as the best we can hope for in the interim which must elapse before mankind is ready for the
Cooperative Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		Standing near Mr.
Gronlund	PERSON	's Civic Church , we may confidently look in the next century for Mrs.
Stetson	PERSON	's '' commodious and well-served apartment house for professional women with families '' -LRB- p. 242 -RRB- .

		It will be without kitchens , but there will be a kitchen belonging to the house from which meals can be served to the families in their rooms or in a common dining-room as preferred .

		It will be a home where the cleaning will be done by effi - cient workers , not hired separately by the families , but engaged by the manager of the establishment ; and a roof-garden , day-nursery , and kindergarten , under well-trained professional nurses and teachers , will insure proper care of the children .

		. ''

		The demand for such provision is increasing daily and must soon be met , not by a boarding-house or a lodging-house , a hotel , a restaurant , or any makeshift patching together of these ; but by a permanent pro- vision for the needs of women and children , of family privacy with collective advantage .

		This must be offered on a business basis to prove a substantial business suc - cess ; and it will so prove , for it is a growing social need . ''

		The author 's contention is that our homes as at present constituted afford none of those things which we have been accustomed to associate with them , and that the several professions involved in our clumsy method of housekeeping should be special - ized to make the home of the twentieth century in keeping with church and state and industry .

		She wastes no sympathy mourning over the past , but urges that the economic dependence and consequent social subjection of women has fulfilled its evolu - tionary function and is rapidly becoming socially destructive , not constructive ; that the insufficient and irritating character of our existing form of marriage is shown by the fact -LRB- p. 300 -RRB- '' that women must be forced to it by the need of food and clothes , and men by the need of cooks and housekeepers '' ; that the home -LRB- p. 313 -RRB- should no longer be an eco - nomic entity , with its cumbrous industrial machinery huddled behind it , but that the industries of the home life should be managed professionally ; that the existing relation of economic dependence does not contribute to the development of either of the three essential elements of society beautiful women , strong men , and intelligent children ; that what we need are changes which shall minister to the social uplift of the newly specialized American wife and mother , and homes which shall give play for her increasing specialization .

		`` Where the embryonic combination of cook-nurse - laundress-chambermaid-housekeeper-waitress-governess was content to be '' jack of all trades '' and mistress of none , the woman who is able to be one of these things perfectly suffers doubly from not being able to do what she wants to do , and from being forced to do what she does not want to do .

		To the delicately differentiated modern brain the jar and shock of changing from trade to trade a dozen times a day is a distinct injury , a waste of nervous force '' -LRB- p. 155 -RRB- .

		There is a sense , therefore , in which Mrs.
Stet	ORGANIZATION	- son 's attractive volume will serve as a suitable counter-irritant both to Professor
Henderson	PERSON	's sci - entific analysis of the five elementary social institu - tions the family , the schoolhouse , industry , the church , and the government , and to Mr.
Gron	PERSON	- lund 's advocacy of the Collectivist Republic : both books are written from what might be called the masculine point of view , if a point could be said to have life ; '' Women and Economics '' shows us the woman 's side of the case in an entirely new light .

		The author is not arguing a case in court , but stat - ing a profound social philosophy ; and she does this with enough wit and sarcasm to make the book very entertaining reading , and with such a wealth of illustration from the study of man 's development from primitive conditions , and of the sex relations of animal life , as to make her theory seem almost startling in the vividness of its truth . ''

		This change is not a thing to prophesy and plead for .

		It is a change already instituted , and gaining ground among us these many years with marvellous rapidity '' -LRB- p. 316 -RRB- . ''

		It is worth while for us to consider the case fully and fairly ; to introduce conditions that will change hu - manity from within , making for better motherhood and fatherhood , better babyhood and childhood , better food , better homes , better society , this is to work for human improvement along natural lines .

		It means enormous racial advance , and that with great swiftness ; for this change does not wait to create new forces , but sets free 86 THE DIAL , -LSB-

spring	DATE	.

		And it is already hap - pening .

		All we need to do is to understand and help '' -LRB- p. 317 -RRB- .

		We are the only animal species in which the female depends on the male for food , the only animal spe - cies in which the sex-relation is also an economic relation .

		Mrs.
Stetson	PERSON	's , book is written to offer a simple and natural explanation of this fact , to show its present significance , and '' to reach in especial the thinking women of to-day , and urge upon them a new sense , not only of their social responsibility as individuals , but of their measureless racial import - ance as makers of men . ''

		Herein her book em - bodies the idea which marks perhaps the most pro- nounced tendency of recent thought along economic lines , namely , that social progress is more and more becoming a conscious process , and that , while it is perfectly true that there is a natural and physical basis for society and for social institutions , it is equally true that in a large measure man is as he thinks he is and as he wills he shall be .

		The two books remaining to be noticed in this review also illustrate this tendency , though in a less degree .

		They are both of them doctors ' theses offered at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and therefore represent uni - versity tendencies in part rather than those of the thinking world at large .

		They deal with the history of a particular line of industry and the evolution of a special phase of German thought ; these are of necessity impersonal in character , and do not involve controversy and criticism ; they are to be judged on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the inves - tigation and the attractiveness with which results are presented .

		Professor
Hammond	PERSON	has made a careful study of the cotton culture and trade , and tells us what we want to know about it .

		The effect of the agricul - tural economy of the
Southern States	LOCATION	produced by the cultivation of cotton is shown in the introduc - tory chapter .

		In his second chapter the connection beween slavery and cotton-growing at the South is set forth in a systematic , judicial , and critical man - ner ; we are shown the necessary relation of cause and effect in social as well as chemical matters . ''

		Cotton was not responsible for the origin of slav - ery in the South , but to it was wholly due the ex - tension of that institution .

		The movement towards emancipation was checked by the discovery that cotton could be profitably cultivated throughout the whole Southern country '' -LRB- p. 42 -RRB- .

		After three chapters devoted to the history of Southern agri - culture , Book I. closes with two chapters on the present condition of the cotton culture and the remedy for over-production .

		This latter , Mr.
Ham	PERSON	- mond thinks , is only to be found in the establishment and extension of a proper system of agricultural credit -LRB- p. 196 -RRB- .

		Book II .

		is a study of the cotton trade and the evolution of the cotton market , the most noticeable feature of which , since the Civil War , has been the growth of the cotton manufacture near the seat of the supply of the raw material -LRB- p. 343 -RRB- .

		The cotton industry will form the sub - ject of another volume .

		All history will have to be rewritten , was the reply of one of
America	LOCATION	's greatest historians , Mot - ley , to the question as to what field he would advise a young man to cultivate .

		Each succeeding century each generation , almost gains a new outlook and higher standards of truth by which to measure the thought and life of the past .

		We study what has been and what is , to show us what will be .

		An essay which does not show this contrast , and which does not afford better light to our path and lamps to our feet , is subject to the criticism that it begins nowhere , ends nowhere , and has nothing scientific between : it has not even an academic interest .

		This criticism is in part applicable to the attempt of Professor Crook to write a history of the de - velopment of German Wage Theories .

		He be - gins well , by showing the dependence of German economists on
Adam Smith	PERSON	and the definite reason for this : '' The conditions of economic life in the two countries were very different .

		There was want - ing on German soil the stimulating influence of unsolved practical problems of economics '' -LRB- p. 8 -RRB- .


Germany	LOCATION	had no factory system during the first half of the century ; as late as
1882	DATE	'' 42 per cent of the German textile industry was still conducted in the home or domestic workshop '' -LRB- p. 9 -RRB- .

		But the author 's conclusion -LRB- p. 113 -RRB- that , when we have made all allowances , the residual theory fails to satisfy the mind completely , is not , to say the least , eminently satisfying in itself , and there is nothing exceptionally scientific between the beginning and the end : one is forced to query why such history is written .


ARTHUR B. WOODFORD	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		An English The D6ed f & n English history of handbook of Spanish literature , authoritative and Spanish literature .

		U p-t - date , has long been felt , for the want has been but imperfectly supplied by Mr.
Butler Clarke	PERSON	's manual and by Mr.
David Hannay	PERSON	's volume upon `` The Later Renaissance . ''

		As for
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	, while that monumental work is not likely to be wholly displaced for a long time , it must be admitted that it is very defective in the light of later research .

		The need is now supplied , as far as a single volume of moderate dimensions can supply it , by the '' Spanish Literature '' written for the series of '' Literatures of the World '' -LRB- Ap - pleton -RRB- by Mr.
James Fitzmaurice Kelly	PERSON	, of all living English writers the most competent to pre - pare such a book .

		This accomplished Spanish scholar and Cervantist not only knows his subject , but he has also the literary faculty required to make thoroughly interesting reading of such a manual , in which latter respect his volume does not derogate from the high standard already set for this series by Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	and Professor
Dowden	PERSON	.

		He has ,
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 87 too , opinions of his own , which is rather refreshing in view of the colorless and perfunctory character usually attaching to condensed surveys of this gen - eral description .

		For example , he remarks of Senor Echegaray that , '' a delightfully middle-class writer , his appreciation by middle-class audiences calls for no special comment . ''

		This comment will cause exquisite pain to the '' advanced '' critics who hail every new experimental literary product as a revelation of hitherto unequalled genius .

		In the matter of extracts , the author is rather more liberal than his predecessors in the preparation of this series , and he is not afraid to use an occasional line or two of Spanish .

		We are minded to suggest one bit of criticism that he would probably have used had he known of it .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	, after reading the ''
Numancia	ORGANIZATION	'' of Cervantes , made it the subject of the following quatrain : '' Den Selbstmord einer ganzen
Stadt Cervantes	PERSON	bier geschildert hat ; Wenn alles bricht , so bleibt uns nur Riickkehr zum Urquell der Natur . ''

		We mention this because it is the sort of thing that Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	likes to introduce , and the introduction of which makes his volume so more than usually readable .

		We may add , by way of closing , that the author 's theme is Castilian literature , and has little to say of books written in the Asturian , Galician , and Catalan dialects , or in that '' spoiled child of philologers , '' the Basque tongue .

		The historical T he second volume of the `` Histor - deveiopment of ical Development of
Modern Europe Modem Europe	LOCATION	.

		_ 1849-97 '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is equal in scholarship and similar in treatment to its prede - cessor .

		The history of
Europe	LOCATION	is shown as a devel - opment ; movements and subjects are dealt with as '' logical wholes . ''

		The separate parts or movements considered are such as the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	, European diplomacy in the Crimean War , the constitutional development of
Piedmont	LOCATION	and the union of
Italy	LOCATION	, the growth of
Prussia	LOCATION	and the struggle for German hegemony , the establishment of the Austro-Hunga - rian Monarchy , the Progress of the
Eastern Ques	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		If we were called upon to choose out of these splendid chapters , we would say Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	is particularly happy in treating of
Napoleon III	ORGANIZATION	.

		and European politics in his time .

		A single sentence summarizes the causes of the rise of this charlatan : ''
Lamartine	PERSON	, the idol of the Parisians ten months before , and Cavaignac the dictator of the
June days	DATE	, were both defeated by a name and a legend . ''

		The author shows how the Crimean War indirectly was the revenge of
Europe	LOCATION	for its reactionary policy in
1848	DATE	; how
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	himself , hypocritically pretending liberal ideas , profited by the discon - tent to acquire glory , calculating that the political theories of
England	LOCATION	would force her to the French side .

		Another chapter in which Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	so successfully treats European history as a `` logical whole '' is that narrating the unification of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The combination of circumstances which led to the French intervention in
Italy	LOCATION	, the arrest of Ital - ian unity at the very gates of
Rome	LOCATION	, the effect of '66 and Sedan upon Italian politics , all these are skilfully woven into one compact account , mas - terful in clearness and in grasp .

		The book , how - ever , has a false end .

		The year
1878	DATE	had been a much better terminal point , for since that time new policies and purposes have initiated changes the wide ends of which no man can guess .

		What with the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair in
France	LOCATION	, the crisis in
Austria	LOCATION	-
Hungary	LOCATION	, and the Far Eastern Question , the future of
Europe	LOCATION	is uncertain .

		The
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	to the coming historian will be rather the prologue to the twentieth century than an epilogue to the nineteenth .

Edward C. Mead	PERSON	essays to per - petuate the characteristics of the famous old houses of this cynosural section of the
Old Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, and gives a brief anecdotal and genealogical account of the families whose names are more closely and his - torically connected with them .

		Some of these names as
Jefferson	PERSON	and
Randolph	PERSON	are of national , and all of them are of local , historic interest .

		There are twenty-eight papers in all , the list being headed with an account of
Monticello	LOCATION	that political shrine of serio-comic memory which is well symbolized in its quaintly composite architecture , showing , in front , the chaste portico of a Doric temple , through which the votary passes on to the domestic and culinary arrangements of the interior and the rear .

		Thither the philosophic
Jefferson	PERSON	retired , an honored
Pali	ORGANIZATION	- nurus , from the helm of state , to prune his vines and plant his cabbages , and , as the event showed , to be literally eaten out of house and home by intrusive swarms of the '' plain people '' who came ostensibly to pay their respects to , but really to stare at , the future Patron Saint of American democracy .

		One scarcely knows whether to be more amused or disgusted at the picture of these Vandals lighting like locusts on
Monticello	LOCATION	, '' eating up all the pro- duce of the estate , '' and committing a thousand vul - gar impertinences under the veil of admiration for the persecuted proprietor , upon whom they bestowed nothing in return for his enormously abused hospi - tality save the crown of martyrdom .

		Mr.
Mead	PERSON	writes sympathetically and with an intimate knowl - edge of his theme .

A. M. Robertson	PERSON	-RRB- , two publications of the pronounced '' Holiday '' type , reached us too late for inclusion in our regular De - cember reviews of books of their class .

George	PERSON	and
Louis Rhead	LOCATION	.

		The decorations remind one of Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	, and are in the main sat - isfactory .

		The full-page drawings are in the pre - Raphaelite or neo-mediseval manner , and range in quality from good to indifferent though one or two examples -LRB- as the preposterous plate on page 88 -RRB- must in candor he pronounced positively had .

		The drawings by the brothers Rhead are undeniably clever and striking in their way ; hut in too many instances they are marred by a certain stiffness , one might almost say woodenness , which becomes un - pleasantly apparent when one compares them men - tally -LRB- as is inevitable -RRB- with the work of such illus - trators as Hunt and
Rossetti	PERSON	, or even of
Madox Brown	PERSON	, with whose manner they have closest affin - ity .

		But altogether the publication is a pleasing , as it certainly is a striking one , and should find favor as a gift-book .

		The text is printed in black letter in double columns , and the cover is of white buck - ram showily stamped in black , red , and gilt . ''

		Ten Drawings in
Chinatown	LOCATION	, '' a sort of combination of book and portfolio , is the joint work of Mr.
Ernest C. Peixotto	PERSON	, who supplies the pictures , and Mr.
Robert Howe Fletcher	PERSON	, who is responsible for the text .

		The whole is the result of a trip , or rather of several trips , through
Chinatown	LOCATION	, undertaken by these gentlemen under the guidance of a resident pilot ,
Wong	PERSON	Sue ; and anyone who has '' done '' the sights -LRB- and smells -RRB- of
San Francisco	LOCATION	's bit of the Far East will vouch for the accuracy of the recorded impressions of both narrator and artist .

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	develops a very happy vein of quiet humor , and his knack of neat and graphic description is undeniable .

		The drawings are on thin paper mounted on boards , and they are sprightly and artistic .

		The edition is limited to 750 copies .

		It may be suspected that if the amen - ities of legal debate were preserved , and
Marie Corelli	PERSON	allowed to close the argument in `` The Modern Marriage Market '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , as she was to open it , its forensics would resemble nothing so much as the
Kilkenny	LOCATION	cats of fable .

		For
Miss Corelli	PERSON	falls afoul of the '' Modern Marriage Market '' -LRB- whatever that is -RRB- ; Lady Jeune falls afoul of
Miss Corelli	LOCATION	, and the M. M. M. ; Mrs.
Flora Annie Steel	PERSON	of
L. J.	PERSON	,
M. C.	PERSON	, and the
M. M. M.	PERSON	; and
Susan	PERSON	, Countess of Malmes - bury , of all the foregoing , in a manner which has the elaborate constructive detail of '' The House that Jack Built '' and the style of the contest between the famous cats aforesaid .

		Only ,
Miss Corelli	LOCATION	not being permitted a rejoinder , there is a very small tip left of her argument indeed , while the Countess of
Malmesbury	LOCATION	's flourishes like a green bay tree : if the tropes are here confused , they are assuredly much less so than the topic after it has passed through so many distinguished inkstands .

		For it is a hopeless undertaking to save even shreds of '' The Modern Marriage Market . ''

		It is , and it is n't .

		One of the contestants avers one thing , only to be supported and contradicted by each of those who come after .

		Miss Corelli speaking , it is to be hoped , without her own experience regards it as something dreadful , and descants upon it in a way which is nothing less than passionate .

		Lady Jeune thinks pretty well of it , and discusses it in relation to the colonial empire of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and other closely related matters .

		Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	is not quite sure , but believes upon the whole that the
Hindoo	PERSON	custom of child-marriage is better .

		And Lady
Malmesbury	LOCATION	thinks all the other things that are left for anybody to think of .

		It can hardly be expected that the reader will think at all if he is a man , he will not , in self-defence .

		In his chastely elegant little volume entitled `` Tales of the Enchanted Islands of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	turns to graceful account the riches of the hitherto similarly unexploited field of legendary lore that the European fancy for more than a thousand years wove about the mysterious isles , real or fancied , of the
Western Ocean	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although we can not quite admit the accu - racy of Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	's sweeping claim that these legends are '' a part of the mythical period of American history , '' we have nothing but approval for the way in which he has treated them .

		The vol - ume is conceived in the spirit and written in the style of Hawthorne 's '' Wonder Book , '' of which it forms a worthy and desirable counterpart .

		There are twenty tales in all , under such alluring titles as '' The Story of Atlantis , '' '' Taliessin of the Radiant Brow , '' '' Merlin the Enchanter , '' '' Sir
Lancelot	PERSON	of the Lake , '' ''
Maelduin	PERSON	's Voyage , '' '' The Island of Satan 's Hand , '' ''

		Mr.
Albert Herter	PERSON	has supplied a half-dozen full-page illustrations , which are both charmingly fancied and artistically done , and add decidedly to the attractiveness of the pret - tily bound , well-printed volume .

		It is an especially acceptable and stimulating book for young readers , whose imaginations are certainly in little danger of over-feeding in these practical times .

New Orleans	LOCATION	, its companion volume .

		Miss Repplier 's always rather prim style , with its old-time graces and mannerisms and verbal tags out of
Pepys	PERSON	and the '' Spectator , '' accords well with her present theme .

		Beginning with a kindly sketch of its ex - cellent though maligned founder , she sketches with a light and fluent touch the generally serene though not untroubled history of the
Quaker City	ORGANIZATION	down to present times .

		The treatment is popular , and from a literary point of view especially the book calls for cordial approval .

		41 Sartor Resartus '' illustrated .

		At first thought , '' Sartor Resartus '' would seem to be one of the last books to tempt the hand of an illus - trator .

		But even the Bible is '' pictured '' and '' dec - orated '' nowadays , and it was probably inevitable that the illustrators would sooner or later get around to
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		We can therefore only be grateful that the task has been elected by such a capable artist as Mr.
Edmund J. Sullivan	PERSON	, whose seventy-five pen - and-ink drawings for '' Sartor Resartus '' are em - bodied in a handsome new edition of that work just issued in this country by the
Maemillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Sullivan	PERSON	has not attempted to depict the complete scenes and episodes of the book , but has confined himself , in the main , to portraits of the principal characters and to pictures of an allegorical or dec - orative nature .

		With few exceptions , the drawings show considerable originality and strength , and en - title the artist to a place in the front rank of pen-and - ink draughtsmen of the day .

		We fancy the true

		After the novelist 's death ,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	put together a book of
Thackeray	PERSON	's let - ters to him , including many drawings , and it is this unique volume that has supplied most of the mate - rial for the present chapter .

		It contains nothing more touching than some verses written by

		Here is one of the stanzas : '' If I get to be fifty , may Willy get too .

		And we '11 laugh , Will , at all that grim sixties can do .

		Let him do of what poets complain , We '11 thank him for making us children again ; Let him make us grey , gouty , blind , toothless , or silly , Still old Ned shall be Ned , and old Willy be Willy . ''

		Mrs.

		Within small compass and in an interesting manner , he has told the story of the ex-libris from its small mediaeval beginnings to its acceptance as a latter-day fad .

		He is accurate and sufficiently scholarly within the narrow limits he sets himself .

		It is not quite true to say that
Lord de Tabley	ORGANIZATION	is better known to-day as

		The story of Lord
Nelson	PERSON	's life being what it is , and his private affairs being readily dissociable from his career as the greatest of all sea-fighters , there seems to be room for an account which shall include his three greatest campaigns and nothing more .

Guthrie	PERSON	himself took part as counsel , urging a broad interpretation of the amend - ment which '' has done more than any other cause to protect our civil rights from invasion , to strengthen the bonds of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, to make us truly a nation , and to assure the perpetuity of our institutions . ''

		At the end of the book the Constitution is conven - iently annotated with references to cases in which it has been construed .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The Bodleian manuscript of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, discov - ered in
1856	DATE	by Professor Cowell , and transcribed by him , is the oldest codex of the poet as yet known , and dates from the year
1460	DATE	.

		It has , furthermore , the special interest of being the manuscript upon which
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	based his immortal poem .

		A photographic reproduction of this manuscript , with a transcript into modern Persian characters , a prose translation into En - glish , a learned commentary , and a great variety of bibliographical and miscellaneous annotation , are all provided by Mr.
Edward Heron	PERSON	-
Allen	PERSON	in `` The Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, '' a sumptuous volume published in this country -LRB- in its second edition -RRB- by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a book that no Omarian can possibly spare from his collection . ''

		The New Gulliver , '' by Mr.
Wendell Phillips Gar	PERSON	- rison , is in form a very tastefully printed little book , issued from the
Marion Press	ORGANIZATION	of
Jamaica	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		In content , it is the story of the strange experience of Mr.
Theophilus Brocklebank	PERSON	, who rediscovered the coun - try of the Houyhnhnms , left unvisited by any
Yahoo	ORGANIZATION	from the time of its original explorer .

		In purpose , it is a mild satire upon the relativity of human knowledge and the futility of theological speculation , although this purpose is left rather vaguely defined , with the inten - tion , we suspect , of mystifying the reader rather than qf contributing to his real enlightenment .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		The next publication of the '' Brothers of the Book '' will consist of a reprint of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's essay on '' The Morality of the Profession of Letters , '' taken from the '' Fortnightly Review '' for
April , 1881	DATE	. ''

		Bush-Fruits , '' by Mr.
Fred W. Card	PERSON	, is '' a horti - cultural monograph of raspberries , blackberries , dew - berries , currants , gooseberries , and other shrub - like fruits , '' just published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Boy Who Drew Cats '' is a Japanese fable told ; in English by Mr.
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	, and printed on crepe paper with colored illustrations as an issue of the '' Japanese Fairy Tale Series '' published in
Tokyo	LOCATION	by Mr.
T. Hasegawa	PERSON	.

		It is a charming little book as to both text and illustration .

		One of the daintiest little books of the season , a book that brings joy to the eye and the heart alike , is a se - lection of Elizabethan lyrics made by Mr.
FitzRoy Carrington	PERSON	, illustrated with portraits of famous
Eliza	PERSON	- bethans , printed with sixteenth century spelling and typography , and entitled '' The Queen 's Garland . ''

		Mr.
R. H. Russell	PERSON	is the publisher .

		One of the most interesting of recent announcements comes in prompt fulfilment of our wish , expressed in writing of the Tolstoy anniversary , that we might soon , have a uniform English edition of the books of the great Russian .

		Such an edition , in twenty volumes , is now under way , to be edited by Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	, , and published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		It is announced that the competitive examinations for the fellowships of the
American School of Classical Studies	ORGANIZATION	at
Athens	LOCATION	will be held this year on
March 16	DATE	, , 17 , and 18 .

		Candidates are to enter their names on or before
February 1	DATE	with Professor
B. I. Wheeler	PERSON	-LRB- Ith - aca , N. Y. -RRB- , Chairman of
Fellowship Committee	ORGANIZATION	, from whom all information as to place , subjects , etc. , may be obtained .

		These fellowships yield
$ 600	MONEY	each .

		The
Hoppin Fellowship	ORGANIZATION	, open to women only , yields
$ 1000	MONEY	.


Lewis Henry Boutell	PERSON	, of
Evanston	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, who died on the sixteenth of
January	DATE	at the age of seventy-two , was a soldier and lawyer of much distinction .

		His death deprives THE DIAL of a valued contributor , and histor - ical scholarship of a zealous student whose published work , although inconsiderable in quantity , exhibited qualities of a high order .

		His most important publica - tion was a '' Life of
Roger Sherman	PERSON	, '' which appeared about two years ago .

		This biography was undertaken at the request of Senator
Hoar	PERSON	, who had himself made preparations to write it , and who transferred the task , together with the materials collected , to the competent hands of Mr.
Boutell	PERSON	.

		In the death of
William K. Sullivan	PERSON	, on the seventeenth of
January	DATE	,
Chicago	LOCATION	lost one of the best-known and most highly-esteemed of its public men .

		THE DIAL records his death for two reasons : As a member of the
Chicago Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, and for a term of years its Presi - dent , he always stood for the highest standards and the most enlightened ideals of public education .

		As a pro- fessional newspaper worker for the greater part of hi * active life , first with Mr.
Dana	PERSON	on the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun , '' then with Mr.
Horace White	PERSON	on the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' and eventually as editor of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Evening Jour - nal , '' his influence was always on the side of those tra - ditions of dignity and seriousness that are now fast disappearing from journalism .

		Born in
1843	DATE	, in .

		Water - ford ,
Ireland	LOCATION	, he came to this country in time to serve
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL as a volunteer in the closing period of the Civil War .

		He was also a member of the
Illinois Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, and a President of the
Chicago Press Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1890	DATE	he went to
Bermuda	LOCATION	as
United States	LOCATION	consul , remaining a year in that position .

		Personally , he was endeared to all who knew him by his sincerity , his generosity , and the fine courtesy of his manner .

		There was nothing superficial about these qualities ; they were rooted in the depths of his nature .

		After experimenting for some months with an Amer - ican issue of '' Literature '' which was merely the English edition imported in sheets and supplied with new covers and a belated date , the publishers ,
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, have at last come to a conclusion which was inevitable from the start , and have begun the issue of what is in the genuine sense an American edition of this periodical .

		That is , the English matter is used only in part , and is supplemented by at least an equal amount of new matter prepared in this country .

		Some of the reviews are signed , and others are not .

		The total matter included is less than we have had heretofore -LRB- especially in the readable department of `` notes '' -RRB- , but it is all chosen with reference to the interests of American readers , and consequently far more likely to attract subscribers .


January 10	DATE	is the date with which this '' new series '' begins .

		We can highly recommend this able history of

		Mr.

John Bright	PERSON	, as far as possible , to speak for himself , and he has shown great discrimination in the selection of pithy typical passages from memorable speeches at critical junctures in the Queen 's reign .

		Speaker .

		An excellent little life of Bright , with a chapter on Bright 's oratory which is admirable and most remarkable .

		It constitutes a brief but careful examination of the characteristics which made Bright the first orator of our time , and appears to us the best examination of the peculiarities of modern English oratory extant .

		Athenceum .

		This little book seems to us , in its way , a remarkable success .

		It is a model of what such a sketch should be sober , well-written , with the matter well-ordered , and throughout a tone of judicial care not unmixed with enthusiasm .

		A cademy .

		Mr.
Vince	PERSON	's biography of Bright is a model of its kind .

		Much of the current interest in Sociology rests upon a basis of sentiment rather than fact .

		In no small degree this condition has plainly been due to the lack of a popular treatise stating comprehensively the data involved and issues in debate .

		Dr.
Henderson	PERSON	has provided the much-needed systematic outline for investigation and discussion .

		He treats of the social conditions and problems as they exist in the repre - sentative centres of the
United States	LOCATION	, the most profitable methods of sociological study , and the means at hand with which to improve the general situation .

		133 CONCERNING DEGREES .

		The measure providing for a regulation of academic degrees in the
State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, pre - pared by President
Henry Wade Rogers	PERSON	of
Evanston	LOCATION	, and recently introduced into the Legislature through his initiative , marks the first serious attempt to do away with what has long been a great evil and a scandal to the good name of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		For several years past ,
Chicago	LOCATION	has harbored certain institutions , ex - isting chiefly on paper , incorporated under the lax educational statutes of the commonwealth , and engaged in the nefarious business of fur - nishing academic or professional degrees to all applicants offering the stipulated consideration in cold cash .

		These rascally traffickers in titles to distinction have published their alluring offers far and wide , and have found gullible victims in considerable numbers , mostly in other States and other lands .

		A number of Englishmen , for example , have become bache - lors or doctors of these bogus institutions , and the swindle has attracted enough attention to be made a subject of inquiry in the English Parliament .

		It is certainly time that the abuse should be ended , and the measure to which we have referred is designed to accomplish that desirable purpose .

		In general terms , it is proposed that the granting of degrees in
Illinois	LOCATION	be restricted to institutions of approved educational standing , and to this end a
State Commission	ORGANIZATION	is to be established , with power to pass upon the claims and pretensions of institutions that wish to bestow degrees upon their students .

		So far , the proposed measure corresponds to the sort of regulation that already obtains in other States , and that has been enforced with such conspic - uous success in the
State of New York	LOCATION	.

		Fur - ther , it is proposed that , in the case of colleges to be incorporated in the future , a minimum endowment of one hundred thousand dollars shall be an imperative condition of the degree - conferring power .

		There is also the wise pro- viso that degrees may not be granted by any institutions carried on for private gain .

		It is extremely desirable that the measure which embodies these salutary provisions should be given statutory force by the present Legisla - ture ; and we urge upon everyone interested 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, in the cause of serious education , as distin - guished from sham education , to lend his influ - ence to the enactment of the proposed law .

		A great many narrow and selfish interests to say nothing of dishonest interests will be arrayed against it , and the work of distortion and misrepresentation , which began as soon as the measure was made public , will create an opposition not easily to be overcome .

		Yet the good name and the dignity of the
State	ORGANIZATION	demand that the title-factories should be suppressed , demand that every degree henceforth granted under the authority of
Illinois	LOCATION	should stand for good work done , or , in the case of the honorary degree , for an achievement judged to be worthy by some reputable institution of learning .

		For the weak-minded persons who are willing to purchase the fraudulent degrees so obligingly offered we must confess that we have little sympathy .

		It is a pitiful form of vanity to which the allurements of the diploma-shops appeal , and we are not particularly concerned to protect that sort of ambition from the conse - quences of its own foolishness .

		But the public has a right to be protected from charlatans of all descriptions , and the granting of a degree is an act that touches public interests so nearly that the process should be hedged about with all reasonable restrictions .

		Indeed , the pro- visions of the proposed legislation seem to us to err , if anything , upon the side of leniency , and we view with no little suspicion the stipu - lation of one hundred thousand dollars as the minimum endowment of degree - conferring institutions hereafter to be incorporated .

		The
New York	LOCATION	requirement of five times this en - dowment seems to be the wiser provision of the two , for surely the latter sum is none too large for the needs of any new college that would be a desirable addition to those we already have in this
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is to be noted that the bill is not made retroactive in this matter of endowment , so that no injustice to existing institutions would result from its en - actment .

		The desire to parade a degree of some kind is , no doubt , one more illustration of the instinct that has created orders of nobility in the older civilizations , that has given Frenchmen the mania for decorations , and made Germans such sticklers for the use of whatever official titles they may bear .

		The American character is popularly supposed to have risen above these vanities , but this is only a superstition .

		The desire of the individual to be in some way dis - tinguished from his fellows is so inherent in the human nature which all peoples have in common , that , if denied vent in one direction , it will find it in another that , if not allowed the gewgaws of knighthood and rank , it will find a substitute in the mock distinctions that come from membership in societies which shall here be nameless , but of which no reader will have to look far for as many examples as he needs .

		Of course , the ambition to possess an academic degree is a shade worthier than the ambition to be a Grand Commander of some - thing or other , or to sport the proud badge of the
Scions of Colonial Tax-Gatherers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The former ambition betrays , at least , some trace of the feeling that intellectual distinctions have more intrinsic worth than any others ; yet even in this case how often is it true that the exter - nal mark of the distinction is the thing sought after , rather than the powers for which it should rightfully stand .

		The full force of this observation requires for its realization that we take into account not only the poor souls who stand ready to pur - chase degrees outright at the current market rates , but also those who bid for them indi - rectly , who make gifts to colleges , for example , anticipating in return the honorary doctorate .

		We look with righteous scorn upon the English ministry that is willing to traffic in titles of nobility making peers out of brewers and stockbrokers whose political contributions have been sufficiently liberal and how much more contemptible is the action of the American col - lege that is willing to degrade in similar fashion the titles of intellectual aristocracy which it ought to guard as a sacred trust .

		There is a good deal that might be said also about the motives of those who earn their degrees in legit - imate ways .

		Many students seem to think that getting a degree is the be-all and the end-all of college life . ''

		Will it count for a degree ? ''

		is the question they ask when some new kind of work is recommended to them .

		Every teacher knows this spirit , and knows how deadly an enemy it is of all culture for the sake of cul - ture .

		If the spectacle of young men and young women actuated mainly by this motive is a dis - heartening one , a spectacle even more disheart - ening is offered by those students of advanced age who so often are found in the classes of our larger universities , and who are so obviously out of place there .

		We make no reference to men and women seeking to round out , in later life , the defective education of their youth .

		Their pathetic case calls for nothing but sym -

		107 pathy and respect .

		We do , however , refer to those who , having got far beyond the period of their lives when training of the university type was what they most needed , submit themselves to that training for the sake of its prizes .

		It is not the best sort of discipline for them ; it is intellectually wasteful rather than economical ; nothing but the incentive of the doctorate im - pels them to undergo it ; the act is , in short , an unworthy concession to an artificial standard of culture .

		It is this tendency to make a fetich of the de - gree as if there were no other possible criterion of a man 's attainments that is responsible , on the one hand , for the disreputable business of diploma-selling , and , on the other , for the spectacle of gray beards engaged in the perform - ance of tasks fitted only for youth .

		If a ficti - tious value were not attached to degrees in the pedagogical estimation , we should have neither the one nor the other of these evils to deplore .

		The common university attitude toward degrees is not unsuggestive of the attitude of the church toward the consecration of priests : it is tacitly assumed that the scholarship has no validity which is not thus certified at the hands of men who have themselves gone through the academic routine and received the consecrating cowl .

		Yet the cowl no more makes the scholar than it does the monk .

		Again , those who are banded together by the common possession of degrees , especially if they are engaged in the professional work of education , are too apt to assume an attitude similar to that assumed by trade unions toward the outsider .

		They seem to say that , whatever distinction a man may have achieved in irregular and unorthodox ways , he can not really be a superior person , because he has dared to court fame while forsaking the beaten path .

		The tendencies which we have thus noted do not often go to the extremes of arrogance or fatuousness , but they go farther than they should be allowed to , and they some - times work grave injustice .

		The president of one of our leading universities spoke , a few years ago , of the Roman emperor who wished that all his enemies had a single neck that he might cut it off at one stroke , and then said that , for his part , he wished that all de - grees had a single neck that a single blow might put an end to them .

		While we should hardly express our own opinion in so hot a fashion as this , we can neither help feeling a certain sympathy with the utterance , nor help sharing in the indignation by which it was inspired .

		RECENT SCHOOL LEGISLATION FOR CITIES .

		When the article entitled '' City School Systems '' appeared in THE DIAL -LRB-
Oct. 16 , 1898	DATE	-RRB- , I hoped at no distant day to return to the subject , going more into detail , but dealing with it in a less critical and in a more constructive way .

		Such an article I thought might , at the present stage of discussion , prove helpful to some readers ; but now that the time to carry out this plan has come , I am per - suaded that a still better one will be to review , in a general way , some recent school legislation that illustrates the later movements of public thought .

		The first act of legislation to be noticed related to the city of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, where , as was widely be - lieved at the time , the evils of the old system had become intolerable and the need of reform very urgent .

		In
1887	DATE	the
General Assembly of Ohio	ORGANIZATION	enacted that henceforth the superintendent of the public schools of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	should appoint all the teachers of said schools , by and with the advice and consent of the board of education , and that the board or superintendent might remove teachers for cause .

		It will be seen that this is putting the super - intendent and the board in the same relation to appointments that the President and
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	occupy , as prescribed by the
Consti	PERSON	- tution , in relation to appointments in tbe
National	ORGANIZATION	service .

		The superintendent nominates teachers to the board , which confirms or rejects the person or per - sons nominated ; but if the board rejects one of the superintendent 's nominees , it can do nothing toward filling the place until the superintendent sends in a second nomination .

		As we shall see , this method of appointing teachers has since been adopted in other cities .

		This law made no other change in the administration of tbe
Cincinnati	LOCATION	schools .

		The Reorganization Act for the
Board of Edu	ORGANIZATION	- cation of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, passed in
1892	DATE	, was a far more radical piece of legislation than the one just con - sidered .

		It is , indeed , the most radical act of the kind that has been passed for any city up to date , and deserves the careful study of all men who are inter - ested in the reform of city school administration .

		As amended , this act offers to our consideration the following principal features : 1 .

		The board of education consists of a school council and a school director .

		2 .

		The legislative power and authority of the city school district is vested in a school council of seven members , elected biennially for the city at large in two groups consisting of three and four mem - bers each , who receive each a compensation of
$ 240	MONEY	annually .

		They are chosen by the legally qualified electors for school purposes .

		All legislation enacted by this council is by resolution ; and every resolu - tion involving expenditure of money or the approval of a contract for the payment of money , or for the purchase , sale , lease , or transfer of property or levy - ing any tax , or for the change or adoption of any 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, text-book , must , before it takes effect , be presented certified to the school director for his approval .

		If the director approves of the resolution , he shall sign it , and it becomes law ; but if he does not approve it , and refuses to sign it , he shall return it with his objections to the council , and it can then become law only when it receives the votes of two-thirds of all the members .

		The council has power to provide for the appointment of all necessary teachers and employees , and prescribes their duties and fixes their compensation .

		3 .

		The executive power is vested in a school director , who , like the members of the council , is elected on a city ticket by the qualified voters of the city , and , like them , holds his office for the term of two years .

		He is required to devote his entire time to the duties of his office , and he receives a salary , fixed by law , of
$ 5000	MONEY	a year .

		The duties of the director in regard to purchasing property , entering into contracts , building buildings , making repairs , providing supplies , etc. , are important , but do not come within the range of this article .

		It will be seen that the director is wholly independent of the council , standing to the people of the city in precisely the same relation as the members of the council themselves .

		4 .

		The provisions of the law relative to the ap - pointment and duties of the superintendent of instruction are so important that I shall quote the entire section that contains them .

		``
Sec	ORGANIZATION	.

		10 .

		The school director shall , subject to the approval of and confirmation by the council , appoint a superintendent of instruction , who shall remain in office during good behavior , and the school director may at any time , for sufficient cause , remove him ; but the order for such removal shall be in writing , specifying the cause therefor , and shall be entered upon the rec - ords of his office ; and he shall forthwith report the same to the council , together with the reasons therefore .

		The superintend - dent of instruction shall have the sole power to appoint and dis - charge all assistants and teachers authorized by the council to be employed , and shall report to the school director in writing annually , and oftener if required , as to all matters under his supervision , and may be required by the council to attend any or all of its meetings , and , except as otherwise provided in this act , all employees of the board of education shall be ap - pointed or employed by the school director .

		He shall report to the council annually , or oftener if required , as to all mat - ters under his supervision .

		He shall attend all meetings of the council and may take part in its deliberations , subject to its rules , but shall not have the right to vote . ''

		5 .

		The auditor of the city is the auditor of the board of education .

		This important enactment has exerted a consider - able influence upon subsequent legislation , although it has not been copied in its most radical features .

		A law to reorganize the school system of the city of
St. Louis	LOCATION	passed the
State	ORGANIZATION	legislature in
1897	DATE	.

		According to this law the superintendent of instruc - tion is appointed by the board of education , which consists of twelve members , for a term of four years , during which term his compensation can not be re - duced .

		On his nomination , the board appoints as many assistant superintendents as it deems neces - sary , and they may be removed by him with the board 's approval .

		The superintendent has general supervision , subject to the control of the board , of the course of instruction , discipline , and conduct of the schools , of text-books and studies ; and all ap - pointments , promotions , and transfers of teachers , and introduction and changes of text-books and apparatus , are made only upon his recommendation .

		One more act may be mentioned , that for
Toledo	LOCATION	, passed in
1898	DATE	.

		The city board of education con - sists of five members , elected for the city at large by the electors who are qualified to vote at school elections , to serve for the term of five years .

		Only such persons can have their names put on the offi - cial ballot , and receive votes , as are endorsed in writing for members of the board to the city hoard of elections by two hundred of the legal voters of the city -LRB- as above -RRB- , of either sex , not less than ten days previous to the election .

		The names of all persons who are thus certified , the board of elec - tions must publish in the daily papers , and prepare ballots containing them , which ballots must be voted at the annual municipal election and be deposited in a separate ballot-box provided for this purpose .

		Every elector may vote for as many of the candi - dates on the ballot as there are members to be elected .

		This provision in regard to making up the official ballot is believed to be a novel feature .

		The superintendent of instruction has the power to ap - point , subject to the approval and confirmation of the board , all teachers authorized to be employed .

		The tendencies of recent school legislation makes some things very clear , the more important of which may well be set down in numbered order .

		1 .

		There is a strong and a growing conviction in the minds of the people most interested , that the old-fashioned system of school provision , mainten - ance , and administration is not now adapted to ex - isting conditions , and must be thrown aside as obsolete .

		At least , it is very clear that such is the case in the cities that have been passed in review , for the thing has already been done .

		2 .

		While the new laws show considerable differ - ences in details , there is nevertheless a substantial agreement upon the main points .

		One of these points is that the old board of education was too large , was too carelessly selected , and exercised powers that were both too many and too much diversified .

		A second point is that the board should be practically kept within legislative limits , and not be allowed to roam at will , directly or indirectly , over the whole field of administration .

		The third point , and perhaps the most important of all , is that executive powers and duties should be entrusted to properly qualified executive departments or officers , that should have a status clearly recognized by law , and so be independent , to a greater or less extent , of the action of the board .

		Every one of these new laws recognizes two such departments , and the
Cleveland	LOCATION	law recognizes three .

		The latter would seem to be the proper number .

		In a report sub - mitted to the
National Council of Education	ORGANIZATION	in
1888	DATE	, I contended that there should be three executive departments : the
Department of Finance	ORGANIZATION	, Ac -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 109 counts , and Records ; the
Department of Construc	ORGANIZATION	- tion , Repairs , and Supplies ; the
Department of Instruction and Discipline	ORGANIZATION	.

		I contended , further , that the heads of these departments might he called the auditor , the superintendent of construction , and the superintendent of schools ; and that they should he men of decided ability and character , having each an expert knowledge of the important duties committed to their charge .

		Such modifica - tion of this recommendation as is suggested by the school director of
Cleveland	LOCATION	and the business man - ager of some of the other cities is perhaps a desir - able modification of my former plan .

		On one point the testimony , so far as it goes , is quite conclusive ; namely , the great evils '' that have affected the public schools , so far as they originated on the business side of the city system , are mainly due to the composition , character , and methods of school boards .

		Of course , conditions existing in the cities must be taken into the account ; for the prob - lem of city school reform is most distinctly a part of the great American problem of the reform of municipal government .

		The argument could be strengthened by taking account of reform movements that have not yet crystalized into legislation .

		Mention may be made of
Boston	LOCATION	, where the subject of reorganization on new lines has attracted sufficient attention to bring it before the
State	ORGANIZATION	legislature .

		The Report of the
Chicago School Commission	ORGANIZATION	has already been made the subject of an elaborate editorial article in this journal .

		The two largest cities of
Michigan	LOCATION	, De - troit and Grand Rapids , are now moving to bring the reorganization of their school systems before the legislature at the present session .

		No doubt there are other movements that have escaped my notice .

		The general subject is sure to attract the increasing attention of the public mind for some time to come .

		What the final type of school organ - ization for an American city will be , I do not un - dertake to say ; indeed , there is no reason to think that there will be , in a close sense of the term , a single type of system ; but there is little room to doubt that the recent legislation which has been re - viewed has been on lines that the future will approve .

		WHY IS POE `` REJECTED '' IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A writer who is a '' logic machine , '' who is marked by '' lack of humor '' and '' deficient knowledge of human nature , '' is hardly fitted to secure lodgment in the Amer - ican heart , though he be '' the greatest intellect
America	LOCATION	has produced assuredly the best artist . ''

		The writer on
Poe	PERSON	, in your issue of
Jan. 16	DATE	, should hardly wonder at the rejection of such a writer , however he may regret it .

		But , as he seems to remain puzzled by the fact , it may be worth while to point out two peculiarities of the writings of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, pervading them all , though more notice - able in his prose tales than in his poems , peculiarities which , as I happen to know , have prevented some read - ers who fully appreciate his marvellous mastery of lit - erary form from taking much delight in him .

		He is astonishingly unrealistic : it is utterly impossible to persuade oneself to care much for the outcome of his fictions , because we can not bring ourselves to that degree of faith in them which is necessary for sympathy .

		A rapid review of a few typical tales will make this plain ; and it will be most satisfactory to select for that purpose the seven tales lately edited by Professor
Perry	PERSON	for
Poe	ORGANIZATION	is entitled to be judged by his best .

		No house ever fell after the manner of the '' Fall of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Usher '' ; the assertion is true of the story as a whole , and of the details generally , from the queer observations made by the narrator as he approached the house to its final sinking .

		The weakness of '' Ligeia '' lies not in its being a study of an impossible problem the return to life , in another person 's body , of a woman long dead , but in the unreality of the scenery amid which , following his usual taste , the struggle is located .

		The process by which the victim in `` The Cask of Amontillado '' is lured to his doom is certainly thought out by a '' logic machine , '' but the only motive for the horrible crime is the difference between being injured and insulted , disposed of in one sentence of twenty - one words .

		To secure for the story that moderate amount of credence which is required for fiction , the author should have enlarged upon the insult enough to - make it seem possible that such revenge could be taken by a human being .

		Shakespeare did not lead up to the murder of Desdemona by saying in one short sentence that Othello suspected
Cassio	PERSON	.

		A similar absence of reported motive makes it impossible to sympathize with the couple who made an '' Assignation '' to - meet in sui - cide .

		We could care for them by first getting to have faith in them ; we might actually wish that their pro- posed elopement from life might not be thwarted , if we knew enough about their past lives and relationships to feel that they had indeed become inseparable .

		The '' Manuscript found in a Bottle '' reports dream-storms and dream-waves .

		The particular '' Black Cat '' of the tale has a way of coming to life after being killed that reminds us of the other cat which , the day after being beheaded , appeared at the door carrying its head in its mouth .

		The investigations of the hero of '' The Gold Bug , '' though certainly told by a perfect '' logic ma - chine , '' carry not the slightest conviction , as is discovered by the reader who notices that he remains perfectly passive ; he does not share the excitement of the digger for the hid treasure , does not care whether the spade turns up gold or sand .

		And as to the cryptogram , we all feel from the very start that it is a '' put-up job . ''

		This strange lack of realism , or naturalness , in all
Poe	PERSON	's writings for it characterizes his poetry also doubt - less results from his '' deficient knowledge of human nature . ''

		And '' this effect defective comes by cause . ''

		It is originally due to a deficient interest in morals .

		It is a sort and a degree of deficiency that becomes a de - fect in art ; for it is severe criticism on a man 's artistic quality to assert that his work is not so grounded on the passions of mankind as to carry the reader through to the end with a vitalizing interest in the outcome .

		This assertion of the artistic importance of morals is frequently misunderstood : it has become almost a fash - ion to misinterpret it .

		It is supposed to imply only a desire for didactic morality ; but it is simply a demand for moral motive as the impelling power of human ac - 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, tion .

		We do not demand of
Poe	PERSON	, or of any other liter - ary man , that he write goody-goody tales , that he aim to show `` young persons '' ho w to live , or mistake
Sunday	DATE	- school books for a high type of literature .

		We only rememember that men are supremely interested in the moral aspects of life , so that the way to interest one 's fellows is to appeal to moral motives .

		It is a maxim of art , which should be familiar to every artist in whatsoever medium he works , that the moral creates enthusiasm and so secures belief .

		In point of fact , literary illusion is obtained by moral warmth rather than by clear-cut logical consistency .

		The absence of the moral element from
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's writings will appear the moment one attempts to state the sub - jects of bis tales in moral terms .

		Shakespeare 's '' Mac - beth '' is a study of the effect upon a man under tempta - tion of the assurance that he can succeed by crime the co-working of fatalism and ill-desire .

		Hawthorne 's '' The Birthmark '' works out the results of impatience with a slight blemish in what is otherwise perfect .

		The '' Fall of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Usher '' might have shown how gloomy anticipations tend to fulfil themselves , if the author had not involved stone and mortar in the ruin .

		The problem of '' Ligeia '' the victory of will over death , can be stated , and there would have been a satisfactory basis for the action , if
Poe	ORGANIZATION	could have kept to the subject if he had not , as is his wont , over - emphasized the eyes , the squirming draperies , and other such details , and if he had not confused all moral sense by the notion that there was something criminal in taking a bride into such an apartment .

		If the murder included in '' The Black Cat '' is not utterly motiveless , it is at least to be hoped that a long time must pass before men take to wife - murder with no more rational promptings thereto .

		Comparison of '' The Gold Bug '' with
Stev	PERSON	- enson 's '' Treasure Island '' reveals at once the defect in Poe :
Stevenson	PERSON	leads his reader gradually up to interest in the success of the quest , and arouses a distinctly moral prejudice , to which much of our interest is due ; we take sides against the party among whom are to be found some of the most cruel of the pirates who had by murder and pillage gathered the treasure .

		I do not care to weigh against each other
Poe	PERSON	's won - derful linguistic perfection and his weakness in that part of art which has to do with the gathering and marshall - ing of fact and motives .

		I only wish to remind those who are charmed by his mastery of the resources of speech that it is vain to expect our people , for the pres - ent at least , to everlook the absence of moral motive and of consequent realism .

		For the present : if the time ever comes when the creations of the opium-eater 's imagination are actually born into the world and live out their careers , they will be apt to take him '' home to their business and bosoms , '' at least they will ad - mire the prophetic genius which enabled him to write their biographies beforehand .

		SOME CAUSES OF `` THE AMERICAN REJECTION OF POE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Is it altogether a matter of unfairness and prejudice that American readers as a rule make little of Poe ?

		Surely
Griswold	PERSON	's misrepresentations have been so often and so convincingly answered by
Poe	PERSON	's friends and ac - quaintances that no serious student of American letters is influenced by their manifest injustice .

		Does not the real reason lie deeper in the nature of the poet him - self , and in that of the nation which , as a rule , does not read him ?

		In fact , your contributor who deplores
Poe	PERSON	's non - appreciation by the mass of his countrymen has himself supplied several good reasons for it .

		One is his fatal lack of humor .

		Let us take as an example the opening lines `` To Helen '' : 44 1 saw thee once once only years ago ; I must not say how many but not many , '' where the attempt at playfulness , taken in connection with the rest of the poem , produces an effect that is neither more nor less than ludicrous .

		No man with the faintest sense of humor could have been guilty of a blunder like that .

		Now , humor is a warm-hearted , kindly quality , which endears a man to his fellows .

		He who does not in some degree possess it must makeshift as best he can to dwell in a world apart from human - kind ; and however this world may be lighted by poetic fancy and adorned by imagination , it will after all be only a cold moonlit region whose beauty will never com - pensate for its loneliness .


George Eliot	PERSON	has told us that '' there is no strain on friendship like a difference of taste in jokes , '' and this is one explanation of the dis - tance between
Poe	PERSON	and the public whom he failed to reach : they had no common ground whereon to stand long enough to become acquainted with each other .

		Poe had in him , it is true , '' something exotic which hinted of another clime and age . ''

		Had he lived in
Persia	LOCATION	one or two thousand years ago , some enter - prising Orientalist might have discovered him , and translated his writings for the benefit of a small but enthusiastic circle of readers , and publishers might have brought out his works in beautifully bound and illus - trated editions de luxe .

		There is scarcely another nine - teenth century author whose works afford scope for greater originality in illustration .

		Poe has certain qualities that the most unkindly critics can not deny him : weird and powerful imagination , con - structive ability , and exquisite melody of expression in both prose and verse .

		His perception and handling of tone-color are unsurpassed by even the greatest of lit - erary artists .

		There are certain lines of his that linger in the memory because of their perfect beauty of sound , while others come back frequently because of the pic - tures they suggest .

		But to many readers , the realiza - tion of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's artistic genius is only another source of vexation .

		Great poetry must have great subjects .

		Per - fection of form is not enough , although , in spite of Whitman and his followers , some readers will continue to think beauty of form one of the essentials of genuine poetry .

		The great poet , however , the poet who lives in the hearts of his own countrymen and wins for himself a lasting place in the affections of mankind , must voice in some effective manner the feelings and thoughts common to humanity .

		This
Poe	PERSON	does not do .

		As he does not laugh with those that laugh , neither does he weep with those that weep .

		His weeping he does all by himself .

		In fact , his most musical dirges , with their refrains of '' the lost
Lenore	PERSON	, '' '' beautiful
Annabel Lee	PERSON	, '' and - `` Ulalume , '' seem less like the expression of real sorrow than complex and finished studies in minor chords .

		One 's heart is not touched by them as by such simple lines as those in '' After the Burial '' : 44 There 's a little ridge in the churchyard Would scarce stay a child in its race , But to me and my thought it is wider Than the star-sown vague of space . ''

		This quatrain is a sincere and beautiful expression of
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL ill human experience .

		No heart that has shrunk before the mystery of death can fail to vibrate in response to it .

		Even pagan
Horace	PERSON	appeals to us more than
Poe	PERSON	, when he says , with sturdy manliness : '' The sorrow that we can not cure may yet Be lessened by that strength of heart That in all trials of our life endures . ''

		We are a strenuous race , we Anglo-Normans , and this girding-up of the loins of the soul in the face of bereave - ment has for us far more of pathos than the most mu - sical outpourings of self-pity .

		Herein is
Poe	PERSON	's vital defect : he indulges too much in self-pity , and is too little moved by the sorrows and burdens of the world .

		Poe himself says that '' a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites by elevating the mind . ''

		Whether or not it be a defect in our make-up , it must be acknowl - edged that for the most part Americans , while we may be refreshed and soothed by poems which give us '' pure beauty '' and nothing else , are elevated only by those which voice the experiences of our common humanity , or call us to high endeavor .

		And is not one or the other or both of these elements to be found in all poems which have outlasted the century wherein they were produced ?


Victor Hugo	PERSON	has told us that '' while the poet needs wings , he must also have feet '' ; he must touch the earth occasionally , must come near to us , if he would persuade us to follow him into the blue ether .

		So , notwithstand - ing
Poe	PERSON	's many and varied gifts of the intellect , the poet of our hearts will for a long time continue to be some other than the poet of ''
Lenore	PERSON	. ''

		WHAT ARE CRITICS FOR ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A short time ago it fell to the lot of the literary editor of one of
Chicago	LOCATION	's most popular dailies to re - view ''
Aylwin	PERSON	. ''

		He had evidently not been informed as to the aristocratic parentage of the book , for he seized upon it as the work of a green and friendless writer , only fitted to be a target for humorous sharp - shooting .

		Accordingly his Procrustean column was filled with fragments of gipsy incantations , Welsh dia - lect , and mystical jargon , punctuated with sic 's and -LRB- ! -RRB-

		's , and supplemented with a witty commentary reflecting ou the sanity of a novelist who expected intelligent peo - ple to interest themselves in such a '' farrago of non - sense , '' and to read Welsh names where the consonants were in such large majority .

		A few weeks later the same newspaper published another review of the same book , this time evidently inspired by the publishers , for it included all those details about Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	which were published -LRB- usually in the same words -RRB- in other so-called critiques : all about his distinguished friends , the circumstances under which the book was written and published , an authentic key to the charac - ters , some remarks on the esoteric popularity of
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	and the
Welsh Gipsies	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		The Pre-Raphael - itism , Neo-Platonism and Post-Zolaism were neatly dissected out and identified with the skill of a clinical snrgeon , and one knew not which to admire the more : the author who had made these dry bones live , or the critic who discerned their origin and function .

		We can leave the explanation of such incidents to those who know what goes on behind the curtain of anonymity .

		The managing editor is not to be severely blamed , since there was nothing to indicate that the two reviews pertained to the same subject except the title of the book .

		But whether Deutero-Critic was the same individual as the first except for the change of heart , is not of importance .

		What does shock the reader is to find that the '' literary column '' of the average news - paper is its most carelessly written department , with the exception of the dramatic criticism , which is usually worse .

		The athletic editor , the fashion editor , the culi - nary editor , the dermatological editor , the horoscope editor , all seem to understand their business and show some independence of judgment ; but the literary editor often shows neither independence nor judgment .

		What is demanded by the reader of the critic is not infallibility but responsibility .

		We will overlook his mistakes if we only have his assurance that he is doing the best that he can .

		A critic in discussing Mr.
Paul Laurence Dunbar	PERSON	's recent novel commented on the curi - ous fact that all the characters were colored people ; another critic called attention to the equally curious fact that Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	had introduced no characters of his own race , but had written a '' white folks ' story . ''

		Now both these critics were above the average , because they realized that there is a difference between black and white , and they resisted the prevalent tendency to call everything gray ; and it is probable that one or the other of them was partly right .

		It is to be expected that a critic will err , but we wish he would not boast of his errancy as Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	did a few months ago .

		His attention was called to the fact that a book he had condemned in a few careless words as unworthy of notice had proved a literary success , and in his gracefully facetious way he explains that a critic has so little time to give to reading that he can not be expected to know whether a book is good or not , and that for his part he does not care whether his judgments are correct or false .

		This confession disturbed me a good deal , for I had been relying on Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's criticisms for many years .

		A book he condemned I always read ; and if he attacked a book savagely I bought it at once , for I knew it must be worth owning .

		By following this rule I have acquired a select library of the world 's best literature with not a trashy volume in it .

		But when he says he does not know and does not care whether the books he reviews are good or bad , my faith in his negative infallibility is rudely shaken .

		I may miss some important work through a neglected condemnation on his part .

		A respectable lawyer who , loses a case , the respect - able doctor who kills a patient , is properly ashamed of it : would it be too much to expect of a respectable critic who has pronounced a false judgment or killed a good book that he should conceal his glee over the achievement ?

		What is a critic for , anyway ?

		Is he to be a publisher 's echo , a writer of philosophical essays with a book for a text , a jester at the author 's expense , a bric-a-brac collector of second-hand personalities ?

		or is it his duty to read new books and tell us what they are ?

		We would like to have the critics save us time and money by reading .

		the twenty-five books published each day and giving us a trustworthy and impartial account of them , so we can tell whether we want to read them or not .

		We are not interested in the critic 's likes and dislikes , except in so far as we can use them to fore - tell our own .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD .

		* Fifty years ago everybody that was interested in American politics and everybody that read newspapers had heard of the Underground Railroad .

		It was much talked of , but not by those who knew the most about it .

		It was as mysterious as the Iron Mask , or the Fehm - gericht , or the Old Man of the Mountain in the middle ages .

		The phrase was purely meta - phorical .

		There was no railroad , and it was not subterranean .

		There was no corporation ; there were no directors , no president , no stock - holders , no track , no cars , no engines , no time - table , no regular time or place of trains , no rates of fare , no tickets ; name everything that belongs to a railroad except passengers and conductors , and deny the existence of all that you have listed , and you will be in the right .

		And the so-called conductors were not like real railway conductors .

		The laws of most of the states were against this shadowy elusive thing , whatever it was : yet in every community where it was known or supposed to exist , some of the best men of the community , the most upright , men who feared God and wrought righteousness , were spoken of as deepest in its mysteries , most audacious in its management .

		Can we call the ''
U. G. R. R.	PERSON	'' -LRB- so the abbre - viation ran -RRB- an institution ?

		Slavery was called by one of its defenders '' our peculiar institu - tion '' ; surely here was the counter peculiar institution .

		Slavery was well-organized , had vast wealth , had unlimited social support , had special pro- visions for its defense in the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, had seats in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, controlled elections , made presidents , judges , and officers of every grade .

		But the unorgan - ized counter-institution , without money , without law , without political place or power , like the invisible antagonist in the fairy stories who carries a magical sword , proved to be such an annoying assailant and such a powerful adver - sary that it must be reckoned one of the great causes of the final ruin of slavery .

		The political importance of the escapes of fugitives and of the recovery of them is made * THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD FROM SLAVERY TO FREEDOM .

		By
Wilbur H. Siebert	PERSON	, Associate Professor of European History in
Ohio State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		With an Intro - duction by
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	, Professor of History in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		With illustrations .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		very prominent by the efforts of the South to recover slaves under the law of
1793	DATE	and to get a more stringent law . ''

		Five bleeding wounds ! ''

		said the great orator of compromise and con - ciliation in
1850	DATE	, describing the condition of his country , '' five bleeding wounds ! ''

		counting them off on the diverging fingers of his out - stretched hand .

		Benton cynically said that if
Clay	ORGANIZATION	had had more fingers he would have found more wounds .

		But
Benton	PERSON	might have spared his sneer , as he would have done had he fore - seen .

		Now that the whole matter is half a cen - tury away , we can look with sympathy upon the efforts of
Clay	ORGANIZATION	,
Calhoun	PERSON	, and
Webster	PERSON	to avoid the civil war which they believed to be imminent .

		There were indeed bleeding wounds .

		To Clay , one of the fatal five was the action of Northern people when they aided fugitives and fought the slave-hunters .

		It is wonderful that he could have thought
Mason	PERSON	's Fugitive-Slave Bill to be a healing balm for that gaping wound .

		The remedy was like the old surgery of wounds before the days of Ambrose Pare , when caustic potash was ap - plied to every cut , '' to draw out the peccant humors , '' the creation of which modern science finds due to the potash itself .

		If the law of
1793	DATE	was offensive to the North because of its ten - dency to provoke breaches of the peace when the slaveholder sought to recover his slave by simple '' reprisal '' -LRB- which
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	explains as one 's taking his property wherever he finds it -RRB- , and because it was a cloak for kidnapping free men , how could it be supposed that the North would peaceably bear an enactment which increased both these evils , and contained several special and new grievances and provo - cations ?

		The more we have studied the pecu - liarities of this law and the results of its enforce - ment , and the subsequent career of
James M. Mason	PERSON	, its author -LRB- the Confederate envoy taken from the Trent -RRB- , the more it seems plain that it was not intended to make peace , but to lead to secession .

		It was a test measure : if the North will stand this , slavery is secure ; if it will not , the South will know the next step must be secession .

		The gaping , bleeding wound was enlarged ; but slavery , not the nation , died of the hemorrhage .

		Clay 's curative measures were passed one by one : they failed to go through together , as a real compromise .

		Nevertheless , they were called the compromises of
1850	DATE	.

		The admission of
California	LOCATION	gave an actual majority in the Sen - ate to the North , and shattered forever
Cal	LOCATION	- houn 's favorite scheme of an equal balance
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 there .

		Texas was paid not to make war upon the
United States	LOCATION	, and to yield her claims upon
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		All things were indeed settled and compromised except Northern conscience and love of liberty , and
Southern	ORGANIZATION	claims of property and defense of slavery .

		With the new law to help him , the Southern master or his agent made hunting-grounds of the North - ern States .

		He became frequent and very obvious .

		Fugitives who had long rested secure in
Northern	LOCATION	villages and cities or worked on
Northern	ORGANIZATION	farms fled in swift alarm to
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Their absence was eloquent .

		Throughout the South the rumor spread , and suggested flight to daring spirits .

		As masters talked , slaves learned that there were friends of liberty in the North as well as officers of oppression .

		In the North every arrest excited greater attention , and brought the peculiar institution into the blaze of publicity .

		The Underground Railroad increased its business .

		The South and the North grew still more angry with each other as collisions were more frequent .

		North - ern states passed '' Personal Liberty Laws '' and other measures within their constitutional rights to make recovery difficult .


The Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	came into conflict with the
United States	LOCATION	and its
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' was written , and sold by thou - sands and tens of thousands of copies .


Doug	PERSON	- las 's
Kansas	LOCATION	and
Nebraska	LOCATION	Bill poured oil on the flames by renewing the political struggle and rending the lately victorious Democratic party .

		The operators on the Underground grew bolder ; for men now winked at or aided them who had before denounced them as disturbers of the peace and enemies of the public welfare .

		This is well illustrated in the
Garner	PERSON	case , in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, in
1856	DATE	.


Rutherford B. Hayes	PERSON	is the relator of the story as given by Professor
Siebert	PERSON	.


Margaret Garner	PERSON	had escaped into
Ohio	LOCATION	with four children , and was hidden near
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		When her master found them , she determined to save her little ones from slavery by the second of
Patrick Henry	PERSON	's alter - natives ; she killed the best beloved of her little flock , but succeeded no further .

		Efforts to save her from returning to
Kentucky	LOCATION	all failed : even a process against her for murder and vio - lation of the law of
Ohio	LOCATION	was of no avail : the property right of the master overrode the crim - inal justice of
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	was living on a street full of pro-slavery people ; but this tragedy converted them all ; one of the leaders among them called on Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	at his house and declared with great fervor , '' Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	, hereafter I am with you .

		From this time for - ward I will not only be a Black Republican , but I will be a damned abolitionist ! ''

		Such conversions abounded .

		The execution of the law killed it .

		Moderate men in the
North	LOCATION	,
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, for example , said the slaveholders were entitled to a law for the re - covery of their property ; but it must now be doubted whether even the allowance of a jury trial on the question of identity would have calmed the aroused and indignant Northern people .

		The great contests of the giants in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and the occasional capture of a fugitive like
Anthony Burns	PERSON	, or
Sims	PERSON	, or
Jerry	PERSON	of
Syracuse	LOCATION	, were matters of history open to all men ; but the underlying cause of much of the commo - tion was as secret as a fire in a peat-bog .

		It avoided the publicity that makes history .

		Now and then some daring or skilful escape would be told in the Northern newspapers ; but
Fred	PERSON	- erick
Douglas	PERSON	complained that all such narra - tions made later escapes more difficult by mak - ing masters and hunters aware of the tricks and turns and disguises and resting-places of the fugitives and their friends .

		He would not tell how he escaped in
1838	DATE	.


Henry Box Brown	PERSON	was put into a box three feet long , two feet wide , and two feet eight inches deep , and so sent by
Adams Express	ORGANIZATION	from
Richmond	LOCATION	,
Va.	LOCATION	, to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The early and triumph - ant publication of the story put an end to such escapes , and helped bring the man who had boxed
Brown	PERSON	, and who had aided fugitives for twenty years , to the penitentiary .

		It was the policy of the shrewdest station agents and con - ductors to know as little as possible of the work of others .

		Hence , it happened that when slavery came to an end and there was no reason for further concealment , no one could write a history of the Underground Railroad .

		Occasionally some actor in this drama behind the scenes would relate and publish his reminiscences .

		There are a few interesting books of this sort , as the
Life of Levi Coffin	ORGANIZATION	, or Still 's account of things noted at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, or Dr.
R. C. Smedley	PERSON	's memoranda of
Chester County	LOCATION	.

		The men who had been most active were now for the most part old and grayheaded men , passing rapidly away .

		Men born sixty years ago had not become adult when the drama closed .

		The stories they can now tell are for the most part traditions from their elders .

		Seeing that this knowledge must soon be lost , Professor
Siebert	PERSON	114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, has devoted much time and labor to the collec - tion and arrangement of historical matter re - lating to the Underground Railroad , which is presented in the volume under review .

		Professor
Siebert	PERSON	's book is both the most extensive and the most comprehensive work of all hitherto issued upon this subject .

		He dis - cusses his sources of information ; the origin , growth , methods , and managers of the Under - ground ; abductions from the South ; fugitives in the North and in
Canada	LOCATION	; prosecutions under the Acts of
1793	DATE	and
1850	DATE	; the effects of the Underground Railroad in politics and otherwise , in discussion of which he affirms that '' the
U. G. R. R.	PERSON	was one of the greatest forces which brought on the Civil War and thus de - stroyed slavery . ''

		He gives thirty-seven pages to '' the map of the
U. G. R. R.	PERSON	system , '' giv - ing one general and five local maps .

		He gives in an appendix the Acts of
1793	DATE	and of
1850	DATE	, and the fugitive clauses in the Constitution , in the Ordinance of
1787	DATE	, and in the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise ; and adds another appendix giv - ing eighty-one important fugitive-slave cases with reference to the sources of information concerning each .

		To these he might well have added from
Wheeler	PERSON	's '' Law of Slavery '' the early case of
Avis	ORGANIZATION	in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, often cited as a leading case ; and the cases of
Phoebe vs. Jay	PERSON	, Borders vs. the People , and
Willard	PERSON	vs. the People in
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		Another valuable appendix is an extensive bibliography .

		This ends with '' Imaginative Works , '' listing only four , of which one is ''
Uncle Tom	PERSON	's Cabin , '' and another is Whit - tier 's Poems .

		Why not also
Longfellow	PERSON	's '' Poems on Slavery , '' which preceded Whit - tier 's first book that had an anti-slavery poem ?

		Why not
Lowell	LOCATION	?

		And for novels , there should be named
Trowbridge	PERSON	's '' Neighbor Jackwood , ''
Epes Sargeant	PERSON	's `` Peculiar , ''
William L. G. Smith	PERSON	's pro-slavery ''
Uncle Tom	ORGANIZATION	's Cabin as it is , '' of which 15,000 copies were sold in fifteen days , and Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's '' Dred , '' called later ''
Nina Gordon	PERSON	'' : to these we could add njany more of less importance .

		Another appendix of thirty-seven pages is called a '' Directory of the Names of Under - ground-Railroad Operators . ''

		The present re - viewer is sorry to be obliged to say that unless the rest of it is more accurate than certain parts that come within his own personal knowledge , it is so unreliable as to be practically useless .

		By defect , it omits names that should be there ; but this fault is naturally incident to the diffi - culty of obtaining information at the present time , almost forty years after the secret coali - tion ceased operation .

		For example , in
Sangamon County	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, the station at
Farmington	LOCATION	, near the present
Farmingdale	LOCATION	, had operators Rev.
Bilious Pond	PERSON	,
Deacon Lyman	PERSON	, and Messrs.
Estabrook	PERSON	and Low ; and the knowing ones sent fugitives thither rather than to pro-slavery
Springfield	LOCATION	, though the capital was honored by the residence of Luther Ransom , a fearless and active Gar - risonian .

		These names are not given ; but three names are given for Sangamon , of so little fame that only surnames represent two of them .

		So in
Morgan	LOCATION	,
Henry Irving	PERSON	and
W. C. Carter	PERSON	, the principal '' coachmen '' from
Jack	PERSON	- sonville , are unnamed , as well as
Julius A. Willard	PERSON	, whose name is found in our
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	Reports .

		In the same volume with
Willard	PERSON	's case appeared the case and name of
Andrew Borders of Randolph	ORGANIZATION	, not listed .

		Pro- fessor
Siebert	PERSON	may be excused for not getting these names ; but their absence may show that such a list or '' directory '' can not be made .

		Again , men are listed who never were Under - ground Railroad operators , but were known only as anti-slavery men , and perhaps lukewarm as such .

		The reviewer knew
Morgan County	ORGANIZATION	pretty well , and can say that the three names given for that county should have no place there .

		Still worse , in the list for
Jersey County	LOCATION	are three names that belong to
Morgan	LOCATION	; and one of those had no active connection with the movement .

		Of the remaining four names in
Jersey	LOCATION	, who would recognize in the Frenchy name '' Garesche '' the sturdy Yankee miller ,
Joseph Gerrish	PERSON	?

		In
Henry County	LOCATION	,
William T. Allan	PERSON	-LRB- not
Allen	PERSON	-RRB- appears also as
William S. Allen	PERSON	, non-existent .

		McLean is honored with the single name of
Deacon Moss	PERSON	; but this is the same man as the ''
Dea	ORGANIZATION	.


Mark Morse	PERSON	'' of
Woodford	LOCATION	, '' Mt. Hope Station , '' on the road in
1840	DATE	.


Charles Lippincott	PERSON	never lived in Ran - dolph , but in
Madison	LOCATION	and Bond .

		There is a very suspicious identity of three names in the
Bond County	LOCATION	list of
Illinois	LOCATION	and the
Bond County	ORGANIZATION	list of
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		Leaving
Illinois	LOCATION	, where more defects could be shown , let us go to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		Here , from the list for
Chester County	LOCATION	,
J. Williams Thorne	ORGANIZATION	should be transferred to
Lancaster	LOCATION	, where he is erroneously given as
I. William Thorne	PERSON	.


Enoch Walker	PERSON	should be given to
Montgomery	LOCATION	;
Philip	LOCATION	and Benjamin Price should be taken from
Delaware	LOCATION	to
Chester	LOCATION	, where one of them is listed as
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	.

		Other changes should be made in that region ; and
Mahlon Brosius	PERSON	1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 should be added to
Chester	PERSON	.

		Forty-two per cent of the '' Directory '' is given to
Ohio	LOCATION	, which is probably nearer to accuracy .

		But the '' Di - rectory '' and the maps are tentative , partial , and defective : a true map can not be made .

		Let not this criticism of the weak point of the book -LRB- weak because its author attempted what no man can now do -RRB- obscure or hide from our readers the fact that Professor Sie - bert 's work is the great work on its subject , the book to which writers on American his - tory must hereafter look as the best summary of information .

		It is an honest and laborious attempt to gather the facts of the time ; and they are skilfully classified and arranged .

		There is no superflous rhetoric .

		It must have cost the writer an effort to omit the romance of the Underground Railroad , the marvellous stories of escapes and perils which would have made the volume more readable , but would have made it less a sober and self-contained history .

		For those incidents one must go to Still and S medley and Coffin and the like .

		The present reviewer , who heard
Garrison	PERSON	lecture sixty-eight years ago to a scanty audience , and who was an interested observer and an active sharer in the an ti - slavery contest to its close , is glad to see a presentation of one of the greatest agencies of the conflict so suitable to its import - ance and so worthy of praise .

		The last paragraph of the text speaks of '' the cancellation of the slave clause in the
Consti	LOCATION	- tution by the amendment of that instrument . ''

		This is a not uncommon error .

		But that clause is not cancelled .

		If a duly-bound apprentice or a person who has made a contract to labor for a specified time should run away from
Ohio	LOCATION	into
Indiana	LOCATION	, under this still-valid clause the injured party could reclaim the fugitive , whom no law of
Indiana	LOCATION	could release from his obli - gation .

		This clause , used for the benefit of the slaveholder , is valid without slavery , and is a condensed form of a similar provision in the instrument of union of the
New England	LOCATION	col - onies in
1643	DATE	, which was meant for indentured servants ; though after their treaty of
1650	DATE	with
New York	LOCATION	, it was extended to that Dutch colony , and it is reported that under it one slave was reclaimed .

		The book is well printed , and is , except in a few proper names , free from typographical errors : it has thirty-eight pages of index .

		Having been so interested in the work as to read every page of its text , the reviewer congratu - lates Professor
Siebert	PERSON	upon the completion of his monumental labor .

		SAMUEL WILLARD .

		SOME RECENT BOOKS ON .

		EDUCATION .

		* General
Francis A. Walker	PERSON	was known to the country in many ways ; he was a man of varied talents and diversified activities .

		Per - haps it would not be an easy matter to rate his ability and the value of his work , relatively , in the several spheres of action in which he figured .

		He was a soldier of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and the historian of important phases of the Civil War ; he was superintendent of the National Censuses of
1870	DATE	and
1880	DATE	; he was a student of economics , and the writer of valuable eco - nomical books ; and he was a practical educator .

		All this was well known to the public ; but we assume that the extent and value of his contri - butions to educational discussion were not equally well known .

		We have now before us the evidence of his work in this department of activity , in the solid and beautiful volume en - titled '' Discussions in Education , '' which is made up of his occasional addresses and papers .

		It is a fitting memorial to its author , and a fresh evidence of the country 's loss in his un - timely death .

		General
Walker	PERSON	was a man of varied educa - tional experience , serving at different times as a college tutor , a college professor , and President of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	.

		He also served on the
Boston School Board	ORGANIZATION	, and probably in other similar administrative offices .

		The breadth of his experience , as well as the natural range of his mind , are reflected in these '' Discussions . ''

		The subjects dealt with are all live and practical subjects ; the author was apparently too busy to deal with educa - tion under its historical or philosophical aspects .

		The contents are grouped by the editor under * DISCUSSIONS IN EDUCATION .

		116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, four heads : `` Technological Education , '' '' Man - ual Education , '' '' The Teaching of Arithme - tic , '' and '' College Problems . ''

		But General
Walker	PERSON	never deals with his subject in a nar - row or so-called '' practical '' way ; right or wrong , he always has his eye fixed on some valuable educational end .

		Nor does he tumble into the pitfall that always yawns for the spe - cialist .

		For example , he writes : '' My own opinion is that engineering education is primarily and principally an educational and not an en - gineering problem ; and that the judgment of a strong and experienced teacher who has studied this problem is more likely to be right than that of any engineer without experience as a teacher , however eminent he may be in his profession . ''

		Again , he does not find the value of industrial education in special utilities , but writes : '' I heartily believe that the introduction of the me - chanic arts , and of sewing and cooking , into the public schools , will do much , very much , not only to increase the interest of the pupils in their work , as has been already indicated , but to win for the schools a far larger degree of interest on the part of parents and a far heartier support of the system on the part of the general community . ''

		And again , speaking of manual training : . ''

		I care comparatively little for its influence upon eye or hand .

		Its chief work in my view is educational ; and in that educational work I place foremost its power of rectifying the mind itself , of straightening the crooked limb , so to speak , of strengthening the weak joint , of healing the lesion , which , if not cured , will proceed to deep and irreparable injury . ''

		President
Gilman	PERSON	's '' University Problems , '' like General
Walker	PERSON	's '' Discussions in Edu - cation , '' consists of the more weighty utterances of its author , during the last twenty-five years or more , on educational subjects .

		Most of these utterances originally took the form of public addresses ; and such form they still re - tain .

		The book is a valuable contribution to educational discussion .

		Here the reader will find the resources and ideals , the methods and field , of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, with some - thing of its history , clearly set forth by its President .

		President
Gilman	PERSON	throws out one original suggestion relative to a National uni - versity that may yet prove to be highly import - ant .

		It is , that the Smithsonian Institution shall '' organize a plan by which the literary and scientific institutions of
Washington	LOCATION	may be associated and correlated so far , and so far only , as relates to the instruction and assist - ance , under proper guidance , of qualified stu - dents . ''

		There will be no difficulty , he assures us , about the funds if this were done .

		As we understand him , this is the scheme that Dr.
Gilman	PERSON	has in mind in this passage : '' If the university in
Washington	LOCATION	could be so ordered that all the scientific resources of the nation were avail - able for study , under the guidance of competent per - sons , without reference to honors , and without formal and prolonged curricula , very many well-qualified schol - ars some who have graduated , and some who have never been in college ; men and women ; foreigners and Americans ; some in early and some in later life would there be gathered , and would be aided , taught , and inspired by the opportunities and influences thrown open to them , in an amplitude worthy of the
National Capital	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Professor
Russell	PERSON	is fully justified in assum - ing , as he does in his preface to '' German Higher Schools , '' that there was room in our pedagogical literature for a new book on the subject .

		As he tells us , German elementary schools and German universities have become familiar to American educators , but the sec - ondary schools , which could be studied by us with still greater advantage , are much less known .

		Not only has he discovered the want , but he has gone far toward meeting it : still , no one book could meet it fully .

		One hundred and seven pages of his handsome volume are given to an historical account of German education and schools , from the days of Columban and
Boniface	PERSON	to the present time , and the remainder to an exposition of the existing system of sec - ondary education .

		The work is not closely confined , however , to secondary schools , and , if it were to be a good one , could not be ; it must present the subject in its relations to other parts of the educational system .

		The author shows wide reading on his subject and skilful use of the note-book .

		He sprinkles quotation over his pages most plentifully , but he so weaves them into his narrative or exposition as not seriously to impair the unity of his compo - sition .

		But , what is more to the purpose , he shows , when dealing with the secondary schools as they now exist , a large first-hand knowledge , obtained by personal visitation of schools and conference with teachers and educational au - thorities .

		There is no work in the English language known to us that contains so much and so valuable information about the second - ary schools of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Nor is the book a book of facts merely ; the author has an eye also for ideas and forces , and conducts his his - torical narration with constant reference to these factors .

		We do not know how it may be with Rug - beans or other British readers , but it is pretty safe to say that such Americans as read Mr.
Rouse	PERSON	's '' History of Rugby School '' will find the centre of interest in the external rather than the internal features , as he portrays them ,
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 of that famous school .

		While these readers have a considerable knowledge of the interior work and life of a great English public school , they generally know little of its exterior his - tory .

		We can not say that , under this aspect , Rugby is a typical school ; undoubtedly , these institutions present many points of difference , but , after all , the great public schools , as well as the large class to which they belong that is , the endowed schools must have much ex - ternal history in common .

		Mr.
Rouse	PERSON	has , in general , presented this side of his subject with commendable fulness .

		When
Lawrence Sheriffe	PERSON	, member of the
Worshipful Company of Grocers	ORGANIZATION	, and grocer to Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, died in
1567	DATE	, he left be - hind him a will and accompanying documents , in which
Rugby School	ORGANIZATION	had its origin .

		He was a Rugbean by birth , and , having prospered in business , wished to leave to his native town a legacy that would be productive of lasting good .

		So he left to
George Harrison	PERSON	and
Barnard Field	ORGANIZATION	, trustees , three pieces of prop - erty : A mansion house that he had built at Rugby , together with the land round about it , * ' being altogether one rood thirty poles or thereabouts '' ; the parsonage of
Brown	PERSON	so ver , near Rugby , '' with one yard of glebe , more or less , and the tithes '' ; and one-third of '' the field hard by
Holborn	PERSON	, some half mile outside of
London	LOCATION	, commonly called Conduit Close or Conduit Mead , '' these pieces of property being devoted to the founding of an almshouse and a public school .

		The potency of Rugby lay in the piece of meadow land .

		This was at the time of comparatively little value , but it was by and by swallowed up by the great me - tropolis and so became a source of great and increasing wealth to the double foundation .

		Although
Lawrence Sheriffe	PERSON	added a codicil to his will , and then fortified both documents with an '' intente , '' he still left the business in great confusion .

		As we have seen , the foundation was double , and it was a long time before the school and the almshouse could be fully sepa - rated ; the founder stated his intentions and wishes in a vague and general manner , not even providing for the succession of the trusteeship ; while some of his relatives who had some slight claims upon his estate did all that they could do to destroy the trust altogether .

		What with an imperfect devise , indifferent or incompetent trustees , suits and commissions in equity , acts of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and greedy heirs , it was not a little remarkable that the foundation ever be - came a great school , or even survived at all .

		This point we had in mind when we spoke above of the external history of Rugby .

		Of the many hundreds of school endowments made in
England	LOCATION	in the sixteenth century , some , and probably many , must have perished utterly , or have been wholly diverted from their purpose , by causes similar to those that came so near to wrecking Rugby .

		Still , the view that we get of the interior of the school is by no means without interest .

		Dealing with the new spirit introduced by Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	, the author sets forth his own view , as well as
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's , of one important feature of school discipline : ''
Arnold	PERSON	did not in the least suffer from that false sentimentally common in our own generation , which condemns all corporeal punishment as degrading .

		There can be no degradation when none is felt , and ordinary boys , as every practical teacher will admit , feel none in corporeal punishment .

		They hail it , rather , as far pre - ferable to long and monotonous impositions ; if judi - ciously and calmly administered , it never leaves a grudge behind , as impositions often do . ''

		The reader of this passage would naturally expect to find Mr.
Rouse	PERSON	defending fags and fagging , and this he does .

		He tells us that : '' It raises a smile to read what some eminent edu - cationalists have written of the fagging system , as though it were a thing essentially bad , and only to be tolerated because it can not be abolished .

		If it be essen - tially bad , that the young should serve before they can rule , then the whole system of government in all organ - ized countries , and in the army and navy , and in com - merce , is essentially bad .

		Experience shows that the fagging system , if properly limited , is a good and use - ful institution , and an excellent training in habits of smartness and obedience . ''

		There may be some shadow of truth in this view of the subject , but the fagging system will disappear , and future masters of Rugby , suc - cessors of Mr.
Rouse	PERSON	, will wonder that he ever defended it .

		Mr.
Graham Balfour	PERSON	has attempted to describe the three grades of education in the four countries ,
England	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and
Wales	LOCATION	.

		He defines his purpose as not to write a history of education , but to give '' an account of the framework of which education is the life and spirit . '' ''

		I have had , '' he says , '' to deal only with the dry bones , for the first and most pressing need was a picture of the ex - isting skeleton . ''

		Skeletons , even if grinning and ghastly , are of the first importance to all systems , and of great interest to all students of anatomy .

		This book might be described , there - fore , as a treatise on the educational anatomy of the four countries just named .

		We do not see how the author could have done his work better than he has done it .

		He has ranged 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, over the whole field for facts , and has presented them in a manner that shows decided power of analysis and combination .

		It is hard to see how more information could have been put in the same compass , or how what is here found could have been presented in clearer or more concise language .

		The book is one that all students of education in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	will find most useful , if not indispens - able .

		Still , we have some fear that readers who have not some considerable previous knowl - edge of the subject will find it too solid and compact for their purpose .

		But compendiums are not written , or should not be written , for novices .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's book illustrates in a striking way the extraordinary variety of schools exist - ing in the four countries named , and especially in
England	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	, which , for the purposes of elementary teaching , are subject to the same laws .

		Even the reader who is already familiar with the field that is , if he lives on this side of the ocean will be impressed again by the utter absence of controlling ideas and princi - ples , and the absolute predominance of empir - icism and precedent , in British education .

		He will also be impressed again by the progress of elementary instruction in recent years .

		Govern - ment grants began with 20,000 in
1833	DATE	; they amounted to 800.000 in
1860	DATE	, and reached 9,000,000 in
1897	DATE	.

		Nor were the rates , or local taxes as we should call them , which amounted to nearly 5,000,000 , counted in the sum given for the last year .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	counts the educational fund from public grants , endowments , and other sources , for
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, at fully 20,000,000 an - nually ; and estimates that this sum will have to be considerably increased before existing wants are met .

		The title-page of '' Work and Play in Girls ' Schools '' suggests that the book is wholly the work of the three head-mistresses named , all of whom have at some time been members of the teaching staff of the Cheltenham Ladies ' Col - lege .

		But such is not the fact : many other writers have contributed to the volume .

		Nor are
Miss Soulsby	ORGANIZATION	and Miss Dove relatively prominent ; the one writes the section on the '' Moral Side of Education '' and the other that on the '' Cultivation of the Body . ''

		The veteran
Miss Beale	PERSON	is much the most abundant con - tributor to the book .

		The aim of the authors is to cover the whole field of girls ' education .

		Some of the pedagogy that it contains is rather antiquated , and some of the exercises recom - mended are useless ; but on the whole it is a book of solid value and breathes a wholesome spirit .

		It may be observed that
Miss Beale	PERSON	keeps her good old English faith in examinations un - shaken .

		She argues with old-time confidence , and with perfect truth that , provided examina - tions are rightly conducted , they are useful as a test of what we really know ; that preparation for them enables us to find out what are our permanent possessions ; that competitive exam - inations compel us to set these possessions in order and estimate their relative importance ; that examinations tend to produce presence of mind and mental self-control ; that they sup - press wordiness and abolish a florid style , and tend to make us feel the supreme importance of clearness and accuracy .

		All the current arguments against examinations that are now so popular are based on their abuses .

		It is generally agreed among scholars that no better university work in history is now any - where done than in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		This fact will give importance to the '' Introduction to the Study of History , '' quite apart from its intrinsic merits .

		MM .

		Langlois and Seignobos are lec - turers on history at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, and they give us in this book , as we understand the matter , the view of history and the general method of studying it that are now in favor at this cele - brated seat of learning .

		They intend to go to the bottom of things , as this paragraph from their preface will show : '' We propose to examine the conditions and the methods , to indicate the character and the limits , of his - torical knowledge .

		How do we ascertain , in respect of the past , what part of it is possible , what part of it is important , to know ?

		What is a document ?

		How are documents to be treated with a view to historical work ?

		What are historical facts ?

		How are they to be grouped to make history ?

		Whoever occupies himself with his - tory performs , more or less unconsciously , complicated operations of criticism and construction , of analysis and synthesis .

		But beginners , and the majority of those who have never reflected on the principles of historical methodology , make use , in the performance of these operations , of instinctive methods which , not being , in general , rational methods , do not usually lead to scien - tific truth .

		It is , therefore , useful to make known and logically justify the theory of the truly rational methods a theory which is now settled in some parts , though still incomplete in points of capital importance . ''

		The keynote of the work is that history is a science .

		Mr.
York Powell	PERSON	, in introducing it to English readers , strikes this note in this manner : '' It is not an historian 's question , for instance , whether
Napoleon	PERSON	was right or wrong in his conduct at
Jaffa	LOCATION	, or Nelson in his behavior at
Naples	LOCATION	; that is a matter for the student of ethic or the religious dogmatist to decide .

		All that the historian has to do is to get what conclusion
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 he can get out of the conflict of evidence , and to decide whether
Napoleon	PERSON	or Nelson actually did that of which their enemies accuse them , or , if he can not arrive at fact , to state probability , and the reasons that incline him to lean to the affirmative or to the negative . ''

		The meaning of this is that the historian is to look upon the actions of men just as the geolo - gist looks upon the eruptions of a volcano and the spouting of a hot
spring	DATE	. ''

		The historian very properly furnishes the ethical student with material , '' Mr.
Powell	PERSON	tells us further , '' though it is not right to reckon the ethical student 's judgment upon the historian 's facts as history in any sense . ''

		This ideal , we venture to say , is both false and impossible .

		The kind of man that
Napoleon	PERSON	or
Nelson	PERSON	was , is an historical question ; and neither one is to be studied as though he were an elemental non-moral force .

		That , no doubt , was
Napoleon	PERSON	's own view of the matter .

		The first duty of the historian , and one hitherto much neglected , is to get at the facts ; but , this done , he is to seek out their causes and interpretation .

		Moreover , the char - acter of the man himself is a factor in this sec - ondary process .

		Our authors have produced a strong book , and one that we gladly recom - mend to students and teachers of history ; but we protest that history is not one of the natural sciences .

		CURRENT THEATRICAL , CRITICISM .

		* It is not the custom of our dramatic critics to collect and publish their works .

		You may go into any well-appointed bookstore and ask for Mr.
Alan Dale	PERSON	's '' Life and the Stage , '' or Mr.
Franklin Fyles	PERSON	's '' Sunlight and Foot - lights , '' but you will not get them , for they do not exist .

		So many libraries consider it re - spectable to bind the ''
New York	LOCATION	Tribune '' that Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	's views will be always accessible ; and now that Mr.
Norman Hap	PERSON	- good has taken to the magazines , he is safe for immortality .

		But as a rule the press comments , even on our '' metropolitan '' stage , are breathed forth but once into the great expanse of news - paper readers , and after a day or so are as if they had never been .

		In other countries , men are more or less in the habit of publishing their theatrical criticism ; and this is a good thing , on the whole , for it dignifies the tone of criti - cism and of the stage as well .

		DRYDEN 'S ESSAYS ON THE DRAMA .

		Edited , with Notes , by
W. Strunk	PERSON	, Jr. .


New York	LOCATION	:
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		interest that Mr.
Dupont Syle	PERSON	should have broken the ice in the matter .

		* His '' Essays in Dramatic Criticism '' contain two different kinds of work , first , a number of essays on general dramatic subjects ; and second , several critical notices of current plays .

		It is curious , if nothing more , that the stage which forms the object of Mr.
Syle	PERSON	's criticism should be that of
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		That will explain the fact that of the fifteen plays that he speaks of , not a single one can really be said to be of any permanent interest .

		The best known of them are '' Trilby , '' '' Shore Acres , '' and '' The Geisha '' ; these , people have heard of and still remember ; the others were either never known at all or are now forgotten .

		Many , many people live in places Cone-night stands -RRB- where the ''
Opera House	ORGANIZATION	'' offers very few real attractions ; but few who have any dramatic possibilities at all have gazed on a list of plays of less interest to anybody except the inexperienced and the confirmed theatre-goer .

		Yet in this very fact -LRB- and I think that Mr.
Syle	PERSON	appreciates it perfectly -RRB- lies the chief interest of this book .

		Mr.
Syle	PERSON	is a pretty well equipped dramatic critic ; he has seen good acting here and abroad , he is a professor of literature and therefore familiar with the great dramatists , he has the disposition and reading of a critic .

		Now , if a competent critic happen to live in
San Francisco	LOCATION	-LRB- or near it -RRB- what is he to do ?

		Keep quiet ?

		Certainly not : let him criticize anything in sight .

		A good critic should be something like a good portrait-painter : he should work on the material at hand , and not always demand the brightest and best .

		Prob - ably the men that
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	and
Franz Hals	PERSON	painted would have seemed commonplace enough to us , at least some of them .

		A good critic will have something to say about almost anything .

		These criticisms , then , were very interesting to me , although I do not think that I should have cared much about the plays .

		I do not know that they would be interesting to every - body , for doubtless a great part of my interest might be called -LRB- with an unintentional double meaning -RRB- professional .

		Perhaps the general run of people would not care to read about plays that they have never seen and never wish to see and for which they care absolutely nothing .

		It may be so ; and yet Mr.
Syle	PERSON	has written well concerning them , written on a high plane , but * It seems hardly possible , in these days of republication , that no one should have done so before , so I am prepared to be wrong in this matter .

		But it is certainly an uncommon practice .

		120 -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, easily and quite without pedantry or conven - tionalism .

		I suppose it may be urged against these critiques that they are '' too literary . ''

		I think I have heard this expression used of dramatic crit - icism , although I am not at all sure that I know just what it means .

		Mr.
Syle	PERSON	rather lays him - self open to this allegation , for the first essays in the book -LRB- Essays as distinguished from Im - pressions -RRB- are undoubtedly '' literary '' in char - acter .

		The longest is an indication of the influence of
Moliere on Congreve	ORGANIZATION	and
Sheridan	PERSON	, good in itself , and perhaps rather better if it should lead anyone to carry on the inquiry and ask whether we can trace any influence of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and
Congreve	PERSON	and
Sheridan	PERSON	upon Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	.

		The four other essays are much shorter ; pleasant reading , but without much novelty of idea .

		The last may perhaps be excepted ;
Mr Syle	PERSON	, in comparing our stage with the Elizabethan drama , shows how several of the popular ele - ments of the latter , poetry , eloquence , history , have of late found better means of expression than the drama .

		So far he is quite right ; probably right also when he says that the chief distinctive element of the art of the present playwright is the construction of situation , and explains thus the popularity of the farce , wherein situation is the chief dependence .

		If this be so , however , I hardly follow Mr.
Syle	PERSON	in thinking that with a decrease in our present commercialism , the drama will again take to itself '' the poetical and ethical elements which we see flourishing in the works of the great playwrights . ''

		It may well be that in that millennium the drama will find that possession is nine points of the law .

		But to return to the criticism of contempo - rary plays .

		Whether the general reader be interested in such essays or not , it would be rather for the better , so far as the stage is con - cerned , if he were interested and if there were more such books as this .

		We have , nowadays , so many books anyway that a few more could at least do no harm .

		And books like this are in the way of doing good in so far as they tend to raise the tone of our theatrical criticism , both on the part of the critics and of play-goers as well .

		There is no doubt that , critics or not , people will keep on going to the theatre , and generally to see what they like .

		But there can be no doubt either that they will also continue to talk about the plays they have seen and therein find a great part of their pleasure .

		You buy a ticket and see a play ; but that is only the beginning of your good time .

		After the play there is always a fresh interchange of opinion or repartee at the theatre supper or in the street - car going home .

		Then for a week or so there is the constant , '' Have you seen this or that ? '' ''

		Well , my dear , what did you think of it ? ''

		`` Were n't the dresses , '' etc. , a sort of conversation which , independently of the weight of opinion expressed , is generally pleasant to the conversers .

		And then after - ward , for a longer or shorter time , there is the general impression left by a play and its acting , rarely taking definite form but usually present , the impression which does most -LRB- when anything at all is done -RRB- to influence taste and character .

		Everybody knows this , and yet nobody to speak of thinks much of it .

		With a book , a picture , a piece of music , we all think opinion is im - portant enough to be worth our attention .

		Ah , but these are opinions on the great books , the great pictures , the great music , not of mere contemporary appearances , .

		True enough ; but of the great plays as acted plays , we can never have anything but contemporary criticism .

		Hence , if we are going to have dramatic criti - cism at all , it must be from day to day , and just as it is worth while to have criticism of literature , painting , music , so it is worth while to have some criticism of the drama .

		Not that people may thus get the right opinions ready made and so know what to think , but that they may have a chance to form for themselves more definite ideas and standards than they can easily do now , when popular theatrical criticism is largely impromptu and a matter of accident .

		Let anyone think whether novel-reading would be as much fun as it is now had we never read any literary criticism ; whether paintings would be so absorbing to us if we had never read a word about the art of the great painters .

		And let anyone think , too , whether '' good music '' would not be more truly attractive to many if people ever read any musical criticism .

		Criti - cism of anything arouses interest ; it makes us notice what had before escaped notice ; it gives a chance for opinion either by agreement or disagreement ; it encourages thought .

		So I saw Mr.
Syle	PERSON	's book with pleasure , just as I see with pleasure the gradually increasing custom of publishing plays in real books .

		Both tend toward the creation of a more active , a sounder state of public opinion than we have now ; and this is the first thing necessary to having better plays and better acting .

		When people want the best , they will generally find a way to get it .

		A farther view of this book is suggested by
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 another , published a little while ago , namely ,
Dryden	PERSON	's '' Essays on the Drama , '' edited by
W. Strunk	PERSON	, Jr. .

		This is an excellent little book .

		It contains the essay '' Of Dramatic Poesy , '' the '' Defence '' of the Essay , and the essay '' Of Heroic Plays , '' with very good apparatus .

		Mr.
Strunk	PERSON	has done his work thoroughly ; he gives -LRB- besides the usual biographical facts and notes on style and allusions -RRB- a history of the discus - sion of which these essays were a part , an ac - count of
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	's sources and authorities , an index of plays cited , and , in his notes , a pretty constant comparison of
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	's opinions with the classics of criticism of his time .

		The book gives a good opportunity for an introduction to
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	's dramatic criticism .

		In the presence of a fairly definite body of dramatic criticism as you will find in
Drydeu	LOCATION	, one inclines to look to Mr.
Syle	PERSON	to see what are the principles on which his remarks rest .

		It is true that
Dryden	PERSON	's criticism was the criti - cism of a man who was more interested in writing plays than in seeing them acted .

		It is true also that he spent most of his energy upon the development of the action and on the ques - tion of rhyme ; and further , it will be allowed that
Dryden	PERSON	was in his criticism too much bound to precedent for the best results .

		Still , it is of interest to have bases of criticism , un - less you mean to have absolutely impressionistic criticism .

		Mr.
Syle	PERSON	does not give us impressionistic criticism : he gives what he calls '' impressions , '' but they are really more like opinions , judg - ments .

		Now , without differing especially with many of these opinions , I should much like to know the guiding principles . ''

		For instance , Mr.
Syle	PERSON	says , '' Constructively the play is well made '' -LRB- p. 94 -RRB- , although it afterwards appears that the first and fourth acts are the strong acts , while in the second and third acts '' there is nothing that one could not foresee after listening to the opening speeches . ''

		Else - where he says , '' It is a thousand pities that the author who could conceive such a character had not imagination enough to set it forth in truly poetic form '' -LRB- p. 104 -RRB- , whereas another play of apparently the same kind is at fault because its dialogue has not '' a shred of wit , humor , or anything but a surface observation of life '' -LRB- p. 94 -RRB- .

		I do not mean to be captious or hypercritical in calling attention to these remarks , but I find it hard to see from them just what kind of construction , what kind of dialogue , Mr.
Syle	PERSON	thinks good .

		If I did see , if I got at the fundamentals , I might improve my own ideas .

		I do not myself think that con - struction is very good which permits us to fore - see the end of an act from the beginning .

		I have not , as a rule , thought that we could ask for poetic charm in the presentation of the characters in a melodrama , nor much wit or humor in its dialogue .

		But if I have been wrong , it would surely be interesting to me to have some definite bases on which I could carry out a re-accommodation .

		But perhaps everyone -LRB- else -RRB- knows all about such things already .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		IDEALIST 'S IDEAS or EVIL .

		* Professor
Royce	PERSON	's latest book is a series of essays , more or less related to each other , and all bearing upon the general subject of Good and Evil .

		As might have been expected from the author 's previous works , his point of view is that of the ethical idealist .

		This does not mean that Professor
Royce	PERSON	is an idle dreamer , vaguely explaining away the essential differ - ences between right and wrong .

		On the con - trary , he looks facts squarely in the face and holds closely to the realities of everyday human life .

		He is an ethical idealist in that he inter - prets the universe as a realm whose significance lies in the ethical ideals which its processes realize .

		Of all the problems of life , none are more baffling and intricate than the one which per - tains to the existence of Evil .

		If God be good , why does He permit Evil ?

		is a question that in one form or another has perplexed every thoughtful being .

		It is the question which Professor
Royce	PERSON	attempts to answer .

		To put the matter in concrete form , he takes the case of Job as illustrating the experience of suffer - ing humanity .

		To Job , this world is the work of a Being who ought to be intelligent and friendly to righteousness .

		Yet this God seems at times to show himself just the reverse .

		What is the explanation ?

		After considering vari - ous familiar answers which have been given as solutions to the problem that Evil is but transient discipline , that without Evil there could be no free-will , that we see only in part and a complete view would justify the belief that Evil is but partial good , Professor
Royce	PERSON	gives his own interpretation .

		He regards Evil * STUDIES OF GOOD AND EVIL .

		122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, as a real fact , and holds that its existence is not only consistent with the perfection of the world , but is necessary for the very existence of that perfection .

		As the hero could never be hero without controlling fear and pain ; as the saint could never be saint without overcoming temp - tations to sin , so a knowledge of Good is possi - ble only as one knows Evil and subordinates it to the Good . ''

		If moral Evil were simply de - stroyed and wiped away from the external world , the knowledge of moral goodness would also be destroyed , '' is the language of Professor
Royce	PERSON	.

		This reminds one of St.
Thomas	PERSON	's fam - ous argument for the existence of God . ''

		It has been asked , '' says St.
Thomas	PERSON	, '' if there is a God , whence comes Evil ?

		We should rather conclude thus : If there is Evil there is a God , for Evil would have no existence with - out order in the Good , the privation of which is Evil .

		But there would not be this order if God did not exist . ''

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	holds that Job 's problem is insoluble upon Job 's presup - position , which is that God is an external creator and ruler , for in this case God is either cruel or helpless .

		Only when one regards God as the essence and fulness of all Being , abso - lutely one with humanity , suffering in its pain and triumphing in its victory , can there be any satisfactory solution of the problem .

		God is not the Infinite One beyond the finite imper - fections , but the being whose unity determines the very constitution , the tension and relative disharmony of the finite world , and so the ex - istence of Evil is not only consistent with the perfection of the universe , but is necessary for the very existence of that perfection .

		To the student of
Hegel	LOCATION	, this theory of the justification of Evil is not new ; nor does Pro- fessor
Royce	PERSON	offer it as such .

		The merit of the essay is that the most difficult of problems is handled in a clear and masterly way , and the solution given is in accordance with the views of some of the ablest thinkers of the present time .

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	again states his fundamental theory in an essay on ''
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Pessim	PERSON	- ism . ''

		He defends the position that ''
Locksley Hall	PERSON	Sixty Years After , '' although artistically inferior to the first ''
Locksley Hall	PERSON	, '' is ethi - cally higher , and , contrary to general opinion , far more satisfactory .

		The complaint is made by the author that while
Tennyson	PERSON	is one of the most devout of men , he gives as his ideal some - thing that can be realized only through a more or less complete separation from the world of con - crete life .

		The God in whom
Tennyson	PERSON	believes is a God that hides himself , or shows himself only on rare or romantic occasions to the devout .

		In no sense is he the God of the present .

		He is the God of the future .

		This is shown in the first ''
Locksley Hall	PERSON	. ''

		The young man is in the old romantic world on a quest for the ideal .

		He has nothing to do with the commonplace .

		His business is important , but vague and inde - scribable .

		Its prominent feature is that it takes him away from earthly relations to move forward , and neither he nor anyone else knows exactly where .

		This romantic idealism Pro- fessor
Royce	PERSON	claims leads eventually to pessim - ism ; and the pessimism of the second `` Locks - ley
Hall	PERSON	, '' so far as it is pessimistic , is the explicit statement of what is implied in the first .

		The thought is , Unless God is here , how do you know he is elsewhere ?

		Unless the present has divine meaning , What proof is there of a far-off divine event ?

		It is the recognition of this thought , and the absence of a vain roman - ticism , that gives a value to the later poem .

		For here
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	recognizes that if this is God 's world , then these struggles , sins , striv - ings , and loves must be the expression of God 's will : a truth which
Browning	PERSON	repeats over and over again .

		Like various other forms of Evil , pessimism is not to be regarded as a final ill .

		On the contrary , '' the best man is the one who can see the truth of pessimism , can absorb and transcend that truth , and can be nevertheless an optimist , not by virtue of his failure to recognize the evil of life , but by virtue of his readiness to take part in the struggle against this evil . ''

		One of the most interesting , as well as most original , of thes ' e essays is '' The Case of
John Bunyan	PERSON	. ''

		The religious experiences of the great writer , as given in his remarkable Con - fessions , '' Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners , '' are summarized by Professor
Royce	PERSON	, and then interpreted , not in terms of the soul and its relation to God , but in the language of the latest school of empirical psychology .

		The story of
Bunyan	PERSON	's religious life offers a rare object-lesson to the student of normal and ab - normal mental processes .

		Bunyan was what psychologists would call a good visualizer .

		He was also an expert in the dialectics of the inner life , and a born genius as to the whole range of language functions , good and bad .

		Describing his early youth , he tells us that he frequently felt himself tempted to curse and swear , or speak some grievous thing against God .

		These and other insistent morbid impulses such as wavering hopes , gloomy doubts and question -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		123 ings , all of which
Banyan	ORGANIZATION	subsumes under the name Tempter are more or less inhibited by other automatic mental processes , the result of a close study of the scriptures ; for a text con - demning or encouraging was sure to come to his mind whenever the oath came to his lips or the doubt to his consciousness .

		A chaos of motor processes was the result .

		Noting these and similar trains of morbid association , Pro- fessor
Royce	PERSON	follows them through their various stages , as reported in the wonderfully clear and definite autobiography , marking the corre - spondence between periods of low physical con - dition and certain religious depressions .

		Finally the great change came , when , under a skilful self-imposed mental regimen ,
Bunyan	PERSON	had no return of the more deeply systemized disorders , although always a prey to elementary insistent temptations and depressions .

		The study of
Bunyan	PERSON	's Case is of value as typical of morbid processes which have gone on in many brains less exalted than that of
Bunyan	PERSON	without
Buu	PERSON	- yan 's power of vivid description .

		While Pro- fessor
Royce	PERSON	has chosen to state the case in psychological terms , he is careful to say that this does not in any wise impair its worth as an ethical study ; for the problem to
Bunyan	PERSON	was one of moral struggle , a struggle in which he came out victorious , recognizing in his victory the value of the Tempter as well as the Com - forter .

		The remaining essays in the volume bear upon other aspects of the relation of Good and Evil , and serve to illustrate the author 's funda - mental theory that Evil is essential to the real - ization of Good ; that it is the living strife in the midst of which and by which God main - tains Himself in the world .

Loire	LOCATION	.

		We are compelled to say that '' Ashes of Empire '' is distinctly the poorest , as ''
Lorraine	PERSON	'' is distinctly the best , of the three books thus far published .

		The author 's inven - tion seems to be flagging , and his sentimentalism to have become exaggerated .

		Still , the gift of romantic story-telling is his in so marked a degree that one may derive a good deal of pleasure from the new book , which begins with the news of Sedan and the escape of the Empress , tells the pitiful story of the siege , and ends with the entry of the victorious Prussians into the capital .

		Meanwhile , we are made to realize by ominous mutterings the gather - ing of the storm soon thereafter to break in the
Commune	ORGANIZATION	, of which Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	has already written in '' The Red Republic . ''

		Upon a previous occasion , in speaking of these books , we have had to regret the author 's propensity to disfigure them by the introduction of caricatures of some of the best of Frenchmen .

		But the prejudices hitherto made manifest in the treatment of
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	and
Gambetta	PERSON	and Hugo seem feeble in comparison with that now excited by
Renan	PERSON	, who is caricatured in the present volume so offensively that one feels nothing but disgust for a novelist who could so per - * ASHES OF EMPIRE .

		124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, vert the truth .

		This blot so darkens '' The Ashes of Empire '' that its real merits are likely to he overlooked . ''

		The Road to
Paris	LOCATION	'' is a long one , if we take the new romance by Mr.
R. N. Stephens	PERSON	for a guide and cicerone .

		The story begins at
Culloden	LOCATION	with the flight into exile of the hero 's father .

		The hero himself is born in the wilds of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, in time to grow up into a Revolutionary soldier , and take part in the fray on
Bunker	ORGANIZATION	's Hill .

		He then , after escaping from imprisonment , joins the expedition to
Quebec	LOCATION	, and makes the long march through
Maine	LOCATION	to the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	.

		In
Quebec	LOCATION	he appears as a spy , escapes detention , and gets carried away to
England	LOCATION	as a prisoner of war under the supposition that he is somebody else .


Ethan Allen	PERSON	is one of his fellow-prisoners upon this unwilling voyage .

		Escaping from his English prison , he becomes in turn a strolling juggler , a gardener 's assistant , and a fine gentleman of the town in Bath and
London	LOCATION	.


Newgate	ORGANIZATION	,
Vauxhall	ORGANIZATION	, and Hyde Park all make his acquaintance , and , after a surprising series of intrigues and adventures , he finds his way across the Channel in a smuggling boat , and seems at last to be really upon the road to
Paris	LOCATION	, the goal of his boyhood 's ambition .

		But before he enters the city , he becomes engrossed in a sentimental episode with the precocious young daughter of Necker -LRB- who was afterwards to become the author of '' Corinne '' -RRB- , and is also unwillingly mixed up in an organized plot for the assassination of that famous Minister .

		In consequence of all this , our hero 's first entrance into
Paris	LOCATION	makes him a guest of the
Bastille	LOCATION	, where he languishes in captivity for a year or so .


Escap	ORGANIZATION	- ing again -LRB- he always escapes -RRB- , he makes his adven - turous way into
Germany	LOCATION	, and becomes a personage at the court of
Hesse-Cassel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here he takes part in a conspiracy against the
Landgraf	PERSON	, barely escapes with his life , and carries off his lady-love in triumph to
Paris	LOCATION	, which he really enters at last in the fashion to be desired .

		The lady in the case , it should be added , has figured in his life both in
New England	LOCATION	and in
Quebec	LOCATION	, so we know she is bound to appear at the end and make his story all that a romance should be .

		Here , indeed , is a tangled skein of ad - venturous experiences , and the reader hardly knows , when all is over , whether to admire the more the author 's easy and animated narrative manner , or the astonishing ingenuity displayed by him in mak - ing so many historical scenes and situations take part in the shaping of the hero 's destiny .

		Mr.
Elwyn Barron	PERSON	, who some years ago left
America	LOCATION	for an English sojourn of indefinite dura - tion , is now favorably recalled to the memory of his old circle of readers by what may fairly be called one of the most charming novels of the sea - son . ''

		Manders '' is a Europeanized production , almost as much so as the later stories of Mr.
Henry Harland	PERSON	, which it somehow suggests , and it strik - ingly illustrates , when compared with Mr.
Barren	PERSON	's earlier writing , the broadening influences of life in the great centres of European civilization .

		Manders is the name of a little boy , and he is ostensibly the hero of the story , but in fact he interests us less than his widowed mother a professional model in the
Quarter	DATE	and her vacillating but not unsym - pathetic lover , an American art student of ample means .

		Mr.
Barren	PERSON	's success with his heroine is akin to Du Manner 's success with a certain girl whom we need not name : it is the successful por - trayal of a woman who remains pure at heart amid surroundings that at least are not encouraging to purity .

		There is also an American heroine of pro- nounced and attractive type , besides the necessary complement of minor characters .

		The author has shown much skill in realizing these figures for us , besides doing it in a style that is excellent on its own account .

		He has a form of expression that is crisp and effective , subtly humorous upon occasion , but always ready to rise to the demands of a seri - ous situation .

		The book is not exactly a strong one , but it is exceptionally pleasing , and it rings true .

		As every reader of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's books is aware , the stories that they tell can not possibly be retold in abstract . ''

		The Associate Hermits '' is no exception to this rule , and an outline of its plot would give no notion whatever of the quaint humor , the nov - elty of situation , and the general whimsicality , which make this book a worthy companion of its many predecessors .

		About the only idea that can be de - tached without losing its essential flavor is the one with which the story opens the idea of a newly - wedded couple who , instead of starting on a wed - ding journey themselves , persuade the parents of the bride to do it for them .

		This is as Stocktonian a notion as can be ; to tell what follows shall be his affair , not ours .

		Two historical romances which stand rather above the usual level of merit have for their subject the War of
1812	DATE	.

		Mr.
George Rivers	PERSON	, the author of `` The Count 's Snuff-Box , '' has taken the episode of the
Henry	PERSON	letters for a starting-point , and the '' Count '' of the title-page is the imposter who posed as one
Edward de Grill	ORGANIZATION	on upon that critical occa - sion .

		Mr.
Rivers	PERSON	supplements what is known his - torically of that imposter by embellishments of the usual romantic sort , and makes an agreeable story of the whole affair .

		The scene is laid partly on the shore of
Buzzard	ORGANIZATION	's Bay and partly in
Washington	LOCATION	, the burning of the capital by a horde of British ruf - fians affording a thrilling climax to the work .

		The burning of
Washington	LOCATION	also appears in '' A Herald of the West , '' by Mr.
Joseph Altsheler	PERSON	, but midway in this case , for the
Battle of New Orleans	ORGANIZATION	provides the climax .

		Mr.
Altsheler	PERSON	's book is more closely historical than the one before mentioned , and those who have read his two earlier romances of American history do not need to be told that he is a writer of real power .

		In these days , which are witnessing a recementation of the ties that should and must bind together the English-speaking peo - ples , we are apt to forget how real were the griev - ances that brought on the War of
1812	DATE	.

		These the author recalls to us in plain terms , with perhaps just
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 125 a touch of the bitterness that should by this time have disappeared altogether , but certainly with no harboring of the old rancor .

		The story is well-knit , varied of interest , thrilling upon occasion , and dis - tinctly to be praised . ''

		Exiled for Lese Majeste ' '' is a taking title for a book , and when a glance at the pages shows it to be a story of .

		Russian despotism and imprisonment in
Siberia	LOCATION	, a certain pleasurable anticipation is aroused .

		Bat the expectation is doomed to disap - pointment upon further examination , for the story proves but a tenuous thread upon which the author hangs a heavy burden of miscellaneous information concerning all subjects under the sun -LRB- and others -RRB- .

		Interminable conversations of a semi-didactic sort are the substance of the book , while the romantic interest is lost like a rivulet in the desert .

		We can - not help being amused at the audacity of the writer in making his characters discuss -LRB- in the time of
Nicholas	PERSON	that is , in the early fifties -RRB- such subjects as Darwinism and the marvellous growth of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and quote from
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's Omar and the later poems of
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		No such trifling matter as an anachronism is going to stand in the way of this writer 's fancy ; if he wishes to point a moral , he is evidently not to be deterred by any consideration of what the mere facts will justify . ''

		With Bought Swords '' is a Spanish-American romance of revolution and intrigue , in which the author has by no means ma ` de the most of his mate - rials .

		The effect is too sketchy to be in any way impressive .

		Over and over again , situations that might have been worked up excitingly are merely hinted at , and one follows the story with some dif - ficulty .

		We fear that this book must be character - ized as a bit of amateurish effort undeserving of serious attention .

		Those who expected the new novel by ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	'' to be a work of such elaborate interest as '' My Lady Nobody '' or '' God 's Fool '' will be disappointed .

		It is so long since the author last came before the public that such an expectation was reasonable , but instead of fulfilling it , he now pre - sents us with what is little more than a sketch .

		The book is called '' Her Memory , '' and is the study of a man 's sorrow when bereft of a beloved wife , and left to face an existence made solitary save by the presence of the little girl who is left him .

		How the passionate soul of the man rebels , and how the first poignancy of grief gradually becomes tempered into endurance , how the lives of both father and child develope under the influence of the tender memory that remains to them , and how existence in the end comes once more to take on its wonted aspect ; all these things are imparted to our sympathies rather than to our intellect by the writer 's graceful art .

		Few novelists have so marked a temperament as this Anglicized Dutchman of genius , and the tempera - ment is such as to suggest
Thackeray	PERSON	in more than one way , although there is back of it no such wealth of intellectual resource as was possessed by the author of '' Vanity Fair '' and ''
Henry Esmond	PERSON	. '' ''

		Her Memory '' is a welcome visitor to our table , but we can not help wishing that it were ampler in dimen - sions and richer in content . ''

		In any case this tale has no claim to be called a historical novel , '' says Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	in a note appended to '' The Battle of the Strong . ''

		We shall take the liberty of qualifying this assertion to a certain extent .

		Admitting the fact that the char - acters concerned are wholly the creations of the author , it must yet be said that a novel may be historical even if no actor on the stage of actual history treads its boards .

		The setting must be taken into account , the manners and customs depicted , the truthfulness to the larger historical facts of the period and the place concerned .

		In these particu - lars , the book is a historical novel in a high and fine sense , just as
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's '' Les Mise ` rables '' is a historical novel , and would remain one without its description of the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		There are more reasons than one for the suggestion , in the present connection , of the great French masterpiece .

		It is made inevitable by the fact that Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's book is a romance of
Jersey	LOCATION	, for no one may write of the
Channel Islands	ORGANIZATION	without suggesting the writer who lived among them during nearly twenty years ' voluntary exile .

		There are , furthermore , among Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's pages not a few which in manner , in epic breadth of treatment , and in poetic envisage - ment of an impressive scene or situation , constantly recall to the mind this or that page of '' Quatre-Vingt - Treize '' and '' Les Travailleurs de la Mer . ''

		Nor is the comparison an unworthy one , for Mr.
Parker	PERSON	here approves himself to be of the great race of story - tellers , and has produced a work that must be reck - oned among the masterpieces of recent fiction .

		The scene is
Jersey	LOCATION	, for the most part , although an im - portant section of the romance takes us to the Duchy of
Bercy	LOCATION	, and the time that of the Revolution .

		The island itself remains almost undisturbed during these stormy years , but echoes from
Paris	LOCATION	, and La Vende'e , and the high seas where English and French are pitted against each other , reach the scene from time to time , and bring the action into relief against an impressive historical background .

		Still , its inter - est , which runs the entire gamut from the lightest comedy to the deepest tragedy , is essentially domes - tic , and concerns the lives of a few Jerseymen and
Jerseywomen	PERSON	.

		Among these the heroine ,
Guida de Landresse	PERSON	, shines like a star in the purity of her womanhood , and about her are grouped three men who love her one less than his ambition , another with a too dumb and dog-like devotion , a third , to whose life her gracious presence gives renewed no - bility of purpose , and who wins her in the end , after she has sounded all the depths of grief , and felt to the full the chastening influence of suffering .

		The story is one in which strength and sweetness are so subtly commingled that each intensifies the other .

		Mr.
Parker	PERSON	has made judicious use of a vast amount of material collected for his work .

		The history , the customs , the dialect , the folk-lore , and the insti - tutions of the island are drawn upon most effectively .

		126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, and when the climax is reached , it is an ancient legal formula that provides the keynote to an intensely dramatic situation .

		When the wronged
Guida	PERSON	appeals for justice to the Cour d'He * ritage , it is with the old Norman cry :
Haro	PERSON	, haro !

		a Paide , mon Prince , on me fait tort !

		The effect , as con - trived by Mr.
Parker	PERSON	, is simply overwhelmning .

		We might go on almost indefinitely in praising this book which is an advance upon even '' The Seats of the Mighty '' but enough has been said to make it clear that here is a work to be reckoned with , and to persuade our readers of the pleasure that is in store for them .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	has written so many novels that some of them must be poorer than the others , and there is no doubt that '' The Changeling '' is one of the least successful of them all .

		It is more discursive than usual , more obviously artificial , and has more resort to situations and coincidences of the kind that strain the credulity .

		It tells of a mother who , losing her infant child , seeks to spare its father the grief of the loss by putting another child in the vacant place .

		How this sin finds her out after many years , and how the history of the substituted child proves heredity to be stronger than environment , are the two main themes of this story , which is rather bewildering in its complications , and unim - pressive in its outcome .

		A few months ago , we noticed an extraordinary romance entitled '' The Lake of Wine , '' by Mr.
Bernard Capes	PERSON	.

		It will possibly be remembered that this title was derived from the fanciful name of a great ruby , for the discovery and possession of which many men ventured -LRB- and some of them lost -RRB- their lives .

		In reading '' The Adventurers , '' by Mr.
Marriott Watson	PERSON	, we find the same story , in its gen - eral outline , retold .

		The treasure in this case is gold and not jewels , but otherwise the similarity is strik - ing .

		There is an ancient country house in
England	LOCATION	, and the treasure which it conceals is eagerly con - tended for by the owner of the house and the des - perate gang of cutthroats who have learned of its existence .

		In both cases , also , the hiding-place of the treasure is as unknown to the one party as to the other .

		The chief difference is in the style of the two narratives , for that of '' The Adventurers '' is as plain and straightforward as that of '' The Lake of Wine '' is affected and tortuous .

		It is a rather daring thing , for either writer , thus to have framed in the setting of the nineteenth century conditions in a civilized country an action so full of lawlessness and bloody violence that it belongs rather to
Turkey	LOCATION	or to the sixteenth century .

		The story is certainly interesting , and its plot is most ingeniously contrived .

		In '' The Red Axe , '' Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	departs from his wonted scenes and his well-worn Scots , to write of the robber barons of mediaeval
Germany	LOCATION	.

		For once , he has for us no moss-hags and no stern Cov - enanters , but instead , Gothic towers and ruthless bands of the rough riders of several centuries ago .

		The book is very '' bluggy . ''

		The hero is the son of the hereditary justiciar to the Dukes of the
Wolf	LOCATION	- mark , and is himself called upon , in the due course of events , to take up the axe of the executioner .

		Thrills occur upon nearly every page of this story , which is so swift in its action that one gasps for breath in trying to keep up with it .

		There is a love - story , too , as tender as any that the author has imagined , and , altogether , the book affords much exciting entertainment .

		. ''

		.

		f ''
Grace O'Malley	PERSON	, Princess and Pirate '' is surely a fetching title , and the covers of the book add pic - torial effect to verbal by a poster-portrait of the heroine .

		The story turns out to be a wild history of love and revenge in
Elizabethan Ireland	LOCATION	, with the historical figure of the
Earl of Desmond	ORGANIZATION	set among those drawn by the writer from his imagina - tion .

		The story is related in the first person , and with the usual affectation of an archaic form of speech .

		But , despite the author 's endeavor , his book is a rather dull one , and he misses the romantic touch of which such men as Mr.
Bloundelle-Burton	PERSON	, for instance , know the secret so well .

		The '' Adventures of the Comte de la Muette dur - ing the Reign of Terror '' is an interesting romance of a rather conventional sort , which tells how an aristocrat , by means of disguise , escaped massacre , and how he also saved the life of a fair aristocratic damsel , who naturally became his wife when their adventures were over .

		It is a picturesque and thrilling narrative , with the proper infusion of sen - timent , studied from the memoirs of the period , and told with considerable dramatic effect .

		Mr.
Bloundelle-Burton	PERSON	is rapidly taking the place , if he has not already taken it , that clearly belongs to him among writers of historical romance .

		Few , if any , of his living fellow-workers in this field have a finer sense of the requirements of this form of fiction , or a better equipment for its production .

		In '' The Scourge of God , '' he has taken for his theme the Huguenot persecutions that followed the Revo - cation .

		The scene is laid among the
CeVennes	LOCATION	, and the desolation wrought in that fair region by the Most Christian King 's endeavor to stamp out a pestilent heresy is pictured with vivid and terrible effect .

		The monarch who was so justly called the '' Scourge of God '' does not appear personally in these pages , and the `` femme funeste et terrible '' at whose behest he acted appears only in two brief scenes ; but , in a certain sense , these two personages dominate the history , and their figures ever loom up in the background of the imagination .

		The story is one of the best in style , construction , information , and graphic power , that have been written in recent years .

		THE DIAL Libr = 127 BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		New England There are some things that would letters and lead one to keep separate in the
New England	LOCATION	life .

		mind Mr > W > C > Lawton 's '' New England Poets '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and Mrs.
Harriet H. Robinson	PERSON	's `` Loom and Spindle '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The latter book will be of value to the economist and the historian : Mr.
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	, who contri - butes an Introduction , adds his authority on this point .

		The former , as will be inferred by the read - ers of Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	's recent book on Homer , will be useful mainly to the literary student .

		But the two books came to us at the same time , and they con - nect themselves in our mind .

		Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	's book is a good statement of the position and the work of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and
Holmes	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Robinson	PERSON	's is a very interest - ing account of the life and characteristics of the
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	mill-girls half a century ago .

		Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	, as one may see from his title , emphasizes the idea that these poets were
New England	LOCATION	poets : that their lives and work was conditioned by their being born and living in
New England	LOCATION	.

		Now , New En - gland in the middle of this century was certainly not all factory-life in
Lowell	LOCATION	, and yet the change is not very severe from
Lucy Larcom	PERSON	's ''
New England	LOCATION	Girlhood '' to Dr.
Edward Everett Kale	PERSON	's ''
New England	LOCATION	Boyhood . ''

		It is not that
Emerson	PERSON	and
Holmes	PERSON	, for instance , were of the stock of which mill-hands were made .

		But the old families from which they sprang never held themselves very far above the old families from which the mill-girls came , and in very many forms of thought and modes of feeling they never separated themselves at all .

		Everywhere the same church , the same school , the same town-meeting served for both , and much the same careers were open to both .

		The Brahmin caste was really not a caste , properly speaking , at all , for it never shunned communion with others .

		Of course these poets were of the picked New En - gland stock , picked over in some cases for genera - tions .

		That is true ; but who picked them , and for whom were they picked ?

		Who was it that was to understand them , who did understand them , if it comes to that ?

		Not more the mill-girls of
Lowell	PERSON	than the students of
Harvard	LOCATION	, doubtless ; but who were they ?

		The old
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	factory-life is especially interesting because particular circumstances gave the opportunity for presenting in great purity the type of
New England	LOCATION	, the worker , the worshipper , the lover of the things of the mind .

		This is seen in Mrs.
Robinson	PERSON	's book , which is of these two the more interesting , for it deals with matters which are to the most of us half familiar ; it opens a door into the past , as
Lowell	PERSON	says , into a room that we have heard of but never entered ; it tells us of a life eminently characteristic and now wholly passed away .

		But its interest , to us at least , is greatly heightened by the fact that it enables us to read the other book so much more understandingly .

		We rather wish that Mr.
Lawton	PERSON	had been able to read it before writing his own book .

		It makes one under - stand , better than before , all the six that he writes of except
Hawthorne	PERSON	, and perhaps even
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		They are rightly called ''
New England	LOCATION	'' poets .

		But what is , or rather was ,
New England	LOCATION	?

		That is something which we need not try to say just here .

		There are a hundred books to answer those that can not remember , but the list will not be complete until it includes Mrs.
Robinson	PERSON	's simple record of a phase long gone forever .


France	LOCATION	as
France	LOCATION	to-day , convulsed by the elucidated by Dreyf us matter , presents a curious , the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	case .

		a humiliating , yet a not altogether hopeless spectacle of national retrogression : curious to the social pathologist , humiliating to the opti - mistic champion of free institutions , not altogether , or indeed by any means , hopeless to those who understand the transient and superficial character of these periodic outbreaks of French , or per - haps more accurately speaking , Parisian hysteria .

		Broadly speaking , the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	case and the popular hallucinations attending it are the result of the momentary ascendency of forces which the Revolu - tion overthrew but unhappily could not extirpate .

		There were diseased parts in the national body which the rude and sometimes misapplied surgery of the soi-disant regenerators of
France	LOCATION	failed to cut away , and which could not have been quite cut away by far more skilful operators .

		Now a portion of the poisonous virus has worked its way to the surface ; and the civilized world looks on in amaze - ment at the spectacle of Jesuitry , bigotry , caste - tyranny , working their infamous will on an innocent man , quite as in the days of Galas and La Barre ; while a populace that a decade ago celebrated the centenary of the fall of the
Bastille	LOCATION	stands by ap - plauding and supporting the outrage .

		Unhappily , there is now no Voltaire to smite the evil .

		But the mind of
France	LOCATION	is saner and her conscience more sensitive than in the days when the `` intellectuals '' of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's century fought the battle against the foes of right and reason that
M. Zola	PERSON	and his col - leagues are fighting to-day ; and there is good ground of hope that Frenchmen are even now shaking off the degrading hallucination that condemns the un - happy
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	and the heroic
Picquart	PERSON	to shame and torture , while the reptilian Esterhazy and the monstrous Drumont go unwhipt of justice .

		If there be to-day any rational being , outside of
France	LOCATION	, who is still unconvinced of the fact that
Esterhazy	PERSON	is the man who ought to be where
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	is , that he is the writer of the bordereau and the seller to the German attache of the military secrets therein listed , we earnestly commend to him Mr.
F. C. Conybeare	PERSON	's concise and conclusive little book entitled `` The Dreyfus Case '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		Through the presentation of documents , facsimiles of handwriting , etc. , and through its well-marshalled history of the successive stages and phases of the case , it puts beyond the shadow of a doubt the facts of the innocence of
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	and the guilt of Esterhazy .

		The volume 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, is well furnished with portraits of the chief actors in this remarkable cause cSlebrb , beginning with the noble
Picquart	PERSON	-LRB- one of the brightest names in the annals of contemporary

Scotland	LOCATION	that may be quoted here as suggesting a useful ideal not , we think , kept so fully in view as it should be in the great educational foundations of our own country : '' It is the glory of our Scottish universities that they have never been made places of education for a class , that no costly arrangements render access to them possible only for the rich , and that when once he has crossed their doors a young man finds himself in a community where intellectual resource is the only wealth that wins re - spect , brain power the only power that tells , and where honor and distinction await the ablest and worthiest , and await these alone . ''

		This special tribute which
Principal Caird	ORGANIZATION	felt in conscience justified in paying to the universities of his own country applies , we think , with equal justice to those of
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		That any superiorities other than those of mind and character should , in an institution of learning , be the marks of its acknowledged aris - tocracy , seems anomalous enough ; but we fear the anomaly is not unknown in republican
America	LOCATION	.

		Educators especially should find these sane and earnest addresses useful and stimulating .

		The recent ^ e COn ^ e88 we ^ n < ^ ^ ` tle in Mr.
G. W.	PERSON	bloody business

Kitchener	LOCATION	to

Sudan	LOCATION	.

		tum -LRB- D o dd -RRB- that seems to us to justify the lavish encomiums heaped upon it by the higher class of English reviews .

		We can easily see why the ordinary newspaper should laud Mr.
Stee	PERSON	- ven 's book to the skies ; for it contains just the sort of '' hot stuff '' that the ordinary newspaper has been for the past year or so especially desirious of get - ting , and would have at almost any price .

		If war should break out to-morrow -LRB- which God forbid ! -RRB-

		the enterprising owners of our '' live up-to-date '' newspapers might well put Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	's book into the hands of the '' bright young men '' they pro- posed sending to the front , and say to them : '' This is the kind of thing we want . ''

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	's book , in fine , is a clever and well-spiced piece of war-time reporting , made in a hurry on the spot and meant for immediate home consumption : but it is nothing more than that .

		Its vogue with the British public is easily explained .

		The Sirdar is just now the British public 's especial hero , and Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	tells what he did and lauds him without stint or reserva - tion for doing it ; the British public , too , is for the first time in a quarter of a century or more unques - tionably in a fighting mood , and Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	's battle-pictures give it much the same sort of grati - fication that our own public gets from '' kineto - scope '' views of the more crucial and historic pugi - listic events .

		Reading Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	's cheery and often even jocular account of the
Sudan	LOCATION	campaign is almost as good -LRB- or as bad -RRB- as seeing the thing itself .

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	has the knack of describing things vividly , and we do n't mean to carp at him for giving his employers and the public their money 's worth of gore and grewsomeness .

		But he might , it would seem , without loss of cash or credit , have written less flippantly , and with a more apparent sense of the fact that this tragic , if perhaps una - voidable ,
Sudan	LOCATION	business this scientific butchery of a half-armed mob of half-savage religionists is a dark and deplorable episode in the history of the territorial conquests of Western civilization .

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	, we are glad to note , appears to recog - nize the fact that , when the day of
Omdurman	LOCATION	was done , the palm of valor lay , not -LRB- broadly speaking -RRB- with the men who had been behind , but with those who had been before , the guns .

		The volume is supplied with maps and plans , and serves to convey a tolerably good idea of
General Kitchener	ORGANIZATION	's meth - ods of dealing with the problem his predecessors had so egregiously failed to solve .

		Probably there is but one religious Parochial history f oundation j n t hi s country whose his - extraordinary .

		* ... tory , adequately told , would require more than a duodecimo volume of three or four hundred pages .

		That one is the
Parish of Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	,
New York City	LOCATION	.

		It is a notable parish in many respects .

		Its annals are closely connected with those of the city in which it exists .

		The du - ties and responsibilities of its rector are greater than those of some of the bishops .

		It celebrated its bicentennial in
1897	DATE	, and the elegant volume set - ting forth the proceedings in the nine churches com - prised in this immense city parish seems to have whetted the appetite of the parishioners for more history .

		So records running back to the
early years of the seventeenth century	DATE	have been ransacked , and the Rev. Dr.
Dix	PERSON	, Rector , has begun the prepa -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 129 ration of a complete history of the parish .

		The result thus far is a royal octavo volume of over 500 pages , bringing the narrative down to
1783	DATE	, that is to say , down to the close of the Revolutionary War and the opening of the history of the parish under new ecclesiastical relations .

		All this is given with the promise of an indefinite number of volumes in the future to bring the history down to the pres - ent time .

		The history is considerably more than a transcript of musty records .

		It contains some val - uable contributions to general history .

		The author -LRB- who , because the task of research was necessarily committed to others , modestly claims to be merely an editor -RRB- is not a thresher of old straw .

		He pur - sues an independent course , corrects some errors which have crept into general history , notably con - cerning the character of Governor
Fletcher	PERSON	and that of Leisler ; and even corrects errors into which he confesses himself to have been drawn in previous historical writings .

		The volume is handsomely printed , and illustrated with full-page portraits and facsimiles of documents .

		The publishers -LRB-
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- announce that 750 copies of this edition have been printed for sale .

		A volume on '' The Rivers of
North America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is offered mod - estly by its author ,
Professor Israel C. Russell of the University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, as a '' read - ing lesson for students '' of physiography or geology .

		It proves to be a well-digested thesis upon the effects of rivers in fashioning the surfaces of the regions where they are generated or through which they flow .

		Each drop of aerial water does its work , infinitesimal though it may be .

		With its fellows , it takes certain substances into solution ; others it holds in suspension ; manifold more it pushes along , as , in obedience to gravity , it pursues its devious way toward a distant sea , ever wearing the chan - nels through which it flows .

		Even if , sooner or later , it should be lifted again by evaporation , it will have contributed something , if it be only to lay down in another place the atom which its solvent power seized elsewhere .

		In time , such drops will have carved the mountains , filled and seamed the valleys , eroded the canons , and transformed all the contours of the earth 's surface ; in time , no coun - teracting upheaval occurring , they will have re - moved all elevations , and restored old ocean 's vast and solitary reign .

		Professor
Russell	PERSON	's logical and lucid treatment of his subject makes his '' reader '' attractive for both scientist and layman .

		Another volume from the same publishers , `` Earth Sculp - ture , '' by Professor
James Geikie	PERSON	of the
University of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	, describes the configuration of the earth 's surface as the resultant of every variety of physical activity , whether working internally or externally .

		The work includes the results of the latest geological surveys , notably those within the western half of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The author has addressed the great body of intelligent readers not professionally versed in geology .

		Scrap-book M.rs .


Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer	PERSON	's of the French , '' Scrap-Book of the French Revolu - Revoiuiion .

		tion -LRB- Mc ci U rg -RRB- is made up of ma - terial gotten together by the author in the course of her work as a lecturer on the French Revolution .

		The book is frankly a compilation , and as such it has the distinctive merit that its contents are to a considerable extent drawn from unfamiliar and comparatively inaccessible sources .

		Of especial interest are the excerpts from the series of mono - graphs on the events of the Revolution published in the
Paris	LOCATION	'' Figaro '' during the years
1893	DATE	,
1894	DATE	, and
1895	DATE	.

		The volume opens with some rather interesting reminiscences of an American ,
Thomas Waters Griffith	PERSON	, who resided in
Paris	LOCATION	from
1791	DATE	to
1799	DATE	, and was an eye-witness of many dra - matic Revolutionary episodes .

		He saw , for instance , both
Louis XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		and his unhappy consort passing through the streets on their way to the scaffold the former in '' court-like dress '' in '' a handsome coach , '' the latter in '' a common cart '' like an or - dinary malefactor , and attracting comparatively little attention from the populace .

		It is greatly to be regretted that Mr.
Griffith	PERSON	was not a keener ob - server , or , at least , that he did not more fully realize the great historical and dramatic interest of the remarkable scenes he skims over so carelessly in his too cursory narrative .

		Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	's book contains a good deal of curious , suggestive reading , and deserves its popularity .

		There are twenty-nine portraits in half-tone , including an interesting one of the Rev.
Eleazer Williams	PERSON	, the alleged `` lost Dauphin , '' whose singular story is given in the closing chapters on '' Louis XVII . ''

		Mr.
A. G. Newcomer	PERSON	is one of those professors of rhetoric who believe that a writer should consider first what he would say , and only when that is settled should he consider what particular words to use .

		This obvious view is not common among our writers on rhetoric , although Mr.
Newcomer	PERSON	's '' Elements of Rhetoric '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- is by no means the only book in recent years which has been based upon it .

		The older writers Professor Bain , for instance , or Professor
A. S. Hill	PERSON	prefer to begin with a study of words .

		The latter especially did great things in the cause of diction .

		Their influence has been such that most people -LRB- even in college faculties -RRB- think that there is no rhetorical fault worse than misspell - ing or bad grammar : such , at least , are the only faults ever mentioned .

		The newer practise is really not new : it has the authority of every rhetorician who ever put pen to paper , from the days of Korax and Tisias down to the time that Dr.
George Camp	PERSON	- bell , with his speculations on Good Usage , knocked the classical rhetoric into a cocked-up hat , so far as authority was concerned .

		We do not mean that Mr.
Newcomer	PERSON	is a neo-Aristotelian , or any other such creature : his earlier book , which had some - thing to do in bringing about the change of heart that is gradually taking place , was a very simple '' The New Rhetoric . ''

		It said nothing about Aris - totle : but then , it had nothing of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	either .

		The present work , founded on the right theory , and the result of individual work of some years on the right lines , has a great deal in it that is direct and practical .

		We are glad to see it , and hope we may help it a bit toward a wide circulation .

		It has been long years since a thor - i ?

		oughly up-to-date one-volume
Bible Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	made its appearance .

		The numerous discoveries of recent years in
Bible	LOCATION	lands and adjacent lands , the new investigations in Bib - lical archaeology and in Biblical criticism , have de - manded a re-writing of nearly every article in the
Bible	LOCATION	Dictionaries of a quarter of a century ago .

		Professor
John D. Davis	PERSON	of
Princeton Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, with the cooperation of two of his col - leagues , Drs.
Warfield	PERSON	and
Purves	PERSON	, and after three years of incessant labor , has produced the book that is needed -LRB-
Westminster Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It is a volume of 800 pages , covering the whole range of Biblical themes , and of the
First Book of Maccabees	ORGANIZATION	.

		It aims to confine itself to facts , and to facts of the Scriptures and of records and things which throw light on the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		It very wisely leaves out spec - ulation about the
Bible	LOCATION	, which is usually short-lived and always of uncertain value .

		It is amply , almost profusely , illustrated with pictures , not of the imag - ination , but of the actual things themselves .

		Several up-to-date maps , based on the most recent discov - eries and authorities , were prepared especially for this work .

		The articles are well-proportioned in length and fulness of treatment .

		Their position is that , not of a hide-bound conservative , but of a pro- gressive and safe leader in the interpretation of the facts of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		The up-to-date character , the fulness of illustration , the wealth of maps , the pro- gressive position , and the cheapness of the volume ought to make this the one-volume Dictionary of the Bible for many years to come .

		In The Wonderful Century '' theMrl -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , Mr.
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	discusses in two aspects the scientific achievements of the century now closing .

		In one group he enumerates the theoretical discoveries with the practical invention resting thereupon .

		His list includes twelve examples of the first such as the conservation of energy , organic evolution , the ground theories of chemistry ; and twelve of the second as railways , telegraphs , photography , and the use of anaesthetics and antiseptics .

		With this list he compares all the discoveries of preceding ages , of which he names fifteen as gravitation and the circulation of the blood , the art of printing , the mariner 's compass , and the telescope .

		In a con - trasted group of what he calls the failures of the century , the author enumerates subjects as to which he insists that the scientific world has fallen into lamentable errors , either by underrating or by
Ferdinand Bruneti &	ORGANIZATION	re in English .

		wholly ignoring their real significance and value , as in the neglect of phrenology and the opposition to hypnotism and psychical research ; or by over - valuing what he holds to be delusive and mischiev - ous , as vaccination and militarism , which latter he calls the curse of civilization .

		The book has an interest as illustrating the excursions of a distin - guished naturalist into fields outside of his specialty .

		The first part of it almost any well-informed scien - tist might have written ; the second part scarcely any such person would have written .

		We are glad to have an English translation , and one which has been made with unusual skill , of
M. Ferdinand Brunetiere	PERSON	's '' Manual of the History of French Literature '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The work is so masterly an example of such a history , so solid in its scholarship and so attractive in its setting-forth , that it is valuable both on its own account and as a model of how such a thing ought to be done .

		The plan is rather original .

		The text is a philosophical essay in the author 's familiar manner , while the erudition is relegated to the footnotes which occupy about half of each page .

		The author calls his work '' an application of the doctrine of Evolution to the history of a great literature . ''

		The translation bears the assumed name of ''
Ralph Derechef	PERSON	. ''

		Sixteen portraits illustrate the volume .

		We are glad also to welcome in this connection the volume of '' Brunetiere 's Essays in French Literature , '' selected and translated by Mr.
D. Nichol Smith	PERSON	, and imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The volume includes seven of the author 's most characteristic essays , and a special preface written by him for this translation .

		Sir
Edward W. Hamilton	PERSON	's thought - ful and commendably temperate of
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		monograph on
Gladstone	PERSON	-LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has the prima facie recommendation of being from the pen of a man who knew the great statesman well for nearly forty years , and was closely asso - ciated with him during a considerable portion of that period .

		Sir
Edward	PERSON	aims to convey to his readers a just notion of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	the man , through describing some of his intellectual powers , characteristics , and accomplishments , some of his ways , aims , and objects , his likes and dislikes , and his general turn of mind .

		The little book is well worth reading , and while it can not be said to throw any special new light on Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's singularly complex character , its observations are in general just , well-weighed , and discriminating .

		It would have been singularly im - P r P er to have had a Famous Scots '' series without a life of Sir

		THE DIAL 131 ginning of the fourteenth century .

		At any rate , one gets but a hazy notion of the hero or of his oppor - tunity , in the volume by Professor Murison -LRB- im - ported by Scribner -RRB- .

		The chief figure is shadowy ; the circumstances are like those of a dream .

		The result may be imagined : killings and burnings , victories and defeats , plottings and betrayals , we get a confused vision of such matters , but no clear understanding .

		This volume is hardly as interest - ing as most of the series , a matter not entirely chargeable to the author .

		It gives us something of an account of a simple and violent career in a troub - lous and complicated time .

		We think most readers will know more of Wallace after they have read it than before ; but further it would be rather hard to go in the way of praise .

		Court of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		M. de
Saint-Amand	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Court of the Second Empire , 1856-1858 '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a rather exceptionally animated and interesting number of the sub-series of this brilliant writer 's popular historical studies now current .

		The three years bridging the time from the Crimean War to the Italian war of
1859	DATE	form the epoch covered in this book .

		The salient episodes treated are the coronation of the
Czar Alexander II.	ORGANIZATION	, the
Orsini	PERSON	attempt , and the diplo - matic preludes to the war which led immediately to the liberation from Austrian rule of northern
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Separate chapters are devoted to
Walewski	LOCATION	, De Morny , and
Cavour	PERSON	.

		There are four portraits .

		`` The More Excellent Way '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a volume of brief selections in verse and prose , all relating to the `` Life of Love , '' compiled by the Hon. Mrs.
Lyttelton Gell	PERSON	.

		The very wide range of au - thors represented would seem to bear out the statement that '' a poet without love were a physical and moral impossibility . ''

		The selections are admirably classified under appropriate readings , and have been chosen with great art and taste .

		Less , however , is to be said for the taste of the publishers .

		The combination of dark blue cover with pale-green edges makes a homely exte - rior ; the same combination within , used for type and decorative designs , makes a striking but not beautiful printed page .

		Mr.
W. E. H. Lecky	PERSON	's '' Democracy and Liberty '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- has just passed into a second edition , and the author avails himself of the opportunity thus pre - sented to discuss , in a special introduction of some fifty pages , '' the experience of the last eventful years . ''

		In the light of this experience , the outlook seems even gloomier than it did before , and the new introduction , to say nothing of the book itself , is far from cheerful reading .

		But the problems which it raises are to be solved only by facing them bravely and squarely ; and no writer of our time brings to their discussion a more penetrative insight or a riper wisdom .

		Judging from the example we have seen , the novel '' Color Prints '' of Miss
Pamela Colman Smith	PERSON	should meet with considerable favor .

		The term '' print '' as applied to these pictures seems to us ill-advised and misleading , as it naturally suggests the use of litho - graphy or some other method of mechanical reproduc - tion .

		In reality , the outline only of the picture is .

		printed , this being then filled in by hand in water-color and retouched by the artist .

		The colors are chosen with taste , and are carefully applied , and the effect of the finished work is both artistic and pleasing .

		Five sub - jects have been issued , varying in price from two ta five dollars each , remarkably cheap , when the amount of work involved is considered .

		The prints are pub - lished by Mr.
R. H. Russell	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's fondness for the eighteenth cen - tury is shown once more in his volume of '' Miscellanies n -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		Nearly all of its thirteen papers concern them - selves with books or authors of that period as Gold - smith ,
Steele	PERSON	, Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, Gay ; others have to do with

Royal Palace	ORGANIZATION	as it was in the year
1680	DATE	, and '' Changes in
Charing Cross	LOCATION	, '' looking back to the time of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, are chapters to delight the antiquary ; for of
Dobson	PERSON	, as of his favorite
Goldsmith	PERSON	, it may be said , '' He touches nothing that he does not adorn .

		A fifth edition of the late Professor
Martin	PERSON	's '' briefer course '' in '' The Human Body , '' revised by Dr.
George Wells Fitz	PERSON	, has just been published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work still has the perfunctory chapter on narcotics , without which it could not be used in the schools of a number of States , but Dr.
Fitz	PERSON	takes pains to state that this chapter '' is retained against the best judgment of the reviser , who believes that the questions involved are ethical and not physiological . ''

		The book is , of course , aside from this defect , one of the best elementary manuals of human anatomy and physiology that have ever been written .

		In another text-book of the same subject , written by Dr.
E. Franklin Smith	PERSON	, and published by Mr.
William R. Jenkins	PERSON	, the chapter on narcotics volunteers the delightful statement that '' tee - total drinks '' contain from six to fourteen per cent of alcohol , coming somewhere between claret and cham - pagne in the list . ''

		Where to Educate , '' published by
Messrs. Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, is described as '' a guid to the best private schools , higher institutions of learning , etc. , in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		It is a volume of nearly four hundred pages , and is edited by
Miss Grace Powers Thomas	ORGANIZATION	.

		She sup - plies a good deal of information that may give the book value for reference , but she has not always been on her guard .

		Among the
Illinois	LOCATION	institutions which are included we find , to our amazement , one of the chief offenders in the matter of fraudulent degrees , the estab - lishment which more than any other has led to the pro- posed legislation which we discuss in the editorial pages of this issue .

		It is little more than a compendium of the barest facts and the most condensed critical judgments , supplied with enough process illustrations to save the text from being absolutely meaningless to a young student .

		The total destruction by fire of
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's fine
Chicago	LOCATION	bookstore , which occurred on the 12th inst. , is an event not measurable by the money loss alone , although this approaches the sum of half a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		The store was renowned as one of the largest and best in the world , and its vast stock con - tained many rare items that can not be replaced , auto - graph copies , books in exquisite foreign bindings , treas - ures of the bookhunter and bibliophile , by whom the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 133 loss will be especially deplored .

		We are glad to an - nounce that the firm already occupies new quarters at the corner of
Wabash Avenue	LOCATION	and
Monroe Street	ORGANIZATION	, one square south of the old location .

		We have received from the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	the two bound volumes of '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' for
1898	DATE	, as well as the volume of the '' Century Magazine '' for the half - year ending last
October	DATE	.

		There is a good deal of war in these volumes , which is natural enough , but there are also other features of interest , including -LRB- as far as the '' Century '' volume is concerned -RRB- Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's '' Fran - ois '' and a half dozen of Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's superb wood - engravings .

		The death of
Archibald Lampman	PERSON	, on the tenth of this month , at the early age of thirty-eight , is no small loss to Canadian literature and English poetry .

		His two volumes , '' Among the Millet '' and '' Lyrics of
Earth	LOCATION	, '' together with his many contributions to the periodicals , gave him a high place among that remark - able group of young Canadian poets whose work has made us here in the
United States	LOCATION	look somewhat search - ingly to our own laurels .

		Professor
William Morris Davis	PERSON	, with the aid of Mr.
William Henry Snyder	PERSON	, has prepared a school '' Physical Geography '' which is published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a volume of ordinary dimensions not the extra - ordinary ones that used to be associated with text-books of this subject very abundantly illustrated , and thor - oughly praiseworthy in its presentation of theories and facts .

		The name of Professor
Davis	PERSON	, indeed , is all the guarantee of excellence that such a work needs .

		That readable literary magazine , '' The
Bookman	PERSON	, '' announces the publication in its pages of Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	's historical novel of the American Rev - olution , ''
Janice Meredith	PERSON	, '' the first instalment to ap - pear in the
March	DATE	number .

		This story has already , we believe , been running for several issues in ''
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly . ''

		The '' syndicate '' method of publication , it would thus appear , is to be extended to the monthly magazines , a doubtful experiment , as it seems to us .

		A considerable quantity of French lyrical poetry , in which the most recent singers are fairly represented , is given us in the volume of '' French Lyrics '' which Professor
Arthur Graves Canfield	PERSON	has edited for
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Upwards of sixty poets are included , with an average of four pieces each , although the space given to Hugo ,
Lamartine	LOCATION	, Musset ,
Leconte	PERSON	de
Lisle	LOCATION	, and M. Sully-Prudhomme makes this statement one to be taken with allowances .

		The book is excellent in every way in taste , scholarship , and sense of propor - tion .

		The
Committee on Libraries and Schools of the National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	is at present engaged in collecting materials for a report to be made next
July	DATE	.

		The subjects under consideration include the preparation of graded lists of books suitable for chil - dren , the correlation of public library and school work , normal school work in the use of books by teachers , and other related topics .

		There is a wide field of usefulness before this
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, and the cooperation of all inter - ested persons is solicited by the chairman , Mr.
J. C. Dana	PERSON	,
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons announce the publica - tion of '' The American Anthropologist , '' a new quar - terly journal established under the auspices of the anthropological section of the
American Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Board of Editors	ORGANIZATION	comprises such men as Messrs.
D. G. Brinton	PERSON	,
F. W. Putnam	PERSON	,
W. H. Holmes	PERSON	,
Franz Boas	PERSON	, and
J. W. Powell	PERSON	in a word , the most distinguished American scholars in this branch of science .

		Each number will contain two hundred pages of text and illustrations .

		Four dol - lars is the annual subscription .


The Association of Collegiate Aluinnge	ORGANIZATION	has recently added to its publications a '' Magazine Number '' which we have examined with much interest .

		No announce - ment is made of its continuation as a serial publication , but we wish that such an undertaking might prove prac - ticable , for a monthly , or even a quarterly , periodical of this character would be a welcome addition to our edu - cational literature .

		The contributors include such women as Mrs.
Alice Upton Pearmain	PERSON	,
Miss Abby Leach	PERSON	,
Miss Marion Talbot	PERSON	,
Miss Emily James Smith	PERSON	,
Miss M. Carey Thomas	PERSON	,
Miss Louise Brownell	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Paul Shorey	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Shorey	PERSON	's interesting paper upon '' The
Collegiate Alumiife	PERSON	and the Public Schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	'' affords a typical illustration of the sort of work
the Association	ORGANIZATION	is doing , good unobtrusive work of a kind that might accomplish much for the betterment of public education .

		The publication is issued from
Richmond Hill	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		This book in its present form is new to American readers , although a book under the same title , telling practically the same story , was pub - lished in
America	LOCATION	seven years ago .

		That was just after the passing of the Copyright Act , and the effort to meet the conditions of the new law seemed to require that the romance should be published in what I knew was an immature and wholly unsatisfactory form .

		This was the form in which it was being published serially in English and American jour - nals , without the revision usually considered necessary for any piece of writing before its appearance as a book , and especially desirable in the case of the present work ... When health and opportunity allowed , 1 did my best to make the story worthy of the reception it had received by an effort to lift its literary execution to the level of its artistic motive . ''

		With these alterations , and with amendments made very recently , I am now offering ' The Scapegoat ' to American readers practically , I think , as a new book , certainly as a book which is in great part new . ''

		164 THE LITERARY LIFE .

		There are many deserving persons to whom '' The Pen and the Book '' for thus is Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's latest pronouncement entitled will bring cheer .

		They are the persons who fondly imagine themselves to be leading , wholly or in part , the Literary Life , yet who find the public looking somewhat askance at their pro- fession , and inclined to subject their pretensions to a considerable discount .

		They are haunted by the fear that their efforts will be disparag - ingly dubbed journalism ; or , even if it be ad - mitted that they produce what are to outward seeming books , that the harsh world will clas - sify these productions among the biblia a-biblia of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's famous catalogue .

		Smart - ing under such cynical thrusts , these worthy souls may take heart again at the words , '' When , therefore , we speak of the Literary Life , it should include all those who produce literature . ''

		And , lest any modest scribbler should still be in doubt as to whether this definition is catholic enough to cover his own product , the assurance quickly follows : '' I include the whole of current printed work good and bad , the whole production of the day whatever is offered . ''

		Being thus con - vinced that he is leading the Literary Life of which he may even have had no suspicion up to this time our supposititious writer will be pleased to read a little farther on , that '' the Literary Life may be , in spite of many dangers and drawbacks , by far the happiest life that the Lord has permitted mortal man to enjoy . ''

		This is warming to the cockles of the heart , and he would be a morose penman indeed who could fail to catch something of the glow of the author 's cheery optimism .

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	's roseate imagination is at its best when he is engaged in a statistical presentation of the reading public , or when he is contrasting the Literary Life of the eighteenth century with that of the nineteenth or twentieth . ''

		Look here , upon this picture , and on this , '' he seems to say as he pens the following contrasted passages : ''
Corae	PERSON	back with me for a moment to the middle of the eighteenth century ... Everybody proclaimed in some way or other by his appearance the nature of his calling : and everybody enjoyed in this way such dignity and respect as belonged to his calling .

		How did the poet appear ?

		He was to be seen every day and all day 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, long : he haunted the coffee-houses , the eating-houses , and the taverns of Fleet Street and its neighborhood .

		Alone among men he had no uniform .

		Yet he could be recognized by his rags .

		Everybody knew the company of wits in the tavern : they were notoriously , horribly poor ; notoriously they had neither principles nor honour ; nor dignity : for a guinea , it was said , they would write satires , epigrams , anything for or against either side or anybody .

		Since the people only saw the ragged side , they supposed that the whole army was in rags ; it seemed to them the only profession whose normal or customary condition was one of rags . ''

		Let us consider next what is the kind of life led daily by the modern man of letters not a great genius , not a popular author : but a good steady man of letters of the kind which formerly had to inhabit the garrets of
Grub Street	ORGANIZATION	.

		This man , of whom there are many or this woman , for many women now belong to the pro- fession goes into his study every morning as regu - larly as a barrister goes to chambers ; he finds on his desk two or three books waiting for review ; a MS. sent him for an opinion ; a book of his own to go on with possibly * a life of some dead and gone worthy for a series ; an article which he has promised for a magazine ; a paper for the
Dictionary of National Biography	ORGANIZATION	' ; perhaps an unfinished novel to which he must give three hours of absorbed attention .

		This goes on , day after day , all the year round .

		There is never any fear of the work failing as soon as the writer has made himself known as a trustworthy and an attentive workman .

		The literary man has his club : he makes an income by his labour which enables him to live in comfort , and to ed - ucate his children properly .

		Now , this man a hundred years ago would have been what you have seen an object of contempt for his poverty and helplessness : the cause of contempt for Literature itself . ''

		The picture thus outlined for us of the life of the professional literary worker of our own times is certainly a pleasant one , and it does not seem to us overdrawn , except possibly as to the practical certainty of continuous employ - ment .

		It is , however , a life that is possible only in a very small number of the largest centres of population and publishing enterprise .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	, for example , it is unques - tionably possible in
New York	LOCATION	, precariously possible in about three other cities , and prac - tically impossible anywhere else .

		If Sir
Walter	PERSON	works no great wonders with his descriptions , he certainly does with his figures .

		We may possibly allow his estimate that twenty thousand persons in
England	LOCATION	are to-day , wholly or in part , leading the Literary Life , although to do this the words '' in part '' must receive much emphasis , since the census returns show less than six thousand actually classified as authors , editors , and journalists .

		For the
United States	LOCATION	, we should have nearly to double these figures ; and we reflect , not without amusement , that even the lesser num - ber provided by the census must include the editors of country newspapers and the compilers of city directories .

		Still , we may admit that in this country forty thousand persons may pos - sibly , at some time or other , do some kind of writing for publication in books or periodicals .

		But when we come to Sir
Walter	PERSON	's notion of the reading public , the imagination fairly balks at the figures offered for our acceptance .

		First of all , he estimates that in
1750	DATE	the '' possible readers or inquirers after new books '' numbered thirty thousand in the three kingdoms .

		Eighty years later , in
1830	DATE	, this number may have increased to fifty thousand .

		So far , so good .

		These figures are certainly conservative enough .

		But when the author contemplates the reading public that to-day awaits the new English books , he loses the sense of proportion .

		Because one hundred and twenty millions of people all over the earth are able to read the English language , he assumes that most of them are eagerly fol - lowing the literary developments of the period .

		For
seventy years ago	DATE	, he will allow only one person in about five hundred to have been '' interested in new books . ''

		Now , owing to the spread of popular education , he thinks of the whole five hundred -LRB- including children in arms -RRB- as readers .

		In other words , while mak - ing excessive reductions for the earlier years selected for comparison , he allows no deductions at all for the present and the future .

		This statement will seem so astonishing as to need a quotation in verification .

		Here it is : '' In fifty years ' time , unless some check some everwhelming national disaster happens to this country , or the
United States	LOCATION	, or to our colonies , the population of the English-speaking race will be more than doubled .

		There will be at least two hundred and fifty millions all of them , on an average , far better educated than at the present moment , and all readers of books . ''

		We are willing to allow an enormous increase in the present ratio of readers to non - readers , as compared with the ratio of
1830	DATE	; but if the latter be taken as one to five hundred , the former can hardly be taken as larger than twenty-five to five hundred .

		The sort of arithmetic wherewith Sir
Walter	PERSON	seeks to enhance the opportunities of the Lit - erary Life of the present day must be illus - trated more specifically .

		We are willing to be liberal , and to accept , for example , the conclu - sions of the following sentence : '' Sixty years ago there was no
Chicago	LOCATION	at all : now there is a city with two million inhabitants , of whom one-half are decently educated and read books , and quite one hundred thousand are interested in new literature . ''

		Observe , however , that this
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 145 is a ratio of only one to twenty , as compared with the author 's ratio for
1830	DATE	, and is a very different thing from the claim that nearly everybody belongs to the audience upon which a new writer can count .

		This is simply an appeal from
Philip	LOCATION	drunk with optimism to
Philip	LOCATION	sober in the presence of facts .

		But we can not find much sobriety in the author 's no - tions of the number of readers to be reckoned for each individual copy of a book or periodical .

		He actually counts an average of twenty readers for every copy of a magazine and five hundred for every copy of a book .

		To say that these estimates are wild is to use moderate language .

		One of the most popular of our American monthlies some years ago claimed a million readers on the strength of an average circu - lation of two hundred thousand copies .

		We thought this claim of five readers to a copy excessive , and the publishers obviously went as far as they dared in making it .

		But Sir
Walter	PERSON	would give them four millions of readers instead of a poor single million .

		As for the five hun - dred readers that Sir
Walter	PERSON	counts for each copy of a popular novel , we must insist upon a discount of at least ninety-five per cent .

		Twenty-five readers would be a generous esti - mate , and we doubt if a circulating - library copy ever got up to the five hundred mark .

		Most books would be in tatters after going through the hands of one hundred , or at the most two hundred , readers .

		It is evident that the above remarks are not to be taken as a review of '' The Pen and the Book . ''

		Indeed , we have not touched upon its main contents , which embody an elaborate setting-f orth of the commercial aspect of author - ship , although we may take up this subject in the near future .

		As a champion of the writer in his relations with the publisher , Sir
Walter	PERSON	has been a stout fighter for many years past , and in this book he presents the results of a thorough , practical investigation of the methods of publishing and the cost of producing books .

		He has made many enemies by his work in this field , and his assertions have occasioned a great deal of acrimonious debate .

		We have read a considerable quantity of this controversial mat - ter , and are bound to say that Sir
Walter	PERSON	is armed cap-a-pie to meet his assailants , and that he usually has the best of the argument .

		We also wish to say that writers inexperienced in deal - ing with publishers will find profitable reading in '' The Pen and the Book , '' to say nothing of the pleasure to be got from its skilful literary pre - sentation of a subject of much general interest .

		LITER AR Y STANDARDS .

		When and where is to appear the true Prophet of the Literati , he who is to stand and cry , Behold the ideal taste , the perfect writer , the
Ultimate Authority !	ORGANIZATION

		We hear much about the '' best literary taste , '' and the conscientious toilers of the pen , those who have not yet reached the comfortable conclu - sion that they know it all , spend many an anxious hour in self-examination , more or less illuminated by the feeble '' glims '' of favorable or adverse critics .

		What a help and comfort it would seem to be , alike to writers , readers , and publishers , if some literary Mahomet might arise to declare with con - vincing power , '' There is but one
Standard	ORGANIZATION	, and I am its Prophet ! ''

		Then all of us or at least all afflicted with a conscience might give o'er the weary search for the ideal , for we would know just what to write about and how ; and readers who valued their mental and moral status would know just what to read ; and the world 's shelves would groan no more under the load of books which infal - lible publishers have brought to an ill-conceived birth .

		But would we ?

		Even though a literary angel should come from Heaven with unimpeachable cre - dentials , would it make any appreciable difference ?

		Would the number of false and foolish books be seriously diminished ?

		Would the millions leave off soddening their none too nimble wits in a steep of sickly sentiment and vapid thought ?

		I fear not .

		And yet every writer who has high ideals , and has , besides , the saving grace to feel dissatisfied with his own accomplishment , has moments when he longs for one clear , sure voice amid the cackle of conflicting criticism , one bright , fixed polestar in the uncertain sky .

		He has tasted the '' classics , '' only to be more fully persuaded how wisely and wittily
Mark Twain	PERSON	has described them .

		He sam - ples modern models , only to find many men , many minds .

		Each author has his constituency of ad - mirers ; to others he is either indifferent or alto - gether anathema .

		One is too psychological , another is all '' fight and love '' stories ; one is naughty with - out being nice , another too nice to be either naughty or interesting ; here one discusses '' problems , '' there it is a problem that he is discussing ; this one ser - monizes , that scandalizes ; one is too smart , another too simple ; this one buries his little grain of thought in a bushel of verbiage , that one sends forth the children of his brain too scantily clothed for de - cency ; alike in the dense air of realism and in the rarified air of hyper-idealism we gasp for breath : and so it goes .

		In such a state of things , what is the writer and reader to do who is ambitious to improve his style and cultivate his taste : is he to go with the crowd , calling all things good which others call good , or is he to lay himself open to the charge of conceit and presumption by daring to exercise his independent judgment , even of the Immortals ?

		Is it all a delu - sion , anyhow , this talk about higher and lower 146 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, taste , the distinction heing as valid as that well - known difference between , orthodoxy and hetero - doxy ?

		If there is no absolute standard , how shall one taste be higher or another lower ?

		Perhaps , after all , it is only a matter of time , circumstance , and luck .

		Worse yet , the past sheds no light on the present or the future .

		The books which delighted the fathers excite in us either distaste or the very gentle interest of the '' classicist . ''

		Books change and we change with them ; but is it up or down ?

		In short , is there any real literary evolution ?

		There is but one way out of this fog of other people 's tastes and opinions : to see that our ques - tion is only one phase of a much larger one .

		That question is world-wide and world-old :
Pontius Pilate	PERSON	was not the first to ask it ; it knows no bounds of time or space .

		The whole literary , moral , and social order , nay , even the universe itself , ravels out into a pitiful reductio ad dbsurdum unless we assume the existence of an Absolute Standard of truth and beauty .

		This is a necessity , not of reli - gion only , but of sanity as well .

		A second postulate is equally imperative : the soul of man is made in the image of that
Standard	ORGANIZATION	, and its normal growth is along the lines of eternal verities .

		These two postulates being granted , things begin to clear up .

		Now we are less anxious to know what A , B , and C think of the thoughts we have written , than to know they are true .

		Now we can go on bravely and hopefully , our only concern being the normal development of that germ of the Infinite within us .

		Now we know that all distortions of truth , all affectations of beauty , being violations of eternal laws , must come to naught ; whatever vogue they may have at first , they are ephemerae .

		But the path , though clearer , is still far from easy .

		Eternal vigilance is the price of sanity .

		The beginnings of error are as infinitesimally insidious as the microscopic germs which infect the body ; and the mind has a fatal facility for repeating an error once begun , until it becomes a bias , then a habit , and finally a characteristic .

		Life is a Sisy - phean task of sifting and weighing , of making errors and correcting them , but ever '' approximat - ing nearer and nearer to the limit of the variable , '' as the mathematicians say .

		That limit is Perfect Judgment .

		That is the goal and rest of all this fitful fever .

		In all this struggle to approximate the truih , of course the wise will not neglect the help to be derived from others ' taste and judgment ; but once the evi - dence on any point is all before us , it is ourselves who must decide .

		Of course we shall make mistakes , that , all are bound to do in any case ; but better sometimes wrong than always servile .

		Let us go forward bravely , in the full assurance that the laws of our being are the laws of Infinite Right .

		But there is one essential condition , without it there is no progress and no sanity : we must be abso - lutely honest with ourselves .

		How can he know truth who lies even to his own soul !

		He -LRB- or she -RRB- who , for love of gain or fame , cajoles himself to believe that wrong is right ; who , for pride or con - ceit of opinion , will not allow himself to see his error ; who twists the truth to fit a story or a theory ; who from love of ease seeks not to know the truth , or stifles it for fear of others ' criticism , none such need ever hope for perfect judgment or perfect taste .

		Truth is the oxygen of the soul .

		While they im - agine they are clever , they are fools , for they are asphyxiating their own souls to an eternal death .

		But would not the subjection of all literature to the test of truth be a long step backward , reducing us to sermons and scientific theses ?

		By no means , even granting that sermons and theses are invariably ves - sels of truth .

		Broadly speaking , all literature which makes for the betterment of man , either directly , or indirectly through saneful wit and humor , is true literature .

		It need not be professedly moral , but its influence must not be immoral .

		To that extent ,
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	is right .

		All literature which presents ideas with which the facts do not agree ; which excites silly , morbid , or vulgar feelings and aspirations ; which makes a jest of that which is sacred , shame - ful , or revolting ; which vulgarizes by too great familiarity with vulgarity ; which makes the wrong appear the better reason ; which apotheosizes vice or calls buffoonery humor , all such literature , of infinite variety of shade and grade , is either dis - tinctly vicious or at best is trashy .

		No wonder that such fatal and fantastic notions of life and happi - ness shock the world by working out their logical and inevitable conclusions in crime and suicide from the flood of trash literature continually poured forth , even through our public libraries , to glut the morbid appetite of those least able to discriminate .

		But is there any best literary style ?

		The best style is any style which best subserves the ends of true literature .

		It is a mistake to take for granted that there is no longer room for originality in style , treatment , or subject .

		Well worked though the field now seems to be , there are doubtless undiscov - ered tracts of virgin soil only awaiting the pioneer pen to laugh back with as rich a harvest as has ever yet been seen .

		To the fathers , who found per - fect satisfaction in '' Rasselas '' or '' The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' it doubtless seemed that the
Ultima Thule	LOCATION	of popular literature had been reached ; now those literary superlatives are relegated to the dig - nified and dubious limbo of '' classics . ''

		The varia - tions of the written thought , as of all things human , are the variations of the human soul ; and they are infinite .

		Three examples out of many illustrate this point of originality :
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Kipling	LOCATION	.

		Each had an independent mind , which , boldly desert - ing the trodden paths , struck out for itself into the woods an original line of thought and style .

		At first the world , always shy of truth in unaccustomed guise , refused to follow ; now it hails them gladly to
Parnassus	LOCATION	.

		But these were geniuses .

		Verily ; yet we who ,
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		147 alas , are only common clay , may profit by their ex - ample .

		We too are free to try new paths in style and subject ; perchance even we can find something to write about fresher than the worn-to-death rela - tion of the sexes , and tell it in a best way of our own devising .

		Mr.
Stephen Crane	PERSON	made the attempt gallantly enough , but only half-successfully .

		His well-praised , well-execrated little book holds a few gems of expression which glisten like diamonds in a dreary waste of sand .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's psychology is positively painful ; but in '' The Ked Badge of Courage '' he really struck a new lead in flashlight word-pictures which is worth developing ; some day the man or woman is coming who will do it , if he does not .

		Poets are born , publishers are made : writers must be both born and made .

		None need lose heart , for none can say what is in him until he has done his best .

		But right here is the danger point .

		That Best is no
Jonah	PERSON	's gourd , but a plant of slowest growth , fed by thought , study , and experience , mayhap watered by tears and watched with care , only to bloom as the westering shadows lengthen .

		But whether or no it bloom in this world is a minor matter ; the great matter is , Have we written our - selves down as a part of the Truth and the Beauty which are Eternal ? ''

		Let each paint the thing as he sees it , for the God of things as they are . ''

		SCHOOL LEGISLATION FOR LARGE CITIES AND SMALL .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Recent and current school legislation for cities is rightfully attracting attention .

		With the illustration of the
Cleveland	LOCATION	law and its six years of trial , sufficient evidence is presented of the efficacy of at least some of the changes thereby accomplished .

		The discussion and presentation of the subject so far contemplates and provides for the conduct of schools in large cities only .

		The measures presented by the
Chicago Commission	ORGANIZATION	, also of the
Detroit Committee	ORGANIZATION	, are quite similar .

		In a general way , the belief that they suggest needed reforms is generally accepted .

		For the thirty cities in the country reported by the
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	as exceeding one hundred thousand population , the propo - sition stated must be accepted as pointing to a more efficient school administration .

		Provision for these thirty cities , if applicable to them alone , leaves nearly six hundred other cities with a population exceeding eight thousand , the schools of which are all at least of equal importance to the country with those of these great cities .

		It will be found that the two chief features of the proposed reform are : first , the divorce of the board of education from executive duty , and confining it to leg - islation ; second , the placing of the direct personal responsibility where a strict account for acts can be de - manded and easily given .

		While it is possible that the framers of the proposed legislation have in mind primarily , as the
Chicago	LOCATION	Com - mission announces , that organization which shall be best for a given city , it will be found that a city which for any reason is unable to provide and maintain two dis - tinct departments in administration namely , business and educational if the board confine itself to legisla - tion , can unite the two under one executive officer .

		The superintendent of schools in smaller cities is able , or should be able , to execute not only efficiently on the educational side but also on the business side .

		Observa - tions of several smaller cities in the country illustrate that where this has been the practice for a series of years the schools have been accorded a measure of reputable standing .

		While modifications will be de - manded of the
Detroit	LOCATION	,
St. Louis	LOCATION	, or
Chicago	LOCATION	plan , for cities of fifty thousand people , they will be slight ; but the erection of divers departments in other than large cities will bring embarrassment financially , and ulti - mately an unsatisfactory outcome .

		As Dr.
Hinsdale	PERSON	said in your last issue , it may be that no single type of system will follow the present interest in this subject .

		To my mind it is reasonably certain that a general type of management of schools in cities will be found to exist ere long , not only in the thirty great cities of more than one hundred thousand people , but also in the cities of less size .

		It is not so great a misfortune that thought and study has been exclusively for the great communities ; but , after all , if a commission similar to the
Chicago Commission	ORGANIZATION	should undertake to formulate a plan for cities in the neighborhood of fifty thousand people , more communities would be directly benefitted than at present .

		THE RENAISSANCES IN
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is a trite but none the less true saying , that '' his - tory repeats itself . ''

		The capture of Constantinople by the Turks in the fifteenth century scattered the learned men of the
East	LOCATION	and their learning over the West , and produced throughout
Europe	LOCATION	a Renaissance whose vast influence has never yet been accurately measured , and which was undoubtedly one of the chief elements in modern civilization .

		Again , it was Tartar hordes , which , about two hundred years later , overthrew the reigning native dynasty of
China	LOCATION	, and unwittingly produced in the neighboring land of
Japan	LOCATION	a Renaissance which led ultimately to the Restoration of
1868	DATE	, and was evidently one of the chief elements in the civilization of
New Japan	LOCATION	.

		For , as the Greek scholars , fleeing from Con - stantinople , took refuge in various countries of
Europe	LOCATION	, likewise many patriotic Chinese scholars fled from their native land and took refuge in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Or , as the fugi - tive Greek savants stirred up throughout
Western Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope a revival of learning , in like manner the fugitive Chinese scholars aroused in
Japan	LOCATION	a deeper interest in Oriental learning .

		The influence exerted in
Japan	LOCATION	by the learned Chi - nese refugees , especially by one named
Shu Shun-sui	PERSON	, was considerable .

		This one man was in
1665	DATE	invited by
Mitsukuni	LOCATION	, the famous Prince of
Mito	ORGANIZATION	, to take up his abode with that clan .

		The
Mito Prince	ORGANIZATION	was at the time engaged in the preparation of the ''
Dai Nihon Shi	PERSON	, '' or '' Great Japanese History , '' which '' had so powerful an influence in forming the public opinion which now up - holds the
Mikado	LOCATION	's throne '' ; and he invited the assist - ance of at least one of these Chinese scholars in correcting this work , which was written in Chinese .

		And although there is no positive evidence that this assistance extended 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, beyond textual correction , yet it is not at all improbable that even this slight opportunity was utilized for teach - ing loyalty to the central authority .

		But , besides the direct and indirect literary work of these learned refugees , we must not lose sight of the deeper interest which , by their very presence , was nat - urally aroused in the study of Chinese literature and philosophy .

		It is , of course , a difficult matter to trace clearly the extent of such influence ; but it is generally admitted by those who have studied the subject , that the presence of Chinese literati in
Japan	LOCATION	did give a greater impetus to learning .

		It is , indeed , true that the revival of learning had , before their arrival , begun un - der the auspices of lyeyasu himself , who , after he had conquered a peace , reorganized the Empire on the f uedal basis , and practically settled upon the policy of seclu - sion and crystallization , '' determined also to become the architect of the national culture . ''

		He encouraged study , especially of the Chinese classics , and stimulated education .

		It is , therefore , no wonder that the Chinese savants received a warm welcome ; and it seems , under the circumstances , as if they had '' come to the king - dom for such a time as this . ''

		But this
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	had a still wider influence , which extended even to political affairs .

		There were , in fact , three lines along which the Japanese were gradually led back to Imperialism .

		One line was Confucianism , which taught loyalty ; another was historical research , which exhibited the Shogun as a usurper ; and a third was the revival of Pure Shinto , which accompanied or followed the second .

		But the Japanese so modified Chinese Confucianism as to substitute loyalty for filial duty as the most important element . ''

		The Shinto and the Chinese teachings became amalgamated in a common cause , and thus the philosophy of Chu Hi , mingling with the nationalism and patriotism inculcated by Shinto , brought about a remarkable result . ''

		To change slightly the figure used above , the Japanese were led over three roads from Feudalism to Imperialism .

		There was the broad and straight highway of historical research : on the right side , generally parallel with the main road , and often running into it , was the path of Shinto ; on the opposite side , making frequently a wide detour to the left , was the road of Confucianism ; but eventually all these roads led to Kyoto and the Emperor .

		It seems as if , with the aid of Chinese savants , the famous
Mito Prince	ORGANIZATION	,
Mitsukuni	PERSON	, the `` Japanese Maece - nas , '' a scholar himself and the patron of scholars , set on foot a Renaissance in literature , learning , and poli - tics , and has been appropriately styled '' the real author of the movement which culminated in the Revolution of
1868	DATE	. ''

		And the effects of this Renaissance aie still being felt in another Revival of Learning , this time along
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	lines .

		To what will this new Revival lead ?

		AN ENGLISH VERSION OF `` BARBARA FREITCHIE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In his admirable work on ''
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	and the American Civil War , '' the author ,
Colonel Hender	PERSON	- son , says of his hero : '' So general was the belief in his stern and merciless nature , that a great poet did not hesitate to link his name with a deed which , had it actu - ally occurred , would have been one of unexampled cruelty .

		Such calumnies as
Whittier	LOCATION	's '
Barbara Frit	PERSON	- chie , ' '' etc. -LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 80 . -RRB-

		The point is not important but one wonders where the '' calumny '' is in
Whittier	LOCATION	's poem , or what sort of a version of it circulates in
England	LOCATION	.

		The poem merely says that when
Jackson	PERSON	rode up the street of
Frederick City	PERSON	at the head of his troops , and '' the old flag met his sight , '' he ordered his men to blaze away at it , which they did ; but later , when the owner of the flag ,
Dame Barbara	PERSON	, appeared on the scene and snatched the fallen flag , and leaned far out o'er the window-sill and shook it forth with a royal will ,
Jackson	PERSON	announced that any - one who touched a hair of her gray head should die like a dog , or words to that effect .

		The facts on which the poem is based have been dis - puted , and the whole thing is perhaps a little apochry - phal ; but it is hard to see where the `` unexampled cruelty '' would come in , were everything actually true that is stated in the poem .

		THE DIAL 149 THE MEMORIALS OF LOUD
SELBORNE	LOCATION	.

		* The concluding instalment , in two sizable volumes , of the late Earl of
Selborne	LOCATION	's '' Me - morials '' is mainly a restatement of the author 's views on the major public questions which arose during the period covered -LRB- 1865-1895 -RRB- , and an explanation of his professional and official course regarding them .

		Some of the chapters are rather freely diluted with matter that will inter - est Lord
Selborne	LOCATION	's relatives and closer friends rather than the public at large ; but the volumes on the whole may safely be pronounced solid and informing , if not especially animated or graphic , additions to the large and growing stock of reminiscences of Victorian times .

		Lord Sel - borne 's gifts and temperament were hardly such as to qualify him to shine as a writer of memoirs of the lighter personal and reminiscential order , a species of writing in which many a social trifler equipped with a lively pen and a taste for gossip might easily have excelled him .

		Of chat about notable contemporaries , therefore , the volumes will seem to many readers to con - tain disappointingly little .

		That
Lord Selborne	LOCATION	, where the subject was an imposing one and where his sympathies were deeply engaged , was no mean hand at painting a portrait and defining a character , his strong and refreshingly independent characterization of
Gladstone	LOCATION	conclusively shows .

		Now that Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	has , in a recent preface , calmly pro- nounced '' the texture of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's intel - lect '' to have been of the '' commonplace '' order , we may confidently look to see the inev - itable reactionary tide of disparagement of the Grand Old Man of liberalism and parliament - ary manosuvre fairly set in .

		Much evil has of course been spoken of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	in the past by his political foes , who , not content with attacking his policy , have impugned his motives , and even attempted to injure his character by the foulest aspersions .

		But detraction of that sort is politics , not criticism ; and we suspect that the recent verdict of Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	himself regarding the quality of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's intel - lect is tinged by his known opinion of the quality of Mr.

		fruit he happens to personally dislike can
spring	DATE	from any but an inferior and weakly tree .

		Lord
Selborne	LOCATION	disagreed pretty sharply with Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	on some points , almost from the first years of their connection ; and he was very far from keeping pace with his early oracle and paragon in the latter 's dramatic yet gradual and deliberate advance from the one extreme to the other of British opinion .

		This advance -LRB- the term is perhaps open to criticism as a question - begging one -RRB- Lord
Selborne	LOCATION	, who had himself gathered caution and conservatism with ripening years in the usual and normal way , must have inwardly regarded as a sort of intel - lectual and political Rake 's Progress on the part of the once u rising hope '' of all that was venerable and established in
England	LOCATION	.

		Nor does he refrain from using language of some bitterness when he comes to speak of the clos - ing phase of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's career .

		If it be true , says
Lord Selborne	LOCATION	, that down to the end of
June , 1886	DATE	, Gladstone '' kept the great con - troversy on the heights , '' it was certainly not long afterwards that he ceased to do so , his power of self-persuasion affecting his moral judgments in a way that would have been deemed impossible in earlier years .

		In the con - stant stress and turmoil of electioneering since
1886	DATE	, in which he played the leading part , there was little to remind men of the
Gladstone	PERSON	of old , save the old eloquence , energy , and daunt - less courage , qualities more remarkable than ever when displayed by the man past eighty .

		`` A new ' transmigration of spirit ' cauae over him ; he accepted it with as much alacrity and apparent self - satisfaction as if it had always been so ; he invested it with the authority of his age , his name , his character ; and under its influence the statesman was transformed into the demagogue .

		Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	became , for four years , until he himself broke the spell , the special object of his admiration ; and other violent spirits of the ' League ' were glorified as heroes and martyrs ... He became the apologist of the methods by which his new allies carried on their warfare against landlords and the law in
Ireland	LOCATION	... All sorts of schemes for parliament - ary interference with rights of property , and with the freedom of capital and labor , budded and blos - soined under the capacious shelter of the new Liberal umbrella , ' not without a sanguine hope that , in the good time coming , they would be entertained by the great leader ` with an open mind ' : and there was no ` plain speaking ' to discourage that hope .

		What the final issue of these things may be , can not be foretold ; but if it should be the decay and degradation of British states - manship , and the triumph of anarchical forces , hostile to the life of freedom , while they shout her name , ' Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	will have contributed to it more than any other man . ''

		With great appearance of tenacity at any given moment , his mind was apt to be moving indirectly down an inclined plane . ''

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	could be quoted against Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	on almost any leading or funda - mental public question whatever .

		To find a powerful and convincing plea against what Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	was urging to-day , you had only to turn back to what Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	was urging yesterday .

		Agrarian schemes that yesterday were stigmatized as '' rapine '' and '' plunder '' were extenuated and even justified to-day as quite excusable and useful moves in a patriotic Plan of Campaign . ''

		Boycotting , '' that in
1882	DATE	was denounced as '' combined intimida - tion , made use of for the purpose of destroying private liberty of choice by fear of starvation , inflicting ruin , and driving men to do what they did not want to do , and preventing them from doing what they had a right to do , '' be - came , after
1886	DATE	, under the magic of Mr.
Glad	PERSON	- stone 's faculty of self-persuasion and matchless dialectic , mere '' exclusive dealing , '' or a form of trades-unionism that was '' the only available weapon for the Irish people , in their weakness and poverty , against the wealthy and powerful . ''

		It would be easy to go on quoting from the tale of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's thousand and one '' magnificent inconsistencies '' -LRB- as his hardier admirers called them -RRB- in proof of the , to our thinking , not very damaging fact that the au - thor of them was as different as could be from the more common type of man who goes through life a complacent slave to the faith he was born in .

		But Lord
Selborne	LOCATION	's strictures clearly go deeper than the charge of mere inconsistency .

		If we are to accept his view unreservedly -LRB- which we do not -RRB- , Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	became in his later years of political activity '' a demagogue , '' an inflamer of popular animosities , of class hatreds and class cupidities , all this for the sake of personal popularity and party advan - tage .

		He degenerated into a sort of '' Sand Lots '' haranguer of genius , the more dangerous because of his genius .

		He was not honest , either with himself or with others . ''

		He had a wonderful power of not seeing what he did not like .

		He was a master of the art of throwing dust into the eyes of those who were proper subjects for that operation ; and he could practise it not less skil - fully upon himself . ''

		Let us turn for a moment to the lights of Lord
Selborne	LOCATION	's by no means altogether or intention - ally disparaging portrait of his former chief .

		The secret of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's great popularity he finds in the opinion generally entertained of the purity of his motives , the elevation of his character , in his sympathy with the people and desire for their good , rather than in his energy , eloquence , and intellectual gifts .

		Humanity turned to him naturally , as to a friend , as to one who felt more than other men of like gifts and station the common kinship of all . ''

		His private life was indeed without a flaw ... He preferred misconstruction to missing opportunities of doing good ... His interests were wide and cosmo - politan ; his acquirements were multifarious , and all at his command .

		He was a lover of music , poetry , the drama , and the fine arts ... He spoke more than one European language almost as easily as his own .

		He was very high , if not first , in the first rank of modern orators ; an orator of the diffuse florid kind , Ciceronian rather than Demosthenic , lofty when dignity was neces - sary , and at all times fluent and animated ; abounding in illustration and metaphor ; every word in the right place , every sentence well turned . ''

		American readers will be particularly inter - ested in
Lord Selborne	LOCATION	's account of the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' arbitration .

		He was consulted professionally by his government during the negotiations prior to the Treaty of
Washington	LOCATION	, and he acted as counsel for
Great Britain	LOCATION	be - fore the
Geneva	LOCATION	Tribunal .

		The maltreatment of this country by the British authorities dur - ing the Civil War , in the matter of the Con - federate privateers , is now res adjudicate / , and admitted and deplored matter of history .

		But Lord
Selborne	LOCATION	, with an advocate 's obstinacy , still endeavors to put
America	LOCATION	in the wrong .

		If we won our case at
Geneva	LOCATION	it was mainly through our bluster and chicane , through the bias of arbitrators , through the generous for - bearance of
Great Britian	LOCATION	, that is the spirit of his contention .

		He intimates that our nego - tiators at the outset felt the importance of '' either complicating the question by irrelevant issues , or to some extent prejudicing it by the terms of reference . ''

		He hints darkly at the '' wiles and subtleties '' of the American law -

		THE DIAL 151 yers , at the '' loaded dice '' with which
America	LOCATION	was allowed by the Rules to '' play the game of hazard . ''

		With a wooden insensibility to the essential fact that in the eyes of
America	LOCATION	the trial at
Geneva	LOCATION	was symbolic , that
America	LOCATION	stood at the bar of the Tribunal , not as a mere claimant of so many dollars and cents in a suit for damages , but to demand moral satisfaction and moral reparation in the sight of the world for a great wrong , Lord
Selborne	LOCATION	sneers at the feeling injected into the American '' Case . ''

		Its tone , he complains , `` was acrimonious , totally wanting in international courtesy . ''

		Perhaps it was .

		Perhaps the American '' Case '' was es - sentially such that not to state it in strong language would be tantamount to not stating it at all .

		Perhaps a nation still smarting under the recollection of the jeers , contumely , and material damage inflicted upon it by a '' neu - tral '' power , while its own hands were tied by civil war , was justified in revealing a sense of wrong even in a formal statement of its griev - ances .

		The question is often asked , '' Why does
America	LOCATION	dislike England ? ''

		and ingenious ex - planations are offered .

		But there is a plain and sufficient answer to that question , and that is , '' Because
England	LOCATION	has shown in the past so often and so offensively that she disliked
America	LOCATION	. ''

		She never showed it so conclusively as during our Civil War , when our difficulties absolved her from the immediate need of cau - tion .

		The ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' incident was but a flagrant episode in the painful story of the atti - tude toward us of the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	and the British cultured and influential classes dur - ing that period .


Russia	LOCATION	alone stood our friend , our friend in need ; and to forget that now would be the blackest ingratitude .

		What was the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	'' ?

		Let us answer that question in the words of a distinguished Englishman , Mr.
W. E. Forster	PERSON	, the friend and colleague of
John Bright	PERSON	, who stood the eloquent champion of the North , while Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	was complacently proclaiming that
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	'' had made an army , had made a navy , and , more than that , had made a na - tion . ''

		Said Mr.
Forster	PERSON	: '' The `
Alabama	LOCATION	' was a British ship , built by British ship-builders , and manned by a British crew ; she lured prizes to destruction under a British flag , and was paid for by money borrowed from British cap - italists . ''

		All the logic-chopping and learned technicalities of
Lord Selborne	LOCATION	at
Geneva	LOCATION	could not obscure those facts .

		During her two-years cruise the ``
Alabama	LOCATION	'' took some seventy North - ern vessels , and literally drove our commerce from the seas .

		As an English historian says : '' She went upon her destroying course with the cheers of English sympathizers and the rapturous tirades of English newspapers glorifying her .

		Every misfortune that befell an American merchantman was received in this country with a roar of delight . ''

		Let us add that when the ''
Alabama	LOCATION	, '' in her first encounter with an antagonist of any - thing like her own class and armament , was shot to pieces after a brief engagement , her fate was mourned sincerely and patriotically by a chagrined British public .

		It was the last action between a British and an American vessel .

		The student of the questions of church and law reform dealt with in these concluding vol - umes will find Lord
Selborne	LOCATION	's reflections thereon of no little value .

		The correspondence with which the work is freely interspersed is of fair interest , and the author 's occasional devia - tions from the dignified , if somewhat diffuse , exposition of his own political views into the lighter paths of reminiscence will be welcomed by the average reader .

		The editing has been conscientiously done by Lady
Sophia Palmer	PERSON	,

		THE SECOND YEAR or THE CIVIL WAR .

		* Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	is giving to the world what seems likely to be the standard history of our great Civil War .

		As we took occasion to say when his first volume appeared , he approaches his work in the spirit of a historian and not as an advocate of any general or any policy .

		Now that a third of a century has elapsed since the close of the war , the leading actors have all passed off the stage , and the country has en - tered upon a new era of its history , there seems to be no reason why a really impartial and authoritative narrative of that period can not be written ; and there is much to warrant the opinion that Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	has produced that nar - rative in its broad lines and its general judg - ments of individuals and of movements and campaigns .

		The volume opens with the startling victory at
Forts Henry	ORGANIZATION	and
Donelson	PERSON	, which broke the Confederate line and recovered

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		152 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, General
Halleck	PERSON	is shown at the outset , and continuously through the whole volume .

		It becomes clear that he undertook this campaign recklessly , without the knowledge of his supe - riors and without the cooperation of his asso - ciate commanders in the
West	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	asserts that
Halleck	PERSON	`` had no scheme in his mind , '' and that jealousy was a probable mo - tive of his precipitate action .

		The administra - tion was planning a campaign in
East Tennes	LOCATION	- see ;
Halleck	PERSON	was afraid that his command would be absorbed in that of
Buell	PERSON	, so he plunged into his campaign and compelled the government to follow his lead .

		It was probably the wisest move he could make ; but the man - ner of making it , and the way in which it was followed up , deserve the severest censure .

		The next step shows the `` great reckless - ness '' of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	at
Pittsburg	LOCATION	Landing .

		It was known to him and to his superior officer , General
Halleck	PERSON	, that the enemy was near in great force ; yet the army was retained in an exceedingly faulty position , with no outposts , no preparation to receive the enemy , no line of battle or defense .

		The various camps were established without system or plan of coopera - tion . ''

		All the well-known maxims of war applicable to such a position were absolutely unheeded by
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		Probably there never was an army encamped in an enemy 's country with so little regard to the manifest risks which are inseparable from such a situa - tion . ''

		The Union generals estimated the ene - my 's forces at eighty thousand , against forty thousand of their own forces ; yet they were blissfully unexpectant of an attack , and when it came it was a complete surprise .

		Grant was not on the field for several hours after the en - gagement opened , and even after he came every general acted for and by himself .

		He is de - clared to have been at that time '' incapable of assuming the entire control and direction of a great battle , '' and '' not equal to an emergency of this magnitude . ''

		The opportune arrival of
Buell	ORGANIZATION	's troops enabled Grant to win a great victory the second day ; but then came his lamentable failure to follow up and destroy the demoralized enemy .

		There was no reason why he should not have done so , but '' he utterly failed to seize the opportunity , '' '' he entirely failed to rise to the height of this occasion . ''

		If he had done what he might have done , the Confederacy would have been irretrievably weakened by the annihilation of one of its two great armies .

		Evidently , Grant had not yet found himself .

		We can not follow the interesting discussion of the several campaigns of the eventful year of
1862	DATE	, and must content ourselves with stat - ing a few of Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	's judgments of men and events .

		It is interesting to contrast his estimates of the leading Federal generals with those of the enemy .

		Those of the
North	ORGANIZATION	, with the simple exception of
Buell	PERSON	, are shown to have been failures more or less complete .

		Hal - leck ,
McClellan	PERSON	, Pope , and
Burnside	PERSON	make a poor showing beside
A. S. Johnston	PERSON	,
J. E. Johnston	PERSON	, and Lee .

		The appointment of
Hal	PERSON	- leck , though the natural one at the time , was as bad as could have been made .

		He was without insight to detect the crisis of a campaign , or energy to strike when the moment of advan - tage came .

		He is shown , in this impartial nar - rative , as a weak man , self-confident , greedy of power , ready to assume responsibility , unwill - ing to cooperate generously with his associates , guilty of disastrous blunders .

		He was not a soldier by temperament or ability , though he had written a highly esteemed book on the art of war and was accounted an authority on mili - tary questions .

		In his discussion of General
McClellan	PERSON	and the famous Peninsular Campaign , Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	is much less harsh than most writers , though the
General	ORGANIZATION	's weaknesses are plainly indicated .

		His constitutional slowness , his excessive cau - tion , his inability to estimate his enemy 's power and his consequent failure to take advantage of his opportunities to strike a fatal blow , all these well-known defects are clearly shown .

		But his skill as a tactician and organizer , and as a leader of men , are also set forth ; and though his career as a whole - is shown to be a failure , and his defects the cause of the loss of many thousands of lives and of the prolonga - tion of the war , the reader feels that full jus - tice has been done him .

		He , too , had oppor - tunities , during this eventful year , to inflict a fatal blow upon the enemy ; but he failed to use these opportunities , and hundreds of thou - sands of lives were the penalty of his incompe - tency .

		As for Pope and
Burnside	PERSON	, there is no need of taking space to show that Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	agrees with all other writers in declaring them almost absurdly incompetent for the high posi - tions to which they were appointed .

		So , while the administration was groping about for competent leaders for its armies , it was training them , at fearful cost , for future victories .

		Meanwhile , the civilians at the head of the government , having little confidence in their military agents , interfered and directed ,

		THE DIAL 153 and made the bad conditions worse .

		It is a sad story , but may as well be frankly told .

		The Confederates , on the other hand , were able to find at the outset competent leaders for their armies .

		These , too , made blunders , and many of them ; but they were able men , and used the forces committed to them wisely and on the whole successfully .

		Of General Lee Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	says : '' In intellect it may be doubted whether he was supe - rior to the able soldier whom be succeeded ; ... but in that fortunate combination of qualities physical , mental , and moral which go to make up a great com - mander ,
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	was unquestionably more favored than any of the leaders of the Civil War ... Lee 's position was unique ; no army commander on either side was so universally believed in so absolutely trusted .

		Nor was there ever a commander who better deserved the support of his government , and the affection and confidence of his soldiers . ''

		Lee was undoubtedly reckless , astonishingly so , in his operations during this year , and gave many opportunities to his enemies .

		But he knew the calibre of the men opposed to him , and that he could take liberties with them which he could not have taken with competent generals ; and the results justified his reckless boldness .

		He depended greatly , too , on his able subordinates , especially
Stonewall Jack	PERSON	- son , who never but once failed him .

		A portfolio of excellent maps accompanies the volume .

		We shall look with interest for Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	's next volume , which will deal with the stirring campaigns of
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	and

		THE FUNCTIONS AND REVENUES OF GOVERNMENT .

		* The word '' finance '' has been persistently used in English , both in everyday usage and to some extent even in the works of economic writers , as a general term referring rather indefinitely to the whole range of monetary and commercial affairs .

		But the
Science of Finance	ORGANIZATION	, in the more correct sense in which Professor
Adams	PERSON	uses the term , has to do only with pub - lic expenditures and public income , and the relations necessarily involved in their consid - eration ; it '' undertakes an analysis of the wants of the

		wants may be supplied . ''

		Problems of money , currency , and banking , which have to do merely with the mechanism by which financial opera - tions are carried on , are not admitted to a place in the science ; much less are questions of '' private financiering , '' such as have to do with the management of business corporations .

		It was natural enough that the same word should be popularly applied to the revenues of states and cities and to the funds of private corpora - tions , but this double use of the word has led to no little confusion .

		Nearly all writers on the
Science of Finance	ORGANIZATION	devote comparatively little attention to expendi - tures , or else neglect that side of the subject altogether ; and the result in either case is un - satisfactory .

		It would seem that public expendi - tures , considering the variety and importance of the objects for which they are incurred , might well receive even more attention than the man - ner of meeting them ; but the science of public expenditures is as yet undeveloped , except as a mere introduction to the study of revenues .

		Professor
Adams	PERSON	has , indeed , done not a little to develop it , first in his '' Relation of the State to Industrial Action '' and to some extent in his '' Public Debts , '' and now in his more comprehensive '' Science of Finance . ''

		He says that ''
the Science of Finance	ORGANIZATION	has no opinion respecting the question of the proper limit of public duties , '' but his actual treatment of the subject is by no means so inadequate as this disclaimer might lead one to expect .

		A few passages by way of illustration : '' It is futile to urge disarmament , and the consequent extinction of the military budget , so long as there con - tinues to be a conflict of legal ideas .

		... It is no acci - dent that the first approach to a successful tribunal for the arbitration of international disputes should rest upon negotiations for a treaty between
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, for these peoples practise the same sys - tem of jurisprudence .

		Their theory of rights , and the method by which they aim to enforce those rights , are the same .

		A standing international tribunal resting on agreement between
England	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, however , or between the
United States	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	, is beyond the range of reasonable expectation at the present time ; for it is only upon the basis of a common system of juris - prudence that a system of international law can be developed which shall render the preparation for war unnecessary . '' ''

		A local government may very properly enter upon a more comprehensive line of activities than the national government , since the more restricted the territory over which a government has jurisdiction , the greater likeli - hood will there be of community of interests among its citizens . '' ''

		It seems probable , when one regards the social evils wrought by corporations in certain industries of collec - tive interests , that local governments at least will ex - 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, pand rather than contract the sphere of government administration . '' ''

		It is essential for the modern State to support pub - lic instruction , because there is no other way to guard against the fading of its own ideals through the rise of an aristocracy of learning .

		It is natural thatinstitutions that look to the wealthy for further endowments should be influenced in their administration by the interests of the wealthy class ; ... and it requires no great insight to perceive that the final result of exclusive reliance upon private benefactions for any phase or grade of ed - ucation will be that the instruction provided will riot only reflect the interests of a class , but will be confined to a class .

		... A
State	ORGANIZATION	which aims to perpetuate de - mocracy can not decline to make ample provision at public expense for all phases and forms of education .

		In no other way can a system of public instruction , which is by far the most potent agency in shaping civilization , be brought to the support of democracy . ''

		Again , we are told that the normal law of public expenditures for the enforcement of fac - tory legislation , and for public commissions , is that such expenditures will continue to increase until industrial development has run its course , or until the character of government itself shall have been changed by some great upheaval ; that governments must continually increase the amount of money at the disposal of their statis - tical service ; that expenditures for forestry , irrigation , and public improvements for the ben - efit of commerce will also increase with the growth of society ; but that , on the other hand , expenditures for the protective functions of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, as distinguished from its developmental functions , tend to decrease in proportion as the protective service of the
State	ORGANIZATION	succeeds .

		There is here at least the foundation of a science of public activities .

		Professor
Adams	PERSON	rejects the statistical method of studying public expenditures , and confines himself to a theoretical discussion , because the former could not be satisfactorily applied , and because the latter is essential in any case .

		But besides the a priori method on the one hand and the purely statistical method on the other , there is the historical - comparative method , which is often applied to particular problems of public economy , and might be employed in developing the science as a whole .

		A theoret - ical treatment , even when so philosophical as that of Professor
Adams	PERSON	, is not wholly satis - factory , because the considerations which de - termine governmental action are of an eminently practical nature , and may easily vary from place to place ; while at the same time a merely statistical study would not be enough , chiefly because the more important results of govern - mental action are incapable of quantitative measurement .

		Neither political philosophy nor statistics , therefore , ought to be expected to determine what are the proper functions of government .

		The consideration of public revenues also involves a study of certain governmental activ - ities , which Professor
Adams	PERSON	classifies into industries undertaken for the purpose of secur - ing revenue , those in which revenue is incidental to service , and those undertaken primarily for service ; and for each class a distinct rule is given for the adjustment of charges .

		The main division of the work , however , is devoted to Taxation .

		Here , after elucidating the princi - ples , and approving progressive rates as being most in accordance with individual ability , the author devotes a chapter to '' Suggestions for a Revenue System . ''

		He would assign to the federal government the taxation of interstate commerce , in addition to the customs and ex - cise duties ; to the States he would give taxes on the business of corporations , other than interstate commerce , and on inheritances ; and to the local governments he would assign taxes on land , on professional incomes , on licenses , and on municipal franchises .

		The theoretical basis of this proposed arrangement is that each government should tax those industries with which it holds some fundamental or constitu - tional relation .

		Twelve years ago Professor
Adams	PERSON	wrote that '' one of the chief difficulties under which we in this country suffer , in our endeavors to solve the problem of monopolies , arises from the fact that our publicists and statesmen pro- ceed in profound ignorance of the meaning and purpose of the science of finance . ''

		For that ignorance they have no longer any excuse .

Matthew Arnold	PERSON	was a literary evangelist , proclaiming every - where by word of voice and pen the gospel of literary culture .


Henry Drummond	PERSON	, as is evi - dent from Dr.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 155 was with the educated classes , and particularly with college students ; and the movements which he set on foot with them are still powerful and progressive .

		Drummond 's sincerity , open - mindedness , intellectuality , and sympathy with science , made him the friend and helper of vast numbers whose religious life was being troubled by doubts suggested by science .

		The enormous success of his '' Natural Law in the Spiritual World , '' and of many of his Addresses , lay in his identifying Nature with Christianity , and showing the natural foundation of Christianity as a law of love .

		From whichever side we take
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's position , as either naturalistic Christianity or Christianized naturalism , it was a gospel of a reconciliation of science and relig - ion which appealed very powerfully to his read - ers and hearers . ''

		To
Henry Drummond	PERSON	, Christianity was the crown of the evolution of the whole universe .

		The drama which absorbed him is upon a stage infinitely wider than the moral life of man .

		The soul , in its battle against evil , in its service for Christ , is no accident or exception , thrown upon a world all hostile to its feeble spirit .

		But the forces it represents are the primal forces of the universe ; the great laws which modern science has unveiled sweep - ing through life from the beginning work upon the side of the man who seeks the things that are above . ''

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	opens his work with a strong sketch of the man in his winning personality . ''

		We watched him , our fellow-student and not yet twenty-three , surprised by a sudden and a fierce fame .

		Crowds of men and women in all the great cities of our land hung upon his lips , innumerable lives opened their secrets to him , and made him aware of his power over them .

		When his first book was published , he , being then thirty-three , found another world at his feet ; the great of the land thronged him ; his social opportunities were boundless ; and he was urged by the chief states - man of our time to a political career .

		This was the kind of a trial which one has seen wither some of the finest characters , and distract others from the simplicity and resolution of their youth .

		He passed through it unscathed ; it neither warped his spirit nor turned him from his accepted vocation as a teacher of religion ... There - was a never a glimpse of a phylactery nor a smudge of unction about his religion .

		He was one of the purest , most unselfish , most reverent souls you ever knew , but you would not have called him a saint .

		The name he went by among younger men was The Prince ' ; there was a distinction and a radiance upon him that compelled the title . ''

		While Professor
Smith	PERSON	can not easily and nat - urally call a man who plays cricket and bil - liards and enjoys a good cigar a '' saint , '' yet he compares
Drummond	PERSON	's influence to that of a mediaeval saint .

		He was the confessor of multitudes of men and women of all classes . ''

		They brought him alike their mental and phys - ical troubles .

		Surest test of a man 's love and holiness , they believed in his prayers as a remedy for their dis - eases and a sure mediation between their sinful souls and God .

		It is with a certain hesitation that one asserts so much as this , yet the evidence in his correspondence is indubitable ; and as the members of some great churches are taught to direct their prayers to the fam - ous saints of
Christendom	LOCATION	, so , untaught and naturally , as we shall see , more than one have since his death found themselves praying to
Henry Drummond	PERSON	. ''

		Professor Smith traces and emphasizes Drum - mond 's progress from the strict orthodoxy of his early life to his later more enlarged and liberal views by which his evangelism gained power with men of high education and thought .

		Evolutionary Science and Biblical Criticism came to have great weight with him , and he gave up verbal inspiration , and found in rev - elation an evolution .

		, . '

		.

		; A clear account is given of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's evangelism in
Glasgow	LOCATION	, with
Moody	ORGANIZATION	and San - key , and among British ,
American	ORGANIZATION	, and Aus - tralian students .

		This book also includes letters and diaries of travel in
America	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	, and the new Hebrides .

		These are often bright and vivid , as in this African sketch : '' At
Zomba	LOCATION	, on the
Sabbath	LOCATION	, we had a service for the natives the real ' Missionary Record ' kind of a thing ; white men with Bibles under a spreading tree , sur - rounded by a thick crowd of naked natives .

		We sang hymns from a hymn-book in the native tongue to Scotch psalm-tunes , and then spoke through an interpreter .

		Unfortunately , the service was brought to rather an abrupt conclusion .

		I had just finished speaking when a tremendous shriek rose from the crowd , and the con - gregation dispersed in a panic in every direction .

		A hugh snake had fallen from the tree right into the thick of them .

		A bombshell could not have done its work faster , but no one was hurt , and the beast disappeared like magic beneath some logs .

		The snakes rarely do harm , and I have never heard of a serious case . ''

		While we can not say that this book is over - eulogistic , yet we miss the marks of common and weak humanity .

		Drummond does not ap - pear to have had a redeeming vice ; we should have felt better satisfied to have known , say , that at least once in his life he got angry and swore profanely .

		Peter and
Paul	PERSON	and all the saintly characters of Scripture have their fail - ings , but
Drummond	PERSON	stands out in these pages as an admirable and perfect
Crichton	PERSON	.

		But , after all , we are glad to believe that here is the highest type of Christian knight , sans peur et sans reproche , an ideal soul , earnest , tender , true , of noblest spirituality and deepest sincer - ity .

		But we can not esteem
Drummond	PERSON	a great man , nor yet that he attained his full stature and maturity .

		We feel that here was a prom - ising tree forced to too early and abundant fruitage , and so exhausted for the most mature and permanent work .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	has 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, certainly given us an able and interesting his - tory of an eager , high-wrought soul , plunged in the vortex of our later nineteenth century life , moved by most manifold currents , and yet attaining a most noble and useful life .

		Another great evangelist , who resembled
Drummond	PERSON	in his power of Christian love , but was more narrow in his interests and straighter in his orthodoxy , was
Newman Hall	PERSON	.

		We have from his pen a chatty and pleasant ''
Autobi	PERSON	- ography , '' in which he seeks to keep out of '' the track of ordinary religious memoirs '' in not speaking exclusively of his public career and religious experience , but also speaking freely of himself in all his relations with the men of his time , and narrating incidents of all kinds .

		He tells a number of first-rate stories , two of which we must quote .

		At

Sunday	DATE	surprised the con - gregation by announcing , in his usual monotone , Let us sing to the praise and glory of God , a psalm of my own composing a psalm of my own composing ! '

		... In a family of my church was a devoutly-behaved dog , which regularly occupied its accustomed seat at family prayers , and remained motionless till the ' Amen ' at the close .

		One day when I was conducting the service , I read the fifth chapter of the Revelation , and when I came to the fourteenth verse , ' And the four beasts said Amen ! '

		the dog jumped from his chair and began bark - ing as usual , as if all were over .

		This was too much for the assembly 's gravity ; host and hostess , servants and friends , could not prevent laughter blending with barking , and the service ended with the dog 's ' Amen . ' ''

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	gives a chapter to
Gladstone	LOCATION	, which throws some light on that statesman 's character .

		There is also interesting mention of his ac - quaintance with
John Bright	PERSON	,

Newman Hall	PERSON	's pastorates , both in Hull and
London	LOCATION	, were thoroughly evangelistic in their nature .

		It was at Hull that he composed the tract '' Come to Jesus , '' which has circulated by the million .

		During the Civil War , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	was influential as a friend of the North , and his American evangelizing tours , of which he gives a sketch , will be recalled by many .

		The mild and gentle spirit , the fervid and simple piety , of the author pervades his book , which is of interest on many accounts , and has consid - erable value for the religious historian .

		TRAVEL , IN MANY LANDS .

		* Arctic exploration has received a new impetus within the
last decade	DATE	.

		The ice-bound lands in the frigid zones have suddenly assumed a new import - ance .

		Sir
Martin Conway	PERSON	's experiences in
Spitz	LOCATION	- bergen since the beginning of
1896	DATE	have done much to set us right in our estimate of that country .

		The results of his first adventures , in
1896	DATE	, were em - bodied in his '' First Crossing of
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	. ''

		The present volume , '' With Ski and Sledge over Arctic Glaciers , '' is to be regarded as an appendix to that account .

		In company with Mr.
E. J. Garwood	PERSON	, a geologist and photographer , and two Norwegians , this undaunted Englishman set out to investigate many of the tremendous glaciers , ice fjords , and lofty snow and ice mountains of this arctic land , four hundred miles north of
North Cape	LOCATION	, and unin - habited by any permanent population .

		To read the crisp account of their tramps over ice gorges and chasms , through blinding snowstorms , and on their ski .

		or snowshoes , is close akin to enjoying the same experiences .

		An expert 's popular descrip - tion of the movements of a great glacier , and of its final crash into the waters of the bay , is a bit of exceedingly good reading .

		The important result of this brief two months ' trip was the determination of the fact that
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	is not , as held by earlier explorers , covered with an ice-sheet .

		This term does not describe the condition of things in arctic lands , and should be expunged from the geograph - ical vocabulary .

		The so-called ice-sheets are merely glacial and mountain areas on either side of water - sheds tending toward the sea .

		Neither do glaciers excavate great valleys , as popularly held .

		The familiar , easy method of telling his story inspires confidence in the author 's knowledge and his ability to arrive at sound conclusions .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 157 In '' Through Arctic Lapland '' we have the nar - rative of two daring Englishmen who set sail from
London	LOCATION	to test their adventurous spirits in the far north .

		They land at Yards , on the north coast of
Finland	LOCATION	, in early
summer	DATE	.

		Their goal is the
Gulf of Bothnia	LOCATION	, four hundred miles overland toward the south .

		To discourage them at the outset , they find that in the
summer	DATE	no route of travel exists in that direction ; in fact , the frequency of lakes and swamps makes such an adventure next to impossible .

		But the doughty Englishmen push ahead , secure short-route guides , travel double the straight-line distance , wade through swamps , row across lakes , float down rivers , tramp through forests , until , weary yet wiser men , they hail the sails of a Swedish ves - sel in the northernmost harbor of
Bothnia	LOCATION	.

		These polyglot and much-travelled travellers show a prodi - gious amount of pluck in enduring hardships , man - aging obstreperous Lapps and Finns , fighting mill - ions of vicious musquitos , and keeping good-natured through it ill .

		The customs and habits of the peo - ples of that almost solitary country are told in a humorous and spicy narrative by Mr.
Cutcliffe Hyne	PERSON	, amply illustrated by the sketches of Mr.
Hayter	PERSON	, the author 's companion .

		Chitrdl is located on the
Chitral	LOCATION	river , one of the sources of the Indus river , up in the district of the Hindu Kush mountains . ''

		The dominant note of Chitrdl , '' says Sir
George S. Robertson	PERSON	, author of ''
Chitral	LOCATION	, the Story of a Minor Siege , '' '' is bigness combined with desolation ; vast , silent mountains cloaked in eternal snow , wild glacier-born torrents , cruel precipices , and pastureless hillsides where the ibex and the markhor find a precarious subsistence . ''

		Down deep in the gorges of these oppressive and ever-present mountains resides a restless and wretched population of natives , controlled almost wholly by the devotees of Mohammed .

		The con - test for sovereignty among the native claimants to the throne precipitated a revolution in the winter of 1894-95 .

		Chitnil is almost on the borderland between British
India	LOCATION	and
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, and was under the protectorate of
England	LOCATION	.

		The assassina - tion of the local ruler led to an attempt by the ruler at
Kabul	LOCATION	to assume control of the district .

		The British Indian troops which had gone to the rescue were defeated , driven within their fort , and besieged for nearly two months .

		In the meantime , detach - ments of native soldiers under English officers were hurrying , in the dead of winter , from the north and from the south to rescue their comrades .

		Some of these men were ambushed , others were taken by treachery , and still others suffered untold hardships in crossing snow-capped and snow-bound mountains .

		The besieged gallantly held out , through great suf - fering , until the approach of English troops caused the flight of the besiegers and the rescue of the be - sieged .

		This is a thrilling and tragical story , told in chaste and forceful language by the commander in the siege .

		Its political significance gives it a value which far outranks that of ordinary books of war or of travel .

		The far-reaching influence of a medical mission - ary , especially that of a wise woman , among the vast populations of
India	LOCATION	, is shown with surprising effect by Dr.
Armstrong-Hopkins	PERSON	in her book en - titled '' Within the Purdah . ''

		The down-trodden , hopeless condition of woman , not only in the secluded harems of princes but in open air everyday life , is enough to make one either pessimistic or actively energetic in inaugurating new means of relief .

		While the British government has done much to mitigate the deadly power of vicious customs , there is a wide chasm between the woman of
India	LOCATION	and ordinary comfort and freedom .

		This book shows where
Great Britain	LOCATION	and other enlightened nations can accom - plish marvels for this caste-enslaved and suffering people .

		The native princes can be won by shrewd - ness and skill of the right kind to banish heartless and harmful rites , and to order themselves and their subjects according to higher principles of govern - ment and human right .

		The Yangtse is to
China	LOCATION	what the
Mississippi	LOCATION	is to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It drains the heart of
China	LOCATION	, embracing an area of 600,000 square miles , with a population of about 180,000,000 of as industrious and peaceful a people as are to be found on the earth 's surface .

		This area is now known as the '' British sphere of influence . ''

		Its great river is navigable by the largest ocean steamers as far as Hankow six hundred miles inland ; then for five hundred more by steamboats to Ichang .

		From this point upwards it is almost one succession of gorges and rapids , through a most picturesque and wild country , though densely populated .

		English trade on the banks of this river has reached enormous proportions .

		Ten years ago , Professor
A. J. Little	PERSON	, author of '' Through the Yangtse Gorges , '' excited his influence to push navigation farther up stream .

		After the China-Japanese war he succeeded in se - curing concessions of various kinds .

		Within the past year he has himself conducted a steamer through several dangerous series of rapids five hundred miles above
Ichang	LOCATION	to Chung-king , the highest point of steam navigation yet reached .

		In addition to a clear and concise narrative of the methods of navi - gation and difficulties encountered on the way , Mr.
Little	PERSON	shows by statistics the wonderfully rich re - sources of this inland empire , this river empire .

		The power of English diplomats and merchants is seen in every gain made in the confidence of the
China	LOCATION	- man .

		The book is full of rare incidents observed by a wide-awake scholarly Englishman .

		The Malay peninsula proper , extending south - ward from
Indo-China	LOCATION	, is 850 miles long by 210 in its widest part , between 10 30 ' N. and 1 22 ' N. Its territory embraces about 82,000 square miles , and its population is about 1,400,000 .

		Its most noted seaport is
Singapore	LOCATION	.

		Fifteen years in the jungles , on the mountain sides , and in the malarial plains of this little-known peninsula , form the basis of Mr.
Rathborne	PERSON	's book on '' Camping and Tramp - ing in
Malaya	LOCATION	. ''

		In his brief preface , the author acknowledges that he is more skilled in the use of 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, the parang , to cut his way through the jungles , than in the use of the pen .

		Mr.
Rathborne	PERSON	takes his own method of telling his story .

		He describes with great detail many of his numerous tramps and trips back and forth through the peninsula and along its shore lines .

		Mingled with this description of the immediate occurrences of his trip , we find frequently little scraps of early history as in the case of
Malacca	LOCATION	, accounts of curious habits of the wild animals of the jungles , illustrated by some experi - ence of his own , and of the character of the natives .

		Incidentally , the resources , the products , the mixed population , the dangers , and the prospects of the country receive ample mention .

		The lack of good roads , the thickness of the forests , the lurking wild beasts , and the enemies of human life , on the land and in the air , tested the patience and endurance of this
Briton	LOCATION	.

		The English government , though able to do much for the natives , has not lived up to its opportunity -LRB- p. 126 -RRB- .

		It has not suppressed , but rather has encouraged by licensing , some of the worst vices in the land .

		In spite of these things , the British forces have suppressed the state of an - archy of two decades ago , and are gradually lifting the natives up to a higher plane of living .

		The whole story is enlivened by vigorous illustration .

		Mr.
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	's '' Cruise under the Crescent '' is a chatty record of his tour along the conventional route of travellers to
Syria	LOCATION	.

		In a very familiar , off-hand style , he describes his jour - ney from Port Said to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, to
Damascus	LOCATION	, to
Baalbek	LOCATION	, to
Beirut	LOCATION	, to
Athens	LOCATION	, to
Stamboul	LOCATION	, and so on .

		The text is besprinkled with sketches , many of them giving quite an adequate idea of the thing represented .

		The observations of the author show in an interesting way the impressions made upon the acute mind of an intelligent traveller .

		The
Greco	PERSON	- Turkish war was short , sharp , and de - cisive .

		But its results can not be measured .

		Many shrewd and acute correspondents were on the field to note for permanent preservation the events of each day .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	, author of '' With the Greeks in
Thessaly	LOCATION	, '' must have been , we judge , among the best of these .

		This compact little volume testifies to his activity and descriptive power .

		He was the special war correspondent of
Reuters	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and consequently had the best of opportunities for close observation on the field .

		The political matters dis - cussed are based , says the author , upon information of men who were close to the political movements of the day .

		The narrative preserves with great faithfulness the exact form in which it was written in the heat of conflict .

		The plans and maps help one to secure a very vivid picture of that sudden and , to the Greeks , disastrous plunge of the Turk - ish army into
Thessaly	LOCATION	.

		Central
Africa	LOCATION	has not ceased to be of genuine interest , both to the diplomat and to the anthro - pologist .

		In the heart of that Dark Continent are many unexplored regions and unsolved mysteries .

		Captain
Burrows	PERSON	, author of '' The Land of the Pig - mies , '' had many facilities , as an officer in the em - ploy of
Belgium	LOCATION	, for wide observation .

		The char - acter of the native tribes in different districts of the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	are extremely interesting .

		The cannibal natives are not all extinct , but rather flour - ish , though in the presence of the white man they endeavor to conceal their custom .

		The pigmies of
Central Africa	LOCATION	, though occupying but small space in this volume , are a unique little people , whom Cap - tain
Burrows	PERSON	had good opportunities for studying .

		Many of the real problems of Central African trade are yielding to the introduction of the railroad and its increasing activities .

		Enough illustrations are inserted in this book to make it a picture-volume of Central African peoples and customs .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		More history of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		With Volume III. , now ready , Mr.
William Laird Clowes	PERSON	's monumental and lavishly equipped history of '' The
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- passes the half-way stage in its progress toward completion in the forthcoming fifth volume .

		The sufficiently comprehensive and liberal lines on which the work was projected we have already set forth somewhat fully in our review of the opening instalment -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Sept. 1 , 1897	DATE	-RRB- .

		The present volume covers the civil history of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, the major and minor operations of its military history , and the record of voyages and discoveries , during the period
1714	DATE	-
1792	DATE	, inclusive .

		The contributors are Mr.
William Laird Clowes	PERSON	, Mr.
L. Carr Laughton	PERSON	, Sir
Clements R. Markham	PERSON	, and
Captain A. T. Mahan Captain Mahan	ORGANIZATION	's quota occupying about a third of the vol - ume , and treating in that admirable naval writer 's usual masterly way of the major operations of the War of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Owing to the unexpected length of some of the articles , the editor has been compelled to reserve Mr.
W. H. Wilson	PERSON	's chapter on the minor operations of the Revolution for inclusion in the volume next forthcoming .

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	takes occasion to allude in his preface in laudatory terms to the recent exploits of the Amer - ican
Navy	ORGANIZATION	at
Santiago	LOCATION	and ''
Manilla	LOCATION	'' -LRB- as he elects to spell it -RRB- , and to indicate a hope that when the British sailor 's turn at the laurels shall come he will be found in no way inferior to his '' brothers of the New World . ''

		It is to be feared that the British sailor 's professional anxiety to emulate the recent achievements of these same long lost and newly dis - covered American '' brothers '' may prove a not inconsiderable stumbling-block in the way of disarm - ament projects and peace ideals generally .

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's work is not , and can not reasonably be expected to be , quite impeccable in point of minor errors of detail that might have been rectified by searching and constant reference to original sources .

		We are inclined to admit the reasonableness of his plea that '' to be content with nothing short of abso - lute completeness and finality in an undertaking of
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 159 this kind '' would involve the drawback that '' neither the initiator , nor , after his death , any of his suc - cessors , would live long enough to finish the work . ''

		On the whole , the volumes thus far are so much fairer , more accurate , and more comprehensive than any former presentation of British naval history .

		that only critics of the captious sort will fail to be truly grateful for them .

		The numerous illustrations are well selected and handsomely executed , and there is an index to each volume .

		Story of
the Union of Italy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
W. J. Stillman	PERSON	, since his retire - ment from active service as Italian correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' has engaged himself busily in certain long-projected literary undertakings .

		One of these the preparation of his memoirs will doubtless result in a book of the most readable sort , a book the appearance of which we anticipate with much pleas - ure .

		Meanwhile , Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	has already com - pleted another task which he was peculiarly well - fitted to perform , and tells us , in a new volume of the '' Cambridge Historical Series , '' the thrilling story of '' The Union of
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Hav - ing made this statement , we hasten to qualify two of the words which it contains .

		Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	is certainly well-fitted to write of the Risorgimento , but prejudice and the disillusionment of advancing years have conspired to impair his powers of judg - ment ; the story itself is certainly thrilling , but Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	's narrative is so matter-of-fact that it would hardly help anyone unacquainted with the great action which it chronicles to understand the Italian poems of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		Still , we are much indebted to the author for what he has done .

		He was a close observer of at least the later phases of the revolutionary movement , in which he himself all but participated , and he has had a wide acquaintance with the men who were conspicuous in that movement .

		Admiration for
Cavour	PERSON	has unfortunately had upon him the effect that it has had upon some other historians of the period : it has made him grossly unfair to
Mazzini	PERSON	, unfair mainly in the negative way of saying little about him , but occasionally unfair in the more un - pleasant ways of innuendo and contemptuous char - acterization .

		That
the Union of Italy	ORGANIZATION	was far more the work of
Mazzini	PERSON	than of
Cavour	ORGANIZATION	is a proposition that we hold to be beyond question , and no history of that achievement in which
Mazzini	PERSON	does not ap - pear as the central figure can be more than a his - tory of its externals .

		Professor
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	has done much for classical scholarship , and at the same time has shown a breadth of culture and a versatility of mind very commendable in this day of intense specialization .

		His latest production in the shape of a book at least is a translation of Petronius into very ver - nacular English -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with a con - siderable amount of editorial accompaniment .

		In '' Trimalchio 's Sinner . ''

		his introduction , the editor has sketched briefly the history of prose fiction in
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Prose fiction , as opposed to theological myth , derives from the beast fable , which is purely oriental in its origin .

		The romance , historical and of adventure , the novel of character , the novel of pastoral life , all find their beginnings here .

		Lost to
Western Europe	LOCATION	in the Dark Ages , these tales , blended with the traditions of the Teutonic peoples , found their way into the ''
Gesta Romanorum	PERSON	, '' that `` perfect mirage of odds and ends , '' the connecting link between the fiction of classic times and the fiction of to-day .

		Following this , we have a brief characterization of Petronius , a history of the '' Satira , '' and a word of criticism , or rather encomium , which closes with this dictum : '' To seek a fitting parallel for his strangely brilliant fiction , we must pass over the intervening centuries and find it only in our own century and in the lit - erary art of modern
France	LOCATION	. ''

		As a third feature of the introduction , Professor
Peck	PERSON	gives us a note of presentation to Trimalchio himself , with a hint of the riches in store for us .

		This very fittingly leads to the dinner itself , where we have game made out of pork , and peacock eggs cut from pastry .

		The extravagant luxury of the table is typical of an age when wealth came easily and the appetites were men 's gods . ''

		Trimalchio 's Dinner '' is valuable as a picture of the life of the Roman bourgeoisie .

		In Trimalchio himself , we have the Roman freedman who has accrued vast wealth suddenly .

		Proud of his estates , well-meaning , generous to a fault , boast - ful of his libraries in Greek and Latin , ignorant of the very forms of his own tongue , he is a veritable snob .

		To the scholar , the original , in the many little details of life , is of archaeological value ; and the text offers much of linguistic interest to the gen - eral reader as well .

		The book closes with a valu - able bibliography of the primitive forms of fiction , of Greek and Roman fiction , of Roman life in the time of Petronius , of the text and translations .

		The translation is well done , and the rollicking humor of the original is sustained throughout .

		The Latin slang finds equivalents in English which are cer - tainly effective , although at times rather startling .

		The illustrations are very helpful , and the entire make-up of the book is commendable .

		A satisfactory review of Sir
James H.	PERSON	Twelve Mries R am8ay ' s u Foundations of
England	LOCATION	'' of British history .

		* -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- would require a mono - graph in itself if the points of interest to the eager historical student were to be adequately noted and commented upon .

		The work is an authoritative narrative , in two large volumes , of the history of
England	LOCATION	from 55 B. C. to
1154	DATE
A. D	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is author - itative in the sense that not a fact is given nor an opinion expressed for which the writer does not cite volume and page of the book or document from which he has drawn his material .

		The style is in no way remarkable , nor is there any novelty of method to attract the reader of history who looks for striking characterizations ; but for reference 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, purposes , for convenience to the student in discov - ering quickly what the best scholarship has deter - mined in regard to the institutions of any particular period , the work is simply invaluable .

		It will he a standard work of reference in every college library in the country .

		A point of somewhat unusual inter - est is the location fixed upon for the battle of
Mons Grampius	LOCATION	, or Groupius , as the author prefers to call it .

		The view taken is that in the year 84
A. D. Agricola	PERSON	advanced from
Ardoch	LOCATION	to
Perth	LOCATION	, from
Perth	LOCATION	to
Coupar Angus	PERSON	, and from
Coupar Angus	PERSON	to
Delvine	LOCATION	, situated on the north bank of the river Tay some thirty-five miles northeast of
Stirling	LOCATION	.

		This site agrees perfectly with the details of the battle as given by
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	, and explains the neces - sity for the curious cavalry manoeuvre which decided the day in favor of the Roman army .

		The jutting promontory of the Redgale Braes made it impossi - ble for the Roman cavalry , after its first charge on the Caledonian left , to wheel round the rear of the enemy 's position , and compelled it to pass back of the Roman infantry in order to make the final and decisive charge against the right .

		Two excellent maps accompany the description of this battle .

		c
A. Dana	PERSON	's The war articles Dv
Charles A. Dana	PERSON	, Recollections of recently published in one of the mag - the Civil war .

		az i ne8 , have been gathered into a comely volume entitled '' Recollections of the Civil War '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		When read as a whole they prove to be fascinating in the pungency of the style and the clear directness of the story-telling .

		The book is also important as a contribution to the his - tory of the time , for the author 's official position took him into the heart of things , and he has secured the accuracy which is apt to be wanting in reminiscences , by reference to his almost daily reports of what he saw and heard .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	joined
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's army in
March , 1863	DATE	, commissioned to act as representative in the field for the Secretary of War , and to report everything that should be of interest to the govern - ment at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		He was with the armies through the whole
Vicksburg	LOCATION	campaign , through the
Chattanooga	LOCATION	campaign from
September	DATE	to
Decem	LOCATION	- ber , and through the Wilderness campaign of
1864	DATE	.

		During the intervals between these campaigns , and during the last year of the war , he was in service in the War Department at
Washington	LOCATION	, in intimate relations with the leading men , especially President Lincoln and Secretary
Stanton	PERSON	.

		The mere state - ment of these opportunities will show what the book must be , written by a journalistic genius like Mr.
Dana	PERSON	.

		Its interest is all the greater from the ab - sence of any formal narrative of the author 's ser - vice and adventures .

		He passes over the details , giving striking incidents , brief character sketches , interesting anecdotes , and vivid descriptions of such events as the battles of
Chickamauga	LOCATION	and Chat - tanooga , and
Grant	PERSON	's death-grapple with
Lee	PERSON	in the
Wilderness	LOCATION	.

		His chapter on Lincoln and his Cab - inet is one of the most satisfactory studies of the great War President yet put into print , while nearly the whole book is an indirect study of
Stanton	PERSON	and
Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is one of the most readable , as well as authentic , of those pertaining to the Civil War .

		Newly discovered lt is a curious feeling with which one early poems takes up the '' all but facsimile re - of SMiey .

		print -RRB- j ust published by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	, of the '' Original Poetry by
Victor & Cazire	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Forty years ago Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	discovered , in a rare periodical named ''
Stockdale	PERSON	's Budget , '' that a volume with the above title had been published by
Shelley	PERSON	in
1810	DATE	, and that subsequently , after a few copies had gone into circulation , the youthful poet had destroyed the greater part of the edition .

		For these forty years the possibility of unearthing one of the few copies that escaped destruction had hovered , as an elusive dream , over the fancies of Shelleians in particular and bibliophiles in general .

		At last a copy came to light , bound up with other pamphlets in a book that had come down from the library of the Rev.
C. H. Grove	PERSON	, a brother of the
Harriet Grove	PERSON	to whom many of the poems were addressed .

		To Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	appropriately fell the task of editing a reprint of this unique copy , and the result is now before us , enriched by an editorial preface .

		These pieces , written at the age of eighteen , add nothing to
Shelley	PERSON	's poetical reputation , and indeed the most striking thing about them is the way in which they illustrate the fact that a great poet may begin his career in the most unpromising way .

		But they add a necessary chapter to the poet 's life , and it is a great satisfaction to have discovered what seemed so hopelessly lost .

		We have read a certain amount of carping comment upon this republication , to the general effect that it does no honor to the poet 's memory ; but this seems to us curiously beside the point .

		Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	puts the matter in a nutshell when he says of the question whether the book should have been reprinted , that '' the question ap - pears pertinent , but only to the uninitiated . ''

		It certainly does not appear pertinent to us , and we shall not discuss it .

		In

''

		Nothing but such a book as this , written by '' A British Officer , '' and illustrated by Mr.
R. Caton Woodville	PERSON	from drawings made on the spot , could accent these differences , and ac - cent them in a manner which leaves us better satis - fied with our own military establishment .

		We learn that a man must have an independent income of no mean size if he is to hold his own in one of the '' crack '' British regiments , the maintenance of a
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161 stable for official duties in the cavalry comprising also a number of polo ponies and racing horses , with an occasional hunter , the original outlay run - ning up into several thousands of dollars or their British equivalents .

		Though
England	LOCATION	maintains several military academies of the highest efficiency , many of her officers pass through the hands of a military '' coach , '' and , by undergoing a somewhat severe examination , enter as commissioned officers directly from civilian life .

		To obtain a commission in the most desirable regiments , ascertained wealth and social position are essentials ; and the traditions of the corps take the place of the American 's edu - cation at
West Point	LOCATION	in maintaining the reputation of the army .

		It is evident that much can be said in argument between systems so diverse .

		The book is interestingly written , and replete with detail .

		Modern German , culture .

		The man of culture of the present day as distinguished from the scholar , the scientist , the philosopher on the one hand , and the artist or the amateur on the other probably owes more to contemporary
France	LOCATION	than to contemporary
Germany	LOCATION	.

		He has more of it in him .

		Certainly taking the whole century , French literature and French painting have been more stimulating than German ; French pol - itics and French life have been on the whole inter - esting to more people than German .

		We think this is so in
America	LOCATION	, in spite of the large German element with us ; in spite of the number of our own people , students and artists , who have worked in
Germany	LOCATION	; in spite of the influence of German music and musicians , of German philosophy and German scholarship .

		You will find a dozen who read a French novel to one who reads a German novel , a dozen plays from the French to half a dozen from the German , a dozen travellers familiar with
Paris	LOCATION	to one who knows
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		But it is this very thing , to our mind , that gives a particular value to Professor
Kuno Francke	PERSON	's `` Glimpses of Mod - ern German Culture '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is a book which may serve to open the way to a great many who are now unaware how wonderfully rich is
Germany	LOCATION	to - day in books , pictures , music , political ideas , in things which when once known are as keenly inter - esting to the cultivated mind as anything that can be found in
France	LOCATION	.

		Without going into compari - sons , a lover of French painting and poetry may find something new and worth while in the pictures of
Boecklin	PERSON	and
Thoma	PERSON	, in the poems of
Johanna Ambrosius	PERSON	and
Gustav Falke	PERSON	.

		And if anyone insists on comparing , we may say that there are no French dramatists superior to
Hauptmann	PERSON	and Sudermann -LRB- Mr.
Francke	PERSON	would probably add Wil - denbruch , but we should not -RRB- , no political forces in
France	LOCATION	more interesting than
Bismarck	PERSON	and the Social Demokratie .

		As to music and scholarship , nothing need be said except just to mention them in filling out the idea of what is included in the phrase '' Modern German Culture . ''

		So far as de - tails are concerned , we differ here and there from
Orowth	LOCATION	and curiosities of
South London	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Francke	PERSON	: as to '' The Sunken Bell , '' for in - stance , we hesitate to agree entirely , as to
Bismarck	PERSON	we are very doubtful , as to Wildenbruch we heartily disagree .

		There are naturally differences of opin - ion in such things : Mr.
Francke	PERSON	probably would have more to say for his views than appears here , had he the occasion .

		In these essays he had to say his say in small compass , for the papers are rather short , many of them having been articles in '' The Nation '' and other periodicals .

		We have been somewhat exercised of late over breakfast-books .

		If a man breakfasts alone , has a little time over his breakfast and does not read the daily paper just then , he will hardly find a better moment in the day for a little reading .

		But of course it is not every book that will do : one must select pretty carefully .

		We rather think that Mr.
Francke	PERSON	's book would be a pleasant breakfast companion for a fortnight : the essays are short and suggestive .

		Afterwards one may go back to
Gibbon	PERSON	's '' Mem - oirs , '' or Lander 's `` Conversations , '' or any other old stand-by .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	has taken a nota - ble interest in the history of what is now
London	LOCATION	.

		He has already writ - ten two volumes on
London	LOCATION	and Westminster , de - scriptive of the origin and growth of those ancient places , with their part in the modern
London	LOCATION	.

		He now offers a volume on '' South
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is not strictly a history , but a series of seventeen chapters selected out of a vast mass of material on the subject .

		He begins with South wark marsh , and takes up the growth of the place , the customs of the people , numerous tragical and humorous incidents in the life of those clashing times , and the growth in the political ideas of his forefathers .

		This is all done in the pleasing and graceful style of Mr.
Besant	PERSON	.

		The vividness and reality of the scenes described are heightened by a great number of choice illustrations , a result of the skill of Mr.
Percy Wadham	PERSON	.

		Londoners , and Londoners ' descendants , will find in this luxurious volume ample fascination for several hours of very pleasurable reading .

		Foundation * and In '' The Groundwork of Science '' mutual relations -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Professor St.
George	PERSON	os the sciences .

		Mivart discusses the common foun - dation of all the sciences and the relationships exist - ing between them .

		Epistemology is the science of the sciences .

		After an enumeration of the sciences , notable for some very proper omissions , his specific topics are the objects and the methods of science ; the physical , psychical , and intellectual antecedents of science ; the relation of science to language ; the causes of science , and the nature of its groundwork .

		The work is timely and is eminently suggestive .

		It is itself an example of the clearness of thought and of diction which should characterize all scientific discussions .

		From the conclusion we quote , as a fitting dominant chord : '' The action of an all - pervading but unimaginable intelligence alone affords us any satisfactory conception of the uni - 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, verse as a whole , or of any single portion of the cosmos which may he selected for exclusive study . ''

		A work of somewhat similar purpose , issued by the same publishers , is '' The Sphere of Science , '' by
Professor Hoffman of Union College	ORGANIZATION	.

		After open - ing his subject by a method not widely different from that used by Dr.
Mivart	PERSON	, Dr.
Hoffman	PERSON	gives less attention to the purely metaphysical construc - tion of an ideal edifice in which the various sciences shall appear in their true and intimate relationships , and more to the share which each has in the devel - opment of human knowledge in its present stage of forwardness .

		Particular interest attaches to the author 's discussions of the limitations of science , and his resum6 of the recent progress made in vari - ous directions .

		The works of Dr.
Mivart	PERSON	and Dr.
Hoffman	PERSON	are in a large degree complementary , and may well be read together .

		Dr.
Mellen Chamberlain	PERSON	, whose essay American esiayt on fhe Revolution Impending '' is and addresses .

		111 < ^ t * i so valuable a feature of the Revolu - tionary history gathered into
Winsor	PERSON	's '' Narrative and Critical History of
America	LOCATION	, '' presents , under the leading title `` John Adams '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a series of essays and addresses which deal mainly with American history and American leaders .

		Be - sides the second President ,
Josiah Quincy	PERSON	and
Daniel Webster	PERSON	are considered in appreciative sketches .

		Constitutional and institutional questions are discussed , along with critical estimates of the results of historical study as shown in the volumes by Professor
McMaster	PERSON	and Mr.
Palfrey	PERSON	.

		In the collection of seventeen papers much insight into life is shown , and many thoughts are crystallized into words for the inspiration of those who welcome each addition to the store of volumes of essays bear - ing upon American character and history .

		Historic England history is an appar - ently exhaustless fountain .

		However
New England	LOCATION	.

		muc h may be studied , some new phase continually presents itself for examination , and the apparently trivial things of daily life in the olden time may be so described as to make enter - taining and profitable reading . ''

		Historic Pilgrim - ages in
New England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is one of a rapidly increasing class of books given to details of the homes and the customs of Americans .

		The familiar plan of answering the questions of a bright young companion is adopted , and much that is valuable information is thus set forth .

		There are many illustrations , some of them uncommon , some very familiar ; and the book will serve to while away more than one hour with the fathers of
New England	LOCATION	.

		Those gay armored knights under De Soto must have cut a queer figure , roaming through the torests and swamps of the southern country in search of gold , or perhaps with a faint hope of finding the fabled fountain of perpetual youth .

		There was little of actual accomplishment for
Spain	LOCATION	, but there was a e J Sofo in
Florida	LOCATION	.

		great deal of romance , which culminated , perhaps , in the death of the leader of the expedition and his midnight burial in the river which so often is asso - ciated with his name . ''

		De
Soto	PERSON	in the Land of
Florida	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a very interesting book , in the preparation of which
Miss Graqe King	ORGANIZATION	has shown the same skill she manifested in `` New Or - leans '' and in that story of
Bienville	LOCATION	which finds place in the '' Makers of
America	LOCATION	'' series .

		It is not too difficult for the pleasure and profit of youth , nor is it so simple in narration as to fail to attract the special student of American history .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''


Harper	PERSON	's Scientific Memoirs '' is the name given to a new series of small books which aim to publish , in careful English translations , what may be called the original documents of science .

		Professor
Joseph S. Ames	PERSON	is to be the general editor of the series .

		The following two volumes have appeared : '' The Free Ex - pansion of Gases '' and '' Prismatic and Diffraction Spectra . ''

		The former comprises papers by Gay-Lussac ,
Joule	ORGANIZATION	, and
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	; the latter the classical papers of
Joseph Fraunhofer	PERSON	.

		A few of the titles promised for early publication are : `` Rontgen Rays , '' `` Solutions , '' '' Properties of Ions , '' and '' The Wave Theory of Light . '' ''

		The Shifting and Incidence of Taxation '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- , by Professor
Edwin R. A. Seligman	PERSON	, has just passed into a second edition , which has given the author an oppor - tunity to subject the work to a thoroughgoing revision .

		It is so changed , both in its historical and positive parts , as to be practically a new volume .

		Among the altera - tions may be noted the fuller treatment of the early English literature of the subject , the addition of a chap - ter on the physiocrats , the rewriting of the chapter on the mathematical theory , the closer study of import duties and stamp taxes , and the added index and bibli - ography .

		The work is thus made far more valuable than before , and a still greater credit to American scholarship in this difficult field . ''

		Bible Stories '' is the title of a supplementary vol - ume of '' The Modern Reader 's Bible '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Like the rest of the series to which it belongs , this vol - ume is prepared by Mr.
Richard G. Moulton	PERSON	.

		It is announced as a '' children 's number '' of the series , and contains stories from the Old Testament only .

		A sim - ilar volume of New Testament stories is in course of preparation .

		A much bigger book which deserves mention in the same connection is Mrs.
Harriet S. B. Beale	PERSON	's '' Stories from the Old Testament for Children '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- .

		Here the stories are frankly retold in simple language , as in
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's `` Tales from Shakespeare , '' whereas Mr.
Moulton	PERSON	's volume does not depart -LRB- except for omissions -RRB- from the revised scriptural text . ''

		The Arte or Crafte of Rhethoryke , '' by
Leonard Cox	PERSON	, who was a preacher and schoolmaster in the reigns of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Edward VI.	PERSON	, is the first text-book of rhetoric in the English language .

		The date of its first edition is uncertain , but it can not have been far from
1530	DATE	.

		It is now reprinted under the editorship of Dr.
Frederic Ives Carpenter	PERSON	, with notes and a learned introduction , and appears as a highly acceptable addition to the series of '' English Studies '' published under the auspices of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 163 LITERARY NOTES .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a volume of selections from Pope 's '' Iliad , '' edited by Mr.

		Miss
Beatrice Harraden	PERSON	, it is reported , will soon make a second visit to the
United States	LOCATION	, with
California	LOCATION	for her objective point . ''

		Der Letzte , '' a story by
Herr von Wildenbruch	PERSON	, edited by Dr.
F. G. G. Schmidt	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
William Dudley Foulke	PERSON	's '' Slav or Saxon '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , already twelve years old , now appears in a revised edition .

		It is one of the '' Questions of the Day , '' just as before .

		A selection of '' Scenes de Voyages de Victor Hugo '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Thomas Bertrand Bronson	PERSON	, makes a very attractive little volume for school use .

		The ex - tracts are from '' Le Rhin . '' ''

		The Story of the
Cotton Plant	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
F. Wilkin	PERSON	- son , is the latest addition to '' The Library of Useful Stories , '' published by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and already numbering more than a dozen neat volumes .

		The series of articles on '' Successful Houses , '' which have been appearing for some time in the pages of '' The
House Beautiful	ORGANIZATION	, '' are now published in a hand - somely-illustrated volume by
Messrs. Herbert S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first monthly number of '' A Kipling Note Book , '' devoted to '' illustrations , anecdotes , bibliographical and biographical facts anent this foremost writer of fic - tion , '' is published by
Messrs. M. F. Mansfield & A. Wessels	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lessing 's ''
Minna von Barnhelm	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
A. B. Nichols	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and has the unusual feature -LRB- for a school book -RRB- of a series of twelve illustrations from the etchings by
Chodowiecki	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Our Nation 's Peril : Social Ideals and Social Pro- gress '' is the title of a pamphlet by Dr.
Lewis G. Janes	PERSON	, just published by
Messrs. James H. West & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a scholarly and philosophical protest against the pre - vailing spirit of imperialism .

		A new novel by
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	is to be published in
May	DATE	.

		English readers will be more fortunate than Russian , for they will get the complete work , whereas it is reported that the Russian censor will reduce it by one-third for home consumption .

		Hereafter there is to be a special American edition of '' The Statesman 's Year Book . ''

		The section upon the
United States	LOCATION	will be greatly enlarged , thereby making what has always been an indispensable work of reference even more indispensable than before .

		Mr.
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	will be the American editor and the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	the publishers .

		In emulation of the plays of the '' Hasty Pudding Club '' at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and the '' Students ' Opera Company '' at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, the students of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	will present a musical comedy entitled '' The Deceitful Dean , '' on the
evening	TIME	of
March 10	DATE	, at the
University Gymnasium	ORGANIZATION	.

		The play has been written by local Uni - versity talent , and the parts will be taken by fifty persons .

		The '' Bulletin of the
New York	LOCATION	State Museum '' for last
November	DATE	-LRB- a government publication -RRB- is '' A Guide to the Study of the Geological Collections of the
New York State Museum	ORGANIZATION	, '' prepared by Dr.
Frederick J. H. Merrill	PERSON	.

		It is a very valuable work for students and teachers of geology , having over one hundred full - page photographic plates .

		To put it within the reach of schools , it is supplied at the merely nominal price of
forty cents	MONEY	.

		In sending out this publication for review , there goes with it the following note , which is so sug - gestive of what other States might do that it deserves reproduction : `` The present director and his associates are without exception warmly interested in securing a more active cooperation of the Museum and its staff with the teachers of science in the colleges and schools of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, which the peculiar circumstances of the Museum have heretofore made impracticable , and will be very glad of suggestions from teachers in any insti - tution in the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Science teachers ought to feel some measure of responsibility for notifying the Museum of matters of interest in their locality and act - ing as associate or honorary members of the Museum staff , the scientific officers of which will in turn be glad , as far as practicable , to visit schools where their ser - vices are requested , and give advice and suggestions regarding collections , field work , and other matters of interest .

		An interesting historical account of British Radicalism of the first half of the century fills a large part of the volume ... On the whole , we are able to praise the volume as a moderate and impartial view of the demo - cratization of the Constitution Athenaeum .

		In dealing with his subject Mr.
Rose	PERSON	displays considerable independence of thought , joined to accuracy of detail and clearness of exposition .

		His style , too , is vigorous ; and on the whole he has made a good start for what promises to be a useful and instructive series

Canon of Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	.

		We can highly recommend this able history of
Canon Overton	ORGANIZATION	's , and we hope it may clear the minds of many as to the history of '' The Anglican Revival . ''

		It is by no means a party or an extreme statement of facts , but rather a judicial record of the religious events that have moulded '' The Anglican Revival '' in the Church of
England	LOCATION	during the reign of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		Church Review .

		Dr.
Overton	PERSON	's contribution to this series of handy books is a volume that is well worth reading by men and women who care to know just where the
Established Church	ORGANIZATION	is now , and what are its tendencies

		The author ... writes without bias and with the true spirit of the historian only anxious to secure his facts and to '' nothing extenuate nor aught set down in malice . ''

		Of the movement itself , and its main actors ,
Canon Overton	ORGANIZATION	gives an excellent account .

		He has the literature of the subject at his fingers ' ends , and the story could not be better told .

		t By
C. A. VINCE	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, late Fellow of
Christ 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		We have every reason to regard this as the sanest , most impartial , and intelligent life of
John Bright	PERSON	that has been given to the public .

		Birmingham Gazette .

		Mr.
Vince	PERSON	has had the good sense to allow
John Bright	PERSON	, as far as possible , to speak for himself , and he has shown great discrimination in the selection of pithy typical passages from memorable speeches at critical junctures in the Queen 's reign .

		Speaker .

		An excellent little life of Bright , with a chapter on Bright 's oratory which is admirable and most remarkable .

		It constitutes a brief but careful examination of the characteristics which made Bright the first orator of our time , and appears to us the best examination of the peculiarities of modern English oratory extant .

		Athenceum .

		This little book seems to us , in its way , a remarkable success .

		It is a model of what such a sketch should be sober , well-written , with the matter well-ordered , and throughout a tone of judicial care not unmixed with enthusiasm .

		Academy .

		Mr.
Vince	PERSON	's biography of Bright is a model of its kind .

		It gives us an admirable picture of the man whom Lord
Salisbury	PERSON	rightly characterized as the greatest master of English oratory that recent generations have seen .

		Price ,
$ 2.00	MONEY	. ''

		In Mr.
DeKay	PERSON	's book the germ is found in the religious association that originally attached to some bird which had been invested with di - vine attributes .

		It was a field that lay open to an enthusiastic explor - er , and has been well worked by the author .

		Every page is stored with the results of wide research , but the arrajr of facts never becomes tedi - ous , for they have been thoroughly assimilated and set forth with a simplicity that makes the reading easy and enjoyable , while affording a clear and reasonable thread of thought to guide the reader through this grotesque jungle of old beliefs .

		On the other hand , the author has not insisted unduly upon his conclusions ; he is often satisfied to leave them in the form of suggestions .

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	has co-operated admirably .

		A ` decorated , ' as distinguished from an illustrated , book , is compara - tively rare nowadays and a welcome revision to old methods .

		The de - signs are excellent full of freshness of invention and vigor of concep - tion : in complete harmony with the spirit of the text , and executed with a technique that is individual and thoroughly interesting .

		They may be quoted as among the best modern examples of beautiful and eloquent line-work . ''

		It is the aim of this series to represent , as widely as possible , the activity of the modern drama not con - fined to stage performance in
England	LOCATION	and through - out the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It so happens that though translations seem to be more in demand every day , the greater number of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	dramatists are at present little known in this country .

		Among them will be found predecessors and followers of Ibsen or
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, as well as others who reflect more inde - pendently the genius of their own country .

		The work of translation has been intrusted to writers specially conversant with the literatures represented , who , in many cases , are already associated in the pub - lic mind with the authors they are here interpreting .

		Every play is translated in extenso , and , if in verse , as nearly as possible in the original metres .

		The volumes contain brief introductions , bibliographical and explana - tory rather than critical , and such annotations as are necessary .

		The volumes are printed in small quarto , and bound in decorated cloth covers , and with gilt tops .

		Price , each ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	net .

		210 AUTHOR AND PUBLISHER .

		In our last issue , occasion was had to say something of `` the literary life '' as seen through the colored spectacles of Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	; and it was hinted that the commercial aspects of authorship , as viewed by that doughty defender of the claims of literary property , might pro- vide us with another subject for discussion , drawn , like the former , from Sir
Walter	PERSON	's recent volume , '' The Pen and the Book . ''

		Since Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	is happily on the road to recovery from his severe illness , and since no other matter of pressing importance just now looms above the bookman 's horizon , we may as well as anything else take our own hint , and say a few words upon a subject that it is no longer possible , thanks to Sir
Walter	PERSON	's activities , for a literary journal to ignore .

		Just
six years ago	DATE	, we took for a subject of editorial discussion the work done for men of letters by the
English Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	and its distinguished chairman , and were happy to pay our tribute of commendation to the helpfulness and thoroughgoing character of that work .

		Since then , both the Society and its quondam chairman have been pegging stead - ily away at their rather ungrateful task , and the persistence with which they have impressed upon the public the fundamental principles that should govern authors in their business rela - tions has had an easily appreciable effect , al - though the work of enlightenment is as yet by no means complete .

		That these missionary labors still have much to accomplish is evident , not merely from Sir
Walter	PERSON	's regretful admission that , in spite of all that has been said upon the subject , `` au - thors as a rule know nothing '' about the busi - ness side of their profession , but particularly from the `` draft agreements '' issued last sum - mer by a representative committee of English publishers .

		This document was so amazing in its pretensions , so obviously grasping in its claims , that even those authors least inclined to be combative were startled out of their easy acquiescence in the existing order of relations between publishers and authors , and began to ask themselves if , after all , there might not be something worth their attention in this discus - sion about the conditions of publication which 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, they had hitherto regarded as so much noisy and hollow clamor .

		The Society of Authors must have chuckled rather audibly at seeing the enemy thus play into their hands , for no publication of the Society itself had ever af - forded so powerful a support to its position as this unabashed statement of what the publish - ers claimed as fairly due to themselves .

		As Sir
Walter	PERSON	says : '' Whether these agreements are eventually with - drawn or modified , or not , they will remain as a proof that nothing that has been said as to the rapacity of publishers as a class comes anywhere near the truth , if this committee is representative .

		Every possible open - ing for a fresh claim is eagerly seized upon : all the charges and accounts , according to these agreements , are to be over-stated as a right : percentages of any - thing the publisher pleases are to be added : all sums of money received are to be treated as belonging to the publisher , less whatever royalties he may choose to give : all rights whatever are to be theirs : they even claim as their own the dramatic and translation rights ! ''

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	's indictment against English publishers is thus sustained , as far as some of its counts are concerned , by the admission of the publishers themselves .

		His accusation is stated in the following general terms , which , we need hardly add , he fortifies by matters of actual fact that have come to his knowl - edge . ''

		I have no hesitation whatever in alleging as a sim - ple fact that has been brought home to me by ten or twelve years of investigation into the commercial side of literature , that many publishers , including some of the great houses , have made it their common practice to take secret percentages on the cost of every item : to charge advertisements which they have not paid for : and in this manner to take from the proceeds of the book very much more than they were entitled to do by the agreement . ''

		Now these charges are very serious , and are not to be disposed of by calling people names .

		Whatever may be thought of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's judgment and that seems to us not infre - quently at fault no one can seriously impugn his veracity , and we have no hesitation in ac - cepting anything which he reports as fact , whether it be the treatment of an author in some particular case , or the actual estimates given for cost of production , or the detailed statement of some '' custom of the trade '' which is used by publishers for the purpose of increasing their share of the profits at the ex - pense of the helpless writer of books .

		Few authors realize the number of distinct rights which they possess in their books .

		In the case of a novel , at least , there are no less than eight rights from which an English au - thor , if his vogue be considerable , may expect some gain .

		They are the English and
Ameri	PERSON	- can serial rights , the English and American volume rights , the colonial and continental rights , and the rights of translation and dram - atization .

		If an author is not wary , he is warned that his publisher will slip into the contract some innocent appearing clause where - by some or all of these rights are transferred without their original possessor 's fully realiz - ing what he is about .

		Certainly , an author should take expert advice in such a matter , just as he would take it in a realty transaction .

		The conveyancing of literary property , as of any other , calls for skill and special knowledge , which are not possessed by one man of letters in a dozen .

		The production of a book is a business en - terprise in which an author and a publisher are jointly interested , and the fundamental question of all is that of an equitable distribu - tion of whatever profits may result from the enterprise .

		We all know what publishers say when this question is raised .

		The burden of their plea is the risk that they perforce incur , the uncertainty of human affairs in general and of book-publishing in particular , the heavy miscellaneous expenses of their business , and the thousand and one cares of which they re - lieve the author .

		If they have acquired the art of saying these things suavely and impres - sively , they soon reduce the average author to a condition of mind in which he is disposed to accept gratefully , as so much unmerited largess , anything that may be offered him , and to depart from the interview with the feeling that publishers are the most benevolent of men .

		Now , there is something in all of these considerations ; there is more , for example , than Sir
Walter	PERSON	is willing to allow .

		Nevertheless , he does the cause of letters good service by hold - ing a brief for the helpless author-plaintiff , and by subjecting the claims of the publisher-defend - ant to a closer scrutiny than his client is in a position to give them .

		There is a good deal of the bogy element in the average publisher 's talk about risk .

		Publishers of experience usually know enough about their business to avoid tak - ing many real risks , although their pretended risks are numerous .

		If it is practically certain that a thousand copies of any book of the ordin - ary sort will find purchasers , there is no risk in its publication .

		The author may be allowed a ten per cent royalty , and enough will remain to make a fair profit for the publisher .

		Now , the large publishing houses do not accept many
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 189 books for which this moderate sale is not a prac - tical certainty , and the profits of one reasonably successful book will make up for the loss incurred through a number of the occasional ventures that do not sell to the extent of even a thousand copies .

		As for the division of the profits , Sir
Walter	PERSON	is of the opinion that one - third to the publisher and two-thirds to the author , after charging up all legitimate ex - penses , would be an equitable apportionment .

		If we do not go so far as this , and are content to claim that author and publisher should share equally , it will still be evident that the royalty of ten per cent , customary in this country for the majority even of fairly successful authors , does not give them anything like half the profits arising from their books .

		The sales have only to reach two or three thousand to make this a very one-sided arrangement , as will be evident enough from an inspection of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's fig - ures , or of any similar figures based upon the conditions of production in this country .

		In fact , we need in the
United States	LOCATION	some such missionary work as has been done by him in conjunction with the Society of Authors in En - gland , and their activities should stimulate a similar movement among ourselves .

		Perhaps we may profit by their example to the extent of avoiding the bitterness of feeling that has been engendered in English publishing circles , but the interests of American authorship need to be championed with the same zeal and dis - tinguished ability .

		The `` method of the future , '' Sir
Walter	PERSON	believes and emphatically declares , is to be the method which treats the publisher as an agent working upon commission , '' who will take none but commission books , who will take his com - mission , and no more . ''

		This suggestion has been received with much derision by Sir Wal - ter 's publisher critics , and some of them have gone so far as to characterize it as absurd if not impossible .

		But its champion has abund - ant facts at his disposal in support of the propo - sition , and discussion of the subject has just brought him a very effective ally in the person of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, who speaks of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's proposed method as '' that which I have pursued for the last fifty years , and with the most satisfactory results . ''

		More than a score of years ago , Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	testified before the
Copyright Commission	ORGANIZATION	that by this plan he received about thirty per
cent	MONEY	-LRB- of the published price -RRB- upon a first edition of one thousand copies , and more than forty per cent upon sub - sequent editions printed from plates .

		AMERICAN VARIANTS OF NURSERY CLASSICS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The old nursery rhymes and jingles , children 's play - ing games , etc. , which have been current in baby-land for hundreds of years , have , like every other kind of folk-lore , been subject to all sorts of variants or cor - ruptions , call them what you will ; and the standard text always cited in disputed readings is that of
Halli	LOCATION	- well an English authority .

		But our own distinctly developing national charac - teristics , local influence , and the cosmopolitan admix - tures in American life , have had their effect upon these Nursery Classics , and not only has a whole group of distinctively American variants grown up , but a very great number of fresh additions to nursery and child-lore have been made since the first '' Mother Goose '' was reprinted in this country .

		A number of friends all over the States are helping in the collection of new material of this kind , and if any of your readers are sufficiently interested in the subject to take the trouble to write down any of the nursery rhymes and jingles with which they may be familiar , and send them to me , especially those they know to be local or distinctly American , they may help to bring to light much that would otherwise escape , and will aid in the most interesting work of showing how far
America	LOCATION	has gone in the direction of evolving a
National Nursery Literature	ORGANIZATION	of its own .

		WAS FOE MATHEMATICALLY ACCURATE ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I wish to comment upon two sentences in the inter - esting article of Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	in THE DIAL of
Jan. 16	DATE	, entitled '' The American Rejection of Poe '' : ''
Poe	PERSON	, a logic machine , was absolutely incapable of those pleasing flaws and deficiencies which allow other people to have a good opinion of themselves .

		He always added up true . ''

		Probably most persons would think of '' The Gold - Bug '' as the best illustration of the accurate working of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's mind .

		The celebrated '' cryptograph '' there found solves itself all right , I presume .

		There are some mathematical statements in this story , however , which seem to me impossible .

		The negro ,
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	, is compelled by his master ,
William Legrand	PERSON	, to climb '' an enormously tall tulip - tree , which ... far surpassed ... all other trees which I had then ever seen , in the beauty of its foliage and form , in the wide spread of its branches , and in the general majesty of its appearance . ''

		The first great branch was '' some sixty or seventy feet from the ground . ''


Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	is told to pass by six large limbs on a particular side of this tree , and to climb out upon the seventh .

		This last proves to be a dead branch , but capable of bearing the negro 's weight , and he climbs '' mos ' out to the eend . ''

		Here he discovers a skull nailed to the limb .

		Legrand tells him to use the '' gold - bug , '' tied to the end of a string , as a plumb-line , drop - ping it through '' the left eye of the skull . ''

		A peg is driven into the ground at the precise spot where the beetle falls .

		Legrand then fastened one end of a tape - measure '' at that point of the trunk of the tree which was nearest the peg , ... unrolled it till it reached the 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, peg , and thence further unrolled it , in the direction already established , ... for the distance of fifty feet . ''

		About the spot thus obtained as a centre , the three as - sociates excavated a pit four feet in diameter to the depth of seven feet , but found nothing .

		It was then discovered that
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	had dropped the beetle through the wrong eye .

		The next time it fell at '' a spot about three inches '' from the previous point . ''

		Taking , now , the tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg , as before , and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet , a spot was in - dicated , removed by several yards from the point at which we had been digging . ''

		The impossibility of the statement italicized will be at once apparent .

		If the skull was found ten feet away from the trunk of the tree was it not farther ?

		the centre of the new circle for digging was about six times three inches from the point about which they dug at first .

		If the skull were only five feet from the trunk , the second point for digging would be about thirty-three inches from the first .

		The journey of the three associates to the place where the chest was discovered lay '' through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate . ''

		After travel - ling `` for about two hours , '' they `` entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen .

		It was a species of tableland , near the summit of an almost in - accessible hill , densely wooded from base to pinnacle , and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil ... Deep ravines , in various di - rections , gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene . ''

		The chest found contained '' rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars '' in gold coins of various nations , '' estimating the value of the pieces , as accurately as we could , by the tables of the period . ''

		The gold dollar of the
United States	LOCATION	weighs 25 4-5 grains , and there are 7,000 grains in the avoirdupois pound .

		Gold coin to the value of
$ 450,000	MONEY	would weigh , roughly stated , about 1,655 pounds .

		Poe tells us that the weight of the other valuables in the chest '' ex - ceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois , '' not including `` one hundred and ninety-seven superb gold watches . ''

		This makes the total weight of treasure over 2,000 pounds .

		The three companions , unexhausted by their journey and prolonged digging , carried home one-third of this treasure in the solid chest over the route indicated above .

		They reached their hut `` in safety , but after excessive toil , at one o'clock in the morning . ''

		After a rest of one hour , they set off , '' armed with three stout sacks , '' to secure the remaining two - thirds of the booty .

		They got back to the hut with this , `` just as the first faint streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the treetops in the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		On the second re - turn journey , if my estimates '' add up true , '' each of the three must have carried about 450 pounds of gold and gems .

		Certainly , at the time of this achievement ,
Poe	PERSON	who tells the story as if himself the third party in the enterprise had not weakened his bodily powers by dissipation .

		In '' The Murders in the Rue Morgue '' we read : `` On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of gray human hair , also dabbled with blood , and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots . ''

		Later in the story , the infallible
Dupin	PERSON	says : `` You saw the locks in question as well as myself .

		Their roots -LRB- a hideous sight ! -RRB-

		were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time . ''

		-LRB- The italics are mine . -RRB-

		The Bible suggests that God alone can accurately number the hairs upon the human head ; but I can not think that it would have involved any impiety if
Poe	PERSON	had made his partial estimate in this passage a little more reasonable .

		Let us disabuse our minds , then , of the notion that
Poe	PERSON	always `` adds up true . ''

		Poe 's fame is secure , though he can never be popu - lar .

		His was essentially an original mind : he was a lit - erary discoverer , and the world does not often forget its discoverers .

		His message is mainly , perhaps , to literary craftsmen .

		Whether we think of the detective story ; of the scientific romance , since carried further by
Jules Verne	PERSON	and others ; of what I can only call `` the short - story of atmosphere '' ; of certain fundamental truths in '' the philosophy of composition '' ; of the true theory of English versification , since elaborated by
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	; or of
Poe	PERSON	's own peculiar type of intensely musical poetry , with its fascinating use of tone-color , parallelism , and repetition we can say , I believe , with substantial truth , that he was '' ... the first that ever burst Into that silent sea . ''

		THE MACHINE THEORY OF HISTORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Will you permit me a word with reference to that '' machine theory '' of history to which Dr.
Hinsdale	LOCATION	, in your issue of
Feb. 16	DATE	, justly takes exception ?

		History is a science , and should be scientifically studied .

		Sci - ence is concerned with facts .

		The facts respect the nature , action , evolution , and effects of substances and forces .

		The facts of history have regard to men , and ought to exhibit the action , development , and progres - sive influence of the forces of his nature .

		We wish to learn from history what man has done , and why he has done certain things .

		As in a natural science we learn the significance of phenomena from their causes and effects , so in history we find the meaning of man 's actions in his character , the motives that control or direct his movements .

		Only in this way can we make a just estimate of an actor 's career , and gain trustworthy and valuable instruction from the experience of those who have preceded us .

		What signified the deeds of a Pericles , an
Alexander	PERSON	, a
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, or a Caracalla ?

		Do we find the mean - ing of their lives in the isolated phenomena called their acts , without inquiring whether these were laudable or culpable ?

		In some cases , perchance , two persons of opposite character did like things .

		Did their doings have the same significance and influence ?

		If we wished to direct our life by theirs , should we simply ask what things they did ?

		The reciter of acts and occurrences is merely a diar - ist , an annalist , or a compiler .

		The historian , worthy of the name , is not a mere collector of political or social phenomena .

		He must form judgments of men and re - late their acts to their character .

		He must be judicial , and must know the conclusions of science in its promi - nent departments ; for he should tell us not merely what men have done , but what their lives have meant .

LEWIS CARROLL	PERSON	, OF WONDERLAND .

		* That was a sensible bit of advice given to ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' in a letter from his occa - sional publisher , Mrs.
Gatty	PERSON	, in
1867	DATE	, in which , after complimenting her correspondent on the quality of a sketch about to appear in her mag - azine , the lady went on to say : '' One word more .

		Make this -LSB- story -RSB- one of a series .

		You have great mathematical abilities , but so have hundreds of others .

		This talent is peculiarly your own , and as an Englishman you are almost unique in pos - sessing it .

		If you covet fame , therefore , it will be , I think , gained by this . ''

		``
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' -LRB- as perhaps not a few read - ers may even to-day need to be reminded -RRB- was the pen-name of the Reverend
Charles L. Dodgson	PERSON	, Mathematical Lecturer at
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and an author of repute in the abstruse field mildly disparaged by Mrs.
Gatty	PERSON	.

		For a period covering almost the
last half-century	DATE	, he belonged to `` The
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' scarcely ever leaving it ; and , says his biogra - pher -LRB- himself of Christ Church -RRB- , '' I , for one , can hardly imagine it without him . ''

		While attending closely to his professional studies and duties , he early began relaxing his mind and indulging his natural bent in writing humorous verses for '' The Comic Times , '' a
London	LOCATION	imi - tator of '' Punch , '' which soon after became merged in a new venture , '' The Train '' ; and it was in The Train '' -LRB- of
May , 1856	DATE	-RRB- that his future famous pseudonym , ''
Lewis	PERSON	Car - roll , '' first appeared .

		Under the date
July 4 , 1862	DATE	, there is a very interesting entry in the Diary : '' I made an expedition up the river to Godstow with the three Liddells ; we had tea on the bank there , and did not reach
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	till half-past eight ... On which occasion I told them the fairy-tale of '
Alice	PERSON	's Adventures Underground , ' which I undertook to write out for Alice . ''

		It was on this
summer	DATE
afternoon	TIME	that Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	improvised for the amusement of the three little girls who accompanied him those adventures in '' Wonderland , '' which were later re-written for publication by the advice of
George Macdonald	PERSON	, who had seen the story in the original manuscript as written out by the narrator for Miss
Alice Liddell	PERSON	. ''

		the following pleasant account of the momen - tous excursion up the Thames : `` Most of Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	's stories were told to us on river expeditions to Nuneham or Godstow , near
Oxford	LOCATION	.

		My eldest sister was c Prirna , ' I was '
Secunda	PERSON	, ' and '
Tertia	PERSON	' was my sister
Edith	PERSON	.

		I believe the beginning of '
Alice	PERSON	' was told one
summer	DATE
afternoon	TIME	when the sun was so burning that we had landed in the meadows down the river , deserting the boat to take refuge in the only bit of shade to be found , which was under a new - made hayrick .

		Here from all three came the old peti - tion , Tell us a story , ' and so began the ever delightful tale .

		Sometimes to tease us Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	would stop suddenly and say , ' And that 's all till next time . '

		Ah , but it is next time , ' * would be the exclamation from all three ; and after some persuasion the story would begin afresh .

		Another day , perhaps , the story would be begun in the boat , and Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	, in the middle of telling a thrilling adventure , would pretend to go fast asleep , to our great dismay . ''

		On
July 4 , 1865	DATE	, just three years after the memorable row up the river ,
Miss Liddell	PERSON	re - ceived the first presentation copy of ''
Alice	PERSON	's - Adventures in
Wonderland	LOCATION	, '' the second copy going to
Princess Beatrice	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1867	DATE	Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	published his book on '' Determinants , '' and we can fancy the sur - prise of the
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	undergraduate * when they learned that ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' of '' Wonderland '' was none other than their pre - ceptor of the lecture hall and author of that learned treatise .

		In
1857	DATE	Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	first met
Tennyson	PERSON	, whom he thus describes : `` A strange shaggy-looking man ; his hair , moustache , and beard looked wild and neglected ; these very much hid the character of the face .

		He was dressed in a loosely fitting morning coat , common grey flannel waist - coat and trousers , and a carelessly tied black silk hand - kerchief .

		His hair is black ; I think the eyes too ; they are keen and restless nose aquiline forehead high and broad both face and head are high and manly .

		His manner was kind from the first ; there is a dry lurk - ing humor in his style of talking . ''

		Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	's faculty for seeing things in a funny or extravagant light is illustrated by his amusing descriptions of
Berlin	LOCATION	, which place he visited while on a continental tour with Dr.
Liddon	PERSON	. ''

		The beast-killing principle has been carried out everywhere with a relent - less monotony , which makes some parts of
Berlin	LOCATION	look like a fossil slaughter-house . ''

		Early in
1869	DATE	Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	's `` Phantas - magoria '' was published , and a few days later the first chapter of '' Behind the Looking - Glass '' was sent to the press .

		In
1871	DATE	the lat - ter story appeared , and at once scored a huge success . ''

		I can say with a clear head and conscience '' -LRB- wrote
Henry Kingsley	PERSON	to the au - thor -RRB- '' that your new book is the finest thing we have had since '
Martin Chuzzlewit	PERSON	' . '' ''

		Jabberwocky , '' Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	says , was at once recognized as '' the best and most original thing in the book '' ; and we learn , as to the origin of this -LRB- to our thinking -RRB- rather silly production , that it was composed as a contri - bution to a game of '' verse-making '' at an evening party .

		Much may be risked with a public that accepts rhymed gibberish as humor ; and in
1876	DATE	Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	put forth his '' Hunt - ing of the Snark , '' a chef-d'oeuvre of sheer nonsense over which
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	grinned for a twelvemonth .

		By the
Browning	PERSON	Clubs '' The Snark '' was rapturously hailed as a godsend in the way of a new repository of hidden mean - ings , until the author set speculation of that sort at rest by calmly announcing that his poem had no meaning at all . ''

		I 'm very much afraid , '' he wrote to an anxious elucidator of poetic rid - dles in
America	LOCATION	, '' that 1 did n't mean anything but nonsense , '' thus closing forever a most promising field of research .

		In
1879	DATE	appeared Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	's most elabo - rate mathematical work , '' Euclid and His Mod - ern Rivals , '' an original book in its way , cast in dramatic form , and relieved by humorous touches in the author 's happier and saner vein .

		In
1883	DATE	occurred his controversy with the '' trade , '' in the course of which appeared his pamphlet on '' The Profits of Authorship . ''

		I speak with some personal knowledge of the matter , having myself , for some twenty years , inflicted on that most patient and painstaking firm ,
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, about as much wear and worry as ever publishers have lived through .

		The day when they undertake a book is a dies nefastus with them .

		THE DIAL , 193 ARISTOTELJANISM AND THE MODERN SPIRIT .

		* It is true ,
Aristotelianism	PERSON	has been shorn of its authority as an officially sanctioned system of philosophy and science , a species of au - thority , however , contradictory to the spirit of that system and of its originator .

		It is no longer the official philosophy of the academic world , or even of the Roman court as in the days of the Scholastics .

		But had the free , inquiring , progressive spirit of Aristotle lived amongst the Scholastics , he would unquestion - ably have been an anti- Aristotelian .

		He would have joined the ranks of his historical adver - saries .

		Authority , in the sense of a binding or school dogma , is a fetich to which Aristotle never paid homage .

		On the other hand , there is another form of authority still left to him , namely , the authority which proceeds from the prestige of a great reputation and from intrinsic reasonableness of doctrine .

		It can not be gain - said that there is a cogency merely in a great name or reputation which forces or tends to force assent .

		The popular ascription of supe - riority to any man carries with it the conces - sion of authority in that particular reference .

		It is a type of hero-worship , in which we now - adays reserve to ourselves the democratic free - dom of electing our authorities in terms of our own prejudices .

		Generally speaking , we have in philosophy and science no authority foisted on us , save what comes from the officialdom of popular opinion , or , in certain circles , from ecclesiast - ical tradition .

		Belief in the possibility of an absolute exorcism of the supposed evil spirit of authority is merely the hallucination of a man who sees visions .

		And even if such exorcism were possible , there is ground for reasonable doubt whether it would be desirable .

		The spirit of trust , of reverence for authority , and the con - tentment of a conservative mind , are real safe - guards to the direction of development .

		Mere motion is not always progress , and radicalism is not a synonym of advancement .

		Against excesses of radicalism and the spirit of mere mobility we are equipped with a wholesome counter-instinct of reverence for the traditional and of caution in revolutionary measures .

		The early years of the struggle of modern science under the influence of
Bacon	LOCATION	and the anti- Scholastics are often characterized as a * ARISTOTLE AND THE EARLIER PERIPATETICS .

		Being a translation from
Zeller	PERSON	's Philosophy of the Greeks , by
B. F. C. Costelloe	PERSON	,

J. H. Muirhead	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	.

		In two volumes .

Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		revolt against the bondage of Aristotelianism and as emancipation from the errors of that system .

		To such a degree is this true , that writers are often disposed to blame Aristotle personally and to regard him as the arch-enemy of progress .

		In view of this attitude on the part of modern critics of the progress of sci - ence , it is curious to note the fact that Aristotle a year before he died fled from
Athens	LOCATION	owing to an indictment for heresy and ultra-progres - siveness ; while the progressive liberals of the Baconian era bring an indictment against him as the inspiring genius of the ultra-conservatives .

		Thus , owing to the immense change in the
Zeitgeist	LOCATION	, diametrically opposite charges are brought against the same philosopher .

		The truth is that
Aristotle	PERSON	is not to be meas - ured by the use made of a part of his system by the
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, but by the advancement in science made by him over his own predecessors and by the intrinsic worth of his own philosophy ; i.e. , he is to be measured both by reference to his historical environment and the then contemporary state of science , as well as by the test of the reasonableness and suggestiveness of his doctrines .

		He is in no - wise chargeable with the stagnation of the middle ages , unless we are to censure the mag - nitude of his genius for reducing
Europe	LOCATION	dur - ing these long centuries to almost abject intel - lectual slavery .

		The fault was not in the master , but in the slave .

		Further , we can not rationally pass censure on him for not having observed that which can be seen only by the aid of a microscope or other instrument of modern invention .

		It is mainly by virtue of instru - mental equipment , the collection of large bodies of material , the organized cooperation of sci - entists , and the increased facilities for record and distribution of results of investigations , that modern science has triumphed over the ancient , and not by virtue of any superior intellectual endowment or acumen .

		On the other hand , where modern science has gained in intension it has lost in extension .

		It is , to be sure , satisfied with this sacrifice of the quan - titative for the qualitative .

		At the time Aris - totle wrote , the methods of the exact sciences were not known .

		One would , therefore , expect to find him most successful in ethics , politics , and metaphysics ; and this we find to be true , although modern scientists have bestowed un - measured praise on his work in the investiga - tion of nature .

		This praise is due mainly to the fact that he clearly saw the superior value of the objective over the subjective method in 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, natural science , and saw it in spite of the well - nigh complete bondage of his contemporaries to a priori speculation .

		For this reason certain modern scientists have bestowed on the Stagirite praise as exag - gerated as were the denunciations of
Bacon	LOCATION	, UamuH , or Luther .

		Between the unqualified detraction on the one hand , mere dreary ex - posure of mistakes , and the inordinate praise and impossible eulogies on the other ,
Zeller	PERSON	maintains a sobriety of criticism which forces the reader 's confidence .

		Cuvier , on the con - trary , commenting on the '' History of Ani - mals , '' says : '' I can not read this book without being ravished with astonishment .

		Indeed , it is impossible to conceive how a single man was able to collect and compare the multitude of particular facts implied in the numerous gen - eral rules and aphorisms contained in this work , and of which his predecessors never had any idea . ''

		Buffon , speaking of the same work , says : ''
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's ' History of Animals ' is perhaps even now the best work of its kind ; he probably knew animals better and under more general views than we do now . ''

		Even
George H. Lewes	PERSON	, who quotes the foregoing passages from '' The French Historians of Na - ture , '' and who has the strong anti-metaphys - ical bias of Positivism and is usually a severe critic of
Aristotle	LOCATION	, in speaking of Aristotelian - ism in general , says : '' His -LSB-
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's -RSB- attain - ments surpassed those of every known philos - opher ; his influence has only been exceeded by the great founders of religions . ''

		St.
George Mivart	PERSON	goes the length of saying -LRB- '' Contem - porary Evolution , '' p. 179 -RRB- : '' What is needed , and what evolution will in fallibly bring about , is not a return to a philosophy , but a return to the philosophy .

		For if metaphysics are possi - ble , there is not , and never was or will be , more than one philosophy , which , properly under - stood , unites all speculative truths and elimi - nates all errors : the philosophy of the philoso - pher Aristotle . ''

		Romanes , who can not be accused of having any bias for Aristotle , says : '' Whether we look to its width or to its depth , we must alike conclude that the range of Aris - totle 's work is wholly without a parallel in the history of mankind . ''

		-LRB- '' Contemporary Re - view , '' Vol .

		Luther , whose attacks on Aristotle exhibit an animus which one would expect , usually denounces him in toto , but in one passage -LRB- Bd .

		Ixii. , p. 262 ,
Erlangen	LOCATION	ed . -RRB-

		he concedes
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's excellence in ethics , while , in a high-handed way , he summarily and unexplainedly condemns his philosophy of na - ture : `` Aristoteles ist der besten
Lehrer	PERSON	einer in
Philosophia	LOCATION	morali , wie man ein fein ziichtig ausserlich Leben fiihren soil ; in naturali
Phil	PERSON	- osophia taug er nichts . ''

		Again : '' Der weise
Mann Aristoteles	PERSON	schleusset fast dahin , es sei die Welt von Ewigkeit gewesen .

		Da muss man je sagen , er habe gar nichts von dieser Kunst gewusst '' -LRB- Bd .

		xxiii. , p. 241 -RRB- .

		This denunciation was all because Aristotle 's cos - mical theories , especially that of the eternity of the world , conflicted with the Lutheran the - ology .

		Between the exaggerated praise of Buffon and the exaggerated denunciation of Luther , there is , as usual , a truer middle ground .

		While
Aristotle	PERSON	's works teem with scientific blunders , they are also filled with fundamental and epoch-making truths , and it is not an over - statement of historical fact to say that no spirit in the progress of civilization has exerted so profound an influence on the life of science as
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the pre-scholastic centuries this influence was exerted mainly through the trea - tises on Logic ; but from the time of
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	the introduction of natural science into the Western world by the Arabs , the entire body of the Aristotelian canon was known to European scholars .

		It must not be supposed that
Aristotelianism	PERSON	is at the present moment extinct .

		The religious system of
John of Damascus	ORGANIZATION	, which is founded on
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's log - ical and metaphysical doctrines , is to this day recognized as the standard of orthodox dogmatic theology in the
Greek Church	ORGANIZATION	, while in the
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	under the pa - tronage of the present Pope ,
Leo XIII	PERSON	.

		, the influence of the
Aristotleian Aquinas	PERSON	is espe - cially in the ascendant .

		So that Aristotelian - ism is still a living and vital element in these two immensely potent forces of the Greek and Roman ecclesiastical organizations .

		The height of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's influence was reached in the twelfth century , at which time he dominated the best educated and most subtle minds of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In the early part of that century the Arabs of
Spain	LOCATION	became the masters of the schoolmen , and through Averroes -LRB- Ibn Raschd -RRB- made themselves powerful factors in the contemporary civilization ; but the Spanish Aristotelianism stood for pantheism in which all special providence was denied .

		This doc - trine was formally repudiated by the
Latin Church	ORGANIZATION	, and in
1270	DATE	was anathematized by the Bishop of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Besides
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	,
Albert	PERSON	the Great was a leading figure in the Aristotelianism of that century , and a little
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		later
Dante	PERSON	was moulded in the study of the Stagirite .

		In his vision in the fourth canto of the '' Paradise '' he speaks thus of il maestro : '' When I had lifted up my brows a little The master I beheld of those who know Sit with his philosophic family .

		All gaze upon him and do him honor . ''

		During the Renaissance the '' Ethics '' and '' Politics '' were widely read .

		In the seven - teenth century
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's influence waned , owing to the tendency in the new natural sci - ence to independent observation .

		Again , at the beginning of the present century we find an important revival of Aristotelian studies under the leadership of
Trendelenburg	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the beginning of a period characterized by the rise of historical criticism and the wane of dog - matism , whose direction was largely given by
Lessing	PERSON	, himself a devoted student of Aristotle .

		In the early decades the
Berlin Academeny of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	issued the great standard quarto edi - tion of all the works , including '' Scholia , '' etc. , on which was employed the flower of Ger - many 's scholarship ; in the thirties ,
Barthe	PERSON	- lemy Saint -
Hilaire	PERSON	began his monumental French version , which he lived to complete after sixty years of labor interrupted at intervals by civic duties .


Grote	PERSON	, the historian , left us the torso of two volumes that illustrate even more than his other writings his splendid industry .

		It was this work , to which
Grote	PERSON	was devoting the last years of his failing health but perennial enthusiasm , that induced him to decline a peer - age of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	offered in the pre - miership of
Gladstone	LOCATION	.

		Besides the foregoing , a large number of volumes on particular parts or aspects of Aris - totle 's system have appeared in
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	, but nothing has been published during the century of more consid - erable moment for Aristotelian studies than the two volumes of
Zeller	PERSON	now before us , giving as they do a systematic exposition of the sig - nificance and content of the whole of the
Peri	LOCATION	- patetic philosophy , with a critical estimation of its value and defects , and an account of its external history .

		One is especially glad to have it in English , for we have nothing whatever that satisfies this lacuna in our literature .

		Zeller is , without exception , the most skilful interpreter of Greek philosophical ideas that ever put pen to the subject , and it will be many a long year before his work is antiquated .

		He has a rare combination of fine critical acumen , power of lucid and orderly statement , just dis - crimination of the values of evidence , immense patience for detail , astounding range and pre - cision of learning , and withal a judicial spirit in the handling of controversial matter .

		He rejects without flinching all interpretations inspired by harmonistic tendencies , however skilfully they may rescue Aristotle 's consist - ency and relieve him from the charge of con - tradiction ; and everywhere he maintains a rigidly conscientious attitude toward the canons of evidence .

		Although he does not underesti - mate the profound intrinsic significance of the Aristotelian system or its great influence on the processes of civilization , he never attempts to smoothe away difficulties by forced explana - tions .

		He has the courage to leave these dis - crepancies as they are .

		The translators have done skilful work in giving us a really English treatise , which brings the reader scarcely a suggestion of its foreign source .

		Zeller never fails to make his state - ments in clear , unmistakable sentences , very unlike the usual treatise that comes from Ger - man scholars .

		His manner of writing is akin to that of the Anglo-Saxon genius ; and his translators have been , for this reason , the more easily able to provide an English version which might well have been originally an English Classic .

		The volumes have a value of the first order .

		One is almost disposed to think of them as definitive in their method of structure , while their subject-matter is indubitably of lasting interest .

		The ultimate problems of philosophy may still be awaiting their satisfactory solution , and men of science have now and again decried the attempt as impossible ; yet , as
Kant	PERSON	says in the l & itik der reinen Vernunft -LRB-
Max Miiller	PERSON	's trans. , p. xxxi . -RRB-

		: '' It is vain to assume a kind of artificial indifferentism in respect to inquiries the object of which can not be indifferent to human nature . ''

		The teachings of Aristotle are of both historical and present interest .

		In certain disciplines , the important thing is not the state of contemporary science , but the per - sonality of the thinker .

		In ethics , e. g. , the deliverances of great spirits are not so much affected by the conditions of science as by the temperament of the man , the character of his will , and the energy of his feeling and vision .

		The utterances of such spirits on subjects of this kind do not become obsolete .

		What was said by
Socrates	LOCATION	,
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	,
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, and Jesus , on the nature of the moral life is in the main universally applicable , and not pe - culiar to conditions of time or place .

		In questions where one is concerned with the 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, immutable principles of human nature , the deliverances of men who have had a genius for morality -LRB- men may have a genius for morality as much as for mathematics -RRB- are as little sub - ject to obsoletism as the Homeric epics , the creations of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, or the divine forms of Gothic art .

		And these problems of the human spirit and its relation to the conduct of life and to the nature and knowledge of reality , although they may be most difficult of solu - tion , none the less they do lie nearest to the heart .

		The answers we find to such ques - tions amongst the Greeks , and particularly in
Aristotle	LOCATION	, are marked by the rigor of original - ity , clear , simple , without artificiality .

		SIR
RICHARD BURTON	PERSON	'S POSTHUMOUS PAPERS .

		* When
Richard Burton	PERSON	died at
Trieste	LOCATION	in
1890	DATE	, the world lost an intrepid explorer , a keen observer , and a polyglot scholar .

		His ad - venturous career was unique in the
nineteenth century	DATE	, and will find no successor in the twen - tieth .

		He had ranged the habitable globe the Orient and tropics by preference ; and had studied anthropology at first-hand , with an unsurpassed equipment for his work .

		In him were united English tenacity , Anglo-Saxon restlessness , a gift for languages like that of Mezzofanti , and a certain trampling brusque power of description that always seemed confi - dent of winning by the mere fascination of its material .


Burton	PERSON	was a '' much-neglected traveller '' ; what honors he had came late ; and the posthum - ous honor which may come from this triad of essays will hardly add to his varied fame , though in certain respects they are faithful suggestions of the man .

		In addition to the forty-eight works published during his life , there were left at his death some twenty MSS. , the publication of which was placed absolutely within the dis - cretion of his widow ,
Lady Burton	PERSON	.

		She pub - lished her '' Life of Sir
Richard Barton	PERSON	, '' and editions of his '' Arabian Nights , '' '' Catullus , '' and '' II Pentamerone '' ; and was arranging for the publication of others , when she died * THE JEW , THE GYPSY , AND EL ISLAM .

March , 1896	DATE	-RRB- ; and the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		with the dis - cretion were entrusted to Mr.
Wilkins	PERSON	.

		The three papers now brought together by Mr.
Wilkins	PERSON	are of unequal merit .

		The first one , `` The Jew , '' is an unfavorable criticism upon the most persistent race in history : its steadily anti-Semitic spirit would delight the soul of Pastor
Stoecker	PERSON	or the Jew-baiting pop - ulace of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Burton 's various
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	con - sulates enabled him to know the Jews of the Orient widely and well ; but his attempt to de - fend the atrocities against the Jews of the Middle Ages by the suggestion of previous greater atrocities committed by them is gratu - itous .

		The chapter on the
Talmud	LOCATION	is interest - ing ; but the mingled absurdity and vindictive - ness of its anti-Gentile teachings are shown up with a relish which is unpleasant to contem - plate .

		The truth is that none of us , as nations , can turn over the leaves of our darker youth without wincing ; and it is unfair to erect the police reports of the
Levant	PERSON	into a studied indictment of a race whose achievements and services to civilization are conceded by all who read history with untrammelled judgment . ''

		The Gypsy '' is an attractive ethnological study , for the writing of which
Burton	PERSON	was admirably well-equipped , even if he had not in his veins that infusion of Romany blood with which he was generally credited .

		Its merits are somewhat impaired by a lack of proportion : nearly half of the 150 pages being a polemic against the claims of
M. Paul Bataillard	PERSON	to priority in identifying the Gypsies with the Jat of the banks of the Indus .

		This , as well as the comparative word-lists , can naturally be of interest to very few outside the ranks of experts in '' Chinganology . ''

		But the chapters devoted to a survey of the '' children of out-of-doors '' in the various continents , whether called
Gitano	ORGANIZATION	,
Zigeuner	PERSON	,
Tzigane	LOCATION	, or
Jat	ORGANIZATION	, are really fascinat - ing , and could have been written by no one else .

		Burton penetrated everywhere , was under - stood of the Gypsies in all lands , and learned their traditions and character with a complete - ness approached by no other Englishman , ex - cept , perhaps , his great contemporary ,
George Borrow	PERSON	. ''

		El Islam , '' the third in this group of studies , is an essay of about sixty-five pages .

		It was written , as Mr.
Wilkins	PERSON	tells us , about
1853	DATE	, soon after that daring and successful pilgrim - age to Mecca which made
Burton	PERSON	famous .

		It is a sympathetic apologia for the '' Saving Faith '' ; and the tone is , on the whole , both moderate and philosophic .

		With
Burton	PERSON	's
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 197 usual lack of perspective , however , nearly two - thirds of the paper is given to a resume of the other great religions displaced by Islamism in the
Orient	LOCATION	; and the author has thus left him - self only about twenty-five pages in which to establish his proposition .

		He sets himself the task of correcting what he believes to be the four most popular errors of the time -LRB- i. e. , 1853 -RRB- in regard to
El Islam	LOCATION	.

		These are , in his own words , as follows : I. '' It is determined to be merely a receptive faith , and therefore adapted only to that por - tion of mankind whose minds , still undeveloped and uncultivated , are unripe for a religion of principles . ''

		The author affirms this to be '' partly correct of the corrupted , untrue of the pure , belief ; it will somewhat apply to the tenets of the Turks and Persians , but not to those of the first Muslims and the modern Wahabis . ''

		II . ''

		Men object that The Saving Faith is one of pure sensuality . ''

		This is refuted by a summary of the numerous injunctions of the
Koran	LOCATION	, condemning nearly all the pleasures of this life ; followed by the claim that '' those who best know El Islam , instead of charging it with sensuality , lament its leaven of asceticism .

		They regret to see men investing these fair nether scenes with mourning hues ; ' the world is the Muslim 's prison , the tomb his stronghold , and Paradise his journey 's end . '

		But this could not be otherwise .

		Asceticism and celibacy are the wonted growth of hot and Southern cli - mates , where man appears liable to a manner of religious monomania . ''

		III . ''

		The third error is that the Founder of the Saving Faith began his ministry as an en - thusiast and ended it as an impostor . ''


Burton	PERSON	's answer to this is substantially the tu quoque , claiming for Mohammed the full measure of sincerity conceded to other Founders .

		IV . ''

		The fourth error is that Muhammad , unable to abolish certain superstitious rites and customs of the ancient and Pagan Arabs , incor - porated them into his scheme , and thus propi - tiated many that before avoided him . ''

		In the author 's answer to this , which is too long to quote entire , we are prepared for his '' conclu - sion of the whole matter , '' as follows : '' Muhammad 's mission , then , was one purely of re - form .

		He held that four dispensations had preceded his own , and that his object was to restore their pristine purity .

		But the Adamical had been obsoletized by the Noachian scheme ; and this by the Mosaic , which , in its turn becoming defunct , had left all its powers and pre - rogatives to Christianity ; thus also the latter dispensa - tion , in the fulness of time , had been superseded by the revelations of the Saving Faith .

		All the past was now effete and abrogated .

		All the future would be mere imposture ; for his was the latest of religions , he the Soul of the Prophets . ''

		The book , it should be added , is beautifully printed and bound ; is provided with an index ; and has a finely etched portrait of Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	, from the painting by Lord
Leighton	PERSON	.

		HISTORICAL TREASURE TROVE .

		* The historian who records the recent mani - festations of good - will and esteem between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	should give prominent place to the restoration to Mass - achusetts , in
1897	DATE	, of the original manuscript of Governor
Bradford	PERSON	's History of '' Plimoth Plantation . ''

		No later occurrence between the two peoples , though in itself more sensational , can testify more unequivocally of an undercur - rent of mutual respect and affection than the romantic episode of this restoration .

		This record of a chapter in our early history is the candid and dignified statement , by one of the foremost actors , in language modest and unaf - fected , of that dramatic movement in the evo - lution of modern freedom which made the Pilgrims from eastern
England	LOCATION	the first found - ers of a newer
England	LOCATION	on the Western con - tinent .

		It is the contemporaneous recital , by one of themselves , of the successive acts for several decades of that Pilgrim company whose career has made a wonderful impress upon the history of the world , and of whom it was well said by Governor
Wolcott	PERSON	, in his address ac - knowledging the receipt of the precious volume : '' In the varied tapestry which pictures our national life , the richest spots are those where gleam the golden threads of conscience , cour - age , and faith , set in the web by that little band . ''

		The
Bradford	PERSON	manuscript is a spontaneous revelation of that conscience , courage , and faith ; and as such , it is held dear in the affec - tions of all Americans .

		Lost to us for nearly a hundred years , it was found in the archives of the established church of that nation which has so often been represented as our hereditary enemy .

		198 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, sador Bayard succeeded .

		Good-will was in - voked , rather than diplomacy , and it awoke an answering chord of good-will in
Great Britain	LOCATION	: the ecclesiastical authorities in the mother-land surrendered to the commonwealth of
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts the custody of her heirloom , the sur - render being accompanied by conditions so little burdensome as to evince the sincere es - teem which prompted it .

		The story of the loss , the search , and the recovery is told in the intro - duction to the handsome reprint of the old man - uscript which the commonwealth has recently issued .

		This history was printed in
1856	DATE	from a copy which had been secured in
England	LOCATION	, so that its contents are already known to historical stu - dents .

		The present issue is , however , timely , and will be welcomed by American readers .

		It is a verified representation of the text of Gov - ernor
Bradford	PERSON	, retaining all the variations of his independent spelling .

		Facsimiles of a few pages of his manuscript form appropriate illus - trations to the text .

		While this edition does not pretend to compete , in the esteem of anti- quarians with the elaborate edition which repro - duces the whole manuscript in facsimile , it will find high place with the reading public , by virtue of its clear typography and its well - ordered index .

		The quaint and almost archaic style of
Brad	PERSON	- ford 's prose is far from tiresome , and he is so faithful an annalist , and so free from undue self-assertion , as to give to his unfashionable diction a charm of its own .

		The faith , hope , and courage of that band of adventurous pil - grims shine through his pages , tempered by a charity which lends to the whole narrative a tone of impartiality characteristic of true his - tory .

		Important episodes are often illustrated by copies of original documents , as in the cases of the
Mayflower Compact	ORGANIZATION	, the articles of the
New England	LOCATION	confederation , and much of the correspondence between the Pilgrims and the adventurers .

		MR.
WILLIAM ARCHER	PERSON	, the well-known English dra - matic critic , is shortly to visit the
United States	LOCATION	for the purpose of writing a series of articles on '' The Stage in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The articles will appear in what is now an international magazine , the '' Pall Mall . ''

		FAITH AND FANTASY .

		* Faith , from the very nature of the case , is espe - cially exposed to becoming fantasy .

		Faith deals with the deeper implications of our sensuous life .

		The unseen and eternal are open to it .

		This ex - ploration , slipping the restraints of experience , is especially liable to become fanciful .

		Hardly another doctrine could have so opened the doors of imagina - tive thought of reason winged by fancy as the assertion that absolute truth is contained in
Scrip	LOCATION	- ture , and is open to any man 's unfolding .

		The processes of each mind are thus given a final author - ity which needs no correction from the flow of events .

		Religious truth is made independent of that com - prehensive scheme of things of which it is a part .

		The rationalistic fancy of the ill-trained spirit meets with no check from the moral experience of the world , and with no instruction from the historical unfolding of our spiritual life .

		The lesson of events is lightly set aside in behalf of an immature render - ing of the fundamental conditions and principles of our being .

		Faith suffers the disparagement of fancy , because it takes no pains to steady itself by an accumulative rendering of the spiritual events of the world .

		We are disposed to accept as the keynote of the present criticism the brief discourse on '' New Forms of Christian Education , '' by Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		Not because the religious thought of the world is ready to fall into harmony under it , but because it best presents the true constructive centre , subject to which the unison of faith is to be reached .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	summarizes her own view of Christian Edu - cation with much distinctness .

		Thus , she says in conclusion : '' Each of those relations and duties may , if we will , be connected with the beloved and sacred name of him who stands both by inherent genius and by the irrevo - cable choice of men at the head of the spiritual life of
Europe	LOCATION	, and still bequeaths even to our far-off genera - tions the maintenance and spread of his work .

		All things may be done to God in
Christ	LOCATION	; and that our chil - dren should learn from us so to do them is the task of Christian education .

		Only in the patient struggle to fulfil it week by week , and day by day , till the educa - tion of childhood merges in the sterner education of maturity , can we hope , parent and child , teacher and taught , for the growth which alone is true life growth in that temper at once of self-surrender and indomitable * NEW FORMS OF CHRISTIAN EDUCATION .

		THE DIAL hope , which yields all that man has and does , his forms of faith , no less than the grosser claims of self and flesh , to the action of the indwelling , all-transforming God , whereof the chief representative in history is Jesus Christ . ''

		The address seems to us to be more pervaded by the sense of loss than by that of gain .

		Our attention is drawn rather to the salvage that attends upon a disastrous wreck than to the pure metal which comes forth when the dross has been purged from the ore in a refining process .

		The certainty of faith is greater , not less , when its data have been subjected to the most thorough sifting of experience .

		Only then are the breadth and inescapable force of our inferences apparent .

		The second book on our list , '' The Preparation for Christianity , '' lies in line with this correction of belief by the history of its development . ''

		The atmosphere of our lives was created by Him , far more completely than the majority of us are even vaguely aware ; our institutions have been molded by His spirit ; our most effective ideals centre in Him ; and upon His career and all its consequences rests our hope for eternity .

		These are not opinions , but facts capable of no dispute whatsoever , simply because they are his - torical , and have been becoming more and more of the essence of history for nigh two thousand years .

		Conse - quently , no Christian can have a firmer foundation for his faith than that which rests immovable upon the his - torical influence issuing from the life of Christ '' -LRB- p. 22 -RRB- .

		We are glad of a new work from
Professor Wenley	ORGANIZATION	.

		His thought is wont to be free and stimulating .

		The purpose of the present volume is to trace the converging influences of Grecian , Jewish , and Ro - man civilization on Christianity .

		Any adequate treatment is exceedingly difficult .

		The theme read - ily lends itself to the intense and vague .

		The book has marked excellences .

		The criticism we should be most inclined to make is that the discussion is too purely one of ideas , a tracing of the intel - lectual and spiritual inheritance that has come down to us .

		The thought would have been made more definite , and at the same time more comprehensive , if the social life of which these ideas were the fer - ment the social life which limited them and was limited by them had been more fully given .

		This would have been in keeping with an introductory chapter in which the author lays strong emphasis on the unity of our lives in society .

		The entire theme , however , is like a rich and widely branching mine to be worked by many in many generations .

		Our author returns from his exploration with his own treasures .

		`` Addresses to Women Engaged in Church Work '' is a small volume made up of a few brief lectures waifs of stimulus and guidance in an ac - tive life .

		They lay little claim to literary form , but they are full of that earnest spiritual temper which renders the words and acts of Bishop
Potter	PERSON	so valuable .

		The themes are of a character fitted to renew thought and impulse .

		The author of '' Christ in the Industries '' ex - plains his purpose at once . ''

		It is written for busy people , who have no time for an extended treatise , and perhaps no tastes for the details of sociological study , and yet would like to keep abreast of modern movements , and of the new applications of
Chris	PERSON	- tian thought . ''

		The volume lies in the line of this intention .

		Its subjects are : '' The Dignity of Labor , '' '' Social Transformations , '' '' Some Friends of Labor , '' '' Industrial Problems , '' '' The
Future of Labor	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The volume is plain , whole - some bread , which should , in one form or another , be on every man 's table . ''

		The Sacrifice of Christ '' is another effort to soften the colors in which orthodox belief has painted the death of Christ , and to give them a more subdued and natural expression .

		So far it is a response one that has often been made to that deepening impression by which the whole procedure of salvation becomes growth under the wide uni - versal conditions of physical and spiritual law .

		So far , we may feel disposed to commend the treatise , and yet we must think that a little more of the same process leaves only the faintest outline of the old conception .

		It is replaced by a less definite , but far more glorious , vision of spiritual life steadily unfolding within itself . ''

		Christianity and Anti-Christianity '' is a much belated volume .

		A title more immediately disclos - ing the purpose of the book would have been '' Christ and Anti-Christ . ''

		Of all the fancies which have fastened on Christian faith , few have been more per - sistent and more misleading than that of Anti-Christ .

		The primary purpose of the author is to bring for - ward this shattered and discarded image , pad it into shape once more with the errors and alleged errors of science , literature , and social life , and set it up as a menace to unbelievers , and an historic landmark on the road to the
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	.

		That he does his work with more moderation than is wont to belong to this kind of effort , is but scant atonement for un - dertaking it at all .

		No labor could be more futile than one designed to crowd the truly prosperous events of our spiritual life off from their present natural basis and force them back on the out-worn uninstructive and unreal conceptions associated with Anti-Christ . ''

		The Hope of Immortality '' is another evidence both of faith and of the want of faith .

		If by faith we mean the rational hold of the mind on truths which can not be proved , yet seem to it deeply involved in the facts before it , then no doctrine makes a more direct appeal to faith than that of immortality .

		The mind that has slight hold of the underlying principles of the spiritual world will always accept this belief with hesitancy .

		Those who find the foundations of religious doctrine dis - turbed by the changing currents of speculation will begin at once to distrust the full consummation of faith expressed in immortality .

		It is not strange then that many are striving to restore to the eye those spiritual forces that find their completion in a 200 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, future life . ''

		The Hope of Immortality '' is a sys - tematic , methodical treatise .

		It moves leisurely and comprehensively .

		It treats of the nature , history , and value of this belief ; of its evidence under two aspects , external and internal ; and of the amplifi - cations of the belief by Christianity .

		It is not quite sufficiently touched by the spiritual temper of our time .

		It is still possessed by convictions which have somewhat lost their hold .

		This is seen in the weight it gives to the internal evidence , the nature of the spirit .

		It lays emphasis on its indiscerptible char - acter .

		This argument implies more knowledge than we have of the nature of spirit , and proves quite too much .

		On the other hand , the author does not sufficiently amplify and enforce the moral argument .

		As physical predictions fail us , spiritual predictions gain power .

		The spirit of the book is of the best .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		A survivor
Colonel Edward Vibart	ORGANIZATION	gives an of the great extremely interesting account of his Indian Mutiny .

		persona i experiences in
India	LOCATION	during the Mutiny , in his '' The Sepoy Mutiny '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		At the time of the outbreak
Colonel Vibart	PERSON	was a young subaltern in a regiment of na - tive infantry occupying cantonments two miles to the northwest of
Delhi	LOCATION	.

		He is now the sole surviving officer of that garrison .

		When the news reached the cantonments of the riots in the city following the arrival there of the mutinous sepoys from
Meerut	LOCATION	, detachments were sent out to quell the disturbance ; but it soon became evident that the native troops were disaffected , as they offered no resistance to the mutineers , suffering them to murder the
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean officers before their eyes and even joining in the bloody work .

		Colonel Vibart with his regiment proceeded to the Cashmere Gate , which they occu - pied , and in the fortified enclosure of which he and the other European officers presently found them - selves entrapped and besieged by a bloodthirsty band of native soldiery composed largely of their own men , who deserted en masse as soon as free - dom of choice between their European masters and their revolted fellow-countrymen was clearly offered to them .

		The position of the little group of besieged English , whose numbers had been in the meantime increased by the addition of several refugees , among them four ladies , from
Delhi	LOCATION	, soon became desper - ate .

		Their place of refuge was a trap , and flight was the sole alternative to death and mutilation at the hands of the now everywhere victorious muti - neers .

		The escape of Colonel
Vibart	PERSON	and his com - panions from the Cashmere Gate into the open country seems little short of miraculous , and we have read few tales of similar adventure more thrill - ing than the recital of the subsequent wanderings from village to village through a roused and hostile country of this little band of fugitives .

		The sepoys were at times hot on their trail and in plain sight from their places of hiding , and they were more than once in imminent danger of violence at the hands of disaffected townspeople .

		Occasional instances of kindness at the hands of compassionate natives are grateful to read of ; and but for the offices of these dusky good Samaritans whose char - itable hands offered the starving and exhausted fugitives furtive gifts of milk and chupatties ,
Colonel Vibart	PERSON	and his companions would certainly never have lived to tell the tale of their flight from
Delhi	LOCATION	.

		That tale is told modestly and directly ; and to it is added an account of the author 's subsequent share in the siege of
Delhi	LOCATION	, and in the operations at Cawn - pore and
Lucknow	LOCATION	.

		Colonel
Vibart	PERSON	saw the dead bodies of the three princes summarily slain by
Hodson	PERSON	, whose action in thus taking the law into his own hands he mildly condemns as '' a most inju - dicious act '' !

		We should call it plain murder essentially a military lynching , and not a whit better morally than the sepoy atrocities for which it was a. reprisal .

		There is no evidence whatever that the princes shared in the massacre of Europeans in
Delhi	LOCATION	; and a British officer who , after the siege was - over and the victory won , deliberately slew his help - less and unresisting prisoners in cold blood and with his own hand , simply put himself on a level with
Nana Sahib	PERSON	, and stained the for the most part glo - rious record of the suppression of the
Bengal	LOCATION	Mu - tiny .

		Colonel Vibart 's book contains some interest - ing plates , some of them from photographs dating back to the period treated .

		Two supplementary chapters , by
P. V. Luke	PERSON	and
Colonel Mackenzie	PERSON	, the one giving the `` true version '' of the so-called '' fateful telegram '' popularly believed to have saved
India	LOCATION	, the other narrating the particulars of the
Meerut	LOCATION	outbreak , are given ; and there is some interesting supplementary matter in the Appendix .

		The German temperate and judicial tone of Emperor in
M. Maurice Leudet	PERSON	's chatty book , private life .

		`` The Emperor of
Germany	LOCATION	at Home '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is to be commended .

		As a Frenchman ,
M. Leudet	PERSON	has not forgotten Sedan , and he plainly looks forward to a day of reckoning with
Germany	LOCATION	; but he speaks by no means unkindly of the Germans , and not disrepect - f ully of their Emperor .

		To his view
William II	PERSON	.

		is an ambitious , somewhat flighty , yet clever and versatile young man , who believes that a King 's business is to be a King , and not the ward of a Chancellor or the mandatory of a majority .

		That
William	PERSON	is vain , with a pompous , peacock species of vanity , that prompts him to sun himself in the public eye in raiment of gorgeous hues and infinite variety ,
M. Leudet	PERSON	does not deny ; but he scouts the notion that the erratic young ruler is a mere empty megalomaniac the neurotic `` William the Witless '' of the more irreverent English journals .

		William 's particular bete noire is
England	LOCATION	; and against her he would combine
Russia	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	a scheme which M. Leudet regards with
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201 much disfavor .

		Republican
America	LOCATION	, with its irrev - erent notions of royalty and its habit of jeering at the pretensions and theoretical sacrosanctity of Consecrated Persons in general ,
William	PERSON	naturally dislikes , regarding her politics and her pork with a jealous and hostile eye .

		To M. de Blowitz he once observed : '' I fear on one side the danger of a cer - tain invading and continued extension with which
Europe	LOCATION	is threatened by one of her races '' -LRB- the English , thinks M. Leudet -RRB- , `` armed with all the resources which civilization puts and will put at the service of her ambition ; and on the other side I fear the intervention of the
New World	LOCATION	, which is beginning to develope appetites from which it has been up to now free , and which will before long wish to interfere in the affairs of the Old World and to meet half way the ambitions , always waking , which are stirring around us . ''

		The famous tele - gram to old Kriiger , and the doings of '' Brother Henry '' at
Manila	LOCATION	, may be taken as some evidence of the sincerity of the above manifesto .

		All in all , the Emperor of
Germany	LOCATION	appears in
M. Leudet	ORGANIZATION	's pages to be , politically considered , a personage whose demise the world in general will in all probability regard with an equanimity bordering on satisfaction .

		He is temperamentally a disturbing factor whose elimination will make for European stability .

		M. Leudet 's book contains a good deal of detailed de - scription of the
Berlin	LOCATION	royal family and manage , drawn largely from a recently published German book on the successor of
Frederick III.	PERSON	, by
Herr Oscar Klaussmann	PERSON	.

		To show the reader
William II	PERSON	.

		in private life is
M. Leudet	PERSON	's aim , though political questions are pretty freely touched upon through - out .

		Judging from the pictorial display in this book , the Emperor has , among other eccentricities , a mania for getting himself photographed .

		Fur trading Following `` The Journal of Jacob on the Upper Fowler , '' lately issued in the `` Amer -
Missisnppi	LOCATION	.

		ican Explorers Series '' -LRB- F. P. Har - per -RRB- , we now have '' Forty Years a Fur Trader on the
Upper Missouri	LOCATION	, '' by
Charles Larpenteur	PERSON	.

		The author was a Frenchman who made his way direct from
France	LOCATION	to the
Upper Missouri	LOCATION	in
1833	DATE	, in the palmy days of trapping and fur-trading in the vast region extending to the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	; and in this region he remained until his death , in
1872	DATE	, most of the time in the service of the
American Fur Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		His personal narrative is an admirable mirror of the trapping and fur-trading life on both its savage and civilized sides , if indeed it can be said to have had any civilized side .

		The selfish and cynical indifference of the trappers , traders , and companies to the well-being of the Indians , we have not seen shown up in a more striking manner .

		For example , in the
winter of 1844	DATE	Larpenteur was or - dered by his superior at
Fort Union	LOCATION	to take an '' out - fit '' and go a hundred miles northward into the British Possessions , to trade with the Cree and
Chippewa Indians	LOCATION	for robes .

		He and his two com - panions suffered from cold and hunger almost unto death , but he was successful in his object .

		He traded for two hundred and thirty robes , giving for them five gallons of alcohol , on which the camp got twice drunk , and some flimsy cloths and trinkets like hand looking-glasses . ''

		This ended the business , '' he remarks , '' there being no liquor and hardly any robes left in camp . ''

		The weather was such that a mule froze to death standing bolt upright in his shelter , while buffalo robes were almost the only protection that the savages had against the cold .

		The editor estimates that the percentage of profit in the transaction must have been several thousand .

		Very realistic , too , are
Larpenteur	ORGANIZATION	's pen-pictures of the Indian agents he had known , most of whom were under the immediate influence of the Amer - ican Fur Company , and so incapable of doing the Indians justice .

		He describes them with such pic - turesque bits of description as '' The greenest of all agents I ever saw '' ; '' a great drunkard '' ; '' a drunken gambler '' ; '' a drunkard and a gambler '' ; '' a jovial old fellow who had a very fine paunch for brandy , and when he could not get brandy would take almost anything which would make drunk come , '' etc. .

		The book is opportune , coming at a time when we are all much borne down with the white man 's burden .

		It is edited in Dr.
Coues	PERSON	's usual skilful manner , and brought out in its pub - lisher 's usual handsome style .

		A builder of ^ fashionable young man whose de -

		school an heiress , and to carry her from the heart of
England	LOCATION	first to
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and then to
France	LOCATION	, could hardly be expected to develope into a man of ability in statecraft .

		Such , however , was the long step taken by
Edward Gibbon Wakefield	PERSON	, a short account of whose life and labors is now given by Mr.
R. Garnett	PERSON	in a volume of the series called '' Builders of Greater
Britain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Wake - field 's aggressive method of conquering matrimonial good fortune -LRB- and incidentally a seat in
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment -RRB- resulted in dismal failure ; for the friends of the lady soon succeeded in rescuing her , and in having the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	by special act set aside an irregular marriage cerremony performed in
Scotland	LOCATION	, while the abductor was given a sentence of three years ' imprisonment in
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	gaol .

		Parliamentary life was forever closed to
Wakefield	ORGANIZATION	by this incident , but his undeniable genius and indomitable enthusiasm resulted in the end in creat - ing for him an enviable position as a sort of non - oflicial adviser to the crown ministers in charge of colonial affairs .

		How he attained that position , and how he used it , are well told by the author , with numerous selections from
Wakefield	ORGANIZATION	's writings and private letters .

		The inclusion of
Wakefield	ORGANIZATION	in the list of colonial '' builders '' in the present series is a surprise , for he alone had no direct agency in con - ducting exploration or in expanding English terri - tory and control .

		His work was rather that of the theoretician who lays down rules of general policy 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, A general index to the and advocates certain lines of expansion .

		His great and enduring fame rests mainly upon the fact that to him more than to any other is due the adoption by
England	LOCATION	of her modern colonial policy '' to let colonies be extensions of
England	LOCATION	, with the same constitution as at home , with their own parliaments on the spot , and Governments responsible to them under the Queen 's Viceroys who connect them with her supremacy . ''

		This assuredly renders him as much a builder of the Empire as the actual organ - izer in any particular colony .

		The author 's defense of the
New Zealand Company	ORGANIZATION	, aside from Wake - field 's connection with it and responsibility for its actions , seems non-essential to the purpose of the hook .

		The delineation of his hero 's somewhat erratic character and the analysis of his labors are given with discriminating judgment and with excellent summation .

		The '' General Index to the Library Journal , '' long demanded by mem - Library Journal .

		berg Q f the pro f ess i on5 has at last been published by the
American Library Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		It covers the twenty-two years -LRB- and volumes -RRB- from
1876	DATE	to
1897	DATE	, inclusive , and provision is made for a manuscript extension by leaving the right half of each page blank .

		There are 130 of these half - printed pages , with an average of something over fifty entries to the page .

		Obviously from these figures , it is not a minute index such an index would have meant a volume six or seven times as large as that now published ; nevertheless it affords a means of ready reference to everything of im - portance in the files of the `` Journal . ''

		The index is chiefly the work of Mr.
F. J. Teggart	PERSON	, with the assistance of Miss
Helen E. Haines	PERSON	, both of whom '' deprecate having their work compared with the ideal library standard of indexing , in view of the limitations necessarily imposed upon them in their work . ''

		A glance over the entries shows Mr.
Cutter	PERSON	and Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	to have been the most frequent con - tributors to the `` Journal , '' each of them having about a page and a half of references .

		Mr.
Paul L. Ford	PERSON	and the late Dr.
Poole	PERSON	come next in the number of entries given to individual names .

		The work will prove of great value to all libraries , whether or not they possess complete sets -LRB- now almost unobtain - able -RRB- of the periodical which is thus indexed .

		Vase paintings Professor
John H. Huddilston	PERSON	's re - as illustrating cent volume on '' The Attitude of the Greek tragedy .

		Qreek Tragedians Toward Art '' is now followed by ''
Greek Tragedy	ORGANIZATION	in the Light of Vase Paintings '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , showing the other side of the question .

		As the earlier treatise col - lected all the passages in Greek tragedy where the poet shows familiarity with the potter 's art , so the later one attempts to trace the effect of tragedy upon conception and treatment of subject by the vase decorator .

		It is interesting to note that
Sopho	PERSON	- cles , whose dramas contain fewest allusions to pot - tery or comparisons drawn from the industry , is also , according to Dr.
Huddilston	PERSON	's theory , the poet An English Mirabeau , who least influenced the designs of later potters .

		The greater popularity of the works of ^ Eschylus and Euripides in furnishing subjects for illustration he attributes to their greater creative power ; the scenes as treated by Sophocles are less original .

		One feels that '' Greek Tragedy in the Light of Vase Paintings '' will have greater interest for ar - chaeologists than for students of tragedy , in spite of the author 's hope , expressed in the preface , that his work will appeal to the latter class .

		More important for vase painting than for tragedy is an understand - ing of the relation between them .

		We may think that at times Dr.
Huddilston	PERSON	has fallen into the temptation of assuming parallelism of tragic scene and vase painting where none exists , or of attribut - ing the frequency of a design to the great popu - larity of a poem , when really it was due to the con - ventionalizing of a scene by the potters themselves , or to their tendency to duplicate patterns .

		But one must appreciate the painstaking scholarship that the book represents , and must be grateful for some ad - mirable reproductions of Greek vases .

		Such repro - ductions are all too rare , and every fresh addition is welcome .

		_ ^ n * k e P re f ace to his lucid and tem - perate little sketch of Mirabeau in the Foreign Statesmen '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
P. F. Willert	PERSON	states that he does not know that '' much of importance has been written in English about Mirabeau , except an essay by Macaulay . ''

		We beg leave to call Mr.
Willert	PERSON	's attention to the important volumes treating largely and professedly of the public career of the brilliant French politician by Professor von Hoist , as a work that might possibly lead to certain modifications of his own views .

		In the main , however , Mr.
Willert	PERSON	is in accord with Professor von Hoist as to
Mira	PERSON	- beau 's course and character and also , let us add , in regard to
Lafayette	LOCATION	, whom he roundly pronounces '' a prig , '' a judgment , in our opinion , too severe .

		There was undoubtedly a tinge of self-complacency , a hint of the poseur , in the attitude of the knight of the '' white horse , '' on grand occasions , that did not fail to excite the smiles of watchful contempo - raries like
Gouverneur Morris	PERSON	, and can hardly be charged entirely to the score of race ; but
Lafayette	LOCATION	played altogether too forceful a part in the drama of his time to be set down as a mere '' prig . ''

		His foibles were patent ; he failed to see and to seize his one grand opportunity of mastering the radical movement , when that movement momentarily col - lapsed before the determined onset of the Constitu - tional party on the day of the '' Massacre of the Champ de Mars . ''

		He is dwarfed in history by the proximity of such Titans as
Mirabeau	LOCATION	and
Danton	PERSON	; .

		but his hands were clean .

		Mr.
Willert	PERSON	has turned the continental authorities on Mirabeau to excellent account , notably the full and impartial biography -LRB- '' Das Leben Mirabeaus '' -RRB- of Professor
Alfred Stern	PERSON	.

		The little book may be read through in a couple of sittings , and -LRB- with the exception noted -RRB- ' it contains the essence of the fuller narratives .

		, ... i < 11 , the third of Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	s prose works , `` Lamia 's
Winter	DATE	- Quarters '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- steers skilfully a middle course between all manner of faults .

		There is something in the attitude of a poet-laureate seeking distinction in prose which is bound to excite adverse criticism ; but it may safely be averred that the critics here will belong to that larger class who do not read the books they animadvert upon .

		And , for the first time since Beowulf and his compeers , it seems to be true that there are fewer persons writing really good prose in English than there are verse-writers of consider - able distinction , making a possible dubbing as prose - laureate perhaps the more worthy title of the two .

		In any event , Mr.
Austin	PERSON	is now to be congratulated on having not only added a third work to the En - glish prose classics , but on having invented in the first instance a vehicle for the setting of his verses which lends both them and the vehicle itself addi - tional charms .

		For in this he retains his original dramatis persons , the Poet among them , and from his lips fall from time to time lyrics of much charm and spontaneity .

		Indeed , the word '' charm '' is one to be used of the book as a whole : manly men , lovely women , an admirable mise en scene , smoothly flowing prose , elegant verse , the whole embodied in a book having many mechanical beauties , all work - ing to that single end .

		It is a pleasure to note that the former volumes , '' The Garden that I Love '' and '' In
Veronica	LOCATION	's Garden , '' have met with proper appreciation in their own country , and it is to be hoped that Americans will not deny themselves a similar pleasure .

		_ Afternoons Prof essor

		addresses on religious subjects in the setting of a beautiful service .

		A volume of these addresses is now published by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The addresses read well and carry out into the wider world the message of the quiet , restful , reverential hours of the old chapel .

		One feels as he reads that he is in the company of noble spirits who love to talk of high themes and whose purpose it is to live true and pure and useful lives .

		The time given is too short for the heavy university sermon , weighted with ponderous discussions of metaphysics , but long enough to spur young and restless students to worthy endeavor .

		The author is master of a charming style , crisp and chaste , well suited to fill a small canvas with figures and hints without crowding and confusion .

		The lampblack pendulum of biographical writ - schooiof ing seems to have reached the limit biography .

		The True
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, '' by
Sidney George Fisher	PERSON	-LRB-

		A portrait which shows '' wart and all '' may suit a
Cromwell	PERSON	and be true to nature ; but one which paints the wart and omits the por - trait is not true .

		.

		Doubtless this mania for realism is but a reaction from the heroic drawing of
Weems	PERSON	and his kin ; but to paint the shadows without the high lights is no more fair than to paint the high lights without the shadows .

		To conjure into ille - gitimacy the affectionate title of '' daughter '' given by an old man to his friend 's child becomes easy when one sin in that direction has been committed .

		No one was more keen to his shortcomings than
Franklin	PERSON	, and no one kept a better calendar of his own sins ; but to measure his deeds by our standard is as cruel as it is unjust .

		One waits with bated breath the publication of the next attempt at lamp - black biography .

		It may be a '' true '' life of the angel Gabriel .

		`` Red Patriots '' -LRB- The Editor Pub - A .

		plea for lighing
Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	-RRB- is a tale of the Seminoles .

		i
ITT	ORGANIZATION	iii the oemmole Indians , into which the author has put an earnest spirit and a realizing sense of the wrongs done this family of red men .

		The usual account of the Seminoles tells of a runaway offshoot of the Creek nation , which found a home in
Florida	LOCATION	, and became a menace to the Southerners because of predatory excursions , or , more offensive yet , established a rendezvous for refugee slaves .

		This notion finds no favor in '' Red Patriots . ''

		There were two sides to every quarrel with the
Southern Indians	ORGANIZATION	, and the facts presented in evidence seem to show that more often the white man rather than the red was the first offender .

		The object of the present publication is to claim a proper place in history for the Seminoles , and especially to do full justice to the fame of
Osceola	LOCATION	, one of the most noted of the chiefs .

		The book is full of references to official documents and records , and bears the stamp of faithful investigation ; but there is a notable lack of literary polish , and the typographical work is as wretched as the quality of paper used is inexcus - ably poor .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The introductory essay written by Mr.
Lewis E. Gates	PERSON	for his three volumes of selections from
Jeffrey	LOCATION	, New - man , and Arnold have been detached from the books in which they first appeared , and brought together -LRB- the
Jeffrey	PERSON	rewritten and expanded -RRB- into an independent volume called '' Three Studies in Literature '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		This is as it should be , for the essays were much too good to remain in the semi-obscurity of their text-book form , and we are glad once more to commend them as striking examples of literary criticism and interpretation .

		The
Newman	PERSON	, particularly , is as good as anything that has been done upon the subject . ''

William Johnson Stone	PERSON	is of those who entertain the forlorn hope of naturalizing strictly classical metres in English poetry , and he has just published , through Mr.

		It is entitled '' On the Use of Clas - sical Metres in English , '' and however essentially ques - tionable the argument may be , it is urged with much force , and , what is better , illustrated by a really beau - tiful version of about one hundred lines from the Odyssey . ''

		The Rev.
Andrew Kennedy Hutchinson Boyd	PERSON	, known to more readers by his initials than by his name , died early this month , at the age of seventy-four .

		The '' Rec - reations of a Country Parson '' was his best known work , although he published many other volumes .

		Something of a new departure is to be made by the Turnbull lectures at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

April 1	DATE	; and the subject of the address , '' Democracy and Culture . ''

		Mr.
Chalkley J. Hambleton	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, has printed privately a small volume called '' A Gold Hunter 's Ex - perience . ''

		The book is not , as one might expect , an account of some recent expedition to the Klondike , but rather the story of an expedition made by the author to
Pike	PERSON	's Peak in
1860	DATE	, '' made up partly from memory and partly from old letters written at the time to my sister in the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		It is a belated bit of history , but none the less interesting for that .

		Two recent numbers of the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	publica - tions -LRB-
Johns Hopkins Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	-RRB- consist of studies of slavery in
New Jersey	LOCATION	by
Henry Seofield Cooley	PERSON	, and of the causes of the
Maryland	LOCATION	Revolution of
1689	DATE	by
Francis Edgar Sparks	PERSON	.

		Rejecting the usual statement that this revolution was produced by a few ambitious men through a false story of a Roman Cath - olic plot , the author of the latter pamphlet traces it to an over-development of the strong Palatinate system of government during the thirty years preceding .

		The former pamphlet traces the history of slavery in its beginnings under proprietary government , its increase under the Crown government , and the spread of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	abolition feeling until the gradual abolition law of
1804	DATE	.

		The largest number of slaves at any time within the state was about 12,000 in
1800	DATE	. ''

		A Laboratory Manual in Astronomy '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , by Miss
Mary E. Byrd	PERSON	, emphasizes the growing apprecia - tion of observational and experimental methods in all departments of teaching .

		At first thought , it seems as if these methods were beyond the reach of most schools and colleges , as far as astronomy is concerned , on ac - count of the expensiveness of the equipment necessary , to say nothing of the advanced mathematical knowl - edge presupposed .

		Bui the author of this volume shows that a great deal may be done with simple means ,
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 and her book fairly justifies its title .

		We are a little suspicious of '' home-made telescopes , '' but there is no doubt that many observations and simple calculations are within the reach of young students , and afford an admirable sort of discipline in scientific thought and method .

		DANIEL
LEWIS SHOREY	PERSON	.


Chicago	LOCATION	has been singularly unfortunate during the last few months in the loss of a number of men repre - senting the highest type of intelligent citizenship .

		Within a comparatively brief period , we have had mel - ancholy occasion to report the deaths of
E. G. Mason	PERSON	,
J. L. High	PERSON	,
L. H. Boutell	PERSON	, and
W. K. Sullivan	PERSON	.

		To that list must now be added the name of
Daniel Lewis Shorey	PERSON	, who died after a two months ' illness , on the fourth of
March	DATE	, at the age of seventy-five .

		Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	will be remembered by our readers as an occasional contributor , but there are far more cogent reasons than that for recording in these columns a tribute to his mem - ory .

		Few Chicagoans have been so thoroughly identi - fied with the higher intellectual life and social aspira - tions of the community as was Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	, even during the busiest years of his professional career ; and few have left behind them so much good work , accomplished with - out ostentation , for the furtherance of culture .

		He was born in
Maine	LOCATION	,
January 31 , 1824	DATE	, and was educated at
Phillips Andover	LOCATION	,
Dartmouth	LOCATION	, and the
Harvard Law School	ORGANIZATION	.

		He taught for a few years in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and
Washington	LOCATION	, and was admitted to the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	bar in
1854	DATE	.

		The year following , he removed to
Davenport	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	, where he practised for ten years , also serving terms as city attorney and pres - ident of the school board .

		In
1865	DATE	he came to
Chicago	LOCATION	, and continued in the practice of his profession for twenty-five years .

		When , after the Great Fire , it was proposed to establish a public library in
Chicago	LOCATION	, Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	took an active interest in the matter , and drafted the
Illinois	LOCATION	statute of
1872	DATE	, one of the first and best of the
State	ORGANIZATION	laws relating to public libraries .

		He became a member of the first library board organized under this law , and occupied that position for eight years .

		This led to his friendship with the late
W. F. Poole	PERSON	, one of the closest friendships of his life , lasting for twenty years .

		Of the nine members of that first library board , Mr.
Julius Rosenthal	PERSON	is now the sole survivor .

		In 1880 Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	became a member of the
City Council	ORGANIZATION	, serv - ing the public in this capacity for six years .

		In
1890	DATE	he retired from his profession , took a long trip abroad , and , returning , settled down to spend his closing years in his library .

		He read widely and deeply in several directions , particularly in the history of the French Revolution , upon which subject he had made himself an authority .

		His contributions to THE DIAL were among the results of these studies .

		The establishment of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	soon after his retirement , and his appointment as a Trustee of the institution , provided a happy outlet for his surplus energies .

		Living close to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, he visited it almost every day down to his last illness , and devoted himself to its interests with a zeal that few men in similar positions have time to display .

		It was peculiarly fitting that the funeral ser - vices , held on the seventh of this month , should have been given a quasi-official character by the participation of the
University	ORGANIZATION	authorities .

		The tale of his public services is not complete without mention of his eighteen years ' presidency of the
Western Unitarian Conference	ORGANIZATION	, and his lifelong activity in the cause of liberal religion .

		Of Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's character it is difficult to speak ade - quately in a few words .

		No one could know him closely without thinking , with Hamlet of Horatio , that he was '' E'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal . ''

		Preserving throughout his life a youthful freshness of feeling , his nature was so genuine , and his integrity so absolute , that he won both love and respect in a meas - ure beyond most of his fellow-men , and his death leaves , to those who knew him intimately , the sense of an irre - parable loss , of a void that can never be filled .

Roden	PERSON	's Corner , '' etc. .

		Mr.
Merriman	PERSON	's success has been steadily growing since the publication of '' The Sowers . ''

		This new novel has not been published serially in this country , and will , therefore , come to the public with absolute freshness .

		Except for `` Dross `` the proofs of which he has just finished reading there will be no other book by Mr.

		12mo ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The author 's preface explains the work . ''

		This is a commentary on ' The Ring of the Niblungs . '

		I offer it to those enthusiastic admirers of
Wagner	PERSON	who are unable to follow his ideas ; although they are unable to follow his ideas , and do not understand in the least the dilemma of Wotan , though they are filled with indignation at the irreverence of the
Philistines	LOCATION	, who frankly aver that they find the remarks of the god too often tedious and nonsensical . ''

		By
JUSTIN HUNTLY MCCARTHY	PERSON	.

America	LOCATION	's development .

		The stories are all significant .

		They mean something , they have a perceptible relation to life .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	is so thoughtful a student of character that his strokes count .

		You may dislike his idea , you may even quarrel with it ; but it makes you think .

		Behind it you feel a cer - tain insight into motives and emotions , into the problem of the trans - mutation of character into action .

		It is not an infallible insight , but it is keen .

		And its edge is almost as sharp in dealing with these light themes as with the prof ounder difficulties of '' The Gospel of Freedom . '' ''

		Ickery
Ann	PERSON	, and Other Girls and Boys . ''

		By
ELIA W. PEATTIE	PERSON	, author of '' A Mountain Wo - man , '' '' The Shape of Fear , '' etc. .

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Every room in the house is taken up in the book and methods of treatment suggested .

		Mr.
Coleman	PERSON	's articles have been widely read in The ,

		Many half-tone illustrations of interiors accompany the text .

		Etiquette for Americans . ''

		By
HARRIET S. B. BEALE	PERSON	.

		12mo ,

		Their object is to reflect the opinion of cultivated Liberals , but in the matter of the American War they fought against the mass of the very class they are trying to represent , and were finally acknowledged by them to have been in the right .

		The news of the current week is compressed into an animated nar - rative , which the laziest or busiest may read , without missing the life or import of the events .

CHARLES TOWNSEND COPELAND AARON BURR	PERSON	, by
HENRY CHILDS MERWIN JAMES FENIMORE COOPER	PERSON	, by
W. B. SHUBRICK CLYMER BENJAMIN FRANKLIN	PERSON	, by LINDSAY SWIFT The reasons which have persuaded the Editor and the Publishers to believe that The Beacon Biographies make their appeal to a fairly general public are these : The Beacon Biographies , it is thought , are the most beautiful small books ever issued in this country .

		The cover -LRB- in blind and gold on blue cloth -RRB- is by Mr.
BERTRAM GROS	PERSON	-
VENOR GOODHUE	PERSON	, who has done also the standing title-page for the series , which has been engraved on copper .

		The size is 24mo -LRB- 3f by 5 ^ inches -RRB- , with an average of 140 pages to the volume .

		The frontispiece portrait which accompanies each is in photogravure .

		The paper has been selected with great care , and the type used is a new face specially cut .

		The subjects of the various Biographies as they appear are to be men of the most vari - ous significance in American life , so that the series as completed will give biographically the history of American life and character in all its important phases .

		The normal extent of a Beacon Biography is around 20,000 words .

		Sixty or seventy years ago books of American biography thus briefly expressed could be obtained generally throughout the country , but they have since been crowded out by the longer Memoirs and formal Lives .

		From these , now , and from the wealth of related material which has been accumulated in the research of a generation , it is proposed to condense once more the brief statement of essential facts which alone can appeal to the busy American interested in his country 's history .

		The writers who have consented to contribute to the Series are uniformly men who have the point of view of the present generation .

		With full critical and historical knowl - edge of the subjects of which they treat , they have not found it necessary to produce dull books , or books without the proper popular appeal .

		Those who care for biography will find in The Beacon Biographies , it is hoped , the solution of a real want books at once entertaining , brief , and authentic .

		Each volume , moreover , is to include a bibliography for further reading , and a strict and full list of important dates in chronological order .

Walter Bagehot	PERSON	, in one of his letters , speaks of somebody 's books as containing '' a pale whitey-brown substance , which people who do n't think take for thought , but it is n't . ''

		All of us who do much miscellaneous reading in cur - rent literature corne to be painfully familiar with the substance thus described , and to won - der , on the one hand , how it can be evolved from minds that seem to work normally in the everyday relations of life , and , on the other , how it can prove acceptable to the mental pal - ate of so many readers , for many readers there must be to account for its voluminous and con - tinued production .

		Such an account of the vagaries of intellection as is given by Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	, in his recent ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' article upon various kinds of '' cranks , '' is an amusing thing to read , of course , but in another aspect an aspect that persists in the field of vision after the humorous one has faded its effect is sad - dening , almost disheartening .

		Cling as tena - ciously as we may to a belief in the essential rationality of the human intellect , our faith suffers many a rude shock when we see one form after another of irrationalism sweeping over the public mind , threatening almost to its foundations the empire of logic .

		Illustrations of this power of the irrational to set intellects awry abound on every hand , and may be drawn alike from great things and from small .

		The irrationality of imagining that our conduct as a nation toward the people of the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	can be made to square with the prin - ciples upon which we have hitherto shaped our national life and carved out our success is of a piece with the irrationality that claims next year for the first of a new century instead of the last of an old one .

		The former is a matter of grave import to countless millions of people ; the latter is a belated bit of scholasticism ; both , to the psychologist , are interesting examples of the way in which pure reason gets flouted when it runs counter either to a passion or a whim .

		There was a time , not very long ago , when we hoped great things from our rapidly expand - ing schemes of education , which were to make 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, for rationality in so many ways .

		The teaching of science , particularly , was to raise up a new generation with a new mental habit .

		The preachers of this gospel said that all our intel - lectual ailments proceeded from the fatal defect in educational methods that made words rather than things the chief object of attention .

		Some - thing analogous to the degeneracy of inbreed - ing was the consequence of the manner in which each new generation was content to deal mainly with the merely verbal inheritance of the past , instead of benefitting by a vivifying contact with the concrete facts of nature .

		Science was to change all this , to keep men in constant touch with life , leaving the dead past to bury its dead , and henceforth to base all our convic - tions upon the solid foundations of observation instead of the uncertain indications of author - ity .

		Well , science has had pretty much its own way in education for the
past quarter-century	DATE	, yet the generation that it has helped to train seems hardly less prone to superstition than were those that preceded .

		Such mockeries of the scientific spirit as parade under the names of palmistry and psychical research and `` Christian '' science , and countless other man - ifestations of the unregulated intellect , rear their heads unabashed , and bear witness to the persistence of the irrational even under conditions that would seem the most adverse to the prosperity of such aberrations of the intelligence .

		This flourishing of the unscientific in what is commonly supposed to be peculiarly the age of science is doubtless the result of instincts too deeply seated in the human consciousness to be readily accessible to the appeal of educational and other rationalizing influences .

		Yet we can - not wholly acquit these influences themselves of all responsibility for a state of things so dis - creditable to human intelligence .

		Our educa - tional methods must somehow be defective , must fail in seriousness of application if not in grasp of the problem to be coped with , while those ancillary agencies upon which education has a right to count seem to be far removed indeed from any adequate realization of their high mission .

		While the church , and the polit - ical party , and the industrial organization , and the publisher of books , and the various kinds of purveyors of entertainment to the commu - nity , are all in part answerable for this failure to realize the opportunities offered them to con - tribute to intellectual advancement , the most conspicuous offender in this respect is that type of the modern newspaper , far too frequently met with , which panders to the lower intellec - tual instincts quite as noticeably as to the lower social and moral instincts of its readers .

		We wish to emphasize this distinction just at present because , although many voices have been raised to protest against the low moral tone of the greater part of contemporary journalism , the fact that its intellectual tone is equally low has failed to attract the attention due it as a com - mentary upon our boasted success in carrying on the work of popular education .

		Mr.
J. L. Lamed	PERSON	, speaking before the libra - rians at
Cleveland	LOCATION	two or three years ago , made use of these impressive and well-weighed words : '' The common school , making possible readers , and the newspaper inviting them to read , arrived together at a conjunction which might have seemed to be a happy miracle for the universalizing of culture in the western world .

		The opportunity which came then into the hands of the conductors of the news press , with the new powers that had been given them , has never been paralleled in human history .

		They might have been gardeners of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	and planters of a new paradise on the earth , for its civilization was put into their hands to be made what they would have it to be .

		If it could have been possible then to deal with newspapers as other educational agen - cies are dealt with ; to invest them with definite moral responsibilities to the public ; to take away from them their commercial origin and their mercenary motive ; to inspire them with disinterested aims ; to endow them as colleges are endowed ; to man them for their work as colleges are manned , with learning and tried capacity in the editorial chairs if that could have been possible , what imaginable degree of common culture might not
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	by this time be approaching ?

		As it is , we are to-day disputing and striving to explain to one another a condition of society which shames all who think of it . ''

		We know now that these things were not pos - sible , although we believe that they may yet become possible , and it is just because we hold this belief that it seems important to empha - size as frequently and as sharply as we may the contrast between what our newspapers are doing for education in the true sense and what they might so easily take it upon themselves to do .

		And in saying these hard truths of a per - verted newspaper press , we wish to give the frankest recognition to those journals , found here and there , whose aims , both intellectual and moral , are entirely creditable to their pub - lishers , and which are particularly instructive because they indicate the course that others might take to the immense benefit of their prestige , and not impossibly also to the benefit of their subscription and advertising accounts .

		While it is true that some of the greatest com - mercial successes in American journalism have
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 235 been gained by newspapers of the most debased and ruffianly description , it is also true that the most dignified examples of our journalism have proved , if not the most successful , at least successful enough to gratify any reasonable ambition .

		The choice by no means lies between success at the price of decency and failure with the preservation of self-respect .

		In order to provide some sort of justification for the title given to these remarks , we must turn from the foregoing abstract considerations to something in the nature of concrete illustra - tion .

		We all know that '' newspaper science '' is a term of reproach , and the reason is not far to seek .

		The same spirit of sensationalism that leads to the detailed chronicling of a prize fight or a criminal trial leads also to the exploitation of every sort of mental vagary that cloaks itself with the respectable name of science .

		Whether it be a belated alchemist who claims to have discovered the stone of the philosophers , or an exponent of the newest and most extravagant occultism , whether it be a palmist or a '' mind - reader '' or a `` faith - healer , '' whether it be a Shaconian or a circle-squarer or a pyramid en - thusiast or a direful prophet with a tale of the coming destruction of the world , there is no per - son so scientifically impossible that he can not get into the newspapers , and enlist their services in the propaganda of his pet eccentricity or insane delusion .

		He can get himself taken seriously , or at least serni-seriously , and that is what he wants .

		For all such persons notoriety is the very breath of life , and the newspapers provide it without scruple , because in so doing they can at the same time provide the weak-minded sec - tion of their readers with a new variety of mental dissipation .

		The most incredible inan - ities , the most preposterous notions , the most meaningless pseudo-science are thus given a currency that is denied even to the genuine achievements of investigation .

		This work is done , moreover , in so blunder - ing and hap-hazard a way that the spirit of sensationalism is not enough completely to ac - count for it .

		There is usually in addition some admixture of an ignorance so dense that one can only marvel at the number of essentially uneducated people who by some mysterious dispensation get their lucubrations into print .

		We recall a newspaper article published in
Chicago	LOCATION	some years ago which undertook to instruct a confiding public upon the subject of ozone .

		The account was a brief one , but it contrived to include statements to the effect that the true nature of ozone was not fully under - stood , that it got its name '' from the peculiar odor , which resembles that produced when a succession of electric sparks are passed through the air , '' that
Faraday	PERSON	considered it '' identical with the medicinal quality in electricity , '' that the effect of inhaling it was very '' exhiliatory , '' and that
M. Jules Verne	PERSON	had once told an interesting '' story of the wild doings in a vil - lage which became accidentally permeated '' with ozone .

		This illustration is trivial enough , no doubt , but it is so extremely typical of the sort of '' newspaper science '' we are concerned with that it will serve as well as another .

		The wonder of it is , of course , that any person so absolutely ignorant of elementary chemistry should write , and that any newspaper should print , so astonishing a farrago of misinforma - tion .

		One more illustration must suffice us .

		An improved method for the liquefaction of air has recently attracted much attention , and the newspapers have naturally taken it up .

		The same newspaper which was responsible for the remarkable statements about ozone to which reference was just made quotes the inventor as '' stating that with three gallons of the liquid he had repeatedly made ten gallons , and that he could go on doing so for any length of time . '' ''

		There is no reason to doubt this assertion '' is the astonishing editorial comment upon this astonishing statement .

		Now if this means that the energy liberated from the aerification of a certain quantity of the liquefied air is sufficient , without any auxiliary energy , to reduce a still larger quantity to the liquid form , it is the flat - test of impossibilities , for it denies the prin - ciple of the conservation of energy , which is the fundamental principle upon which all phys - ical science rests .

		A schoolboy less omniscient than
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's should know such a statement to be impossible , and he should know it with a firmness of conviction that should make him willing to stake his life upon it .

		If a school - boy can get through a common high school ed - ucation without knowing this and other uni - versal principles of the same order there must have been something radically wrong about his instruction .

		And it is because we are inclined to think that there often is something radically wrong about the teaching of elementary science , that such teaching is too apt to make information rather than intellectual discipline its chief aim , that we have wished to provide this moral with the sharpest possible of points .

		POE AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Is it not strange how Foe 's name is usually the signal for a free fight ?

		One might go up and down the streets proclaiming that
Longfellow	PERSON	or
Bryant	PERSON	or Whitman or anybody was the greatest American poet , and all would be somnolent and calm .

		But to speak of Foe in that connection is to evoke cudgels .

		In my case it is all Donny brook to a single shillelah .

		One critic , indeed , whom I am proud to call my friend , Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	'' Inquirer , '' has stood forth to champion the champion of an oppressed poet .

		Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	is in some sense the father of the new
Poe	PERSON	cult , so it is only right he should fight for his offspring .

		Although I assumed in my article printed in THE DIAL some time since that there was a widespread pre - judice against
Poe	PERSON	, I am surprised at the extent of it .

		One correspondent , dating , of all places , from
Baltimore	LOCATION	, is particularly incensed .

		He claims it to be a well-known fact that whenever
Poe	PERSON	wished to make a parade of learning he was in the habit of getting Professor Anthon to coach him .

		I did not refer to the vexed question of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's scholarship in my article , deeming it superfluous to do so .

		In all probability
Poe	PERSON	had the same sort of learning as had
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		It was rich and various and vital , rather than exact and dull and dead .

		He knew at least the alphabets of the whole circle of sciences and arts , knew their relations to each other and their bearings on human life .

		And when he wanted any special information he knew what slave of the lamp , Anthon or another , to summon up to get it for him .

		The notion that he had Professor Anthon on tap during the whole of his lit - erary life is really a humorous one .

		We must imag - ine him sending an order for an assorted bill of erudi - tion , and getting in return , as per invoice , samples and supplies of such goods to deck his show-window .

		In nine cases out of ten such a procedure would be more trouble to any man who had wits of his own than to study up the subjects for himself .

		The same corre - spondent also states that be has talked with several
New York	LOCATION	literary men about
Poe	PERSON	, and they all gave him a bad character .

		Very likely .


New York	LOCATION	literary men are capable of anything .

		My correspondent has the advantage over me in knowing them , and I can not contradict him .

		I have gone up to
New York	LOCATION	more than once , but I always camped on a hillside and preached the destruction of the city from afar .

		However , my proper purpose in recurring to the Poe question is to answer , as far as I may , the temperate and courteous communications which have appeared in THE DIAL .

		With Professor Tolman I have very little quarrel .

		I have no doubt he is sealed of the tribe of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		His analysis of
Poe	PERSON	's '' additions '' is amusing .

		I always suspected there was something queer about that treasure chest , but I never worked it out .

		Such errors , however , are even more trivial than Shake - speare 's anachronisms , and do not touch what I meant when I spoke of his inerrancy .

		I referred to what I might term the mathematics of character , that sense of logic in him which compelled him to think straight and act straight in a world which is fond of curves and compliances .

		I have no desire to make
Poe	PERSON	out an angel or an uusinning man .

		He was doubtless nothing of the sort .

		But his faults were such as com - port with truth .

		His great sin indeed was the same as
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's , and he has doubtless long been treading with bended back that ledge of Purgatory where Pride is punished .

		Professor
Tolman	PERSON	says that
Poe	PERSON	can never be pop - ular .

		Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	, on the other hand , claims that he is popular , or at least widely prized .

		This is the crux of the case .

		He was immensely popular in his lifetime his work startled the public and vivified magazines and yet he was unpaid .

		He is popular in death `` The Raven , '' I suppose , is , after Gray 's '' Elegy , '' the best-known short poem in the language and yet he is proscribed .

		It is the horrible injustice of this fate which moved me to protest .

		Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	, in spite of real fairness , is dominated by the traditional conception of
Poe	PERSON	as a sort of a
Giant Pape	ORGANIZATION	sitting in the door of a cave strewn with hu - man bones and grinning horribly .

		It does not appear to me that
Poe	PERSON	is often baleful or ghastly ; his art is usually controlled by too strong a sense of beauty to be really unpleasant .

		But he is prevailingly tragic .

		If Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	will look squarely at the masterpieces of tragic poetry he will find that they are all of the char - nel and the pit .

		What breath of plain air is there in the '' JEdipus Tyrannos , '' or '' Macbeth , '' or the greater part of '' Faust '' ?

		Is there not in all of them the intense and contorted atmosphere of a thunderstorm ?

		And with lesser tragedians , such as Ford or
Webster	PERSON	or
Emily Bronte	PERSON	, the sheer horror is still more accentuated .

		The difference between these writers and
Poe	PERSON	is that they get their tragic effects from human beings , while he deals mainly with abstractions .

		From a Greek point of view , and even more from that of the art of the
East	LOCATION	, this conventionalizing and generalizing may be defended as tending to unity , proportion , and effect .

		And this brings me to Mr.
Barrows	PERSON	's charge against
Poe	PERSON	of a want of realism , naturalness , or , to put it in its strongest word , truth .

		Truth , like heaven , has many mansions .

		Every age inhabits a different one or to be more accurate , mankind vibrates between its town house of conventionality and its home amid the forests and the floods .

		In the day of the '' Spectator , '' Shake - speare was thought a barbarian or a wildly irregular genius .

		In the time of the domestic novel ,
Poe	PERSON	naturally went to the wall .

		The volcanoes are extinct or are piped to furnish heat to our hot-houses .

		The witch Imagina - tion has been thrust out of doors and the hag Fact installed in her place .

		Our ideal felicity is a balance at our bankers , a country villa , and everything handsome about us .

		But the slicked-up human being is a savage still .

		Fire and flood and famine and disease and war still exist .

		The perturbations of nature and the pas - sions of man are still untamed .

		And because
Poe	PERSON	, in an odd enough way I grant , expresses these primal things , he is nearer eternal truth than the painters and reporters of the surface of society .

		It may be answered me that there are other primal things sunlight and peace and happiness .

		Of course .

		But Tragedy does not much deal with them .

		People may say that they do not like Tragedy that they will not read Tragedy .

		The incredible childishness of the American mind does say something of the sort .

		And it identifies the artist with his art ; it executes the bearer of bad tidings ; it hisses the villain of the melodrama from the stage .

		The consent of the rest of the world , however , calls him the greatest poet who faces the darkest storm of life , who searches the deepest chasms
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 and climbs the most inaccessible peaks of human nature .

		Poe 's art is tragic therefore it deals with evil it could not do otherwise .

		But that he compromises with evil or is wanting in moral motives is a singular error .

		The reverse is the case to a degree that hurts his art .

		His spirituality and high-mindedness are everywhere apparent .

		Conscience comes too easily upon the scene ; the Furies lurk around every corner ; Nemesis follows upon the slightest transgression .

		It is only neces - sary to compare him with
Stevenson	PERSON	to bring this out .

		Stevenson deals with evil almost in the spirit of mischief .

		The worse his characters are the better he likes them .

		He as much exceeds the sane tolerance of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, which accepts evil because it is necessary and then does justice to it , as Foe falls short of such an outlook . ''

		Place aux dames '' is an honored custom , and I hope my woman critic will forgive me for leaving her com - munication to the last .

		I do it because it is perhaps the most important one I have to deal with .

		To give up
Poe	PERSON	as a heartless genius is too much it leaves his intellect living in too dry a place .

		My own view of the matter is that his nature vibrated between the two poles of thought and feeling ; that it was his super - sensitiveness , his extra emotionality , which brought him half his hurts , and which caused him to case himself as in a shell against the world .

		To those who accept
Lowell	PERSON	's flippant characterization of
Poe	PERSON	as one whose heart had been squeezed out by his brain , it must seem strange that nearly all his best poems were dictated by personal affection were tributes to those he loved .

		It is true they are not like the usual run of poems of the affection the keepsake kind .

		Poe was a conscious artist even when most moved , when most inspired . ''

		Ulalume '' was rejected originally by a woman editor , and it is a strange dirge for a dead wife .

		One of the main uses of books of travel , however , is to teach us that all men do not think or feel alike .

		In this matter of high sentiment , as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	would scoffingly phrase it , the Anglo-Saxon temperament is not to have the last word .

		I do not see that
Poe	PERSON	's embodiment of his wife in
Ulalume	LOCATION	is more out of the way than Pe - trarch 's personifications and canonizations of
Lady Laura	LOCATION	, or than
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's using
Beatrice	PERSON	to typify the Divine Wisdom and putting in her mouth immeasurable ser - mons of scholastic philosophy .

		Petrarch and
Dante	PERSON	have not been accounted heartless men , though both of them were probably more faithless to their loves than
Poe	PERSON	.

		It will be admitted , I think , that it is difficult as well as ungracious to argue with a woman .

		Their methods of thought are different from those of men ; and , be - sides , like Britomart in
Spenser	LOCATION	, they always tilt with enchanted lances .

		My critic reproaches
Poe	PERSON	for not voic - ing the common feelings of mankind and then when he does this very thing , coining his heart blood into tokens of beauty which must be current forever she turns upon him and taunts him with the musical outpourings of self pity .

		What will satisfy her ?

		A poet must speak his feelings and he must not .

		Resolve me this riddle .

		As for girding up his loins in the strenuous Anglo-Norman fashion I should like to know what else
Poe	PERSON	was doing all his life .

		I know of no poet who played his part in a manlier way .

		He faced the world with fierce independence .

		He cringed to no one and asked no help .

		He labored honestly to support his family .

		He paid his own '' freight , '' which we have the authority of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	for asserting that
Horace	PERSON	did not do .

		He did not go gallivanting after strange women .

		And when his wife died he mourned her in an immortal poem .

		In the name of all the Gods and fishes what can the most exacting feminine ask more ?

		I have only one thing else to notice , and that is what somebody calls the '' bad physics and worse metaphys - ics '' of the '' Eureka . ''

		I am not to speak of physics , yet I can see there are some considerable errors in the piece .

		A notable one is a grossly absurd theory as to the variations in vegetation in high latitudes in past times .

		The received hypothesis is that they were caused by the eccentricity of the earth 's orbit .

		Poe was per - fectly cognizant of
Kepler	PERSON	's laws and the ` mistake is a mere oversight .

		There are other flaws , but I do not be - lieve enough of them to make his physics at all foolish .

		His main position , the finite nature of the physical uni - verse , is , I understand , coming to be the accepted astro - nomical view .

		As to his metaphysics , he shares the fate of all other philosophers in that they are not provable .

		But this thought is interesting and in the main original .

		One of the most remarkable things in ''
Eureka	LOCATION	'' is the suggestion of a new method of proof or of a sense for reaching such a proof , which he names the intuitional fac - ulty .

		To a certain extent this faculty is the same as
Kant	PERSON	's moral judgment that issues `` categorical imperatives , '' and it is still more closely akin to
Cardinal Newman	ORGANIZATION	's
Illative Sense	ORGANIZATION	.

		That the physicists and English School of philosophers deny the existence of any such judgment or faculty or sense does not rob
Poe	PERSON	of the credit of a bold speculation .

		And now I am done .

		It is not the least my desire to claim for Poe a place with the great world poets .

		I think , though , that he is the most vital and universal force in letters
America	LOCATION	has yet produced .

		As com - pared with
Tennyson	PERSON	, when one takes him with all his best and makes the necessary omissions and excep - tions from
Tennyson	LOCATION	, they are , I think , about equal in range and equal in execution .

		And the underivable and daemonic spark burns brighter in
Poe	LOCATION	than in the English poet .

		On the whole , I would rank him beside the great originating poets of the beginning of the century , beside
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Leopardi	LOCATION	, and
Heine	LOCATION	.

		If this estimate is true he has not had his just deserts .

		That it is true is my thesis , which , as I think I have sufficiently defended it , I deliver to the judgment of others .

		THE BROWNING LOVE - LETTERS .

		* Probably the majority of right-minded and duly reticent persons learned with surprise , not to say a distinct shock , that the son of
Robert	PERSON	and
Elizabeth Barrett Browning	PERSON	was to present to the world , in cold type , the private corre - spondence of his parents preceding their mar - riage .

		Could any circumstances justify such a proceeding ?

		Could it be anything but a desecration to remove the veil which fittingly is permitted to screen the most interior and sacred moments of life from the gaze of the public ?

		Have the living a right to publish what the dead have refrained from publishing , especially when it has been written for the eyes of one person only ?

		However one may have answered these ques , - tions before opening the volumes , whoever now reads the whole of these
1135	DATE	pages of love - letters for love-letters they are , even from the very first will hesitate no longer in gratitude that literature and life have been enriched by classics of a new order .

		The qualification here made to read the whole needs emphasis ; because if one were to pick up the volumes with a deficient knowledge of the very peculiar lim - itations and situations surrounding the writers , and read only a page here and there at random , it is quite possible he will lay them down with derision or even disgust .

		But this is also true of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's
Vita JVuova	PERSON	, or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Son - nets , or any of the other love-classics of litera - ture .

		They all presuppose a sympathetic mood , and some degree of knowledge of the situation , on the part of the reader .

		Two special reasons may be urged in the present instance for setting aside the usual con - siderations of reservation from the printed page : first , because
Robert Browning	PERSON	and
Elizabeth Barrett Browning	PERSON	have come to stand as the type of manned lovers in all time , as truly as
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Beatrice	PERSON	have come to stand for the type of the romantic and idealizing sentiment of man for woman , in all time ; second , because there is here no '' raking of a man 's desk '' when he has ceased to be able to guard it , since Mr.
Browning	PERSON	left the collection with his son , say - ing , '' Do with them as you please , when 1 am dead and gone . ''

		* LETTERS OF
ROBERT BROWNING	PERSON	AND ELIZABETH BAR - RETT BARRETT , 1845-1846 .

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Moreover , the world is not in danger of be - ing reminded too often that there is a genius for loving , and that it may be just as admir - able , and is perhaps even more rare , than a genius for poetry or music or painting or sci - ence .

		When superlative gifts both for lov - ing and for poesy are combined , as in these two persons , rare and precious indeed to the world are the fruits thereof !

		Of such , came the '' Sonnets from the Portuguese . ''

		These indeed would be denied us , and even more strenuously , by the same canons that would deny us the '' Letters . ''

		For not only were these not written for general circulation , they were not written even for the eye of the one lover who inspired them , but merely as the ex - pression of an over-full heart .

		In fact , these now famous sonnets were never shown to Mr.
Browning	PERSON	himself until months after his mar - riage .

		At
Pisa	LOCATION	, one day , as he stood looking out of the window , a packet was thrust into his pocket from behind , by his wife , who begged him to destroy it if he did not approve , and then immediately fled from the room while he should read it .

		But
Browning	PERSON	dared not reserve to himself what he recognized at once as '' the finest sonnets since Shakespeare . ''

		So , under the purposely misleading title '' Sonnets from the Portuguese , '' Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	was persuaded to include them in the next edition of her works , published three years later .

		Time is the great reconciler , and after some years these '' Let - ters '' will come to their own among the classics of love-prose , as the '' Sonnets '' have won long since their unquestioned place in love-poetry .

		Indeed , Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's turns of expression here not infrequently recall the sonnet senti - ments and phrases , though there is no direct allusion to their composition , unless this may be counted as one : '' You shall see some day at
Pisa	LOCATION	what I will not show you now .

		Does not
Solomon	PERSON	say that ' there is a time to read what is written ' ?

		If he does n't he ought . ''

		But , aside from the consideration that since '' all mankind love a lover '' they must perforce love such lovers as these , the '' Letters '' will go far to correct many hitherto generally accepted errors of biography .

		For example , on the au - thority of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	we have believed that '' During the months of their brief courtship , closing , as all the world knows , in their clan - destine flight and romantic wedding of Septem - ber 12 ,
1846	DATE	, neither poet showed any verses to the other . ''

		No statement could be farther from the truth .

		In the first place , eighteen mouths of courtship scarcely can be called

		THE DIAL 239 '' brief , '' either as to time or as to opportunities of acquaintance .

		It included ninety personal interviews and between three and four hun - dred of these very long and intimately confi - dential letters , in which each disclosed to the other not only the feelings of the moment but incidents of their preceding lives , descriptions of family traits , daily habits , personal friends , etc. .

		Passing over the words '' clandestine '' and '' romantic '' though they convey a false impression , since it was necessity alone that compelled a secrecy most distasteful and for - eign to both natures nothing could be more misleading than that they did not share their writings with each other .

		Their letters reveal a continual consultation about the work that each was doing .

		Especially this was true of Mr.
Browning	PERSON	's compositions during these months of
1845	DATE	and
1846	DATE	.

		The Flight of the Duchess '' was sent to Miss
Barrett	PERSON	almost stanza by stanza as written ; '' Saul '' in its first form received her comments , and it was she who suggested that the printer 's marks should indi - cate that it was published as a fragment ; ''
Luria	PERSON	'' and '' A Soul 's Tragedy '' were read by her in their proof-sheets , and here are pages of her advice about them .

		Collaboration even was once proposed by him , to which she re - sponded : '' If you would like to write something together ' with me , / should like it still better .

		I should like it for some ineffable reasons .

		And I should not like it a .

		bit the less for the grand supply of jests it would ad - minister to the critical
Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	, about visible darkness , multiplied by two , mounting into palpable obscure .

		We should not mind ... should we ?

		You would not mind , if you had got over certain other con - siderations deconsiderating to your coadjutor .

		Yes but I dare not do it ... I mean , think of it ... just now , if ever . ''

		It is plain all through that each found a true inspiration in the other .

		Before their meeting , he had written : '' You do what I always wanted , hoped to do , and only seem now likely to do for the first time .

		You speak out , you , I only make men and women speak give you truth broken into prismatic hues , and fear the pure white light , even if it is in me , but I am going to try ; so it will be no small comfort to have your com - pany just now , seeing that when you have your men and women aforesaid , you are busied with them , whereas it seems bleak , melancholy work this talking to the wind . ''

		After a meeting had been secured through the kindness of their common friend Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	, and the rule of a weekly visit had been estab - lished ,
Browning	PERSON	writes : '' You do not understand what a new feeling it is for me to have someone who is to like my verses or I shall not ever like them after !

		So far differently was I cir - cumstanced of old , that I used rather to go about for a subject of offence to people ; writing ugly things in order to warn the ungenial and timorous off my grounds at once .

		I shall never do so again at least !

		As it is , I will bring all I dare , in as great quantities as I can if not next time , after then certainly .

		I must make an end , print this
Autumn	DATE	my last four ' Bells , ' Lyrics , Romances , The Tragedy , ' and then go on with a whole heart to my own Poem indeed , I have just resolved not to begin any new song , even , till this grand clear - ance is made . ''

		Let those who declaim against
Browning	PERSON	's obscurity thank Miss
Barrett	PERSON	that the case is no worse .

		That '' Sordelloisms , '' as she called them , appear at times , even in his letters , ought to go far to remove the frequent charge of '' wilful obscurity , '' since it is not to be con - ceived that in his love-letters would any man '' wilfully '' be anything less than clear .

		In this sprightly fashion she writes to him of one of his best-known and most melodious lyrics now called `` Home-Thoughts from Abroad . '' ''

		Your spring-song is full of beauty , as you know very well and ' that 's the wise thrush ' so characteristic of you -LRB- and of the thrush too -RRB- that I was sorely tempted to ask you to write it twice over ... and not send the first copy to
Mary Hunter	PERSON	, notwithstanding my promise to her .

		And now , when you come to print these frag - ments , would it not be well to stoop to the vulgarism of prefixing some word of introduction , as other people do , you know ... a title ... a name ?

		You perplex your readers often by casting yourself on their intelligence in these things ... Now these fragments ... you mean to print them with a line between ... and not one word at the top of it now do n't you ?

		And then people will read ' Oh , to be in
England	LOCATION	, ' and say to themselves , ' Why , who is this ?

		... Who 's out of
England	LOCATION	? '

		Which is an extreme case , of course ; but you will see what I mean ... And often I have observed how some of the very most beautiful of your lyrics have suffered just from your disdain of the usual tactics of writers in this one respect . ''

		These glimpses into the workshop , so to speak , are of especial value because biography hitherto has not been satisfactory in the case of either poet .

		The standard '' Life '' of
Robert Brown	PERSON	- ing by Mrs.
Orr	PERSON	though accurate and full as to external details , is singularly barren of any insight into the poetic side of the man , and one fails to trace in it that connection which we know must exist between the life and the life-product of any man .

		And Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's biographers have been so much at sea that they have differed even as to the date of her birth .

		Charming discussions of such subjects as lovers in all ages are wont to write of such as the books they read , the persons they meet , the thoughts of each day , and the dreams both by day and night are here to be found in rich profusion , as may be seen by consulting 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, the copious Index at the close .

		There is temp - tation to quote what they have to say of their contemporaries
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, Words - worth , Mill ,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, and other celebrities .

		Moreover , both had great gifts as letter-writers , and their words invite citation as specimens of good literature , never stilted or formal , but sparkling and often playful as letters should be .

		But , after all , it is the two principal figures that make the charm of the book .

		Meeting in the full maturity of their poetic powers and richly endowed natures , without previous en - tanglements or even youthful fancies , each finds in the other the most perfect companion - ship , inspiration , protection , that life can know .

		Now , as never before , can we realize not only the full significance of the '' Sonnets from the Portuguese , '' but also how it was not poetic effect but simple truth that prompted
Robert Browning	PERSON	's '' Prospice , '' '' One Word More , '' the invocation to '' Lyric Love , '' and that stanza of '' By the Fireside '' : '' I am named and known by that hour 's feat .

		There took my station and degree ; So grew my own small life complete , As nature obtained her best of me . ''

		THE STORY OF A FAMOUS IMPOSTURE .

		* In the latter part of the year
1558	DATE	there was published in
Venice	LOCATION	a small octavo volume of but fifty-eight folios , consisting of two parts , wholly distinct in character , and put together in one book only because the leading actors in both were members of the same family .

		The first part , which is about four-fifths of the whole , relates to travels in
Persia	LOCATION	by
Caterino Zeno	ORGANIZATION	, Venetian Ambassador to that country in
1471	DATE	-
73	DATE	; it is of undeniable authenticity in its main features , but of no great value .

		The second part , having the sub-title , '' Concerning the Discovery of the
Islands Frislanda	LOCATION	,
Eslanda	LOCATION	,
Engroueland	LOCATION	,
Estotilanda	LOCATION	, and
Icaria	LOCATION	, made by the two brothers
Zeni	PERSON	,
Messire Nieolb	PERSON	, the Knight , and
Messire Antonio	PERSON	, with a map of the said Islands , '' has made a great noise in the world , and yet , if we may accept the verdict of Mr.
Fred	PERSON	.


W. Lucas	PERSON	, `` is pure fic - tion and wholly valueless .

		This part consists * THE ANNALS OF THE VOYAGES OF THE BROTHERS NfcoL & AND ANTONio ZENO in the

Fourteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, and the Claim Founded thereon to a
Venetian Discovery of America	ORGANIZATION	.

W. Lucas	PERSON	, author of '' Appendiculae Historic * , '' etc. .

		Illustrated by facsimiles .


London	LOCATION	:
Henry Stevens Son & Stiles	ORGANIZATION	.

		mainly of letters purporting to have been written by the two
Brothers Zeni	ORGANIZATION	, and giving accounts of the important discoveries they had made in the far northern seas .

		These discoveries relate to certain countries and islands , several of which are mentioned in the sub-title , the names of which even general readers of history will re - member to have seen on old maps strewn about in the
North Atlantic Ocean	LOCATION	.

		The story really involves the question of the discovery of Amer - ica a full century before
Columbus	LOCATION	crossed the
Sea of Darkness	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book , says Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	, '' Went forth to the world with the prestige of the well-known names of
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	,
Barbaro	ORGANIZATION	, and
Marcolini	PERSON	attached to it ; and it appears to have been at once ac - cepted , without question , as genuine history and geog - raphy ; indeed , there seems to have been no reason why , at that time , it should not have been so accepted .

		The cartography of the
Northern Atlantic	LOCATION	was still confused .

		Many non-existent islands appeared upon the best maps of the time .

		It was still a question whether
Greenland	LOCATION	was united to the Continent of
Europe	LOCATION	, or to
America	LOCATION	, or to both , or whether it was part of
Asia	LOCATION	, or an island .

		The latter question was , indeed , still open until
Peary	PERSON	's recent explorations settled the fact that it was an island . ''

		The influence of the
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	book , which had
Nicolb Zeno	ORGANIZATION	the younger for its author , who said he found the materials in the family home in
Venice	LOCATION	, was far-reaching and lasting .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	devotes thirteen of his folio pages to illustrations of its influence upon subsequent publications , especially maps , but stops short long before reaching the end of the list that he might have given , having said enough to show that for nearly a hundred years after their pub - ' lication the book and map were generally looked upon as authentic .

		Still , doubts as to their genuineness soon began to appear , and have continued to grow until the authority of the whole story , while by no means destroyed , has become greatly impaired .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	no doubt hopes to deal it a death-blow .

		It was in no way strange that the Zeno doc - uments , both book and map , should have been accepted as genuine in the sixteenth century ; but , considering the gross improbability of some of the incidents , the discrepancies that exist between the book and the map , and the impos - sibility of adjusting the story to the facts of history and geography , it would certainly seem strange that it has retained any authority at all .

		In fact , the most ingenious and far-fetched devices have been resorted to to remove the difficulties that the book presents .

		Two exam - ples may be given .

		The elder
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	, writing to his brother Antonio , says he found on the island of Frislanda a great Lord named
Zechmni	PERSON	, master of some islands called Porlanda , '' who
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 was certainly as worthy of immortal remem - brance as any other who has ever lived in this world , on account of his great valor and many good qualities . ''

		Of course the Zeno adherents must identify this puissant chief , which they do , or at least some of them , by finding him in
Henry Sinclair	PERSON	of
Roslyn	LOCATION	,
Earl	PERSON	of the Orkneys and
Caithness	ORGANIZATION	by the investiture of
King Hacon	PERSON	of
Norway	LOCATION	in
1379	DATE	.

		To say nothing of histor - ical questions , the derivation of Zechmni from
Henry Sinclair	PERSON	is a philological feat upon which a layman , at least , had better not comment .

		Again , one ` feature of the marvellous tale of a fisherman who cuts an important figure in the letters , is that a king in
Estotoland	LOCATION	, an island situated in the far Western ocean , dwelt in a populous city with walls , and had Latin books in his library , which neither he nor anyone about him could read , a tale that moves Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	, who never lets slip a good story if he can help it , to ask : '' Pruning this sentence of its magniloquence , might it perhaps mean that there was a large palisaded village , and that the chief had some books in Roman char - acters , a relic of some castaway which he kept as a fetich . ''

		We can not deal with Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's specific answers to the arguments that have been ad - vanced in defense of the book , but rather make room for his own final conclusions , which are as follows : '' 1 .

		That , though Nfcol6 and
Antonfo Zeno	ORGANIZATION	may have sailed into the
North Sea	LOCATION	, and may even have visited the
Continental Frislanda	ORGANIZATION	,
Frisia	LOCATION	, or
Friesland	ORGANIZATION	, and may have written letters to
Venice	LOCATION	during their travels , Nfcol6 Zeno , the younger , certainly did not compile his narrative from any such letters , but from the published works of
Bordone	LOCATION	,
Olaus Magnus	PERSON	, and other authors indicated above . ''

		2 .

		That the two accounts of
Greenland	LOCATION	attributed to Nfcolo and
Antonfo Zeno	ORGANIZATION	are untrue as applied to that country , and could not have been honestly written by any persons who had visited it .

		`` 3 .

		That there is no evidence that Antonfo Zeno ever visited any part of
America	LOCATION	, or any of its islands , as claimed by
Marco Barbaro	PERSON	, Terra-Rosso ,
Zurla	LOCATION	,
Beauvois	PERSON	, and others ; nor , indeed , do the Annals them - selves state that he did so . ''

		4 .

		That there is no evidence to show that either
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	or Juan de la Cosa ever heard of ' Frislanda . ' ''

		5 .

		That , in fact , no such island as
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	's Frislanda ever existed , his map of it having been compounded from earlier maps of
Iceland	LOCATION	and the Faroes . ''

		6 That Zichmni , if such a man ever existed , was certainly not identical with
Henry Sinclair	PERSON	,
Earl	PERSON	of Orkney . ''

		7 .

		That the story that the Carta de
Navegar	ORGANIZATION	' was copied from an old map found in the archives of the Zeno family is a pure fiction ; and that it was , in fact , concocted from several maps of various dates and nation - alities , and not from any one map . ''

		8 .

		That a sufficient motive for the compilation of
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	's story and map is to be found in a desire to con - nect , even indirectly , the voyages of his ancestors with a discovery of
America	LOCATION	earlier than that by
Columbus	LOCATION	, in order to gratify the compiler 's family pride and his own personal vanity , and to pander to that Venetian jealousy of other maritime nations -LRB- especially of the Genoese -RRB- which was so strong in the early days of the decadence of the great
Venetian Republic	ORGANIZATION	, and which , later on , appeared so forcibly in the works of
Terra	LOCATION	-
Rossa	ORGANIZATION	,
Zurla	LOCATION	, and other Venetian writers . ''

		9 .

		That however harmless may have been the orig - inal motive of
Nfcol6 Zeno	ORGANIZATION	, the younger , for the com - pilation of the narrative and map , it ceased to be innocent when he reedited his map for publication in
Ruscelli	ORGANIZATION	's edition of Ptolemy -LRB- 1561 -RRB- , whose work was , in
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	's time , accepted as the greatest authority on geography . ''

		10 .

		That
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	's work has been one of the most ingenious , most successful , and most enduring literary impostures which has ever gulled a confiding public . ''

		No doubt some readers will think that a publication which justifies such a characteriza - tion as this hardly merits such elaborate treat - ment as Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	and his publisher have bestowed upon it ; but the author replies to all such critics , that while the importance of the book from a practical point of view has long ceased to exist , it still possesses an historical and a literary interest , because upon the story contained in it is founded a claim on behalf of the Venetians to a pre-Columbian discovery of
America	LOCATION	, and also because the acceptance of the
Zeno	LOCATION	map as genuine by
Mercator	ORGANIZATION	and
Ortelius	PERSON	, the two leading cartographers of the
latter half of the sixteenth century	DATE	, was the cause of great confusion in the maps drawn during the latter part of that century and for nearly two hundred years afterwards .

		We must not dismiss Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's work with - out characterizing it as an excellent piece of historical investigation , and a most sumptuous volume typographically considered .

		The Zeno story is reproduced both in the original and in translation ; while there are eighteeen beautiful large facsimiles of important maps in plates in the appendix , besides numerous smaller fac - similes of other maps at the backs of half-titles and the ends of chapters .

		The all-important bibliography has also received due attention .

		Students of the subject will welcome the vol - ume for its original matter and its beautiful form , regardless of their views of the author 's conclusions .

		242 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, DATJDET AND HIS FAMILY .

		* The volume on
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	and his family inaugurates the uniform series of Dau - det 's works in English projected by pub - lishers who have already deserved well of French fiction by their edition of
Dumas	PERSON	.

		We could have wished for the present series a more auspicious beginning ; for this book is unsatis - factory in spite of its dainty binding and ex - cellent printing .

		Its faults are various .

		In the first place , the material is not homogeneous , save in the mediocrity of all its parts .

		In the second place , it is not well translated .

		The French shines through the English quite too often , and the English itself is not seldom ques - tionable in vocabulary and in style .

		We should not say , '' My father writes using a little plank screwed to the wall '' -LRB- p. 5 -RRB- ; we should say , '' shelf '' or '' board . ''

		We should not speak of `` great books , dripping with emotion and sweet - ness '' -LRB- p. 28 -RRB- ; nor should we say '' he broke me into my Latin '' -LRB- p. 42 -RRB- . ''

		Would '' for '' should '' is also common , and such infelicities as '' I made it a reproach to him to have never put , '' etc. -LRB- p. 51 -RRB- , are constant .

		We have marked many other passages , but it is hardly worth while to cite them .

		If it were important that the reader should know what Messrs.
Leon	PERSON	and
Ernest Daudet	PERSON	say , there would be some reason for desiring a revised version .

		As it is not a matter of the least consequence to the understanding or enjoyment of Daudet whether they are presented correctly or presented at all , we may as well turn from the translations to the originals of the book before us .

		These are three .

		Last in place and first in value , such as it is , is
M. Ernest Daudet	PERSON	's sketch of the youth and ancestry of the brothers .

		This was made in
1881	DATE	, and has no novelty to-day .

		It serves usefully to check the fancy of his brother 's '' Little What 's his Name , '' and adds some interesting , though so far as we discern , not particularly significant , details as to the family ancestry .

		It is soberly written , in a gen - erous and fraternal spirit .

		It could be read at any time with a certain mild pleasure .

		But it will be hailed with the devout fervor with which the thirsty pilgrim greets the oasis in the desert by those who approach it through the interme - diate section of the volume , an '' Appendix '' of eighty-one pages in which M. Leon casts into the form of '' a dialogue between my father * ALPHONSE DAUDET .

		By
L6on Daudet	PERSON	.

		To which is added '' The Daudet Family , '' by
Ernest Daudet	PERSON	.

		Translated from the French by
Charles de Kay	PERSON	.

		With portrait .

		Boston : Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		and me '' some half-digested '' thoughts '' on the imagination .

		The purpose , result , or organic unity of this composition we have been unable to discover .

		We surmise , however , that its purpose was to pad an over-thin book , of which most readers will have had more than enough before they get to it , so that its result will be nil .

		As to its organic unity , it has at least as much as the first part , the Memoir proper , which is about as unsatisfactory to analyze as a jelly-fish .

		You discern a sort of rudimentary organism at the start , acephalous and inverte - brate though it be ; but when you have dissected this out it shrivels away , and what is left is a glutinous mass of platitudinous literary jelly .

		The book , this part of it , is throughout maudlin at intervals , '' writ , '' as Lord
Byron	PERSON	would say , '' in a manner that is my aversion , '' peppered with `` O destiny ! ''

		`` O Shakespeare ! ''

		and similar literary hysterics .

		So far as we can see , it does not contain a single new liter - ary fact of moment , a single new critical point of view .

		It threshes the old grain over again , adding a good deal of paternal admonition to young Leon , that would be more edifying if he had not taken pains to make the scandals of his own domestic life as familiar to leading French newspapers as the dignity of his father 's home has been to the readers of Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	's excellent biographical study .

		Occasionally the carelessness of composition betrays
M. Leon Daudet	PERSON	, and he deviates into unintentional humor .

		Here , for instance , are a few lines describing young Alphonse at a fire : '' He appeared on the scene of the combat pour - ing water on himself and having water poured on him , holding a lance in his hand '' -LRB- p. 25 -RRB- .

		An edifying spectacle he must have made of himself .

		The French pompier is always a goodly spectacle , but
Alphonse	LOCATION	, pouring water on himself with one hand and holding a lance in the other , standing at his post ,
Casabianca	PERSON	- like , '' till the flames came and burned off his eyelashes and licked his hands , '' is heroic in his way , a worthy candidate for a Montyon prize .

		After this , one does not wonder to find the au - thor aver that '' unless I am mistaken the grand -LRB- say gr-r-r-and -RRB- philosophical system that we shall have to-morrow will put emotion in the first rank and will subordinate all else to it . ''

		Evidently common sense will have to take a back seat if ever the `` astre noir '' is in the ascendant .

		Meantime , to train himself for that consummation we are told that Alphonse '' did not boggle to compare '' the Stanley of Dark - est
Africa	LOCATION	'' with the victor of Austerlitz ''
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 -LRB- p. 45 -RRB- , nor
George Meredith	PERSON	with Hamlet -LRB- p. 46 -RRB- '' in that cottage where lights and shades played about his aureole '' -LRB- p. 47 -RRB- .

		It seems a pity not to extend this fascinating anthology from the family memoir of the great romancer .

		I have cited only from
the first quarter of	DATE
M. Leon Daudet	ORGANIZATION	's work , and the fourth of its treasures has not been told .

		I must draw this appreciation to a close ; but here is a nugget of political wisdom that one would not willingly spare .

		Apropos of Dreyfus : '' On the morning of the catastrophe I promised him -LRB-
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	-RRB- that Rochef ort -LSB- of all men -RSB- would come in person to confirm him in his certainty .

		The idea of the visit delighted him , because he much admired the great pamph - leteer and recognized in him a unique gift of observation analagous to the divining power of Drumont '' -LRB- p. 53 -RRB- .

		To all who know the men , this anti-climax is record-breaking , colossal .

		As to
M. Leon Daudet	ORGANIZATION	's memoirs as a whole , I looked forward with singular eagerness to its appearance in the Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	, and felt a perplexed disappointment from fortnight to fortnight as I first read its parts .

		Then came the book , to increase vexation by concentrating puerility .

		I must plead , therefore , for indul - gence if on this third reading of '' needy noth - ing trimmed in jollity '' I close with the author 's own words -LRB- p. 44 -RRB- : '' Every book is an organ - ism .

		If its organs are not in place it must die and its corpse become a nuisance . ''

		I do not think this book will be long in reaching the corpse stage .

		On the whole , however , I think the most epigrammatic summing up of my idea on this '' Memoir '' would be in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's words : '' Bottom , thou art translated . ''

		MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES .

		*
Senor Romero	PERSON	, the late distinguished minis - ter from
Mexico	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	, was ex - ceptionally qualified to write authoritatively upon the relations between the two countries .

		He twice held a cabinet position in his own country , so that he was familiar with its con - dition and policies .

		He was twice accredited to this country first during President
Lincoln	PERSON	's administration and again after but a short interval spent at home .

		He was practically a continuous resident in our country from the Civil War to the time of his death a few months since .

		It is no exaggeration to say that *
MEXICO	LOCATION	AND THE UNITED STATES .

		By
Matias Romero	PERSON	.

		Volume I.
New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		no representative of a foreign country at Wash - ington ever made a better impression or gained a higher position personal or official .

		The first 280 pages of this bulky volume now before us for review , ''
Mexico	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, '' are taken up with '' Geographical and Statistical Notes on
Mexico	LOCATION	. ''

		This part of the work has already appeared as an independent volume and has been noticed in THE DIAL .

		The remaining pages , almost five hundred in num - ber , are important historic or economic studies .

		In two papers '' Genesis of Mexican Inde - pendence '' and '' Philosophy of Mexican Rev - olutions '' Mr.
Romero	PERSON	shows that revolutions in
Mexico	LOCATION	are not mere exhibitions of turbu - lence , but natural , perhaps necessary events in a normal evolution from peculiar conditions .

		A study follows of '' Anglo-Saxon and Ro - man Systems of Jurisprudence . ''

		It is a com - mon impression in the
United States	LOCATION	that the legal systems of the two countries are extremely unlike and that justice is a thing unknown in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Romero	PERSON	clearly distinguishes common law and equity English Law and Roman Law .

		Both exist in our country .

		So , too , both exist , though unequally developed , in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The paper is an interesting statement of the exact conditions prevalent in the two countries .

		It may be remarked in passing that Mexican Law is not administered to the dis - advantage of Americans in the Republic ; fre - quently its terms are modified in favor of our citizens as a matter of national comity .

		One of the most interesting chapters in the book , as dealing with a question which has threatened international complications and which is not even now settled , is '' The Mexi - ican Free Zone . ''

		This `` free zone , '' estab - lished by the Mexican government at the solic - itation of the northern states especially Tam - aulipas has much distressed some of our wordy politicians .

		It has been asserted that it has given opportunity for enormous smug - gling operations and has defrauded our govern - ment of vast sums .

		Mr.
Romero	PERSON	, either as Secretary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	in
Mexico	LOCATION	or as Minister from
Mexico	LOCATION	, has never been an advo - cate of '' the Free Zone . ''

		He however shows , conclusively , by statistics .

		and argument , that no serious disadvantage can have come to the
United States	LOCATION	from its existence , that the con - trary really has happened , and that no great advantage has accrued to
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		In '' Silver and Wages in
Mexico	LOCATION	'' and '' Silver Standard in
Mexico	LOCATION	'' are discussions of sociologic-economic questions of timely inter - 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, est. .

		It is a mistake to draw conclusions for either country from the other .

		Conditions in the two are fundamentally different .

		That
Mexico	LOCATION	is flourishing to-day with a silver stand - ard does not prove that the
United States	LOCATION	would do so .

		Distribution of wealth , character of resources , nature of the laboring population , all are elements in the problem .

		The final chapter on '' The Pan-American Conference of
1889	DATE	'' is interesting as present - ing a straightforward statement of -LRB- a -RRB- the originating of the idea , -LRB- 6 -RRB- the purposes , -LRB- c -RRB- the make-up and work of this interesting gath - ering .

		What we thought of the meeting has some value : how it impressed the other partici - pating nations is of greater value especially at this moment when we stand in an entirely new position with reference to other countries .

		It is certain that the conference did not do all that was expected of it , that it did not impress our neighbors strongly with our disinterested - ness , but it did do something in bringing together representatives of neighboring coun - tries which have many common interests and must perforce have many inter-relations .

		These chapters have already appeared as con - tributions to periodical literature , and particu - larly to '' The North American Review . ''

		It is , however , a good idea to publish them in a con - nected and permanent form .

		Mr.
Romero	PERSON	, either by appendices or by changes and inter - polations in the text , brings the matter quite up to date . ''

		Mexico and the United States '' will be an important work of reference for politi - cians , for students of social and economic ques - tions , and for the increasingly large class of persons who for one reason or another are interested in our nearest southern neighbor .

		Upon read - ing the book , we are not surprised at the interest which it has excited , for it has qualities that set it far apart from the common run of fiction .

		Yet the impression gained from reading many English com - ments upon the novel was very different from the impression which the novel itself produces .

		It pre - sents a problem , no doubt , and one of the most startling ; but in such a case the manner is every - thing , and this particular problem , which becomes merely brutal in a bare statement , may be treated with the utmost delicacy , as the performance of Miss
Robins	PERSON	attests .

		Briefly put , it is the problem presented by two lovers , who are closely related by blood , and who both inherit a constitution predis - posed to the attack of consumption .

		Have two such people any right to the happiness that they most desire ?

		We can imagine the reply to this question of our greatest ethical teachers , the fierce negative of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, the more suave but equally emphatic negative of Renan and Mr.
Raskin	PERSON	.

		And , absolutely speaking , we should be bound to answer with them .

		But the case as it here lies before us is too compli - cated to be decided offhand .

		It is weakened by the notion that the fears of the lovers may be imaginary , for they are represented as under the obsession of the theoretical idea rather than as attacked by the disease , while modern science , as we know , emphat - ically denies that consumption is hereditary , the most that it admits being hereditary susceptibility .

		Again , the question of consanguineous marriage is an open one , as far as the exact limits of dan - ger or safety are concerned .

		In consequence of all this , we can not help feeling that the author of this book has failed to make out a case clear enough to justify even if otherwise justifiable her con - clusion .

		She seems herself to take too hard and fast a view of the matter , to be over-influenced by what are , after all , no more than theoretical con - siderations .

		Her actual solution is to bring her lovers into a compact whereby they purchase a year of happiness with the pledge that they will end their own lives rather than entail disease upon any life yet unborn .

		Here is an `` open question '' indeed , one upon which we will not presume to pass judg - ment .

		It is all very effectively and even poetically managed , and the idea loses most of its harshness in THE KEY OF THE HOLY HOUSE .

		THE DIAL , 245 the working-out .

		And the story , on its way up to this tragic ending , is full , not only of interest and acute observation , but has no small measure of those finer qualities which betoken genius .

		There are occasional longueurs in the way of semi-didactic discussion , but at least three-quarters of the book is fairly glowing with life , and the chief characters are creations in a very fine sense of that term . ''

		Poor Human Nature , '' by Miss
Elizabeth God	PERSON	- frey , is called '' a musical novel '' upon the title-page , but hardly deserves the description .

		It is mostly concerned with musical people , to be sure , for its leading characters are the principals in the royal opera of Blankenstadt , and a great deal of the talk is about operatic matters .

		But the author evinces no power to make verbal interpretation of music , and has only the externals of the singer 's life to set before us .

		When we contrast this treatment of the art with that found in ''
Evelyn Innes	PERSON	, '' for example , the difference is seen to be so great as to be one of kind .

		Miss
Godfrey	PERSON	's novel is little more than a sentimental love story , a story of the general type to which '' The First Violin '' belongs .

		It would have been essentially the same story had its characters been poets or painters instead of singers .

		In other words , the artistic terms in which it is stated are of the interchangeable sort .

		This does not prevent it from being a fairly acceptable novel of the kind in which sentiment almost achieves the convincing ac - cent of passion .

		The workmanship is nicely fin - ished , and the outcome is not too gloomy . ''

		An attempt to depict the emprise of a man who is a victim of the Napoleonic idea '' is what Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	tells us he has made in writing `` The Phantom Army . ''

		His hero is a Spaniard of extra - ordinary charm and strength of character at least he is intended to be all this who gathers about him a band of devoted adherents , and who seeks with their aid to overthrow the Spanish government , and even to overrun the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The au - dacity of his strategy leads him to several successful engagements , but he is overcome in the end , and suffers the death that such brigands deserve .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	has evidently got much of his material from a study of Carlist conspiracies and methods , with which he seems closely familiar .

		His work is brilliant episodically rather than successful as a whole , and one feels that the romance was planned upon a scale too large for the author 's powers .

		Despite a fault or two of construction , and a few loose ends in its complicated plot , '' God 's Prisoner , '' by Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	, remains one of the most captivating works of fiction that it has often been our good fortune to read .

		Beginning with a hot-blooded murder in
London	LOCATION	, it ends among the islands of the
South Pacific	LOCATION	, and its leading character has , in the interval , gone through a series of the most romantic and startling experiences .

		The author 's invention is unflaggingly brilliant , and his narrative manner both direct and forcible .

		We will not summarize the plot : that would be in this case peculiarly un - fair to the reader , besides being a totally inadequate way of conveying a notion of the remarkable qual - ities of the story .

		The reader bent upon excite - ment alone , and the reader who delights in the better qualities of romance in literary form and psy - chological portrayal , will alike find their account in a book which we counsel them not to miss .

		As far as our recollection goes , Mr.
Albert Lee	PERSON	is a newcomer in the field of romantic fiction , and his '' Key of the
Holy House	ORGANIZATION	'' is certainly a prom - ising piece of work .

		The scene is sixteenth century
Antwerp	LOCATION	, and the chief incidents are connected with the Spanish tyranny and the methods of the
Inqui	LOCATION	- sition .

		We have glimpses of the
Prince of Orange	ORGANIZATION	, and the Beggars of the Sea are our companions for a time .

		An English episode near the close gives us brief sight of the Queen , and altogether there is much brightly-colored interest in the story , both historical and inventive .

		To mention a small mat - ter , Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's Dutch names seem a trifle uncertain in their orthography .

		On the first page , for exam - ple , we have '' Nordenstrasse '' instead of `` Noord - enstraat . ''

		Messrs.
C. S. Bentley	PERSON	and
F. Kimball Scribner	PERSON	have collaborated in the production of '' The Fifth of
November	DATE	'' a historical romance that makes no great pretensions and that is put together in a straightforward and conscientious way .

		Its subject is , of course , the Gunpowder Plot , having Guy Fawkes for a central figure , and providing brief views of the
King	LOCATION	,
Monteagle	LOCATION	,
Catesby	PERSON	, and other historical characters .

		The fanatical spirit that led to the Plot is well reproduced in the dialogue , and the utter villainy of the thing is sufficiently tem - pered by our interest in the ringleaders and our sympathy with their motives to make the story a possible one .

		Two interesting examples of what may be called the biographical as distinguished from the historical romance have recently been published .

		In one of them Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	has told the story of Omar 's life .

		In the other Mr.
Walter Cranston Larned	PERSON	has subjected Rembrandt to similar treat - ment .

		Mr.
Dole	PERSON	's '' Omar the Tentmaker '' displays much knowledge of Persian history and life in the eleventh and twelfth centuries , and the meagre sup - ply of facts that have come down to us concerning
Omar	PERSON	's own life is in this case liberally eked out with selections from his verses , taken from several translations , and including many of which Fitz -
Gerald	PERSON	had no knowledge or took no cognizance .

		The result of this pastiche of history and poetry is distinctly readable , although it fails to create the illusion proper to romance .

		At least , it creates only , and that for an occasional moment , such illusion as there is in an
Arabian Night	ORGANIZATION	's Entertainment .

		We are a little startled to make acquaintance with an Omar who is a lover in the concrete sense , familiar as we are with the poet who sings so tenderly of love in the abstract ; but this proves merely an epi - sode in Mr.
Dole	PERSON	's romance , and the interest speedily lapses into the strictly historical and philosophical .

		But we can hardly forgive him for making the poet 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, anticipate the fin de siecle pun upon Omar and Homer .

		What Mr.
Dole	PERSON	calls '' an Oriental 's exces - sive fondness for playing on words '' should not be used as a cloak for his own paronomastic depravity .

		Mr.
Larned	PERSON	's '' Rembrandt '' embodies the essen - tial facts in the artist 's career , his sudden rise to fame , the history of his most famous pictures The Anatomy Lesson , '' '' The Night Watch , '' and '' The Syndics '' the pathetic story of his financial embarrassments , and , above all , the romance that has so linked the name of
Saskia	LOCATION	with his own that we can never think of the one without recalling the other .

		The whole narrative is informed with so generous an enthusiasm , and written with so vivid a sympathy , that we can easily pardon its excess of sentimentality and the vagueness of its character delineations .

		The book helps us , somehow , to feel the wonder of
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's consummate art , and that is doubtless what the author chiefly wished it to '' 0 >

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		As Prosector of the Zoological So -
Avian Anatomy	ORGANIZATION	, ciety of
London	LOCATION	, it has fallen to Mr.
Frank E. Beddard	PERSON	to bring to a suc - cessful completion in his '' Structure and
Classifi	PERSON	- cation of Birds '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- a treatise upon the subject of avian anatomy which his predecessors ,
Garrod	ORGANIZATION	and
Forbes	PERSON	, had projected .

		The book is timely , for there has been no comprehensive work of recent date upon this subject , in the English lan - guage , which at all compares with the Monograph of Fiirbringer , or
Gadow	PERSON	's extended treatise in
Broun	PERSON	's Thierreich , published in German .

		English investigators , of whom Mr.
Beddard	PERSON	is one , have long been leaders in this field and the author has not lacked for material at hand .

		Over 250 figures , drawn from original memoirs , adorn the volume , and with very few exceptions they come from En - glish sources , the names of
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Mivart	LOCATION	,
Garrod	ORGANIZATION	,
Mitchell	PERSON	,
Forbes	LOCATION	,
Selater	PERSON	, and Beddard being oft repeated as authorities .

		The book is a condensed and somewhat systematic presentation of the most important facts of comparative avian anatomy , and an extended discussion and application of these facts to the classification of the group of birds .

		In this phase of the work it is an advance upon any hitherto published .

		It is to be expected that old systems of classification would be disturbed some - what by this process .

		We are therefore not sur - prised to find that the author has severed the owls from their long association with the hawks and has shifted them to the neighborhood of the goat-suck - ers ; and to find him arguing for the primitive re - lationships of the pico-passerine group and the degeneracy of the Struthionidce as a type .

		For those who pursue at a distance the study of orni - thology with an opera-glass as a pastime or as an avocation , this book will not be light reading , though doubtless suggestive and profitable ; for those who with scalpel and lens seek the sterner discipline of a science , it will be invaluable .

		Beginning as far back as
William Lang	PERSON	- land and Sir Thomas More who are classed as Utopian socialists born out of due time the aim of the book is to show the varied types of socialism from time to time expressed in English literature .

		The principal space about one-half of the volume is given to the great prose writers of the last half-century .

		The novelists
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
George Eliot	PERSON	, and the essayists
Carlyle	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, are dealt with as prophets of socialism in twelve chapters of admirable construc - tive criticism .

		The concluding chapter on '' Con - temporary
England	LOCATION	'' is so delightfully optimistic that even one who does not share in the author 's enthusiam for social settlements can not fail to enjoy its pleasing picture of the present and its prophecy for the future . ''

		The mystic of former times , re - acting against conventions and longing for simplicity of life , fled like
Thoreau	PERSON	into the wilderness ; the mystic of the present , actuated by the same impulse , flees not from but to the world , betakes himself , not to the woods , but to a crowded city district , and steeps his soul in the joy of the widest human sym - pathy he can attain ... Children of privilege and children of toil will be united in these groups ; thinkers and laborers , women and men of delicate traditions and fine culture , mingled in close spiritual fellowship with those whose wisdom has been gained not through opportunity but through deprivation .

		... They will realize in a measure the old dream of
Langland	LOCATION	, fellow pilgrims of Truth , while they share life and labor in joyous comradeship . ''

		Memoirs of the ^ ew characters stand out more nobly wife of an in history than Lord

Charles	PERSON	.

		Few have been treated more exhaustively , as a result .

		Yet the '' Memoirs of Lady Russell '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , setting forth the facts in the life of his wife and widow , come to the reader in much the light of a revelation .

		She was his elder in years , a widow when he met her ; she survived him a full forty years , devoted to his memory until the end ; the honor which would have been his had he not been so mercilessly slain came to his descendants through her offices ; in every way her career is a notable one .

		There is a confused prefatory note to the volume which leaves the fact of preparation for the press much in doubt .

		It would seem that
Lady Stepney	PERSON	, une grande dame of four generations ago , brought the contents together from the family documents in her possession .

		It seems ungracious to criticize one so far beyond the reach of this modern world , but Lady
Stepney	PERSON	has injured her work seriously by making it , chiefly , a religious tractate , her illustrious kinswoman 's long and virtuous life lending itself as readily for the pointing of a moral as for the adornment of a tale .

		Lady
Russell	PERSON	was indeed a devoted maid , wife , and mother , and the book is to be read with profit in the human even more than the doctrinal sense .

		A brief , interesting , but not cogently re - lated memoir of Lady
Herbert	PERSON	, widow of the brave Sir
Edward	PERSON	who fought for his king so gallantly at
Naseby	LOCATION	, is added by way of conclusion .

		It serves to increase the dislike felt for
Charles II.	PERSON	, but is not of great importance .

		A `` Social Settlement handbook .

		Messrs.
Lentilhon & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	, have begun the publication of a convenient series of '' Handbooks for Practical Workers in Church and Philanthropy , '' edited by Professor
Samuel M. Jackson	PERSON	, of
New York University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the first volumes of the series is a little book on '' Social Settlements , '' by Professor
C. R. Henderson	PERSON	, of the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago .

		It opens with an historical introduction sketch - ing the changes in life and thought which led up to the newer and higher forms of philanthropy , followed by an account of the immediate genesis of the Uni - versity Settlements in
England	LOCATION	.

		Here one finds the names of Dr.
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	, Professor
Thomas Hill Green	PERSON	, Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Frederick Denison Mau	PERSON	- rice ,
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	, and
John Richard Green	PERSON	, as well as those of
Edward Denison	ORGANIZATION	,
Arnold Toynbee	PERSON	, and
Canon Barnett	ORGANIZATION	; and , in connection with the progress of the movement in
England	LOCATION	, those of both Mr. and Mrs.
Barnett	PERSON	, Mr.
Percy Alden	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		There are chronological lists of the
University	ORGANIZATION	,
College	ORGANIZATION	, and
Social Settlements of England	ORGANIZATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and brief notices of many of the more important Houses .

		Part II .

		is devoted to the '' Theory of the Settlement , '' as shown mainly by the writings of leaders in the movement ; and in the third and final part of the volume the author describes the manifold methods of Settlement work , exhibits a systematized '' table of activities , '' and offers many practical suggestions to inexperienced workers .

		The book is a compendium of desirable information in small compass and convenient form .

		It bears some evidences of haste in preparation and in printing , but its defects are not such as will interfere with its usefulness to readers who wish to inform themselves about the Settlement movement .

		Among the books recently imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons is a little volume by Mr.
H. Heathcote Statham	PERSON	, entitled '' Architecture among the Poets '' a long essay , originally published as a series of articles in `` The Builder . ''

		It deals , as may be inferred from its name , with the references made to architecture by the greater poets or , to speak precisely , by the greater Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, and English poets .

		The points made are two : first , that archi - tecture , which ranks among the least popular of the arts , has been of no such value to the poets as have painting and music ; second , that the love of archi - tecture for its own sake , and the perception of the racial and intellectual significance of style , belong to modern poetry alone .

		The classics are repre - sented by Homer and
Virgil	PERSON	, and the '' entirely fan - ciful '' Homeric architecture is compared with the realistic description of
Priam	ORGANIZATION	's palace which we find in the '' jEneid . ''

		The English poets are then re - viewed chronologically , the elder being shown as affiliated , in regard to architectural terms and im - agery , with the classic writers , while '' the new feel - ing , '' merely suggested in eighteenth-century poetry , becomes evident in the early romantic school , and rises to its full height in the poets of our own time .

		The author 's especial enthusiasm is for
Browning	PERSON	, in whose pages , as he very rightly declares , may be found a stronger descriptive power and a greater knowledge of architecture than in those of any other English poet .

		Of American poets , he mentions only
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
Poe	PERSON	, quoting the former liber - ally , the latter only in a few lines from '' The Haunted Palace '' ;
Lowell	PERSON	, whose '' Cathedral '' we think worth notice in such an essay , is evidently forgotten .

		The literary criticism of the book is a minor matter ; though generally correct , and , hav - ing the virtue of simplicity , it lacks the literary touch .

		Its illustrations are dainty and its ensemble pleasant .

Macmillan Go	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then , the former house issued their one-volume ''

		We have now to call atten - tion to the edition in twelve volumes just published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which for some purposes is more desirable than any of the others , particularly for all careful students of the poet .

		This ''
Cam	PERSON	- berwell '' edition is in pocket volumes , four inches by six in size , and is provided with annotations by
Miss Charlotte Porter	ORGANIZATION	and Miss
Helen A. Clarke	PERSON	, the editors of '' Poet - Lore . ''

		It is hardly necessary to say how entirely competent these editors are for the task , or with what sympathy they have per - formed it .

		There is a general biographical intro - duction to the edition , and a special introduction to each volume ; the notes occur at the end , and include digests of each poem .

		The text is the poet 's latest revision of 1888-89 , and includes in addition many fugitive pieces , among them the unfortunate Fitz -

Boston	LOCATION	in
1819	DATE	to the culmination in the annexation ceremonies of
August 12 , 1898	DATE	.

		The tale is of more than passing inter - est and is told with dramatic effect .

		The history is written from the American point of view and with professed sympathy for the annexation movement , though the treatment of persons and policies is as a rule candid and fair .

		The author 's zeal for dramatic effect leads him to make
England	LOCATION	the villain of the play , in spite of her repudiation of the seizure of the Islands by Lord
George Paulet	PERSON	in
1843	DATE	, and of her uniformly neutral position in recent years .

		This same zeal , coupled , perhaps , with a lack of familiarity with details of local history , has led to some misleading statements of minor importance .

		The part that
Boston	LOCATION	merchants have played in the development of American commerce with the
Islands	ORGANIZATION	is well told .

		The early sandalwood trade with
China	LOCATION	and the rise and decline of the whale fishery in the
Pacific	LOCATION	are described at length , but the growth of the sugar industry is barely mentioned , though
Whitney	PERSON	's edition of

		The work is confessedly not critical and some of the illustrations are veterans in the service ; the figures illustrative of cell-division , for example , are quite out of date in this day of cytological research .

		There is no index , an inex - cusable omission in a work of this character .

		The book presents , however , an advance both in the choice of material and in the method of treatment , over many elementary treatises often used in our academies and normal schools .

		It is not easy to get started in the book , for it is a section taken out of a projected larger work and so fails to give the necessary information as to parties and conditions .

		But when one gets into the current of the narrative he finds it most interesting .

		The story is dramatic in its rapid changes , its making and unmaking of kings and republics . ''

		In six years the Spaniards had seen a panorama of governments pass before them , ... each a failure and each in turn replaced by another failure . ''

		The restoration of Alfonso of Bourbon closed the series of changes , but not the misfortunes of that unhappy country .

		The present volume contains all the common helps for easy reference , numbered paragraphs with bold - faced headings , maps , index , chronological table , dates at the top of the page , and the like .

		It is not easy reading , for during eight centuries this little country in the middle of

		LITERARY NOTES .

		`` Quentin Durward , '' in two volumes , is the latest addition to the '' Temple '' edition of
Scott	PERSON	's novels , pub - lished by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published a third edition of Mr.
George Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	's '' Gordon in
Central Africa	LOCATION	, 1874-1879 , '' which first appeared eighteen years ago . ''

		Our Feathered Friends , '' by Miss
Elizabeth Grinnell	PERSON	and Mr.
Joseph Grinnell	PERSON	, is an illustrated reading book for young pupils just published by Messrs.
D. C	PERSON	,
Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Charles Waldstein	PERSON	is now in this country occu - pied in lecturing before the Archaeological societies and other audiences upon the subjects of Greek art and the results of recent excavations .

		Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	has prepared an abridged edition of ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	'' for '' school and home reading . ''

		Except for the considerable omissions , the text , which is
Ormsby	PERSON	's translation , is left practically unchanged . ''

		Art and the Beauty of the Earth '' is the title of a lecture by
William Morris	PERSON	, delivered in
1881	DATE	, and now printed with the author 's own '' golden '' type at the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		A new and revised edition of Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's charming volume of sketches and translations , entitled '' Earthwork Out of
Tuscany	LOCATION	, '' first issued
three years ago	DATE	, has been published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons in connection with Messrs. Dent of
London	LOCATION	.

		A number of rather slight pencil sketches , made by Mr.
James Kerr-Lawson	PERSON	, are contained in this edition .

		A happy outcome of the recent tribute publicly paid to Mr.
Carl Schurz	PERSON	for his distinguished services in so many good causes is the endowment fund of twenty thousand dollars contributed by the German - Americans of
New York	LOCATION	.


Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	is to be the trustee of this fund , one half of which provides a fellowship in German literature and the other half is to be used to buy books for the Germanic department of
the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Benjamin Moore	PERSON	is the author of an '' Ele - mentary Physiology '' published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which we can recommend most heartily for its attractive presentation , compact form , and sci - entific accuracy .

		We note , further , that the index con - tains no reference to alcohol , tobacco , or narcotics , which fact will probably prove a still stronger recom - mendation to all teachers who wish to deal seriously with the subject .

		It is announced that there remain in the hands of the heirs of the late
George Brinley	PERSON	, some copies of the parts of the
Brinley Catalogue	ORGANIZATION	, with the exception of the first , also some copies of the index , and of the price - lists .

		So long as they last these will be sent gratuit - ously to any public library making application for them , specifying the parts required , and enclosing
fifteen cents	MONEY	for each part -LRB-
five cents	MONEY	for price-lists -RRB- to cover postage and mailing expenses applications to be addressed to
W. I. Fletcher	PERSON	, Librarian of
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	,
Amherst	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.


Emile Erckmann	PERSON	died about the middle of last month .

		As the associate of
Alexandre Chatrian	PERSON	, who died in
1890	DATE	, he contributed not a little to the instruction and entertainment of his fellow-countrymen , and the
Erck	PERSON	- mann-Chatrian series of historical novels , if at times somewhat flamboyant in their patriotism , and if lacking 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, in the finer literary qualities of fiction , achieved a note - worthy and well-deserved success .

		They were whole - some literature , although not the best of art .

		The partnership of the two men lasted for something like forty years , and is one of the most remarkable instances of collaboration in literary history .

		A short time be - fore Chatrian 's death , an unfortunate quarrel estranged the two novelists .

		Erckmann was born in
1822	DATE	, and had lived to the age of seventy-six years .

		The new uniform edition of '' Sketches and Studies in
Italy	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	'' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , by the late
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	, is now made complete by the publication of the third volume .

		This volume is the richest of the three , for it includes the marvellous chapters on
Siena	LOCATION	,
Perugia	LOCATION	, and
Orvieto	LOCATION	, the subtle and sympathetic studies of Lucretius and Antinous , while from the titles of still other chapters the magic names of
Amalfi	ORGANIZATION	,
Psestum	LOCATION	,
Capri	LOCATION	,
Syracuse	LOCATION	,
Girgenti	PERSON	, and
Athens	LOCATION	, meet the reader 's eye .

		These studies are literature of a very noble sort and will bear repeated perusal .

		It is a great pleasure to have them all collected in the present set of dignified volumes .

		Several novel features will distinguish the '' British Anthologies '' which Professor
Edward Arber	PERSON	is editing for the
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	, from other collections of English verse which have appeared .

		The series will contain some two thousand five hundred entire poems and songs -LRB- exclusive of extracts which have been inserted spar - ingly -RRB- , printed for the most part in large type on stout paper in crown octavo volumes , and published at a pop - ular price .

		Some three hundred authors will be repre - sented , a few for the first time in any anthology .

		Use has been made of the earliest and most authoritative texts , but the spelling and punctuation have been re - vised where necessary .

		Each volume will consist of three hundred pages of text , to which are added an index of first lines and authorities , and a glossary .

		Pains have been taken to prevent lines being turned .

		Each volume will be identified by its title with the chief poet of the period treated , and together with his works will be printed the compositions of his contemporaries and anonymous poems of the same date .

		Not one-fifth of the total , however , will be anonymous .

		Ten volumes have already been arranged for The D unbar Anthol - ogy , 1401-1508 ; The Surrey and
Wyatt	PERSON	, 1509-1547 ; The Spenser , 1548-1591 ; The Shakespeare ,
1592	DATE	-
1616	DATE	; The
Jonson	PERSON	, 1617-1637 ; The
Milton	LOCATION	,
1638	DATE	-
1674	DATE	; The
Dryden	PERSON	, 1675-1700 ; The Pope , 1701-1744 ; The
Goldsmith	PERSON	, 1745-1774 ; and The
Cowper Anthol	PERSON	- ogy , 1775-1800 .

		Of these the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Jonson	PERSON	, and
Milton	PERSON	volumes will be published immediately , and the remainder will follow in quick succession .

		Profes - sor
Arber	PERSON	's reputation and experience in editing reprints his experience extending over thirty years are a sufficient guarantee that these Anthologies will be schol - arly , and that he will avoid the pitfalls into which so many compilers of collections of verse have fallen .

		As an illustration of the labor spent on the volumes it may be interesting to state that no fewer than fifty-five texts have been verified at the Bodleian from sources which are not to be found in any public library in
London	LOCATION	, not excluding the British Museum .

		The natural grouping of the poems , the historical basis on which the volumes have been planned , the notes and glossaries , will com - mend these '' British Anthologies '' to systematic stu - dents of English literature at home and abroad , and it is hoped that the fulness , variety , and freshness of the selections will appeal to all classes of readers .

		- sr. r H `` VHE Proprietors who in
1861	DATE	purchased the Spectator have since that date conducted it themselves .

		They are therefore exempted from many influences which press severely on the independence of jour - nalism , and have from the first made it their chief object to say out what they believe to be truth in theology , politics , and social questions , irrespective , not only of opposition from without , but of the opinion of their own supporters .

		Their object is to reflect the opinion of cultivated Liberals , but in the matter of the American War they fought against the mass of the very class they are trying to represent , and were finally acknowledged by them to have been in the right .

		The news of the current week is compressed into an animated nar - rative , which the laziest or busiest may read , without missing the life or import of the events .

		The Spectator contains a list of all Books published during the week -LRB- not under one shilling in price -RRB- , with the names of the publishers and the prices attached , a feature which will greatly increase its value to booksellers , librarians , literary institutions , and private gentlemen .

		282 THE EDUCATIONAL OUTLOOK .

		During the session of the
Illinois Legisla	ORGANIZATION	- ture now just ended , two educational measures of the highest importance were presented to that body for consideration .

		One of them pro- vided for the control of degree-conferring insti - tutions , to the end that the scandal of the fraudulent issue and sale of diplomas should cease ; the other sought to create a new organi - zation for the public schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	, to the end that politics and personal influence might be eliminated from their management , and statutory sanction be given to those fun - damental principles of educational administra - tion which are now accepted with practical unanimity by all educational leaders .

		The for - mer of these measures was popularly known as the ''
Rogers Bill	PERSON	, '' from the fact that it was championed by the president of the North - western University ; the other was similarly dubbed the ''
Harper Bill	PERSON	, '' from the fact that it emanated from a commission having the president of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	for its chairman .

		Both measures were discussed by us at the time of their introduction into the Legislature , and are thus , in their general terms , familiar to our readers .

		Both measures made for progress , and were the outcome of an en - lightened intelligence applied to the educational situation in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		There now remains to us to chronicle , not merely the defeat of these measures , but the significant fact that they did not even receive respectful consideration , that they were rejected with derision and contumely .

		We are free to say that we were not at any time of the sanguine souls who anticipated any other outcome than this .

		It was almost a fore - gone conclusion that a body of timorous poli - ticians of the sort that we choose to have for our law-makers would not discuss such propo - sitions as these upon rational grounds ; that they would be swayed by what seemed to them the prevailing sentiment of the public .

		We say '' seemed , '' and wish to emphasize the word , because what seems to be public opinion in such cases is usually the opinion of a small minority , made up chiefly of interested persons who are fearful lest their weakness be exposed and the privileges they have usurped be wrested from them .

		These persons promptly rally about the 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, legislative lobbies when attack is threatened , and their angry buzzing enables them to gain their ends without much resort to the two-edged weapons of logic and rational discussion .

		Those who form the real majority , meanwhile , have too much inertia to be moved to speedy action , and have only just begun to bestir themselves when the question is already disposed of , and the powers of darkness have once more pre - vailed .

		Since the result of this preliminary effort in the direction of educational reform has been about what was expected , we can not fairly say that we are discouraged .

		Much public interest , including some of the intelligent kind , has been aroused by the discussion , and the movement now well started is sure to gather impetus as the months go on , and we are as assured of its ultimate triumph as we were of the temporary setback it has just experienced .

		Out of the dis - tracting conflict of theories that has enlivened educational discussion during the past score of years , there have gradually emerged certain controlling ideas that have risen above the plane of the debatable , and are sure to impress them - selves eventually upon our school systems .

		This slow but sure development of unity out of diver - sity , of order out of chaos , in the educational domain is an indication altogether encouraging to those who have the cause of education at heart , and when we take a comprehensive view it is the one fundamental indication of recent discussion .

		A quarter of a century ago , such journals as '' The Educational Review '' and '' The School Review , '' such reports as those of the
Committee of Ten	ORGANIZATION	and the
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	, such a piece of legislation as the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	high-school law of
1891	DATE	, even such a Commission as framed the law which has just been defeated in
Illinois	LOCATION	, would have been simply impossible .

		The conditions that made all these things possible have come into existence in this country during very recent years .

		Looking at the general situation in this light , it can not fail to appear encouraging , in spite of the failure of the
Illinois Legislature	ORGANIZATION	to rise to the opportunity set before it , and in spite of the reactionary spirit displayed by a considerable section of the teaching force in the schools of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		We may also take encouragement from the experience of
New York City	LOCATION	during the past few years .

		Not more than five or
six years ago	DATE	, the condition of public education in that community seemed well-nigh hopeless .

		So far had its methods of administration fallen behind the times , that its school system , instead of leading those of our American cities , had be - come an object of contempt .

		Yet a single term of the mayoralty , owing to the fortunate elec - tion of an officer strong enough to inaugurate and carry out a thoroughgoing reform , sufficed to put the schools of
New York	LOCATION	nearly where they belong , at the head of our municipal sys - tems .

		The present problem in
Chicago	LOCATION	is nothing like as difficult as was the
New York	LOCATION	problem , and there is every reason to anticipate for it a satisfactory solution .

		With a Super - intendent determined to exercise the preroga - tives that rightfully belong to his office , and with a Mayor -LRB- just reflected for his second term -RRB- who , although he may have made mis - takes , has nevertheless taken a more active and intelligent interest in the city schools than any of his predecessors for twenty years has done , the outlook is reassuring to those who hold as the most sacred of all causes the cause of public education .

		We wish to repeat upon this occasion what we said
three months ago	DATE	, that the report of the
Educational Commission	ORGANIZATION	of last year , together with the accompanying draft of a new school law , was , taken as a whole , an expression of the most enlightened ideas upon the subject with which it dealt , and that its adoption , with a few amendments , would be the most fortunate thing , educationally , that could happen to
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		At least nine-tenths of it was alto - gether praiseworthy and desirable , and if the remaining one-tenth was open to question , our sense of its value as a whole was so high that we would have been willing to accept the ques - tionable sections for the sake of the great improvement promised by the rest .

		Doubtless this would not have been necessary , for a lit - tle rational discussion would have excised the merely tentative suggestions of the plan , leav - ing only those features upon which enlightened educators now agree with almost complete unanimity .

		Had the document been dealt with in this spirit , recognizing the disinterested zeal of the body that gave a year of hard work to its formulation , admitting the soundness of most of its positions and calmly weighing the few that seemed doubtful , we might have chronicled its fate without any touch of bitterness .

		But it has been painfully obvious to all who have followed this discussion , that interest and pas - sion had much more to do with the rejection of the plan than did anything that might fairly deserve the name of argument , that the teach - ers who attacked it used the weapons of the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIA1 , 263 politician rather than those of the educator , and that to borrow a phrase from a recent cause celebre in
New York	LOCATION	there are some '' fine old educational mastodons '' still lumber - ing about our social jungles .

		The influences that led to the defeat of the proposed law were mainly of the lower sort ; they came from the least competent and progressive elements of the teaching body ; they were appeals to prejudice rather than to intelligence ; and they accom - plished their purpose by resorting to wilful misrepresentation .

		As for the Legislature that made itself the tool of these influences , we can - not do better than say of it , in the words of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' that it '' rests like a dead weight upon every movement that is calcu - lated to promote the best educational interests of the commonwealth . ''

		THE FRIEND OF
JASPER PETULENGRO	PERSON	.

		Perhaps you are wearied of the sometimes dizzy heights of romanticism and the oftentimes monot - onous plains of realism .

		Then form acquaintance with a man who , if he find you a kindred spirit , shall show you a new country which is yet an old one ; a traveller through whose eyes you shall see things which are strange , yet familiar ; a writer whose words go to the making of the essay proper , which is '' the world viewed thro ' the prism of indi - viduality . ''

		Through the prism of this man 's individ - uality you shall have a view of life , unique , full of strange lights and shades , of a clearness sometimes startling .

		The man is
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	litterateur and travelling tinker , zealous churchman and enthu - siast in the manly art of self-defense , literary hack and nature worshipper , acute philologist and '' pal '' of the Romany dials .

		Never was there so strange a combination in one personality ; never was there a better illustration of the saying of the Autocrat : '' This body , in which we cross the isthmus between the two oceans , is not a private car but an omnibus . ''

		Sorrow 's writings are comparatively unknown ; but book-lovers have a strongly developed property instinct , and find an added attraction in the thought that a favorite author is little known or caviare .

		The reader of '' Lavengro '' has that sense of inti - macy and possession that means so much to those born with the book-mark .

		Borrow 's whole leaning was toward the unusual , and circumstances seemed always to incline him in that direction ; he was born for adventure , as other men to trouble : the cause lay not in his surround - ings , but in himself .

		`` One finds in
Rome	LOCATION	only what one takes there , '' and Borrow took with him a freshness of observation and an attitude of mind not paralleled in literature .

		His first meeting with the Gypsies , who were to so strongly affect his after life , is worth noting as characteristic both of his style of narrative and of the man .

		He has come suddenly upon the
Petul	PERSON	- engro family , which is evidently engaged in the making of counterfeit money . ''

		I '11 strangle thee , '' said the beldame , dashing at me . ''

		Bad money , is it ? '' ''

		Leave him to me , wifelkin , '' said the man , interpos - ing ; '' you shall see how I '11 baste him down the lane . ''

		Myself .

		I tell you what , my chap , you had better put down that thing of yours ; my father lies concealed within my tepid breast , and if to me you offer any harm or wrong , I '11 call him forth to help me with his forked tongue .

		Man .

		What do you mean , ye
Bengui	ORGANIZATION	's bantling ?

		I never heard such discourse in all my life : playman 's speech or Frenchman 's talk which , I wonder ?

		Your father !

		tell the mumping villain that if he comes near my fire I '11 serve him out as I will you .

		Take that Tiny Jesus !

		what have we got here ?

		Oh , delicate Jesus !

		what is the matter with the child ?

		I had made a motion which the viper understood ; and now , partly disengaging itself from my bosom , where it had lain perdu , it raised its head to a level with my face , and stared upon my enemy with its glittering eyes .

		The man stood like one transfixed , and the ladle with which he had aimed a blow at me , now hung in the air like the hand which held it ; his mouth was extended , and his cheeks became of a pale yellow , save alone that place which bore the mark which I have already de - scribed , and this shone now portentously , like fire .

		He stood in this manner for some time ; at last the ladle fell from his hand , and its falling appeared to rouse him from his stupor . ''

		I say , wifelkin , '' said he in a faltering tone , did you ever see the like of this here ? ''

		But the woman had retreated to the tent , from the entrance of which her loathly face was now thrust , with an expression partly of terror and partly of curiosity .

		After gazing some time longer at the viper and myself , the man stooped down and took up the ladle ; then , as if somewhat more assured , he moved to the tent , where he entered into conversation with the beldame in a low voice .

		The recontre ends in his being made '' brother '' to young
Jasper Petulengro	PERSON	, the future Gypsy '' Pharoah '' and his mentor in the
Romany	LOCATION	world that world that was to know the young scholar as '' Lavengro '' and the ''
Romany Rye	PERSON	, '' and which was to serve him as an intermittent home , a refuge and very present help in time of trouble .

		From this meeting the Gypsy motif begins to appear in his life , and in a few years the Romany Chals were to him brothers and the Romany women sisters , though some of the latter -LRB- like the murderously inclined Mrs.
Herne	PERSON	, with her brimstone disposition -RRB- were exceptions to the rule .

		No one can tell how much of Borrow 's work is autobiography , but one feels that his writings are dyed through and through with his experience and his individuality .

		The style is unusual and faulty ; and yet the wild life , the broken narrative whose se - quel may appear in a place entirely unlooked for , the mass of information on out-of-the-way subjects , 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, perhaps the touching for the evil chance , perhaps horse-charming , perhaps the forgotten meaning of a word , all contribute to a whole which is strangely fascinating .

		His style is faulty ; true , but he can limn a per - sonality or a landscape with a vividness that many a master of style would rejoice to possess .

		For a man with angles in his character , Borrow has an affection ; for all affectation and humbug , only scorn .

		The thoughts and motives of his men and women are never analyzed , but the reader feels that he knows the make-up of the nature before him .

		There is the talk with Jasper : '' What is your opinion of death , Mr.
Petulengro	PERSON	? '

		said I , as I sat down beside him . '' '

		My opinion of death , brother , is much the same as that in the old song of
Pharaoh	LOCATION	, which I have heard my grandam sing ''
Cana	LOCATION	marel o manus chivios anck 5 pay , Ta rovel pa leste o chavo ta romi . ''

		When a man dies , he is cast into the earth , and his wife and child sorrow over him .

		If he has neither wife nor child , then his father and mother , I suppose ; and if he is quite alone in the world , why , then he is cast into the earth , and there is an end of the matter . ' ''

		And do you think that is the end of man ? ' '' '

		There 's an end of him , brother , more 's the pity . ' ''

		Why do you say so ? ' '' '

		Life is sweet , brother . ' ''

		Do you think so ? ' '' '

		Think so !

		There 's night and day , brother , both sweet things ; sun , moon , and stars , brother , all sweet things ; there 's likewise a wind on the heath .

		Life is very sweet , brother ; who would wish to die ? ' ''

		< I would wish to die ' '' ' You talk like a gorgio which is the same as talk - ing like a fool were you a Rommany Chal you would talk wiser .

		Wish to die , indeed !

		A Ilommany Chal would wish to live forever ! ' ''

		In sickness ,
Jasper	PERSON	? ' ''

		` There 's the sun and stars , brother . ' '' '

		In blindness ,
Jasper	PERSON	? ' '' '

		There 's the wind on the heath , brother ; if I could only feel that , I would gladly live forever .

		Dosta , we '11 now go to the tents and put on the gloves ; and I 'll try to make you feel what a sweet thing it is to be alive , brother ! ' ''

		In that talk you have the underlying spirit , the motif , of the Gypsy .

		Does the thought never come to you on one of those days when you weary of the city street , that the spirit there outlined , the feeling of joy in mere living , is an inheritance which we have practically thrown away , refined out of our lives ?

		There comes to most men some experience perhaps it is standing on the border-line of the great forest that breaks the sweep of a northern prairie and breathing the sweet cold wind of
spring	DATE	that sweeps the plain and roars in the bending trees overhead , perhaps it is facing the salt breath of the ocean which gives them a taste of the divine elixir .

		The thought is thenceforth with them that we are far from that part of happiness that should come from mere physical existence , that primal feeling still strong in the
Romany	LOCATION	blood .

		How few words are required to indicate the man who knows how to use his mother tongue , and how often do we find this noble simplicity in Borrow , a manner of writing that carries with it more than the mere signification of the words .

		When applied to character-drawing this quality becomes extremely effective , as in his talks with
Isopel Berners	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hers is a magnificent character , and though she is alone among all the women of fiction , one feels that here is a true reading of one of those almost indecipher - able manuscripts , women .

		Borrow , like
Keats	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	, believed in the body ; he revelled in outdoor life , in violent sports , and especially in '' the manly art . ''

		How delightful is the narration of how the shabby old gentleman , by means of his
Broughton	PERSON	guard and chop taught him by the immortal Sergeant himself , served out the bruising coachman , the bully of the line .

		But better yet is Sorrow 's own contest with the
Flaming Tinman	ORGANIZATION	, the best man in the north country .

		Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	refers to this as the finest thing of the kind in literature ; and one must certainly go far ta match it .

		In the fight of the frail youth against the burly ruffian shines clear and bright the indomitable spirit which characterized him , that spirit which in later years made possible the `` Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		This slight sketch can not consider that side of Borrow shown in his philological work and in his travels , both illuminated by his strangely fascinating personality ; but it should not close without a rec - ognition of the fact that his character is essentially , and in the best sense , religious .

		Therein lies the secret of his strange success in gaining the good - will of natures differing apparently so widely from his own , be they those of the Romany Chals , the Fancy , or the
Welch	PERSON	preaching brotherhood .

		This feeling is shown in his tribute to the wandering preachers , as he comes across one , standing on the seashore , preaching salvation to the fishers gathered around him , amid the roar and boom of the breakers .

		The ending of this episode is particularly Borrowesque : '' I would have waited till he had concluded , in order that I might speak to him and endeavor to bring back the ancient scene to his mind ; but suddenly a man came hurrying to the monticle mounted on a speedy horse , and holding by the bridle one yet more speedy , and he whispered to me , ` Why loiterest thou here ?

		knowest thou not all that is to be done before
midnight	TIME	? '

		and he flung me the bridle ; and I mounted the horse of great speed and I followed the other who had already galloped off .

		And as I departed I waved my hand to him on the monticle , and I shouted ' Farewell , brother T the seed came up at last after a long period ! '

		Then I gave the speedy horse his way , and leaning over the shoulder of the galloping horse I said , Would that my life had been like his , even like that man 's ! ' '

		With this saying , that shows the true
George Bor	PERSON	- row , let us say Good-day to '' Lavengro , '' but let it be an Ave as well as Vale , and be it in the words of the Hungarian master of horse at the Horncastle Fair : '' Here 's to the Romany Rye !

		Here 's to the Sweet Master '' !

		THE DIAL 265 A SKEIN or MANY YARXS .

		* Mr.
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	's fascinating and instructive account of his cruise of some twenty - two years ago round the world on the bluff old New Bedford whaler '' Cachalot '' makes its appearance fortified by the glowing endorse - ment of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	.

		In an open letter to the author , Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	assures him that his book is '' immense , '' that he has '' never read anything that equals it in its deep-sea wonder and mystery , '' that '' it 's a new world '' he has '' opened the door to , '' and so forth .

		All this praise from Sir
Hubert Stanley	PERSON	must make Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	feel as good as if he were homeward bound with a fair wind , a '' full '' ship , and a Captain 's '' lay '' to reckon his share of the voyage on ; and we congratulate him on his feelings .

		But -LRB- it may be well to point out -RRB- Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's practical experience of sperm - whaling being limited , his testimony to the '' immensity '' of Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's book must be taken cum grano , and as going to its literary merits mainly .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	can hardly claim to be an expert witness in the case from the technical , or
New Bedford	LOCATION	, standpoint ; else , we make bold to say , he must have felt bound to pick a small-sized hole or two even in the coat of Mr.
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	.

		Not that we by any means presume to charge Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	with sailing under false colors when he styles himself '' First Mate '' -LRB- plain '' Mate '' would , by-the-bye , have been the corrector form for a whaleman -RRB- , or with having gained his whaling experience through the easy and not untried process of '' pumping '' some an - cient

		* THE CRUISE OF THE CACHALOT : Round the World after Sperm Whales .

		By
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	,
First Mate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		We gladly admit that his narrative , at its best , is as salt as Lot 's wife and as breezy as
Nan	PERSON	- tucket ; that he describes the process of '' rais - ing , '' striking , killing , cutting in , and trying out a whale far better than we have seen it described elsewhere ; that his bordereau of a whaleship 's proper gear , tackle , apparel , and furniture is full and accurate , from try-works to chock-pins .

		But , nevertheless , we can ' t help wondering how it is that Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	, with all this store of professional knowledge at his fingers ' ends , should here and there make slips in his terminology that would grate on the ear of a green hand four months out of New Bed - ford .

		Maybe the slips are intentional , and due to the author 's pardonable desire to make him - self clear to the lay reader ; but slips they are , and in the very shibboleth of his calling .

		For example , what practical whaleman , clothed and in his right mind , was ever known to style the flukes of a whale the `` tail , '' as Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	does with rasping frequency ?

		And did Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	, while aboard the '' Cachalot , '' ever hear a boat-steerer called a '' harpooner , '' or a lone whale a '' solitary '' ?

		On the other hand , Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's book is the first one of its kind we have met with that is free from certain stereotyped errors of writers on his subject the annoyingly persistent one , in particular , that represents the man at the mast-head as singing out '' There she blows ! ''

		at sight of a spout .

		Possibly a very green hand -LRB- remembering the formula given in the books -RRB- might do so once .

		But Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	sets us right on this point .

		He reproduces with pho - nographic truth that magic cry from the crow 's - nest that is to a whaleship what the blast of
Gabriel	ORGANIZATION	's trump will be to a graveyard . ''

		I turned in at four o'clock A. M. from the middle watch and , as usual , slept like a babe .

		Suddenly I started wide awake , a long mournful sound sending a thrill to my very heart .

		As I listened breathlessly , other sounds of the same character but in different tones joined in , human voices monotonously intoning in long drawn-out expirations the single word ' bl-o-o-o-o-w ! '

		... ' There she white waters !

		Ah , bl-o-o-o-w , blow , blow ! ' ''

		There are also one or two little inaccuracies or inconsistencies not exactly of a technical sort in Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's book that we must point out .

		He starts out by describing the '' Cachalot '' as a full-rigged ship , which she appears to be in the pictures ; but later on he calls her a `` barque '' square-rigged on the fore and main masts , and fore-and-aft rigged on the mizzen , like most of the
New Bedford	ORGANIZATION	fleet .

		This is a small matter , perhaps , but we expect accuracy 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, from a sailor on these points .

		But the oddest of Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's lapses is the extraordinary '' sea-change '' suffered by the speech of Mr.
Count	PERSON	, Mate of the '' Cachalot , '' in the course of the narrative .

		Early in the voyage Mr.
Count	PERSON	is made to say : '' I 've seen a fif ty-bar ' l bull make the purtiest fight I ever hearn tell ov a fight that lasted twenty hours , stove three boats , 'n' killed two men .

		Then , again , I 've seen a hundred 'n' fifty bar ' l whale lay 'n' take his grooel ` thout hardly wunkin ' 'n eyelid never moved ten fathom from fust iron till fin eout .

		So yew may say , boy , that they 're like peepul got their iadividooal pekewlyarities , an ' thar 's no countin ' on 'em for sartain nary time . ''

		One would scarcely expect this same Mr.
Count	PERSON	-LRB- become Captain on the death of the ''
Cacha	PERSON	- lot 's '' original '' Old Man '' -RRB- to get off the fol - lowing neat little speech to the crew a few months later on : '' Men , Captain Slocum is dead , and , as a consequence , I command the ship .

		Behave yourselves like men , not presuming upon kindness or imagining that I am a weak , vacillating old man with whom you can do as you like , and you will find in me a skipper who will do his duty by you as far as lies in his power , nor expect more from you than you ought to render . ''

		Nothing like promotion and a '' good voy - age '' to polish up one 's English , it seems .

		There 's another little count -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- in our not very serious indictment of Mr.
Bul	PERSON	- len .

		He has not perhaps overdrawn the bru - tality that reigned for the most part on board the particular vessel he chanced to ship on .

		But he tends -LRB- unintentionally no doubt -RRB- to give the impression that such brutality is the rule on all these vessels , and that the
New Bedford	LOCATION	whaler generally is , or was , like the '' Cachalot , '' more or less a '' floating hell . ''

		Now , Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	must know that such is not the case .

		The conditions of the service the perils of the calling , the length of the voyages , the great disparity in numbers between officers and crew , the often reckless and unruly char - acter of the latter , etc. make it necessary that order be maintained with a firm hand , and that , from first to last , forecastle be kept in awe of cabin .

		In bad cases something like a reign of terror is the sole alternative to insubordination and disaster ; and , it must be owned , there are cases where the reign of terror is due more to the savagery of the officers than the character of the men .

		But there are '' home ships '' as well as `` hell ships '' sailing out of
New Bedford	LOCATION	, with men and not brutes in command of them .

		We recall one good old barque of Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's time -LRB- and there were others of her class -RRB- whose Mate was a hero every inch of him , and a gen - tleman to boot ; whose crew was a happy fam - ily of '' shipmates all '' ; and whose good old Skipper -LRB- now at rest -RRB- was a type of old-fash - ioned Down East piety .

		There was a tradition , indeed , that Captain C , momentarily '' downed '' by the Old Adam , had once been heard to swear ; but the occasion was a trying one .

		The ship was lying '' hove to '' in a gale , when a great sperm whale rose alongside , blow - ing and wallowing in the brine not twenty fath - oms to leeward , and gazed calmly at his enemies .

		Lowering the boats in such a sea was out of the question ; and there was much strong language . ''

		There goes a hundred an ' twenty bar ` ls plum to , by the great Jehosaphat ! ''

		said Cap - tain C , as he went below to hide his feelings .

		That night -LRB- so the story ran -RRB- the men who stole aft to peep at the clock back of the binnacle saw through the cabin skylight the penitent '' Old Man '' poring over his '' big ha ' Bible '' till well in the Middle Watch ; and who can doubt that his peace-offering was accepted ?

		Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	is not a good hand at dialect .

		Happily , there is not much of it in his book , and there is but one variety .

		Yankees , '' Por - tagees , '' '' niggers , '' all the '' Cachalot 's '' poly - glot crew , are made to speak pretty much the same preternatural lingo a sort of cross be - tween the Whitechapel '' patter '' of Mr.
Alfred Chevalier	PERSON	and the speech of the plantation `` darky . ''

		Fancy a
Vermont Yankee	ORGANIZATION	fresh from the ploughtails talking in this way , for instance : `` I doan see de do ' way any mo ' at all , sir . ''

		Did Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	ever hear anything like that up
Brattleboro	LOCATION	' way , we wonder ?

		But Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	is a capital hand at descrip - tion , and he writes from a memory packed with scenes and processes that nine out of ten of his readers will have never seen described before .

		Of his style , the following pathetic episode may serve as a sample .

		A cow whale has been '' struck '' with the harpoon , and the author goes on to describe the denouement : '' But , for all the notice taken by the whale , she might never have been touched .

		Close nestled to her side was a youngling of not more , certainly , than five days old , which sent up its baby-spout every now and then about two feet in the air .

		One long , wing-like fin embraced its small body , holding it close to the massive breast of the tender mother , whose only care seemed to be to protect her young , utterly regardless of her own pain and danger .

		If sentiment were ever permitted to interfere with such operations as ours , it might well have done so now ; for while the calf continually sought to escape from the enfolding fin , making all sorts of puny struggles in the attempt , the mother scarcely moved from her position , although streaming with blood from

		THE DIAL 267 a score of wounds .

		Once , indeed , as a deep searching thrust entered her very vitals , she raised her massy flukes high in air with an apparently involuntary move - ment of agony ; but even in that dire throe she remem - bered the possible danger to her young one , and laid the tremendous weapon as softly down upon the water as if it were a feather fan .

		... So in the most perfect quiet , with scarcely a writhe , nor any sign of flurry , she died , holding the calf to her side until her last vital spark had fled , and left it to a swift despatch with a single lance - thrust . ''

		Naturally , there are marvels not a few in Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's book which landsmen will find hard to accept as fact .

		They will '' shy '' at some of his stories -LRB- mere commonplaces of whaling -RRB- pretty much as the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	chief did at the missionary 's assertion that in his own country he had seen water get so hard in
winter	DATE	that men walked on it and sawed it up in blocks . ''

		Gospel man heap liar ! ''

		roared the indignant
Bongo	PERSON	who had already accepted some of the good man 's toughest Old Testament stories without a quiver ; and we have no doubt some of Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's unsalted readers will feel at times like using language similar to that of the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	skeptic .

		But while Mr.
Bul	PERSON	- len 's experiences and adventures certainly lose nothing in the telling , we cheerfully vouch for the substantial , and in proper cases the literal , truth of his narrative .

		It forms , we believe , the first published account from the seaman 's standpoint of a sperm-whaling voyage in a
New Bedford	LOCATION	ship ; and the '' Cachalot 's '' voyage , it should be added , took her into the
South Atlantic	LOCATION	, the
Pacific	LOCATION	, the Indian Oceans , and the
Japan	LOCATION	and Okhotsk Seas , round the
Cape	LOCATION	of Good Hope and the Horn , and to many re - mote ports and islands little known even in these globe-trotting days .

		In fine , Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's book is brimful of truths that are far stranger than most men 's fiction , and it is as instructive as it is readable .

		The marvels of the deep sea are mirrored in his pages , and the novel phase of human life and character he paints is painted substantially to the life .

		It was an odd chance that threw a man of Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's unquestionable literary talent into so rude and unpromising a calling ; but it was a happy one .

		In its declining days , whaling has found in him its picturesque his - torian .

		THE AMERICAN BUTTERFLY BOOK .

		* The collecting habit is a natural one , and is by no means confined to the bower-bird of
Australia	LOCATION	or the arctic foxes of Franz-Josef Land .

		Intellectual and even esthetic diversion may be found in the collecting of postage - stamps or of old blue china ; but objects of natural history are par excellence , the spoil of the amateur collector .

		Here is found not only the widest range of choice but also the greatest freedom of access ; it is here that the zeal for classification enjoys its fullest gratification and the search for the beautiful its natural satisfac - tion .

		The collection and study of butterflies is a favorable , and has long been a favorite , pur - suit for the amateur as well as for the specialist .

		The natural beauty of these common objects excites the interest and holds the attention .

		The methods of capture are somewhat simple , and the expenditure attending the instalment and maintenance of a collection is relatively slight .

		The student has unrivalled opportuni - ties for the study of many of the most interest - ing biological problems of the day , such as variation , seasonal and sexual dimorphism , and the effects of the various elements of the en - vironment , such as food and temperature , upon the form and color of the full-grown organism ; he also has the privilege of contributing to our knowledge of the life-histories of many forms which are as yet unknown ; furthermore , his pursuit is quite free from the objectionable features which pertain to the robberies of the bird 's - nesting oologist and the bloody business of many an amateur ornithologist .

		There is little esthetic or economic objection to any diminution in the numbers of butterflies and caterpillars that may result from his activity .

		The lack of an illustrated , inexpensive , and at the same time fairly complete manual of this group has been hitherto a serious obstacle to the growth of amateur interest in butterflies in this country .


Europe	LOCATION	and the Continent are more fortunate in this respect .

		We have , to be sure , several most excellent and inexpensive handbooks by eminent authorities , but these are limited in their geographical scope to parts of the country , include but a part of the species , and are in no case fully illustrated .

		26S THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, superb lithographed plates , are too expensive for any but the larger libraries , or the most self-denying specialist ; but even these fail to figure many of the American species .

		This need of an illustrated manual bids fair to be supplied by Chancellor
Holland	PERSON	's '' But - terfly Book . ''

		It has been the aim of the author to provide a popular handbook of the diurnal Lepidoptera of this continent north of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The opening chapters deal in a pleasing man - ner with the anatomy and development of the butterfly , collecting apparatus , and the breed - ing of specimens , the arrangement and preserva - tion of collections , the classification of the group , and the literature of the subject .

		The remain - der of the book is taken up with a systematic and descriptive catalogue of species , all of which are figured .

		Brief descriptions are given , not only of the butterfly , but also of the egg , cater - pillar , and chrysalis , wherever these are known .

		In many instances both sexes are figured , and in some cases both the upper and the under sides of the wings are shown , while supple - mentary figures which elucidate anatomical structures of diagnostic importance are to be found in the text .

		Details of color and of structure which may be derived from a study of the illustrations are to a large extent eliminated from the descriptions .

		In all , about 550 forms are described and figured ; while Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	's recently published '' Synonymic Catalogue of North American Rhopalocera '' ascribes 645 to the territory covered by this work .

		The manual is thus not an exhaustive one .

		It should be noted , however , that over five-sixths of the spe - cies are described and figured ; that practically the whole of the butterfly fauna east of the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	is included ; that the omitted forms are either small and insignificant -LRB- as , e. g. , many of the Hesperidce -RRB- , and are thus of little popular interest , or they are of doubtful specific rank and can not be readily distin - guished from their nearest relatives .

		Further - more , no work on American butterflies presents so exhaustive an iconography of our lepidop - teran fauna .

		In the preface to the book the author says : '' I flatter myself that I have possessed peculiar facil - ities for the successful accomplishment of the undertak - ing I have proposed to myself , because of the possession of what is admitted to be undoubtedly the largest and most perfect collection of the butterflies of North Amer - ica in existence , containing the types of
W. H. Edwards	PERSON	, and many of those of other authors . ''

		> The number of such '' types '' or specimens that served for the first published description of the species , which are figured in the book , is stated in a descriptive circular issued by the publish - ers to be '' fully three hundred . ''

		The scientific value of this fact is , however , largely lost , for such figures are in no way designated in the descriptions of the plates , and are but rarely indicated in the text .

		Scattered through the book are a number of apt quotations , ranging from grave to gay , or even facetious at times , and anecdotal digres - sions which are more or less germane to the subject .

		These add variety , though perhaps not always dignity , to the theme .

		The most noticeable feature of the work , and one that is destined to attract wide attention , is the series of forty-eight plates , which exhibit in their natural colors over five hundred different butterflies .

		These are shown in all the charming array of brilliant coloring and delicate tints of the originals , with an accuracy and faithfulness that is as wonderful as it is surprising .

		The plates are prepared from photographs of the actual butterflies , by the so-called process of color-photography , or three-color printing .

		The results of the application of this method to the illustration of this scientific subject are most gratifying , and promise much for the future .

		These plates rival the most skilful and expen - sive chromo-lithography if , indeed , they do not surpass it in the accuracy with which the general color effect , as well as the specific tints of an intricate pattern , are reproduced .

		The optical limitations of photography are such that the structural details are at times obscured in the figures , but these can be illustrated readily by other methods .

		The American press is to be congratulated upon its signal success in this new venture , for this volume exhibits a marked advance over the work of the
Societe de Pho	ORGANIZATION	- tographic en Couleurs a Puteaux put forth recently in
Delage	LOCATION	, and
Herouard	ORGANIZATION	's '' Traite de Zoologie Concrete . ''

		To suggest shortcomings in a work which has so many commendable features seems indeed to be gratuitous , especially as any suggested de - fects are rather only sins of omission , and the very low price at which the book is sold is per - haps both their occasion and excuse .

		In the first place , there is no synopsis of the group , and there are no keys , natural or artificial , for the determination of genera and species .

		Char - acters of diagnostic value are not emphasized sufficiently in the text .

		The collector is thus encouraged to ignore structural details which form the basis of classification , and to descend to the level of the philatelist , merely scanning the plates for the identification of his speci -

		More recognition of variants and of vari - able forms , and a fuller discussion of the syn - onomy and more references to literature , would add to the utility of the book to a considerable degree .

		The cultural value of the work would be greatly enhanced by a more generous recog - nition of the butterfly as a living thing and a part of the economy of nature .

		To stimulate an interest in its life-history , its activities , and its relations and exquisite adjustments to the animate and inanimate world about it , is quite as desirable as to rouse an ambition for a com - plete collection of `` painted beauties '' dead , to be sure , but impaled in orderly array and duly designated by the proper Latin binomial .

		Finally , stouter binding and tougher paper are most desirable in a handbook destined to the hard usage which this one is sure to receive .

		The publishers are to be congratulated upon the production of so excellent a model , mark - ing , we trust , a new epoch in methods of sci - entific illustration .

		The author has prepared a most excellent handbook of a fascinating sub - ject , and it is to be hoped that the companion volume , '' The Moth Book , '' may not be long delayed .

		THE PLAY .

		* Not a year ago I saw an article on the edi - torial page of an influential journal , which began by saying that '' another literary artist '' had '' undertaken to reunite literature and the stage , whose divorce has been so often and so dogmatically declared by the melodramatists . ''

		This interested me : I had heard talk of the divorce , although I had not known that the melodramatists were responsible for it , and I was glad to hear of the reconciliation which the article went on to speak of as almost , if not possibly quite , successful .

		That seemed to me a good deal for one single work to accomplish , and I became curious about it .

		The literary artist in question was Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	, or `` John Oliver Hobbes '' -LRB- I 'm sure I do n't know which to call her or him ; it 's very awkward indeed about the pronouns -RRB- , and the means of recon - ciliation was `` The Ambassador , '' which ap - peared in print not so very long ago .

		It struck me at the time as rather curious that ''
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	'' should be spoken of as a path-breaker , as one of the very few literary fellows who had to do with the theatre .

		* THE AMBASSADOR : A Comedy in Four Acts .

		By
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this country , I know , the line is pretty sharply drawn ; but then , we are not talking of this country : '' The Ambassador '' was pre - sented in
London	LOCATION	.

		I found , however , as I went on , that the article was extremely exclusive in its conception of Literature .

		This appeared when I read later that ''
Dumas	PERSON	and
Pinero	PERSON	are almost the only men who take a high grade of literary art to the theatre . ''

		You see it was before '' Cyrano de Bergerac '' had become known among us , and before the author of ''
Catherine	PERSON	'' had been elected to the
Academy	LOCATION	.

		Still , to confine ourselves to the dramatists of our own tongue , why was Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	left out ?

		That was surely too bad .

		It must have been an oversight , for ''
Michael	PERSON	and His Lost Angel '' has been in print for some years , so that anyone may see how literary Mr.
Jones	PERSON	is .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, I suppose , may have consoled himself at being classed as unliterary along with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Hauptmann	PERSON	,
Sudermann	PERSON	, d'Annunzio ,
Echegaray	PERSON	, and many Frenchmen .

		But , after all , what is a '' literary play '' ?

		What is meant by '' taking literary art to the theatre '' ?

		I do n't know anything else to say except that a literary play is one that can be printed in a book and read with satisfaction by a cultivated person -LRB- i. e. , somebody like myself : that 's what a man generally means when he says '' cultivated person '' -RRB- .

		I do n't see much that can be said beyond that .

		The fact that a man is or is not professionally connected with the theatre has nothing to do with it .

		Moliere was an actor ,
Lessing	PERSON	a dramatic critic ,
Sheri	PERSON	- dan a manager ; yet they contributed to litera - ture much more , so far as the drama is con - cerned , than
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Klopstock	PERSON	, and
Addison	PERSON	, who were distinctly men of letters .

		It may seem foolish to say that a literary play is one that is printed in a book .

		Still , there can be no doubt that there have been '' literary plays '' which never made a part of lit * erature , solely because they were never printed .

		People saw them , liked them perhaps , and for - got them ; and there was an end of it .

		But if you print your play and get the right people to read it and like it , then it becomes literature , in the sense , of course , that a great many other things become literature .

		If , however , we think of literature in a more confined sense , what then ?

		Is there not some - thing aside from the accident of paper and print about a play that we can say is literary ?

		Suppose there are two plays that both please us ; do we not often think of one as literary and the other not ?

		A man said to me not 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, long since that '' The Liars '' was literature : but I never heard that said of ''
Tess	PERSON	of the d'Urbervilles . ''

		What is there about one play that there is not about the other ?

		If you see the two plays you are certainly more moved by '' Tess '' : why , then , is it not more literary ?

		I do not know , I 'm sure .

		Print the two and perhaps I could tell .

		But just now let us re - turn to '' The Ambassador . '' ''

		The Ambassador '' may be compared -LRB- in fact , one can not well help comparing it -RRB- with
Pinero	PERSON	's '' The Princess and the Butterfly . ''

		They are plays of much the same general character , comedies of character and incident , set in the same world , mostly in the same place , more or less alike in plot though not in motive .

		Being so nearly alike , then , any difference ought to be very clear .

		Now , as it is well known that Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	is a practical play - wright , and not a literary man tempted to the theatre , we may have here a means of seeing what is the difference between a playwright 's play and a literary play .

		It will interest you to read the two plays within a short space of time and try to see whether there is any real difference between them .

		It would not seem to be in the plot : Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	's plot is the simpler , but not any more literary .

		In fact , both are somewhat stagey .

		Pinero 's play is of a middle-aged man and a middle-aged woman who were once in love with each other .

		Twenty years after their youth they meet and think they will marry each other .

		Each marries somebody else who has been introduced into the play solely for that purpose .

		In '' The Ambassador '' the middle - aged man has several middle-aged ladies who like to flirt with him .

		He marries none of them , but falls in love with a young woman who has to be disengaged from a worthy young baronet , who gets engaged to somebody else .

		The difference is that Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	's plot is a little more regular in a way : each pair illus - trates the same notion .

		Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	's second pair has no very great reason for existence .

		Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	's play is also a little more involved : there are more complications in it a young lady of doubtful parentage , for instance .

		Neither action is absolutely natural or probable , though both are natural or probable enough for the stage . ''

		The Ambassador , '' being the simpler , is somewhat the more natural .

		Nor would the difference seem to be in the characters .

		St.
Orbyn	PERSON	and Sir
George Lam	PERSON	- orant , indeed , might change for each other sometime just for fun , and few would notice the difference : two middle-aged and pretty well - preserved gentlemen who fall in love rather suddenly , and without your really believing either to be serious .

		St.
Orbyn	PERSON	is rather a cheerful diplomatist , it is true , and Sir
George	PERSON	is a man of the world rather down in the mouth at being middle-aged ; but otherwise the differ - ence would depend largely on the actors .

		Of course , the other characters do not by any means run parallel .

		Still , you might compare Las - celles and
St. Roche	LOCATION	, if you like , or the ladies who come and call on the princess with the ladies who come and call on Lady Beauvedere .

		Doubtless a person more familiar with the world these remarkable people move in would see points of difference ; but I do not see much .

		On the stage they would probably wear differ - ent colored frocks .

		Then there is the dialogue .

		Here , too , there is a likeness , as there must be in any good rep - resentation of the talk of well-bred people .

		There is a good deal of sparkle , of course , Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	's probably the more genuine .

		Take these two specimens .

		The first is from '' The Princess . ''

		LADY RINGSTEAD : I confess I hardly care to sit down to dinner at half-past six .

		MRS.
SABISTON	PERSON	: Oh , I do n't mind that , but I can not undertake to rise at half-past seven .

		This is from '' The Ambassador '' : LADY BEAUVEDERE : Nearly ran away !

		Why , every - one knows that if she had n't been thrown from her horse and killed that very morning on her way to meet him .

		ST. ORBYN : I never attend post-mortems on a con - science .

		It seems somewhat of the same piece , and rather a well-known web at that .

		Yet , on looking back over what I have writ - ten I must confess to having rather deceived the reader .

		All the things I have said were alike , are alike , I believe , but there are also differences .

		I am not sure that these dif - ferences make '' The Ambassador '' more liter - ary , but I suspect they do : at least , I am pretty sure that they made '' The Princess and the Butterfly '' more successful on the stage .

		Take the dialogue : there is much that is alike , certainly .

		But here are two passages coming at precisely the same place in the two plays , the place where the middle-aged man and the young girl have just arranged matters .

		The first is by Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	.

		SIR GEORGE : I have loved you since oh , for these many days .

		You know it .

		FAY , almost inaudibly : Yes .

		SIR GEORGE : You you you return my love ?

		FAY , faintly : You know it .

		SIR GEORGE : For how long have you loved me ?

		JULIET : What , then .

		ST. ORBYN : Because you are honest ... that ` snot the reason either .

		JULIET : What ?

		Well , guess again !

		ST. ORBYN : Because ... Oh ,
Juliet	PERSON	, it is because you make me forget the reasons why !

		JULIET : Then remember the reasons why not .

		lam poor ... ST. ORBYN : So are the angels .

		JULIET : And then ... ST. ORBYN : Well , dearest ?

		JULIET : .

		.

		You make me forget the reasons why not .

		There is a difference , certainly : there 's not a shadow of a doubt Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	is the more natural and -LRB- to me -RRB- more charming ; but I rather think that Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	would call forth more applause , especially when he repeats his little bit with a slight change in the course of a minute .

		Then as to the characters .

		I spoke of the two men : they certainly are more or less alike .

		But the two women : as certainly they are not .

		Juliet and the Princess are two very dif - ferent people .

		It is rather idle to try to ex - plain the difference to any purpose in short compass and without quotation .

		But the fact of it calls our attention to another thing .

		Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	's characters are all more or less built on the model furnished by the idea of his play .

		They are people on whom middle-age works differently .

		Thus , one is a woman who still loves her husband , and one is a woman who chiefly loves her dinner .

		Of the men , one re - mains young in middle-age , or would like to ; and another has become middle-aged in the midst of his youth .

		In other words , the charac - ters are more or less consistent with the scheme , or balanced against each other , but not espec - ially real .

		Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	's characters are uncon - strained by any such conventionalities , and are therefore , other things being equal , rather more life-like .

		And then as to plot : the two are truly very much alike , but Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	's is much the simpler .

		In '' The Princess and the Butterfly , '' Sir
George	PERSON	has a ward whom he thinks is the daughter of his brother .

		She meanders pic - turesquely through the play , having nothing to do with it until Sir
George	PERSON	finds out that she is not his brother 's daughter but the daughter of some old Italian , having been changed in the cradle .

		So he kisses her , and , though that is not his intention at the time , falls in love with her afterwards .

		Certainly a very romantic love - making : certainly that belongs to the stage , no one would claim it for literature .

		Then there is another complication , a great mix-up about a woman of shady reputation who is en - gaged to a deluded young Frenchman : she goes where she should not , and there is a quar - rel which leads to a duel , and the deluded man who provokes the duel becomes good and mar - ries a little girl who is only in the play to be ready for him .

		As to the '' Ambassador , '' the only complication comes to nothing by the reso - lute refusal of all parties to suspect each other of what would be very unlikely .

		That appeals to me : I like it .

		But I rather think the com - plication would do better on the stage : it gives more '' go '' to the business to have Demailly throw water on Sir
George	PERSON	, and to have Fay appear in harlequin 's clothes , especially when that part is taken by a lady who looks well in tights .

		So I think '' The Ambassador '' is the more literary : that is , it contains things that please me more as I read the plays over quietly at home , please me more than do various things about '' The Princess and the Butterfly . ''

		Still , I doubt not that the latter play was the more successful on the stage -LRB- at any rate , it was suc - cessful enough to come over here , as '' The Ambassador '' has not yet -RRB- , and very probably for the very things that are not wholly pleasing to one who only reads .

		In the
Fifth Reader	ORGANIZATION	, or perhaps the Fourth , there used to be a tale about two sculptors who made two statues to go up and be set on a very high place .

		The reader may remember it : one statue seemed very coarse and rude till it got where it was intended to be ; the other , which was very charming and delicate when examined down below , lost a good deal when it was put in place .

		1 think it is the same thing here .

		Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	knows the stage better than Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	: he is somewhat conventional and con - fined , it is true , but he must know the stage .

		Ladies wear rouge on the stage and put black lines under their eyes , I believe , and do other things that would not render them attractive in the parlor ; and so do the men .

		I fancy that it may be that some of these things that we do n't like about Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	may be necessary for the right effect across the footlights .

		But the others , the delicacies , the delight - ful half-tones , why must they miss their effect ?

		Why can they never be put rightly 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, on the stage ?

		Why can they get no farther than to be realized by the kindly imagination ?

		Why should we not like them when we saw them in real flesh and blood ?

		Even if the other things be necessary , why should we not have these too ?

		Be content , my dear insatiable ; your keenest pleasures , your most delightful half-minutes , do you really wish to share them with the mul - titude ?

		impartial , and painstaking .

		Of others prepared by civilians , whether in or out of the field , most of those hewed out by the swords of fighting journalists add new terrors of slander , untruth , partiality , suppression of vital facts , and vituperation to what , in General
Sherman	PERSON	's profoundly truthful phrase , was already Hell .

		It is hardly needful to repeat here the fact , patent to everyone who glances at any of these volumes , that they are the raw ma - terial of history rather than history itself , the pro- toplasm from which time and patient study shall eventually bring something organic .

		So far , there appears to be hardly a suspicion of sources of information outside of our own country which must be consulted to insure accuracy of statement ; and the prevailing assumption that there can be no other side to a controversy in which the
United States	LOCATION	is a party , is the final proof that these volumes are largely tentative and ephemeral .

		If there is any general fault in the books written by the various officers of our army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, it is that they are too long .

		Captain
Sigsbee	PERSON	's account of the destruction of the ''
Maine	LOCATION	, '' for example , could have been kept in half the space .

		There is in this work , too , an assumption of Spanish guilt which is not justified by tbe facts which have so far come to light , however strongly it may be inferred ; and there is a notable lack of information from that side , though it was at hand and available .

		But the story of the sinking of the great battleship has much merit as a bit of literary work .

		This is quite as true of Lieutenant
Hobson	PERSON	's personal narrative of the sinking of the '' Merrimac , '' in spite of his lack of reserve in describing the actual submergence of the vessel .

		But he dwells too long upon the minor matters of his imprisonment , making an anti-climax in spite of the thrilling scenes attending his return to his own flag .

		Had there been judicious suppres - sion in the account of his detention by
Spain	LOCATION	, the book would be nearly perfect ; even as it is , it de - serves wide circulation .

		If other naval officers can write half as well as these two , it is a pity that they are so ill-represented in our literature .

		Major-General
Joseph Wheeler	PERSON	has limited him - self to a bare almost bald statement of fact , and to a reproduction of official reports from his own papers and those of his superiors and subordi - nates .

		His book on '' The
Santiago	LOCATION	Campaign '' is interesting in spite of this , and will increase in value with the years .

		Lieutenant
John H. Parker	PERSON	was not only in command of '' The Gatlings at
Santiago	LOCATION	, '' but it was due to him that there were any Gatlings there .

		What he has to say of machine-guns in the battle-line , and of their effect when opposed to artil - lery , is of real importance .

		Had all our officers been possessed of a tithe of Lieutenant
Parker	PERSON	's zeal and intelligence there would have been fewer mis - takes .

		Lieutenant-Colonel
Miley	PERSON	served as aide-decamp to the general commanding the expedition against
Santiago	LOCATION	, from the beginning to the end of the war .

		His book , '' In
Cuba	LOCATION	with
Shafter	LOCATION	, '' has therefore
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 all the intimacy of a personal narrative and much of the importance of an official document .

		Bather with this and the foregoing books than with those of the professional journalists and compilers is to be ranked Mr.
Stephen Bonsai	PERSON	's account of `` The Fight for
Santiago	LOCATION	. ''

		All of these show
General Shatter	ORGANIZATION	to be a patient , hard-working , thoughtful man , who , till he succumbed to illness which deserves pity rather than abuse , was doing the best he possibly could do under extreme disadvantages which were by no means of his making .

		It is well to remind the public here that the losses by sickness and mismanagement before
Santiago	LOCATION	were due chiefly to the deliberate inattention of Con - gress , for many years , to the needs of both army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		That preparation for war in the face of war is not only the least efficient but the most expen - sive preparation , has assuredly been clearly demon - strated ; but so great is the inertia of our people , that the new
Congress	ORGANIZATION	will probably be found quite as incompetent to give us the skill and practice so sadly needed as these which have now left their shameful record behind .

		The evils of the spoils system , in which Congressmen from both houses played an unen - viable part , the unwillingness of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	to accept war as a probability or to stand out against an apportionment of military offices among mere politicians when there were trained soldiers kept in idleness , the favoritism in the
navy	ORGANIZATION	which has led to such unnecessary wrangling and dispute , these are matters for the dispassionate hand of time to set down without fear and without malice .

		The thou - sands of ruined lives resulting from the expeditions in
Cuba	LOCATION	and
Porto Rico	LOCATION	were offered up on an altar of national ignorance and indifference erected long before the outbreak of hostilities an altar which has not yet been thrown down .

		In the face of these facts , and in the face of the books which have already been mentioned , it is im - possible to acquit Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	and Mr.
John R. Spears	PERSON	of malice .

		In '' The Cuban and Porto Rican Campaigns , '' the former is fairly scurrillous in his attacks upon General Shaf ter , while he exalts
General Miles	ORGANIZATION	to a point which forces him to omit all mention of the illness which fell upon the soldiers in
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, though every whit as severe and extensive as that in
Cuba	LOCATION	; while Mr.
Spears	PERSON	, in '' Our
Navy	ORGANIZATION	in the War with
Spain	LOCATION	, '' makes a similar attack upon
Commodore Schley	PERSON	, at the same time apotheosizing Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	.

		Both journalists suppress and distort the facts to suit their ends , and both have written books which are to be classed as fiction rather than sober history .

		It may be well to add here that the insinuations of cowardice which are made against
Shafter	LOCATION	and
Schley	PERSON	respectively are unsupported by any facts .

		In respect of Admiral
Schley	PERSON	and Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	, it must be remembered that both had served their country faithfully and without reproach up to the opening of the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, when
Sampson	PERSON	was placed in command of one who was his senior and had been his superior officer during the War of the Rebellion .

		There both officers behaved as Amer - ican sailors have always behaved , though
Sampson	PERSON	had the ill luck to lose the ship on which he was executive officer , the monitor '' Petapsco , '' in
Charleston	LOCATION	harbor , a fact which may be looked for in vain in Mr.
Spears	PERSON	's '' History of Our
Navy	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Since the war ,
Sampson	PERSON	has presided over the des - tinies of the
Naval Academy	ORGANIZATION	at
Annapolis	LOCATION	with dignity and decorum , has aided materially in bring - ing our ordnance to the point of efficiency shown in this war when in charge of the
Ordnance Depart	ORGANIZATION	- ment , and , as Mr.
Spears	PERSON	reminds us , has written an admirable paper on '' The
Naval Defence of Our Coast	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Nothing is said of
Schley	ORGANIZATION	's remark - able record , but it might have been told that he has landed blue - jackets in
Central America	LOCATION	, in
Corea	LOCATION	, and in the
Cho-Sen Islands	LOCATION	; has cleared up the dif - ficulties with
Chile	LOCATION	; has rescued the
Greeley	LOCATION	expe - dition to the
North Pole	LOCATION	, in short , has been in active and continuous service , doing deeds rather than writing essays or conducting experiments .

		It is not , then , the records of the two men which gave
Sampson	PERSON	the position of commanding officer which availed him so little , as Mr.
Spears	PERSON	disingenuously suggests .

		Mr.
Goode	PERSON	, who was '' With
Sampson	PERSON	through the War '' as correspondent of the
Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	, is a little fairer than Mr.
Spears	PERSON	and not quite so fond .

		His praise does not lack discrimination , but his partisanship is nevertheless complete .

		He sup - presses , for example , all mention of the dispatch from
Sampson	PERSON	ordering
Schley	PERSON	to hold his fleet off
Santiago	LOCATION	; and , following
Sampson	PERSON	again , he regards
Schley	PERSON	's obedience to this order to be reprehensible .

		This is the more unpardonable , because Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	has evidently supplied the writer with most of his material , including a chapter of his own .

		Mr.
Goode	PERSON	, too , has his quarrel with
Shafter	LOCATION	, evidently by way of retribution for the
General	ORGANIZATION	's criticism of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet the work shows painstaking , even to the extent of drawing upon the Spanish for information .

		`` Campaigning in
Cuba	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
George Kennan	PERSON	's account of services performed in connection with the
Red Cross Society	ORGANIZATION	, is a vivid picture of suffer - ing and hardship , ameliorated in a considerable de - gree by the efforts of Mr.
Kennan	PERSON	and his associates .

		The book , commendable in almost all respects , is injured by the persistency with which references to Siberian matters are dragged in , and far more by a determination to hold
General Shafter	ORGANIZATION	responsible for all the calamities which fell under the writer 's vision among the American soldiers .

		Both
Colonel Miley and Lieutenant Parker	ORGANIZATION	disprove Mr.
Ken	PERSON	- nan 's statement that the lack of surgical attendance was due to the commanding general .

		The vivid account of '' The Rough Riders '' from the pen of Mr.
Edward Marshall	PERSON	, the newspaper correspondent who achieved the distinction of being severely wounded while joining in a charge , is well worth reading , filled as it is with dramatic pictures by an eye-witness of the exciting events in the ca - 274 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, reer of that famous regiment .

		As is perhaps inevit - able in such a book , it lacks a sense of proportion .

		Without in the least reflecting upon the character of the work done by that excellent volunteer organiza - tion , there is here accorded a meed of praise which is surpassing in both quantity and quality .

		It is well to remember that not less than a thousand volunteer regiments , both North and South , were equally instant in performing their duty as they understood it dur - ing the Civil War .

		Let us not forget that we laughed at battles like
Caney	ORGANIZATION	and
San Juan	LOCATION	when the Cubans and Spaniards were fighting two years or so ago , and that some notion of relative values must be pre - served or
Gettysburg	LOCATION	and the Wilderness will take on the dimensions of skirmishes .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	, too , has something to urge against
Shafter	LOCATION	, which rests more upon his mere averment than upon any facts he chooses to relate .

		The books remaining are of lesser moment , though having value as repositories of material .

		Mr.
John C. Hemment	PERSON	is an expert photographer whose zeal carried him not only to
Santiago	LOCATION	but into the firing - line in search of subjects for his camera .

		To him are due many of the pictures that have given those at home so vivid a conception of the war , and it is in these pictures that the interest of his '' Cannon and Camera '' chiefly lies .

		Another abundantly illustrated book is '' The Spanish - American War by Eye-Witnesses , '' compiled from original sources , chiefly the daily press .

		It is episodic , but of much interest , the materials being well chosen .

		Mr.
Murat Halstead	PERSON	describes the battle of
Manila	LOCATION	in `` The Story of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, '' styling himself `` Historian of the Philippine Expedition . ''

		His voluminous work is encyclopaedic in its scope , but with neither alphabetical arrangement nor index .

		It also is illustrated . ''

		A Short History of the War with
Spain	LOCATION	, '' the work of Mr.
Marrion Wilcox	PERSON	, is an agreeable dis - appointment , being fair , comprehensive , succinct , and , considering the material at hand when it was put forth , accurate . ''

		The War with
Spain	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Charles Morris	PERSON	, is written down to the many , is filled with errors , and will be a real grief to those who welcomed his compendium of facts relating to our navy .

		General 0 .

		0 .

		Howard , in '' Fighting for Humanity , '' confines himself to the means taken for the christianization of American soldiers and sailors , and his book is of religious rather than warlike inter - est. .

		It will supply some interesting paragraphs to the future historian .

		Though the war itself was waged with the wea - pons of civilization , the controversies which , have attended its close have the savor of those ill-smelling contrivances still in use , we believe , among the Chi - nese .

		It is to be hoped that unseemly partisanship in respect of such dissensions may give way to a spirit of reform , turning our national energies to the prevention of future scandals rather than to the reanimation of issues which need nothing so much as decent burial .

		JOHN j , CuLVER .

		RECENT POETRY .

		* The ''
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	Poems and Other Verses '' of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	display much rugged strength and an occasional flash of beauty , but they are evidently nothing more than the literary diversions of a man who has cast his best intellectual effort in other moulds of expression .

		Yet at moments they exhibit qualities that almost persuade us a true poet was lost when Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	became a novelist .

		Some - times it is merely a haunting phrase , such as '' at mothy curfew-tide , '' that arrests our attention ; at others it is a longer passage of striking power , such a passage , for example , as this from the lines ad - dressed `` to a lady offended by a book of the writer 's '' : '' So be it .

		I have borne such .

		Let thy dreams Of me and mine diminish day by day , And yield their place to shine of smugger things ; Till I shape to thee but in fitful gleams , And then in far and feeble visitings , And then surcease .

		Truth will be truth alway . ''

		Sometimes , again , although rarely , it is an entire poem , such as '' Heiress and Architect , '' perhaps the strongest of all Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's pieces , too long to quote , and too compactly knit to bear dismember - ment .

		But we may find space for '' Nature 's Ques - tioning , '' which contains the essence of the poet 's message . ''

		When I look forth at dawning , pool ,
Field	ORGANIZATION	, flock , and lonely tree , All seem to look at me Like chastened children sitting silent in a school ; `` Their faces dulled , constrained , and worn , As though the master 's ways Through the long teaching days Their first terrestrial zest had chilled and overborne .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 275 '' And on them stirs , in lippings mere -LRB- As if once clear in call , But now scarce breathed at all -RRB- ' We wonder , ever wonder , why we find us here . '' '

		Has some Vast Imbecility , Mighty to build and blend , But impotent to tend , Framed us in jest , and left us now to hazardry ? '' '

		Or come we of an Automaton Unconscious of our pains ?

		... Or are we live remains Of Godhead dying downwards , brain and eye now gone ? '' '

		Or is it that some high Plan betides , As yet not understood , Of Evil stormed by Good , We the Forlorn Hope over which Achievement strides ? ' ''

		Thus things around .

		No answerer I ... Meanwhile the winds , and rains , And Earth 's old glooms and pains Are still the same , and gladdest Life Death neighbors nigh . ''

		This is one of the undated , and presumably later , poems ; its pessimism is that of '' Tess '' and '' Jude the Obscure . ''

		But a similar note is struck in several pieces that bear the date
1866	DATE	, which shows that Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	has consistently maintained the same attitude toward the fundamental problems of exist - ence .

		More than thirty years ago he could pen such verses as these : '' How arrives it joy lies slain , And why unblooms the best hope ever sown ?

		Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain , And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan ... These purblind doomsters had as readily strown Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain . ''

		Of the ''
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	poems '' proper we have said noth - ing , for they form the least interesting part of the collection .

		But there must be at least one word of mention for the simple and appropriate sketches made by the author himself to illustrate his poems .

		Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's '' Songs and Meditations '' are dated more than two years back , but the vol - ume which contains them has only recently been sent us for review , an occurrence which we doubt - less owe to the large measure of popularity so de - servedly won by Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's prose romance of last year .

		These poems are all that we should expect from the author of '' The Forest Lovers '' and '' Earthwork out of
Tuscany	LOCATION	. ''

		They have a dis - tinction of manner and of phrase that is almost unfailing , and that at one moment suggests Mr.
Henley	PERSON	, at another
Patmore	PERSON	, and at still another our own
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Yet no one could fairly charge Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	with being imitative , for his utterance is distinctly his own , as this '' Dirge '' witnesses : `` How should my lord come home to his lands ?

		Alas for my lord , so brown and strong !

		A lean cross in his folded hands , And a daw to croak him a resting song . ''

		And in autumn tide when the leaves fall down , And wet falls as they fall , drip by drip , My lord lies wan that was once so brown , And the frost cometh to wither his lip . ''

		My lord is white as the morning mist , And his eyes ring 'd like the
winter	DATE	moon : And I will come as soon as ye list O love , it is time ?

		May the time be soon ! ''

		Here , in a very different measure , is an utterance even more original : '' Man is a cage of pain , His thought is a pure thin fire That beateth against the bars And bonds of his grosser part , Astrain for the sky .

		And behold The flame roareth and rendeth , And the war nor stayeth nor endeth ! ''

		Then at last when the bars Of the body shatter 'd and torn Cleave asunder , the flame Winneth the bitter stars -LRB- Keener than scimitars -RRB- , And man lieth prone in shame : Better not to be born ! ''

		The elusive charm of such a poem as '' Artemision '' is not to be described , but the pleasure of feeling it is within the reach of every reader . ''

		Now Winter stealeth out like a white nun , Cloaking her face behind her icy fingers , And men each day look longer at the Sun , While late and later yet the sweet light lingers . ''

		Fast by the hedgerows , bit by gales of
March	DATE	, A chaplet for thy brows of delicate leaves Tendrils of briony , ruby tufts of larch , Wood sorrel , crocus pale , the New Year weaves .

		`` Yet is thy smile half wintry , as forlorn To view thy state too solemn for thy years , And half amazed as a flower 's , late born , And not more quick for pleasure than for tears .

		`` Thy month austere telleth thy cloistral fashion :
March	DATE	frost thy pride is ,
March	DATE	wind thy pent passion . ''

		We miss from this volume a very beautiful sonnet upon the
Botticelli Madonna	PERSON	of the
Uffizii	LOCATION	, published in '' The Athenaeum '' several years ago .

		Nature and the soul of man , the solace of the one for the doubts and perplexities of the other these are the intertwined themes of Mr.
Robert Burns Wilson	PERSON	's volume called '' The Shadows of the Trees . ''

		This closing stanza of '' A Walk with a Child '' may be taken as a highly characteristic ex - ample of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's work : '' Come , I will cast this cloak of care aside , And break the world 's false armour from my breast : His kingdom , from thine eyes , God doth not hide ; Come , we together , will go forth to rest , Somewhere secure wrapped in the sacred dream Which haply , waiteth still , Close nestled in the hollow of yon hill Amidst the drifting leaves .

		There shall the wild And inarticulate whisperings , once more , Speak , with unlying tongues .

		Once more the stream Shall sing of beauty which remaineth ever : No more shall bitter tears for lost endeavour Be known to us .

		All things that should have been , Shall vex us not .

		Thy steps shall go before Towards God 's kingdom .

		On the hidden door Thy hand shall knock , and we shall enter in . ''

		The final philosophy of the poet finds its best ex - pression in this stanza from '' Dust and Ashes '' : '' There be but two things which the soul may find On this sad earth , and , finding , should hold fast , The soul of beauty , which dwells in the mind And hence in all things , for all things are cast In our soul 's proper measure ; and the last And best is love ; love truly can repay 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, The heart 's full sacrifice , for love , being past Leaves something with us that no fate can slay ; And if love linger till the end be here , What cause have we for sorrow then , what cause for fear ? ''

		These two quotations afford sufficient evidence of the fact that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's poetry is out of the com - mon , that it displays a deeper passion and a finer gift than most minor singers have at their command .

		We should like to enforce this proposition by nu - merous further extracts , but space forbids more than one other , a stanza from the poem which asks a question that often before this has put a too com - placent optimism to shame . ''

		Would we return If love 's enchantment held the heart no more , And we had come to count the wild , sweet pain , The fond distress , the lavish tears , but vain ; Had cooled the heart 's hot wounds amidst the roar Of mountain gales , or , on some alien shore Worn out the soul 's long anguish , and had slain The dragon of despair ; if then the train Of vanished years came back , and , as of yore , The same voice called , and , with soft eyes beguiling , Our lost love beckoned , through time 's grey veil smiling , Would we return ? ''

		One thing , and one only , about Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's vol - ume we regret .

		We find among the contents a battle song called '' Remember the
Maine	LOCATION	. ''

		The sooner that discreditable phase of last year 's war is forgotten , the better it will be for bur national reputation .

		The '' Poems '' of Mr.
Philip Henry Savage	PERSON	are , for the most part , trifling and fanciful , although the light touch of the writer sometimes sounds a chord of deep feeling , as in these lines : '' This crystal sapphire of the sky Is saner far than you and I , Who in our passions and our dreams Gun ever more to wild extremes . ''

		The pure perfection of the sea Lies not in mirth and tragedy ; But like the silence of the snows In breadth of beauty and repose .

		u God give one moment , ere we die , As crystal clear as the blue sky , Serene as ocean , white as snow , And glowing as the heavens glow . ''

		Mr.
Savage	PERSON	is often happy in his form of expres - sion , but not often as happy as this . ''

		The Dream Beautiful , '' by Mr.
C. H. Musgrove	PERSON	, is a small and not unpleasing volume of a conven - tional sort of verse .

		We are glad to reproduce ''
Cain	PERSON	, or Christ ? ''

		two quatrains written for Easter of last year , which express what so many thousands were feeling at that time . ''

		Athwart the blazing ramparts of the day The white - robed hosts of peace come hand in hand , White palms and lilies strew the joyous way , And Christ , the risen King , smiles o'er the land . ''

		Behind the sullen fortress of the night
Cain	PERSON	's armed legions wait with feverish breath , While high above them , lost to mortal sight , Hover the black and steadfast wings of Death . ''

		Mr.
William Norman Guthrie	PERSON	has approved him - self an essayist of sobriety and force , but he has not acquired freedom of motion when hampered by the restriction of rhyme and rhythm .

		Such lines as these '' Dear moon .

		So white , so swift .

		That fliest from cloud to cloud Athwart each starry drift , How haughty and virgin-browed !

		There clings about thy form A circle of hallowed light .

		It glides , and hides the swarm Of stars that would hide thy flight '' are of the best that we can find in '' A Booklet of Verse , '' a modest publication just put forth by Mr.
Guthrie	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	's volume of lyrics called '' Beneath Blue Skies and Gray '' is one to be read with con - siderable pleasure , although the measures are some - what cloying in their sweetness , and a few senti - ments receive so much reiteration as to grow monotonous .

		The poet 's inspiration comes almost wholly from natural beauty , which clearly means a great deal to him .

		His observation , too , seems usu - ally to have been faithful , although we can not at all understand him when he writes of '' The creek , where liriodendrons tall , Lift high their golden cups , '' and we are doubtful of the sense in which he means us to take the forced figure in '' The mocking-bird is joyous there In wild parabolas of song . ''

		His best may be illustrated by this sonnet to ''
October	DATE	. '' ''

		Dim are the emeralds of dead
Summer	ORGANIZATION	's crown , And to her throne , where rubies flash and glow ,
October	DATE	comes with queenly step and slow , Pale asters braided in her tresses brown .

		The blue curled banners of the mist hang down , The milkweed bolls are white with silken snow , The thistle 's silver argosies out-blow , And insect voices chant their Queen 's renown .

		With tender eyes of happy , dreamful light She looks abroad on spreading fallow lands , On soft gray skies and wooded hillsides bright , The aged Year 's offering in her outstretched hands : The partridge pipes a welcome leaping white The brook sings welcome from its leaf - strewn sands . ''

		Some pretentious occasional poems , in which the note is too forced to be altogether pleasant , a group of love songs and sonnets , often prettily done , but never more than that ; and a few pieces suggested by the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, form the chief contents of Mr.
Hovey	PERSON	's lyrical collection called '' Along the Trail . ''

		The things last mentioned come first in the volume , and , being mostly sound and fury , do not predispose to a favorable judgment of what is to follow .

		It is claimed , we believe , that the phrase `` Remember the
Maine	LOCATION	, '' as it occurs in one of these pieces , is Mr.
Hovey	PERSON	's own .

		If so , we wish him joy of it , and of the ignoble uses to which it has been put .

		We will illustrate his better work by means of the following sonnet : '' My love for you dies many times a year , And a new love is monarch in his place .

		Love must grow weary of the fairest face ; The fondest heart must fail to hold him near .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL For love is born of wonder , kin to fear Things grown familiar lose the sweet amaze ; Grown to their measure , love must turn his gaze To some new splendor , some diviner sphere .

		But in the blue night of your endless soul New stars globe ever as the old are scanned ; Goal where love will , you reach a farther goal , And the new love is ever love of you .

		Love needs a thousand loves , forever new , And finds them in the hollow of your hand . ''

		A set of translations from MaHamae '' are about the most successful things in Mr.
Hovey	PERSON	's new volume .

		They have no lasting value as poetry , but neither have their originals , and they do reproduce some - thing of the striking verbal effects at which the poet chiefly aimed .

		The pamphlet into which Mr.
Armistead C. Gor	PERSON	- don has gathered a group of four occasional and memorial poems is so slight a thing in appearance that it might easily be overlooked .

		We are glad to call attention to it , for the quality of the verse is of a higher order than is usual in such productions , and is inspired by a deeper sentiment .

		In its mem - ories of the War , this verse is strongly Southern -LRB- or rather Virginian -RRB- in its sympathies .

		Here is a stanza , good as a whole , and made peculiarly im - pressive by the poignant pathos of the closing verse : '' When came the bitter end , the bugle blew Its last sad note , that brought the blinding tears Down wasted cheeks from eyes that only knew Honor and Death through all the weary years .

		The long hard fight was done ; Silenced was every gun ; And what we lost , e ` en now they do not dream , who won . ''

		One of the poems was written for
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, and contains this fine tribute to the mem - ory of its founder . ''

		One name , before which none in all time ever Hath been or shall be , shining there is writ : Worker of Revolutions , mighty giver Of Freedom 's charter , and the
Voice	ORGANIZATION	of it .

		When kingdoms shake , and iron empires fall , Through multitudinous time shall ring the clarion call '' Of the eternal lesson that he taught : 1 The gift of God is Freedom . '

		Never gift In all the ages with his promise fraught , Hath been bestowed like this one to uplift Mortality to godhood , and to light Man 's pathway through the years till Time be put to flight . ''

		The sympathy which we felt for Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	during his recent illness may fairly be matched by the sympathy that he at all times deserves for his sufferings at the hands of the parodists .

		Here , for example , is a volume called '' Songs of Good Fight - ing , '' and the sort of thing it contains is almost wholly this : '' We left a town where the sun stood slant on the fardled dead in the whetted square The murrey sun on a cruise foredone fluxed the West to a tawny glare , And a cozening wind coaxed at our sails , as we set forth to Otherwhere . ''

		The author of this volume appears to be a very bloodthirsty young person , and our slighting com - ment upon his work is made with some trepidation . ''

		The Wayfarers '' is the title of a book of song by Miss
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	.

		It is also the title of the opening poem , a sort of allegory of the spiritual pilgrimage , beautifully told and strangely impressive .

		Here is one stanza that will bear read - ing apart from the rest : '' A red , red rose the early sun Came up , as glad as any guest ; A white , white rose whose bloom was done , The moon did wane unto the west .

		The waking fields breathed warm and stirred Small presences of song , half heard ; The wan stars closed against the day like flowers that fold them for their rest . ''

		It is a relief to find in this collection , after the wil - derness of lyrics and sonnets through which most minor poets bid us find a way , an attempt to do something else .

		We refer to a small group of '' Idyls , '' Tennysonian or Landorian in their inspi - ration .

		Such verse as the following , while not re - markable , is sweet and satisfying .

		The subject is '' Orpheus in Hades . '' ''

		But when he came The trance of snow was troubled .

		Like the
spring	DATE	, I felt sweet stir of long-forgotten roots , Soft wakening in darkness , and afraid .

		Ever the air grew warmer , drew a breath Against the immortal heart-throb of the strings ; Till with some portent like a thunder-burst , My sleep was rifted ... There stood I , agaze , With them that gathered round him where he sang Bright as a torch in the bewildered eyes Of wistful hearers , pressing close , to melt The lonely peace away . ''

		In `` The Song of
Stradella	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Anna Gannon	PERSON	, we have , to begin with , two longish poems .

		One of them gives the book its title , and the other is '' A Dream of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Women , '' the charm - ing embodiment of a happy thought .

		We have also a number of simpler pieces , that display a moder - ate degree of poetic taste and sensibility .

		`` A Song of Best '' is a typical illustration . ''

		I heard a song of rest so infinite That even thought was silenced , and a peace Fell on the spirit softer than the light Of quiet stars when dreary day shall cease . ''

		Who hath not drifted to that fairy shore ?

		Who hath not longed to find that isle so blest , Where hope shall cheat and fate betray no more , And all life 's fever turn to dreamless rest ? ''

		Many of these pieces are reminiscences of scenes , persons , and books , gracefully obvious , and leaving no deep impression upon the memory .

		`` The Immortals '' is a small book of obituary poetry , devoted for the most part to singing the virtues of deceased Bostonians .

		A few outsiders , as
Chatterton	LOCATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	, are admitted to this company , and all are extolled in hackneyed commonplaces that parade in the form of verse .

		There is no original beauty , no freshness of criti - cism , no inspiration in these pieces .

		Such lines as the following , inscribed to
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, which might have been written
fifty years ago	DATE	, are enough to make the poet turn in his grave : 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, '' Yea , verily there is a God in heaven : To know Him , unto thee it was not given .

		He yearned to draw thee to his mighty breast , And soothe thy weary , flattering heart to rest . ''

		A score or more of sonnets and sonnet-like poems , together with something like the same number of brief lyrics , make up the contents of a small volume of verse by Miss
Helen Hay	PERSON	.

		It is verse that de - serves more than a perfunctory commendation , for it bears evidence upon every page of poetic sensi - bility and the artistic conscience .

		Miss Hay is clearly of those who work upon their verses until the first rough spontaneity is overlaid with the polish that betokens painstaking craftmanship , and then again until this polish is made so transparent that the first freshness reappears , softened and subdued .

		The lyric impulse is very strong in these pieces , often attuned to the chord of passion , yet rarely without the reflective element that makes of a poem something more than sensuousness alone .

		Let us take this sonnet for an illustration : '' Kiss me but once , and in that space supreme My whole dark life shall quiver to an end , Sweet Death shall see my heart and comprehend That life is crowned , and in an endless gleam Will fix the color of the dying stream , That Life and Death may meet as friend with friend An endless immortality to blend ; Kiss me but once , and so shall end my dream .

		And then Love heard me and bestowed his kiss , And straight I cried to Death : I will not die !

		Earth is so fair when one remembers this ; Life is but just begun !

		Ah , come not yet !

		The very world smiles up to kiss the sky , And in the grave one may forget forget . ''

		In these verses the passion is warm and throbbing ; how spiritualized another mood may make it ap - pears in the following sonnet , which we reproduce both for its own strange ethereal beauty and for the instructive contrast which it affords when set beside the other : '' Ah , love , my love , upon this alien shore I lean and watch the pale uneasy ships Slip thro ' the waving mist in strange eclipse , Like spirits of some time and land of yore .

		I did not think my heart could love thee more , And yet , when , lightlier than a swallow dips , The wind lays ghostly kisses on my lips , I seem to know of love the eternal core .

		Here is no throbbing of impassioned breath To beat upon my cheek , no pulsing heart Which might be silenced by the touch of Death , No smile which other smile has softly kissed , Or doting gaze which Time must draw apart , But spirit 's spirit in the trailing mist . ''

		As for Miss Hay 's lyrics , we are tempted to call them less lyrical than the sonnets .

		In other words , there is a marked reflective element in both her groups of pieces , and in the song proper this ele - ment should be felt rather than expressed as defi - nitely as it is here , at least in a few cases .

		But we would not close these comments without again indi - cating our sense of the finish and the distinction of Miss Hay 's volume , which we wish were , and trust will in time become , a much larger one .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Democracy : ^ he Poetical reformer , as well as the its evih and student of political philosophy , will their remedy .

		fin -LRB- j p ro f e88or
James H. Hyslop	PERSON	's pungent and venturesome little study of '' Democ - racy '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- decidedly interesting .

		Unlike Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	and most recent critics of Democracy , Professor
Hyslop	PERSON	does not content himself with fault-finding , with showing wherein and how griev - ously this form of government , which was ushered in with such salvos and plaudits and golden predic - tions a century ago , has fallen short of the millen - nial hopes formed of it . ''

		Barking at the Devil , '' he says , '' is not sufficient . ''

		He therefore not only points out -LRB- in a very plain-spoken and peppery way -RRB- wherein our political system is in its workings intoler - ably defective , but he grapples boldly with the much more difficult task of proposing specific remedies for the most crying defects .

		He offers for debate a set of apparently feasible remedial devices which go to form '' a complete system of government which is neither a reaction toward monarchy , nor an ac - ceptance of the status quo '' Professor
Hyslop	PERSON	takes care to say that his scheme is not offered as an object of immediate practical politics , but only as a general conception to be borne in mind when proposing measures of reform .

		Broadly stated , the direction of political reforms should be , Professor
Hyslop	PERSON	thinks , that of specializing the functions of govern - ment , simplifying those of the citizen , and of increas - ing the powers of the executive .

		The remedies he suggests , it must be added , are not in the direction of those popular nostrums , the referendum and the initiative which , however , he admits to be democ - racy 's logical and natural consequences which may have to be allowed to develop their course .

		His plan may be regarded , then , either as a substitute for the referendum and the initiative , or as a remedy to be resorted to after these shall have been tried and found wanting .

		Briefly stated , Professor
Hys	PERSON	- lop 's plan is to enlarge the executive 's appointing power , to curtail the power of removal through the establishment of an independent Court of Impeach - ment and Removal , and to modify the legislature 's method of passing its laws .

		The '' court of removal '' he regards as the key to his entire system of reform .

		That system we can not attempt to state here in de - tail , much less to discuss ; but we heartily commend it as well worth the study and consideration of our readers .

		It is not often that one finds a political treatise so thoughtful and philosophical , yet at the same time so practical , aggressive , and stimulating , as is this of Professor
Hyslop	PERSON	's .

		Mr.
Martin A. S. Hume	PERSON	is a diligent Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	's and 8ucce8 8ful student of the
Eliza	LOCATION	- great minister .

		__ .

		, bethan age .

		His two monographs , '' The Courtships of Queen Elizabeth '' and '' The Year after the Armada , '' are now succeeded by '' The Great Lord Burghley '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , a solid octavo of 500 pages , in which the career of
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL great minister is followed with fidelity from begin - ning to end .

		Any writer who attempts to do this in 500 pages mast sacrifice something : and Mr.
Hume	PERSON	has sacrificed much .

		With every temptation to he picturesque , to describe , like
Green	ORGANIZATION	, the En - glish people , to stir his readers ' blood with the heroic achievements of that awakening age in which En - gland first found herself , he has resolutely stuck to his task .

		It was probably not easy writing , and it is rather hard reading : Cecil 's cautious and self - seeking policy during the reigns of
Edward VI	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Mary	PERSON	was essentially unheroic ; and his forty years of power under
Elizabeth	PERSON	are splendid chiefly in their devotion to
England	LOCATION	's interest and
William Cecil	PERSON	's advancement .

		The annals of a half-century 's tor - tuous intriguing may be as tedious as those of that much prosperity ; and the fact that Lord
Burghley	PERSON	lived safely through a period crowded with brilliant but disastrous careers vindicates his worldly wisdom , but withholds the meed of nobility .

		It was , indeed , as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	has remarked , no place for a
Riche	LOCATION	- lieu : the sovereign was too masterful .

		Strange compound of her father 's coarse violence and her mother 's light vanity ,
Elizabeth Tudor	PERSON	had her own dower of sagacity ; and though she smiled on flat - terers , she always came back to the grave and pa - tient man who sat in her presence and gave her what she knew to be the best advice .

		She had many suitors , and talked always of marriage : but ,
Maiden Queen	ORGANIZATION	though she was and remained , she had an intellectual husband in her great Lord Treas - urer .

		He steered the ship of the realm with infinite skill and determination , by his own methods , through the troublous waters of threatened war with
Spain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Scotland	LOCATION	: and the jibe of his enemies '' regnum Cecilianum '' was founded in fact .

		He saved
Elizabeth	PERSON	from herself , often with no ac - knowledgment but complaint ; yet when she visited him in his sick-room , and the servant cautioned her to stoop on entering the low door , the Queen replied , '' For your master only will I stoop , but not for the King of
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Hume	PERSON	's plan is , as above indicated , analytic , not descriptive .

		He steadily disentangles for our behoof the intricate web of manoeuvres , intrigues , plots and counter-plots , which made into one fabric English , French , and Span - ish affairs ; and has no space or but little for the story of the Armada ,
Mary	PERSON	of
Scotland	LOCATION	's execution , or the rise and fall of
Ralegh	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has done his chosen work well and thoroughly , and ap - parently without prejudice ; and his estimate of Lord
Burghley	PERSON	will probably command assent .

		Porto Rico is one of the choicest islands of the Greater Antilles .

		As a newly-acquired possession of the
United States	LOCATION	it has aroused almost universal inter - est. .

		Located as it is on about the same parallels as
Jamaica	LOCATION	, it presents immense possibilities as a source of our tropical products .

		Mr.
F. A. Ober	PERSON	's ''
Puerto Rico	LOCATION	and its Resources '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is an admirable compend of useful information about this charming little island .

		With good discrimination he discusses its commercial and strategic value , its coastal fea - tures , its climate , seasons , products , natural history , government , and people , and its history down to the present .

		With about 3,600 square miles of territory and more than 800,000 population , it presents few possibilities for anyone besides capitalists , tourists , and educators .

		Eighty-six per cent of its peoples more than one-half of whom are white , three - fourths of the remainder mulattos , and one-fourth blacks are entirely illiterate .

		The lack of trans - portation facilities , enough railroads , and good high - ways , limit the productivity of the soil , though it can readily grow under proper conditions almost any tropical product .

		Counterbalancing this lux - uriant tropical life are the evenness of the temper - ature , the humidity of the atmosphere , the frequency of storms and hurricanes .

		The evident work for the
United States	LOCATION	is to prepare good transportation facilities for the island , teach the Porto Ricans the possibilities of tropical agriculture , and to establish schools . ''

		The Porto Rico of To-day '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Mr.
Albert Gardner Robinson	PERSON	, is a series of pen - pictures of the people and the country .

		In sixteen breezy chapters , the author sketches his experiences and observations in company with the military cam - paign which invaded
Porto Rico	ORGANIZATION
last August	DATE	.

		Life on a troop-ship , lack of organization in the '' ag - glomeration '' of soldiers which entered the island , personal encounters , and varied experiences during several weeks on the island , are appetizingly set before the reader .

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	's observations on the future possibilities of the island are eminently sane , and can not but do good among that restless class of people who are always plunging into risks with little or no capital .

		Amateur adventurers of any kind should read both of these books before rushing to
Porto Rico	LOCATION	.

		As set forth in these vol - umes , the field is an ideal one for foundation work in lifting up and training a susceptible and tractable people .

		We have already had occasion to Mr
Jones	PERSON	' * plays express our opinion of the 8UCC6SS of in book form .

		H.-TT i i - r Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	in serious drama , so far as literature is concerned .

		And we suppose that he must wish to have his plays regarded as literature : else why should he publish them ?

		With the stage we have little to do : our readers have probably before this had occasion to form their opinions as to Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's ability there .

		But an acted play is not literature , and we do not judge it as if it were .

		We are not in the habit of getting our literature viva voce : we get it in books .

		Other things we call '' literary '' pictures and plays , for instance ; but it is by a sort of figure of speech .

		The drama is a thing by itself ; it has its own canons and its own critics .

		But when a play is put into print , then it pretends to be literature , either is lit - erature or is not , for any one of us , as any one of us may decide .

		It is as foolish to judge a printed play by what it might be if it were acted , as it is to judge a play on the stage by what it might be if it 280 -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, Essays on p hates of Evolution .

		were printed .

		`` The Rogue 's Comedy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is , we imagine , better as a play to be read than as one to be acted , although Mr.
Jones	PERSON	probably aimed at no such end .

		We recollect to have heard that it was by no means as successful as '' The Liars , '' for instance .

		One of the reasons cfffered for its quali - fied failure was that it had no real love-story .

		This is practically the case : the play gives us the career of a charlatan , and the amusement comes mostly from its satire .

		Another thing that was probably ineffective on the stage was this : the charlatan 's own son , who , never having known his father , has been successfully trying to expose him , brings matters to a head , and the fellow goes away without telling .

		The Rogue and his wife sail for
America	LOCATION	without discovering himself to his son , who marries the young lady and possibly finds out afterwards .

		This may not have pleased the audience .

		We think , however , that it will please the reader .

		At any rate , one will enjoy this play , and several more of Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's things that are yet to be published .

		It must be remembered , though , that some of the volumes are not so good as others to put it mildly .

		Under the title of `` Foot-Notes to Evolution '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- there has appeared from the facile pen of Pres - ident
Jordan	PERSON	a volume of essays on evolutionary topics which presents even more than the title prom - ises ; for it sets forth in fresh and attractive guise , not some incidental jottings upon the subject , but a skilful treatment of the main theme in some of its most important phases .

		The various conceptions of the term '' evolution '' are discussed and objec - tions are vigorously raised against mistaken appli - cations of the word and illegitimate extensions of its scope .

		The doctrine of descent reappears as '' The Kinship of Life , '' and '' The Heredity of
Richard Roe	PERSON	'' is the text for a lucid and non-partisan pre - sentation and criticism of the theories of
Galton	PERSON	and
Weismann	PERSON	.

		Heredity , irritability , individuality , natural selection , self-activity , altruism , isolation , and inheritance are all recognized and discussed as elements of organic evolution .

		Professor
E. G. Conklin	PERSON	contributes a chapter on the factors of organic evolution , in which he rejects both
Weis	PERSON	- mann and
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	and counsels a return to Dar - win .

		Professor
F. M. McFarland	PERSON	also adds a popular discussion of the physical basis of heredity , in which recent discoveries in cell-life and some of the latest speculations about the same are freed from their technicalities and elucidated for the gen - eral reader .

		President
Jordan	PERSON	loses no opportunity to enforce the relation of biological laws and theo - ries to the questions of philosophy and to the un - solved problems of our modern civilization .

		The chapter on hereditary inefficiency is a strong protest against the perpetuation of crime and pauperism which our treatment of the delinquent classes now affords , and his discussion of the woman of pessim - ism and the woman of evolution is a vigorous pro- test , on biological grounds , against
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's misogynous tirade .

		The breadth of view , the free - dom from the trammels alike of science and of dogma , the freshness and authenticity of the illus - trative data , and above all the pleasing style , render this book one of the best of the popular treatises upon this ever-interesting subject .

		An unaccountable Jt is hard to account for Mr.
Justin	PERSON	history of the
Huntly McCarthy	PERSON	's `` Short History United Stales .

		of the
United Stateg -LRB- R. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- except as an unusually desperate case of cram and potboiling .

		It is superficially conceived and crudely executed , and is often childish in its blundering incompetency .

		A more inadequate and misjudged sketch of the Civil War , for example , we do not remember to have seen .

		There is not even a coherent outline , and men and movements are jumbled together in an altogether hopeless muddle .

		All the disasters of the North in
the first two years	DATE	of the war are laid in a bundle upon the shoulders of one man
McClellan	PERSON	.

		There is not a mention of Pope and his rout -LRB- the name is not even in the index -RRB- ;
Burnside	PERSON	and
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	receive a single line , and
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	is to this historian apparently unknown .

		Instead , we are told that ''
McClellan	PERSON	's removal happily handed the destinies of the armies of the North into the hands of greater men , '' and that with his disappearance '' the story of the war took a new meaning and the fortune of the cause began to wear an unfamiliar brightness , '' the brightness , namely , of
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	and
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	, which succeeded the
Union	ORGANIZATION	gloom of Antietam !

		The reading of a single book written by his fellow-countryman ,
Colonel Henderson	PERSON	, might have saved Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	from blunders such as these .

		Minor blunders may be exemplified by the placing of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's second election after the close of the war in
1865	DATE	instead of
1864	DATE	, and naming
Fremont	LOCATION	as the Republican nominee of that campaign .

		The gem of the book is perhaps in the chapter treating of our recent war on
Spain	LOCATION	, in which we are told that ''
Spain	LOCATION	would do nothing , promise nothing , perform nothing for the better treatment of
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		All she would do was to declare war on the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		It is depressing to think that any educated Englishman could suppose this to be the sort of stuff Americans wish to read .

		The author is

		During the next ten years he had fighting enough to last most men for a lifetime , and he could certainly bear witness to the truth of General

		His story of the storming and sacking of
Badajoz	LOCATION	-LRB- cleansed and softened as it is by the editor -RRB- is shocking beyond description .

		The British sol - diers got completely out of control of their officers , in whose sight -LRB- if we are to credit
Blakeney	PERSON	-RRB- they perpetrated crimes inconceivable by a decent imag - ination .

		Blakeney left the army in
1828	DATE	, and he seems to have spent the remainder of his life in administrative posts in the foreign civil service .

		He was for a time Health Inspector in the
Island of Zante	LOCATION	; and it was during this period that the present memoir was prepared .

		The manuscript has been furbished up and prepared for the press by the author 's son-in-law , Mr.
Julian Sturgis	PERSON	; and it is well worth the pains he has bestowed upon it .

		Notably interesting are the pen-pictures of Welling - ton and his officers , the story of the retreat through
Spain	LOCATION	to
Corunna	LOCATION	with Sir
John Moore	PERSON	; the ac - count of the death of that general , and of the bat - tles of
Corunna	LOCATION	,
Barossa	LOCATION	,
Badajoz	LOCATION	, etc. .

		The pioneering * tne aterial means which have and building contributed to make the outward life of a railroad .

		o f to .

		d a y different from that of sixty years ago , certainly the railroad is foremost .

		Yet to the majority of people a vista of rails and ties and a train with its crew are about all the notions called up by the name .

		Mr.
Warman	PERSON	, in his '' Story of the Railroad '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , has endeavored to give a general idea of the vastness of the interests and the variety of the personnel involved in the great railroad systems of the
West	LOCATION	.

		And yet there are many phases of the work which he only hints at , as , for instance , the legislative management , which would make a couple of interesting volumes ; the financiering , of which Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has told some - thing ; the operation , the most complex yet most perfect business mechanism in existence .

		In fact , it is the pioneering and the building of a railroad with which the book is chiefly concerned , and this in large measure the
Atchison	LOCATION	,
Topeka & Santa Fe	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is adventure and romance enough con - nected with the building of any great transconti - nental railroad , but probably the
Santa Fe	LOCATION	had more than its share of these elements .

		As a consequence , Mr.
Warman	PERSON	's recital , liberally illustrated as it is , is a fascinating story which ought to be much pre - ferred to a novel by those who want '' a true story . ''

		The recollections of General Count The struggle for
Enrico Delia Rocca	ORGANIZATION	, embracing the period from
1807	DATE	to
1893	DATE	, are chiefly occupied with the important events of the struggle for Italian unity .


General Rocca	ORGANIZATION	was in an excep - tionally favorable position to know whereof he has written , since he himself took a prominent part in the contest , having been intimately associated with
King Victor Emanuel	PERSON	as his chief of staff , and A concise biography of
Cavour	LOCATION	.

		intrusted with several delicate diplomatic missions .

		His '' Autobiography of a Veteran '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is accordingly an interesting contribution to the his - tory of the period .

		The book is remarkable in the fact that , although it is a record of matters in which the author had a leading part , it is singularly free from the vitiating influence of personal bias and from harsh criticisms of opponents .

		Remarkably supe - rior to jealousy ,
General Rocca	ORGANIZATION	was able to honor
Cavour	PERSON	and to be just to
Garibaldi	PERSON	and
Mazzini	PERSON	.

		The
Countess Cesaresco	PERSON	has written a very interesting account of the life and work of the great Italian diplo - matist and statesman ,
Cavour	PERSON	, which forms a vol - ume of the '' Foreign Statesmen '' series -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		Not too much has been attempted by the author , and enough has been done to furnish within the limits of 220 pages an account of the career , from early youth , of the man to whom , more than to any other , Italian unity is due an account which will meet the requirements of the general reader .

		While the student of history will naturally have recourse to
Cavour	PERSON	's correspondence and the pub - lished documents which throw light on his career , readers who wish a vivid presentation of the man as he lived and worked will find this book exceedingly interesting and profitable .

		The side-lights thrown upon contemporary history , and Russian , Austrian , French , and English diplomacy , constitute an attrac - tive feature of the work .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		The French Revolution and the English Poets '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Dr.
Albert Elmer Hancock	PERSON	, is unfortunate in the fact that , although completed before the appear - ance in book form of Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's lectures upon exactly the same subject for the
Princeton Sesquicen	ORGANIZATION	- tennial , its publication has been delayed until now .

		As the work of a beginner in criticism , it would not be fair to institute any comparison at all between this book and its predecessor in point of publication , let us rather say that the present work is so well done that we have read it with much satisfaction , and that our shelves have room for it as well as for Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's volume .

		Professor
Lewis E. Gates	PERSON	contri - butes a few introductory pages to the book .

		Indeed , what with the dedication to Professor
Wendell	PERSON	, and the further miscellaneous acknowledgements of the preface , the trail of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is over the whole no very bad thing for a book , all things considered . ''

		The Rights and Duties of American Citizenship , '' by Dr.
W. W. Willoughby	PERSON	, is a school-book of more than ordinary value recently published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book has two sections , the first devoted to the elements of political science in general , and the second to a description of civil government , both na - tional and local , in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The author is fully abreast of the most progressive methods of dealing with these subjects , and his work is sound , practical , and compact .

		Our only criticism is that there does not seem to be quite enough matter in the book to fit it for use in the higher schools for which it is intended .

		286 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, THE STORY OF The Rough Riders By
EDWARD MARSHALL	PERSON	.

		The most intensely interesting book of modern times .

		The author , correspondent of the
New York Journal	ORGANIZATION	, was a par - ticipant with the '' Rough Riders , '' and was severely wounded by a Mauser bullet while at the extreme front of the firing line at
Las Guasimas	ORGANIZATION	.

		His book is thrillingly inter - esting .

		It is devoted entirely to THE ROUGH RIDERS , The best Regiment of Volunteer Soldiers ever organized .

		The first to land in
Cuba	LOCATION	, who raised the first American flag , flown by the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, on Spanish soil , and headed one of the most desperate charges in the history of warfare .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's ability as a writer is widely known .

		His '' Story Of the Rough Riders '' is the best work he has ever done .

		It is by no means a history , although the greatest pains have been taken to make it accurate .

		It is full of anecdote and episode , and tells the story with a breezy freedom and dashing rapidity which is like that of the regiment itself on the battlefield .

		The personalities of many of its members , officers and privates , are vividly portrayed .

		It contains a complete Roster of the Regiment .

		`` Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	tells the history of this celebrated organiza - tion from its formation in
Texas	LOCATION	to the day it was mustered out in
New York	LOCATION	. ''


New York Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` It is one of the most intensely interesting books of the day . ''


Albany Times Union	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It will stand unique and interesting among the books re - sulting from the late struggle with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		It is written in the clear and graphic fashion of the trained newspaper worker , written by one who saw more than the mere details which make common-place histories . ''


New York World	LOCATION	. ''

		Enscrolled with emblematic colors of fidelity , constancy , and courage , shines fadelessly the entries of those horseless riders , that dismounted chivalry of knighthood , the
First United States Volunteer Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	, which more than any other regiment opened to civilization the unwilling gates of
Santi	PERSON	- ago .

		There is nothing Americans admire so much as pure pluck , and in any suffrage .


Edward Marshall	ORGANIZATION	's name would lead in that quality .

		His ' Story of the Rough Riders ' has the authority , the conciseness , the piquant style , of the good reporter . ''


Newport News	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` No European who has had an opportunity to study the
Rough Riders	ORGANIZATION	, fails for a second to appreciate the American soldier .

		It would be madness to back the English , German , or French fighting machines against men like those in the
First Volunteer Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Captain
Lee	PERSON	, English Military Attache . ''

		It is a book which the members of that famous regiment and their innumerable friends will want to read , for the name on the title page is a guaranty that the story is told in a sym - pathetic spirit and with brilliant effects .

		Its power of realism stands alone in the literature of the Spanish war . ''


New York	LOCATION	Evening Sun . ''

		Immediately interesting and destined to be of great value to the historian when he shall come later to his task .

		It is written with the verve and fluency of a newspaper report ; but , it bears internal evidence of a very conscientious accur - acy . ''


George Gary JEggleston	PERSON	, in the
New York World	LOCATION	.

		`` Few contributions to the literature of our time are more worthy of the attention of Americans than this book the plain tale of grand deeds done by their countrymen . ''

		Crown 8vo ,

		The aim of this book is to show that Baptism , the
Eucharist	LOCATION	, the
Visible Church	ORGANIZATION	, the Christian Priesthood , and other Church principles are set forth in the New Testament as inseparably connected with
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's Res - urrection and Ascension ; that both
Romanism	LOCATION	and Pro- testantism , by stopping at the Crucifixion and losing the true meaning of the Resurrection and Ascension , have failed to realize the relationship of the Glorified Christ to His Church , and have thus fallen below the level of
New Testament Churchmanship	ORGANIZATION	.

		The object of this volume is to give a general picture of English society , politics , and religion , at a certain stage in their progress .

$ 2.00	MONEY	. ''

		The case of
Armenia	LOCATION	obviously claims attention , and it is for the purpose of forwarding this claim to the attention of the
Western Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean and American public that the author of this book has written .

		He has a right to speak , for he is familiar with the facts of the matter , and has an almost unique knowledge of the causes , progress , and aims of the late revolt of a large section of his countrymen against the Turkish Government ... He writes frankly from the Armenian point of view , but his stories are none the less based upon fact .

		He has known personally most of the characters he draws ; the opinions they express and those they actually held ; the adventures they go through are real experiences of his friends and kinsfolk . ''

		315 THE ENDOWED THEATRE .

		The recent visit of Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	to this country , for the purpose of making a close study of theatrical conditions on our side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, will doubtless result in a highly in - structive series of papers for the English peri - odical which commissioned him to make the investigation , and has already called fresh attention to , and evoked fresh discussion of , a number of old questions connected with the art of the dramatist and theatrical manager .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	is himself peculiarly well-equipped for such a task as he has undertaken .

		Among English dramatic critics he occupies the fore - most place .

		He has both knowledge and so - berness , and these qualities combined make him a far more significant writer of dramatic criticism than the effeminately whimsical Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	, the sensationally sentimental Mr.
Scott	PERSON	, and the audaciously paradoxical Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		Even the writing of Mr.
Walkley	PERSON	, brilliant and fascinating as it is , lacks the solidity of Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's criticism , because it does not seem to be as firmly based upon the fundamental principles of dramatic art , or as widely conversant with the modern literature of the play .

		Among the many evils connected with the English-speaking stage of our own time , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	marks out the '' actor-manager , '' the '' star system , '' and the '' long run '' for his most emphatic denunciation .

		In the address which he gave in this country before the
Twentieth Century Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	and
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity of
New York	LOCATION	, he sought to answer the question , '' What can be done for the drama ? ''

		and bore down upon these three evils with much weight .

		We imagine , however , that for his audiences upon these two occasions he was slaying the slain , for our cultivated public hardly needs to be persuaded that stars and long runs and actor - managers are directly inimical to all artistic endeavor for the better - ment of our theatrical conditions .

		We are as familiar as Englishmen are with the bad influence of these things , or , if we have not suffered as much from the actor-manager , we 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, have for our very own the additional evil of the '' theatrical syndicate , '' which more than tips the scale -LRB- this to be taken ironically -RRB- in our favor .

		We must , however , hasten to dislodge from the minds of our readers the notion that Mr.
Archer	PERSON	was merely destructive in his criticism .

		Nothing could be farther than this from the truth .

		Unlike Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	, our English vis - itor of six months ago , who dealt with the same general subject of the low theatrical estate of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, Mr.
Archer	PERSON	had definite things to propose .

		And if his address was without the pointed epigrams and the flashes of humor that made Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	so entertain - ing a speaker , it provided ample compensation for the lack of those superficialities in its ra - tional suggestions , enforced as these were by examples of what other countries have actually '' done for the drama . ''

		In a general way , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	was for the establishment of an endowed theatre , but with a difference from the usual speculations upon this subject , in that the sug - gested endowment was to be private rather than municipal , a matter for the voluntary enterprise of subscribers rather than for the forced enter - prise of tax-payers .

		Considered from the point of view of probability , we agree with Mr.
Archer	PERSON	in looking forward to a private rather than a public endowment , although we think it would be entirely proper for the municipality to act in such a matter .

		And we need hardly remind our readers that THE DIAL has always advocated the endowed theatre , as it has always urged the desirability of the endowed newspa - per .

		One of these days , moreover , the idea is going to take practical shape in the mind of some philanthropist , who will prefer to make his gift to the public in this way rather than to establish a new hospital or art gallery or public library .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	spoke at considerable length of the successful way in which certain German theatres notably the Deutsches Theater of
Berlin	LOCATION	and the Volkstheater of
Vienna	LOCATION	have dealt with this problem of supplying the '' inner public '' the public which wants good art , which demands that ideas shall be set above accessories in its plays with its dramatic en - tertainment .

		There is no reason why such theatres , the product of endowment and sub - scription , should not be duplicated in our own country , and even prove successful as commer - cial enterprises , no reason , that is , unless it be that our own `` inner public '' is not large enough .

		There is the rub , no doubt .

		The German pub - lic , the French public , the Italian public , the Scandinavian public , all contrive , in any city of considerable or even moderate size , to sup - port a stage in healthful activity , and this is just what the English public has hitherto failed to do .

		They have a good inherited tradition ; we have cared so little for ours that we have lost it altogether .

		Mr.
Henry Fuller	PERSON	, who has recently been saying some unpalatable things about our lack of artistic aptitudes , would prob - ably observe -LRB- in his not too serious way -RRB- that it is not in us , racially or temperamentally , really to care for dramatic art , or to foster it in the fashion of the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	peoples .

		Per - haps it is not ; but the experiment is worth try - ing , and as long as it remains untried , we shall have hopes .

		The saving element of the situa - tion may not impossibly come from the fact that we are not as English a people as our name implies ; that we have so much admixture of other strains as to make the case a new one , not to be judged by the analogies of the past .

		Our immigrants often practice segregation themselves , but their children become pretty well blended into the common American nation - ality , and who can tell a priori just what apti - tudes and potentialities will characterize the resulting race .

		What we want of our stage , and what we believe will be given us at no distant day , at least in our largest cities , by endowment or otherwise , is , in a word , this : We want a play - house with no stars , no popular successes , no waste in the form of expensive unessentials .

		We want upon the boards of this playhouse a body of trained and conscientious actors , capa - ble of playing many parts every year , bound to the institution both by loyalty to its funda - mental idea and by such material inducements as shall insure an honorable career and a com - fortable retirement .

		We want this playhouse to have a repertory of the most varied sort , catholic enough to include every genre of mer - itorious dramatic writing , but rigorously ex - cluding what is sensational , childish , or merely vulgar .

		We want it to present the classical drama of English and foreign literatures fre - quently enough to give those who wish it an opportunity to become acquainted with the mas - terpieces of ancient and modern dramatic art .

		We want it to be constantly on the lookout for promising works by new writers , extending to them the frankest recognition , yet never mak - ing a fad of any one of them , or any school of them .

		We want it to be both grave and gay , a place to which we may resort for diversion
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 and for edification alike .

		We want it to be a place in which young persons may learn some - thing about life , and acquire standards of taste , yet a place from which young persons should sometimes be excluded , not by administrative prescription , but rather by the judgment and discrimination of their elders .

		Finally , we want it to be a place in which , while nothing is neg - lected that will heighten the legitimate interest of the drama , ideas shall be paramount to all other considerations in the selection and the mounting of the pieces to be produced .

		It does not seem to us that the plan thus out - lined is beyond the range of the immediately practicable .

		In
New York	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	cer - tainly , in
Boston	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	possibly , the public that desires such a theatre is large enough to justify its establishment .

		There must be thousands of people in those cities who would support such a theatre to the extent of from ten to
one hundred dollars	MONEY	each , every year .

		What is needed is the organizing power neces - sary to bring these people into cooperation , with possibly the stimulus of the provisional gift of a site and a building .

		We notice that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, while commenting on the whole favorably upon this suggestion , seems to think that the well-to-do class of people who would control the management of such a theatre might impose a censorship inimical to the free devel - opment of the drama . ''

		In a theatre founded or controlled by them , no play criticising or satirizing society could be favored , '' he says , and instances '' An Enemy of the People , '' `` Arms and the Man , '' `` Die
Weber	PERSON	, '' and '' Die Ehre , '' as plays that could not hope for pre - sentation .

		This seems to us the merest bug - bear , and the force of the criticism is certainly not increased by the reference to '' what has happened in some of our higher institutions of learning . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	makes a much hap - pier suggestion when he finds an analogy between the subscription theatre and the sub - scription lecture organizations which exist in many parts of the country , and which , for a moderate fee , give themselves '' the pleasure of seven or eight lectures during the season , from men who are allowed to speak their minds .

		With a subscription of twenty-five dollars they could have as many plays , from dramatists who also spoke their minds ; and if the experi - ment were tried in ten or twenty places , we should have at once a free theatre , where good work could make that appeal to the public which it can now do only on almost impossi - ble terms . ''

		THE '' DIAL '' OF 1840-45 .

		There is hardly a more interesting episode in the history of American periodical literature than that formed by the conception , rise , and fall of the mag - azine called '' The Dial , '' covering the period from
1840	DATE	to
1845	DATE	.

		This short-lived hopeful of litera - ture is not to be ranked with the ephemera , but holds some such place in the history of American magazines as the young
Marcellus	PERSON	and Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	occupy in the history of men : fascinating the imagination by the appeal of brilliant promise , early death , and pathetic unfulnlments .

		Like that other renowned periodical , '' The Germ , '' which was started on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	just a de - cade later , it began as the organ of a coterie .

		What '' The Germ '' was to Pre -
Raphael !	PERSON

		tism in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, that '' The Dial '' was to Transcendentalism in
New England	LOCATION	.

		If the first issue of '' The Germ '' contained
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Blessed Damozel , '' '' The Dial '' was launched with the equally characteristic though less precious freight of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's '' Prob - lem '' and '' Woodnotes . ''

		One aimed to be the germ , the other to be the dial of '' a movement . '' ''

		The Dial '' began as the organ of a coterie and a movement , and it never became anything more .

		It was never , in fact , successful in meeting the intel - lectual necessities , even of those with whom it orig - inated .

		Yet , on account of the very impracticable and too ambitious character of its aspirations , it all the more typified and expressed the movement with which it was connected .

		To some of its promoters , indeed , it seemed to fly too high ; to others it seemed of the earth , too earthy .

		Its plans were broad and diverse , but its material capital was very limited ; and , while aspiring to give expression to all sides of the restless activities of mind and spirit which drew to - gether
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Alcott	LOCATION	,
Parker	PERSON	, and other divergent sympathizers , it was frequently compelled to print what it could get or depend largely on the writing of some individual , now one and now another .

		Thus , it failed of the breadth aimed at , while at the same time it lacked unity and consecutiveness of character and purpose .

		As a result , the ambitious Protean flopped about mightily for four years , and then expired .

		In its giant throes it showed as many brilliant colors as the dolphin ; but it was out of water from the first , and seems never to have had in it the possi - bility of living .

		The natural desire which enthusiasm has for sympathy and for expression resulted in the forma - tion , at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, in
1836	DATE	, of a club of the more independent thinkers and vigorous spirits who then and there came across one another .

		Transcendental - ism , as it has long been called , had been in the air for some time .

		A number of youthful enthusiasts , readers of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	, the first apostles of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and ardent students of Ger - man philosophy , young fellows of unusual brilliancy and intellectual aggressiveness , graduated from Har - vard College in the years from
1832	DATE	to
1836	DATE	.

		Many of them were budding Unitarian preachers .

		Most 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, of them were looking for greater spirituality than had hitherto been characteristic of American thought .

		Their interests were varied theological , social , political , literary ; but this they had in common , that they were young , enthusiastic , generous , and strongly American .

		They wanted '' life , '' and wanted it `` more abundantly '' than it had been vouchsafed them in the conventional religion and literature of the times .

		These young theorizers naturally looked about for an opportunity to express themselves in their own way , which was , in general , a new way , a free way , and not in accord with the spirit and method of the established journals .

		Thus , among them the subject of a literary club which should publish a magazine of its own became a sub - ject of correspondence as early as
1833	DATE	.

		This dis - cussion grew animated in
1835	DATE	; but subsided with the removal to
Bangor	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, of the Rev.
F. H. Hedge	PERSON	, who had corresponded freely with
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	upon the subject .

		It was after the bi-centennial celebration of Har -
vard College	ORGANIZATION	, in
1836	DATE	, that
Emerson	LOCATION	, Hedge , Rip - ley , and Putnam , four young Unitarian ministers , got into some discussion of the narrow tendencies of thought in the churches .

		They '' talked the matter over at length '' ; and this consultation led to another , the following
September	DATE	, at the house of
George Ripley	PERSON	in
Boston	LOCATION	, where they were reinforced by
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, 0 .


A. Brownson	PERSON	, and others , among them two remarkable women ,
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	and
Elizabeth Peabody	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thus began the meetings of an informal club , afterwards known among its members as '' The Hedge Club . ''

		It was also occasionally known , as in
Alcott	LOCATION	's diary , as the '' Symposium , '' and to the world at large its mem - bers were herded under the title of '' The Trans - cendentalists . ''

		For some years the club continued to meet in a peripatetic way , now at
Concord	LOCATION	, with
Emerson	PERSON	; now , for the sake of Dr.
Convers Francis	PERSON	, in
Watertown	LOCATION	; and sometimes in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The idea of a journal was in their thoughts from the first , and was urged with especial vigor by
Alcott	PERSON	, who desired an outlet for his '' Orphic Say - ings , '' and other idealistic and Delphic '' Scrip - tures . ''

		A model was found in the `` New Monthly Magazine , '' published in
England	LOCATION	by an eccentric character , one
Heraud	PERSON	, who was ridiculed by
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, and `` forgiven '' by
J. S. Mill	PERSON	, '' for interpreting the universe , now that I find he can not pronounce the < h 's . ' ''

		The fact that this periodical made a shift to live seems to have nour - ished the hopes of
Alcott	PERSON	and others for a journal of the '' Spiritual Philosophy . ''

		Frequent mention of the new organ occurs toward the close of
1839	DATE	, and '' the proposed ' Dial , ' '' a title which
Alcott	PERSON	used for parts of his diary , was discussed by Mar - garet Fuller at the '' Symposium '' of
September 18	DATE	.

		The urgent efforts of Mr.
Brownson	PERSON	to merge the enterprise with his ''
Boston	LOCATION	Quarterly , '' and , instead of publishing '' The Dial , '' to open the pages of the `` Quarterly '' to these new writers , was rejected , apparently because
Brownson	PERSON	's review was '' pledged to a party in politics , '' and took '' too narrow ground both in philosophy and literature . ''

		A letter of
Miss Fuller	ORGANIZATION	's , dated
January 1 , 1840	DATE	, and addressed to the Rev.
W. H. Channing	PERSON	, speaks of the first number as practically assured for
April 1	DATE	.

		She concludes : '' At
Newport	ORGANIZATION	you prophesied a new literature : shall it dawn in
1840	DATE	? ''

		During the next few months we find her industriously whipping in the contributors ; and though this was not accom - plished in time to publish in
April	DATE	, the prospectus came out early in
May	DATE	, and the first number was issued
July 1	DATE	, from the press of Messrs. Weeks ,
Jordan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, under the editorship of
Miss Fuller	ORGANIZATION	, with
George Ripley	PERSON	as assistant .

		The first number of `` The Dial '' contained an `` Introduction to the Readers '' by
Emerson	PERSON	, and two poems , one of them his now familiar poem be - ginning , '' I like a church , I like a cowl . ''

		There were also two poems by
Thoreau	LOCATION	; poems by
Emerson	PERSON	's brother and sister ; an article of thirteen pages on '' The Divine Presence in Nature and the Soul , '' by
Theodore Parker	PERSON	; several poems by
C. P. Cranch	PERSON	and others ; a reyiew of
Brownson	PERSON	's writings by
Ripley	LOCATION	; Chapter I. of Channing 's '' Ernest the Seeker '' ;
Alcott	PERSON	's `` Orphic Sayings '' ; half a dozen articles , mostly critical , by Miss Fuller herself ; and some others .

		As time went on , one or two con - tributors were added to the list ; but this volume may be considered as fairly typical .

		Lowell , later , gave them a few sonnets ;
W. E. Channing contri	PERSON	- buted some of his verses and was discussed in a crit - ical notice in the second number .


James Freeman Clarke	PERSON	, also , wrote for some of the later numbers .

		Few were satisfied with the first number of '' The Dial . ''

		In the first place , there were some melan - choly errors in typography one of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's poems was especially mangled .

		Naturally , also , there were , even among transcendentalists , degrees of transcen - dentalism .

		Alcott , for example , represented the ex - treme of mysticism , and wanted too much of what
Carlyle	PERSON	called a '' potato-philosophy . ''

		There was not sufficient departure from accepted standards and conventional modes of expression to suit him .

		He wrote , in the true '' Orphic '' vein , to Heraud : '' ' The Dial ' partakes of our vices , it consults the mood and is awed somewhat by the bearing of existing orders , yet it is superior to our other literary organs , and satisfies , in part , the hunger of our youth .

		It satis - fies me not , nor
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		It measures not the meri - dian , but the morning ray ; the nations wait for the gnomon that shall mark the broad noon . ''

		The dan - ger from
Alcott	LOCATION	and other less eccentric , but also less able ultra-transcendentalists , was , that they should cast discredit on the entire enterprise , by their ab - surd impracticalities .

		The `` Orphic Sayings '' of Alcott were , of course , the especial butt of those who were inclined to poke fun , and were much parodied . ''

		The worst of these , '' says Mr.
T. W. Higginson	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	composedly pasted into his diary , indexing them , with his accustomed thorough - ness and neatness , as ` Parodies on Orphic Sayings . ' ''

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 299 But the editors found it necessary to suppress '' the first man Pythagoras would ask for if he came to
Concord	LOCATION	, '' and , as kindly and judiciously as possi - ble , '' held him down . ''


Theodore Parker	PERSON	furnished , perhaps , the oppo - site extreme from
Alcott	LOCATION	.

		His work was solid virile common-sense , and looked , for the most part , to the practical application of ideas to life .

		What his ideas were he showed later on in his ''
Massachu	PERSON	- setts Quarterly Review . ''

		This was to be , he said , '' a ' Dial ' with a beard '' ; somebody else has said that it was '' a beard without anything else . ''

		Nev - ertheless ,
Parker	PERSON	's work was more calculated to '' take '' than that of any of the others , not except - ing
Emerson	PERSON	, who is reported to have said himself that
Parker	PERSON	's articles '' sold the numbers . ''

		It is rather interesting to note that the only early '' Dial '' to which
Parker	PERSON	contributed nothing should have been the one to fall into the hands of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, elic - iting this criticism : '' The ' Dial , ' too , it is all spirit - like , aeriform , aurora-borealis-like .

		Will no Angel body himself out of that ; no stalwart Yankee man with color in the cheeks of him , and a coat on his back ? ''

		Emerson evidently saw and regretted this tendency of '' The Dial '' people to fire in the air ; among other things to the same effect , he said in his diary : `` It ought to contain the best advice on the topics of government , temperance , abolition , trade , and domestic life .

		... It ought to go straight into life with the devoted wisdom of the best men in the land .

		It should should it not ?

		be a de - gree nearer to the hodiernal facts than my writings are .

		I wish to write pure mathematics , and not a culinary almanac or application of science to the arts . ''

		The force of this conviction ,
Emerson	PERSON	was to have an opportunity of testing , much against his desires . ''

		The Dial '' passed into his hands at the end of its second year .

		The strain of the editorship had been more than
Miss Fuller	ORGANIZATION	could bear .

		She was at this time compelled to make her living ; but '' The Dial '' was not so much a bread-winner as a bread-loser .

		At the end of two years she prepared , with much regret , to give up the struggle , and wrote to
Emer	PERSON	- son that unless he or
Parker	PERSON	should be willing to become responsible for the periodical it must surely go to the ground .

		Parker was quite unable to incur the obligation , and as
Emerson	PERSON	would not `` will - ingly let it die , '' rather than have it fall into the hands of the Canaanites he concluded to try it for a time .

		During the two years that it continued to live , he was its banker , editor , and chief con - tributor .

		After '' The Dial '' passed into
Emerson	PERSON	's hands ,
Thoreau	PERSON	contributed more and more liberally , and finally turned to prose , where he for the first time struck his best vein .

		Parker 's devotion to the mag - azine had been largely a tribute to Miss Fuller ; to her assistance he had come with greater and greater vigor toward the close of her incumbency .

		The table of contents of her last number shows him to have written a good part of that issue .

		After she was relieved by
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Parker	PERSON	's contribu - tions fell off rapidly , and
Thoreau	PERSON	forged into his place .

		In spite of the loss of
Parker	PERSON	, however , one seems to see a slight change toward a more substantial and helpful dealing with the real problems of life which it was the opinion of Emerson '' The Dial '' ought to undertake .

		In some cases , to be sure as , for example , in his essay on '' Agriculture in
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts '' one is rather humorously aware of the conscious effort to deal with practical matters in a practical way .

		Emerson , trying to carry himself jauntily whilst giving advice to farmers about whether they shall sell their cows in the autumn or in the
spring	DATE	, is not conducive to gravity .

		Much of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's best work , both prose and verse , was first published in '' The Dial , '' for the sake of keeping the thing on its feet , when he might profitably have published elsewhere .

		Of his reviews and shorter criticisms , written especially for '' The Dial , '' not so much can be said in the way of praise .

		Their quality is considerably below that of the pieces which were written for other purposes and after - ward found their way into the pages of the struggling magazine .

		Emerson was not at his best as a re - viewer .

		In dealing with characteristics , and the salient features of a great artist 's spiritual message , he is himself great ; but in criticism of the minuter sort , in dealing with technique and those matters which appertain to art , he betrays frequently a sur - prising weakness .

		Often , too , he fails of the dis - tinction of manner which attends him on other subjects .

		In fact , if anything tends to weaken the general tone of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's literary criticism , it is that he condescends to deal occasionally in the con - ventional euphuisms of the reviewer , the polite inanity of which
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	so early washed his hands .

		There is more than a touch of this in
Emerson	LOCATION	's mild characterization of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's '' remarkable style . ''

		When he comes to modern literature , he sometimes lacks proportion , and can speak in the same breath of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Felicia Hemans	PERSON	.

		As a rule , how - ever ,
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	is superior to these weaknesses , and usually his humorous good sense stands by him manfully against the assault of whole battalions of the nonsense and freakishness of that senti - mental time .

		The fight to keep afloat such a periodical as '' The Dial '' proved more than
Emerson	PERSON	could stand , and after a losing battle of two years he also gave it up .

		He left the pumps , and the water-logged craft dove to the bottom .

		The difficulties of successfully con - ducting such a magazine were well-nigh insuperable .

		It was a constant drain on
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	.

		It never suc - ceeded in paying anything either to editors or con - tributors , and had only twelve copies for free dis - tribution .

		Frequently these gratuitous compositions would fail to come to hand as promised , and then the editors were compelled to fill in the gaps with their '' ready pen , '' since the scissors were not to be The unfortunate number which fell under 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the bilious eye of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	was a particularly slim one , got out , under great strain , by Miss Fuller , who '' wrote eighty-five of its one hundred and thirty-six pages . ''

		These difficulties , of course , account to a consid - erable degree for the shortcomings of '' The Dial , '' its lack of unity , its frequent haziness , its repetitions and its lack of consecutiveness ; account , in short , for its want of that indispensable thing , distinct character as a periodical .

		Many magazines of infe - rior power have been better organized and have exhibited more individuality in themselves , with far less to draw upon in their several contributors .

		Yet on the whole it must be said , probably , that the failure of '' The Dial '' was more the fault of the times than of the managers or the contributors .

		That its spiritual aim was too high or too bold to enlist the interest of any large class of Americans of that time is fairly evident .

		Certainly '' the Transcen - dentalists '' were not a large contingent in American society in 1840-45 . ''

		The Dial '' was undoubtedly '' the precious life-blood , '' if not '' of a master spirit '' at least of a great many '' remarkable '' writers , and it quickened the veins of many others ; but it was rather intended to do its work by being '' treasured up to a life beyond life '' than by an immediate effect on the organs of society in its own time .

		A PUBLISHER 'S PROTEST .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
March 16	DATE	appears an article entitled '' Author and Publisher , '' upon which I trust you will allow me to comment .

		I pass by the fact that it repro - duces in all their vague recklessness the vaguest and most reckless statements of Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	.

		To polemise against these were worse than useless .

		But , luckily or unluckily , a couple of very definite assertions are risked , and it is these I wish to challenge .

		I quote the ipsissima verba of the article : '' If it is practically certain that a thousand copies of any book of the ordinary sort will find purchasers , there is no risk in its publication . ''

		Obviously it must be meant that it is practically certain that the thousand copies will find purchasers , and that a sale of one thousand copies is sufficient to cover ex - penses .

		Now , in the first place , a vast number of works are printed in editions of less than 1000 , in editions of 750 , 500 , or even 250 .

		I enclose a catalogue of my publica - tions , in which I have marked with a cross books of which less than 1000 have been printed , in the majority of cases editions of 500 .

		So far , then , from its being pos - sible to count upon a sale of
1000	DATE	for works of this class , one does not dream of doing so ; on the contrary , one makes one 's calculations upon the basis that a sale of 300 copies will cover prime outlay , and , let me add , one is frequently disappointed in one 's expectation , sell - ing perhaps 150 or 200 only , instead of the estimated 300 .

		It is quite evident that for books of this kind 50 copies more or less may make all the difference between profit and loss ; equally evident that however carefully the publisher makes his calculations he can not be sure of selling up to the required limit , and therefore must take a risk which in the case of a 2 2s .

		or 3 3s .

		book may easily run into a large sum .

		I know what will be answered .

		Such books , it will be asserted , are published on commission only .

		I can only say that nine out of every ten of the books I have marked in my catalogue with a cross , to indicate that less than 1000 were printed , are published solely at my risk , without any help or subsidy whatsoever .

		And I could cite many of an even more scholarly and abstruse nature than certain of my publications ; e. g. , Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	's edi - tion of
Pausanias	LOCATION	, the cost of production of which is borne wholly by the publisher .

		Then it will be said , '' Oh , but the statement applies to ordinary books , '' and the books you , Mr.
Nutt	PERSON	, publish , and the class of books you have in view , are not ordinary books ; they are books for the select few , for the scholar and the book-lover , not for the man in the street . ''

		Very well .

		Then I ask what is meant by an ordinary book ?

		And , so far as I can see , the answer must be : a book which is practically certain to sell to the extent of 1000 copies , and the sale of
1000	DATE	copies of which is certain to pay prime outlay .

		In which case , I submit , the bold assertion on which I comment becomes a singularly inept La Palissade .

		In the second place , just as the
1000	DATE	copy limit of sale is meaningless as applied to certain books because the calculations respecting them are made on a 300 to 500 sale basis , so it is equally meaningless when applied to the still vaster class of popular -LRB- which should be ordinary -RRB- books which can not bring in profit until the sales have reached figures of from 3000 to 20,000 .

		In the case of perhaps the majority of illustrated children 's books , and of educational works , the sale of
1000	DATE	copies would be insufficient to cover the illustrator 's or the editor 's fee , let alone other expenses .

		And books of this class are , to the extent of ninety per cent , publishers ' ventures .

		Here again , it is , I think , obvious that if profit calculations have to be made on the basis of sales running into thousands , it is absolutely impossible to avoid a certain amount nay , a considerable amount of risk .

		So far , my criticism of the first assertion to which I take exception .

		The fact is , I venture to think , that the writer of the article , like Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	him - self , has in view a single class of book only : the medium - priced novel or hack-library book , biography , essays , or what not , books in which the elements of cost are almost exclusively paper , print , binding , and in the case of which the authors depend for their remuneration upon royalties .

		I should think it likely that with books of this class the
1000	DATE	copy limit of sale may be appli - cable .

		But in the case of works of erudition , of beau - tifully illustrated books , of popular educational works , of popular gift and children 's books , that limit is wholly inapplicable , either because such a sale never can be reached , or because it must be largely exceeded .

		And my complaint against Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, and against the writer of '' Author and Publisher , '' is that they keep their eyes fixed upon the least deserving , the least intrinsically valuable , portion of the total output of books current hack-fiction to the utter neglect of the abiding , the vitally essential elements of literature .

		And this brings me to the second count of my indict - ment .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's emphatic declaration that '' the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301 method of the future in publishing is one which treats the publisher as an agent working upon commission , who will take none but commission books , who will take his commission , and no more , '' is quoted with en - tire gravity and apparent approval .

		Yet can anything be more outrageously silly ?

		Even if the large class of collective publications encyclopaedias , dictionaries , and the like , where obviously the commission principle be applied be left out of account , and only individual work be considered , does Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, does the writer of '' Author and Publisher , '' really think that the average man of science , college professor , local histo - rian , jurist , theologian , or medical man , is willing or is able to bear the cost of bringing the result of his labors before the world ?

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's example is quoted , in ignorance , I would fain believe , of the true import of his testimony .

		For Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	has put it on record -LRB- I quote his own words -RRB- : '' The losses I suffered my - self were great , and continued for many years . ''

		How many scholars would be able , how many willing , to face '' great and continued loss for many years '' ?

		And what a comment upon the glib statement that there is no risk in publishing !

		One of the foremost philosophers of the century has to wait for years , has to risk great loss , before he derives profit from his books .

		Supposing he had died with his task but half achieved -LRB- and pre - mature death has caused many a publishing venture to fail -RRB- , it is safe to say that the losses Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	speaks of never would have been converted into a balance on the right side .

		The average scholar can not count ' upon combining in himself genius , long life , and a hand - some private income .

		I can only speak with certainty of my own publica - tions , but I can most certainly affirm that if I had waited to be '' commissioned '' I should never have published the '' Tudor Translations , '' or
Sommer	PERSON	's edition of the `` Morte Darthur , '' or the `` Grimm Library , '' or the '' Tudor Library , '' or '' Painter 's Palace of Pleasure , '' or the '' Bibliotheque de Carabas , '' or , in fact , ninety-nine out of every one hundred books I have published .

		I am always looking for the intelligent author who will publish on commission .

		But in the very nature of things the majority of authors are not and can not be capitalists , and publishing more than any other manu - facturing business requires capital .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's '' method of the future '' would prevent the publication of nearly every book that is worth publishing at all .

		-LSB- Mr.
Nutt	PERSON	forestalls our rejoinder to his main contention .

		When we spoke of '' any book of the ordinary sort '' it was with the express purpose of excluding the classes of books which we quite agree with him in thinking would require a larger sale than 1000 copies to prove profitable ventures .

		Nor had we the remotest intention of implying that works of the special and scholarly class illustrated by Mr.
Nutt	PERSON	's own catalogue were likely to sell to the extent of
1000	DATE	copies .

		As for his grievance that we quote Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	'' with entire grav - ity and apparent approval , '' we can only say that the approval is not so '' apparent '' as he thinks , but that Sir
Walter	PERSON	's opinions are entitled to at least as respectful a consideration as are those of his pub - lisher-critics .

		GREAT GENERALS nsr BLUE AND GRAY .

		*
Thomas Jonathan Jackson	PERSON	occupies a pecu - liar place among the heroes of American his - tory .

		As the story of the great Civil War is being told , in these days when the passions of a generation ago are forgotten and the intensely partisan volumes of contemporary writers are revised with a cooler judgment , the worth of this great soldier of the
Lost Cause	ORGANIZATION	becomes increasingly apparent .

		No one can estimate what a power for good in healing the wounds of a fratricidal strife one thought has been : If an intensely earnest , devoted Christian man like u Stonewall ''
Jackson	PERSON	believed in the jus - ness of the contention of the South and was willing to give his life for his convictions , then no one from the other side has the right to make sweeping condemnation of '' rebels '' and '' traitors '' without a fair and unbiased exam - ination of the questions at issue in the great contest which nearly severed the bonds of American union .

		Some such thought as this must explain the welcome given to the two noble volumes by
Colonel Henderson	ORGANIZATION	, in which , with grace of lit - erary style and wealth of graphic aid , he has attempted the interpretation of the life of a great commander .

		Himself learned in military lore , no better one could have been chosen to paint the portrait of a general who took with him into the field the invaluable treasures of a well-ordered mind enriched by years of study of the achievements of the world 's leading sol - diers .

		In the twelve hundred pages , besides the thread of the life-story of
Jackson	LOCATION	, the reader will find many a paragraph that will stimulate careful thought , many a bright phrase that will illumine the darkness of conflict , many a brilliant description that will charm .

		There can be no doubt that this work will be the standard biography of
Jackson	LOCATION	, and that , there - fore , the literature of the Civil War has received a notable addition .

		could tell the details of the career of this sol - dier of the South without feeling his heart warm with enthusiasm toward one who was intensely popular , although his life throughout was char - acterized by rigid reserve , whose student 's na - ture gave him self-control , who manifested tact in many a critical moment because of this self - possession , who cared little for the praise of his fellow men , and who seemed to enjoy surround - ing himself and his plans with a veil of deep mystery .

		In boyhood and youth , in the train - ing days of the Mexican War , and in the cam - paigns of the
Valley	LOCATION	, wherever
Jackson	PERSON	appeared he was a power .

		His brain worked for others ; he did the thinking and oftentimes the doing as well .

		Perhaps the facts sustain such a notion , but there is such a fascination in the narrative that one who seeks to criticise is led to wonder whether this uniformity of laudation may not be a defect of judgment , the presence of which should lead to a closer examination of state - ments about other men and things which are interwoven into the story .

		It is probable , also , that no one could tell the details of the career of
Jackson	PERSON	without being in sympathy with the cause for which he fought and died .

		When one is gone , the tes - timony of a friend is more to be desired than the tribute of an enemy .

		A Northerner , in these days of reconciliation and reunion , might write appreciatively of a Southern general , might give him due credit for honesty of pur - pose , for skill in strategy , for valor in conflict ; and yet there would be the certain bias of one who was reared under different conditions and with opposing fundamental notions .

		In like manner , if in any part of this work there is ap - pearance of too great praise for the Southern leaders and too much sympathy for the Confed - eracy , the unpleasant thought will come that this intensity of feeling may prevent that impartial examination of facts which an alien might be expected to make when studying military move - ments in the light of sober history , with a defi - nite view of contributing to the literature of warfare rather than to that of partisanship .

		It is more than likely that a writer who had had soldierly training and military sympathies would far better express the true estimate of the life of a great general than any civilian possibly could do .

		At the same time , in case of conflict between the military authorities and the civil , the bias of personal opinion and tech - nical training would certainly operate in cloud - ing the judgment to some degree .

		In every war there are times when the desires of the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 803 civil authority go counter to the views of the military .

		Sometimes time shows that the civil arm was to blame ; sometimes the reverse is true .

		In
Jackson	PERSON	's career , as in that of many a general of the Civil War , there were occa - sions when the feeling between these two forms of authority was intense .

		No one needs to read far in
Colonel Henderson	ORGANIZATION	's volumes in order to find the strength of his opinion that the civil authorities are too apt to interfere with generals in the field , and that things would go much better were the military authorities to be given entire control .

		There are many who would contend that history does not sustain the cor - rectness of such a view .

		Having now a writer who has become thor - oughly imbued with the idea of the nobility of character of his subject , who either had a pre - viously formed conception of the justice of that hero 's cause or reached such a conclusion after a sympathetic study , and who has the military bent of mind , the inevitable tendency will be that the heroic element will be made too prom - inent , and that every obstacle will give way before the mighty genius which
Providence	LOCATION	has determined shall triumph .

		No matter how over - whelming the odds , victory will be sure to come ; or , if it fails , will be prevented only because of the want of hearty cooperation on the part of someone else .

		These seem to be the lines of criticism along which the volumes devoted to Stonewall Jack - son may be , perhaps harshly , reviewed .

		But there is a sense in which these criticisms only increase the praise due the author .

		One feels that the history of a life is presented from the standpoint of that life .

		The reader here sees things as
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	saw them .

		He understands how the problem of slavery ap - peared to a thoughtful man of the South .

		In the words of Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	: '' He found the institution a responsible and trouble - some one , and I have heard him say that he would prefer to see the negroes free , but he believed that slavery was sanctioned by the Creator himself , who maketh men to differ , and instituted laws for the bond and free .

		He therefore accepted slavery as it existed in the South , not as a thing desirable in itself , but as allowed by
Providence	LOCATION	for ends which it was not his business to determine . ''

		The reader understands how it came about that men believed that injustice was done them in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and were willing to fight and die , if necessary , to sustain their convictions when once deliberately formed .

		The point of view can be appreciated , even if the arguments given do not seem decisive .

		The chapter on the causes of the war does not give attention to many topics which were influential in bring - ing about the struggle .

		Statements are made which are to be taken with much allowance .

		There is apparent inconsistency in places , as , for example , where the old fear of slave insurrection is used to warrant rebellion after the election of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	; while , ten pages later , the safety of the women and chil - dren in the midst of war 's alarms , when only the slaves were near , is used to show the false - ness of any such ideas of the wrong treatment of slaves as were set forth in `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin . ''

		A reasonable argument for the justification of the South in rebellion is sought in many pages , and then much of truth is hinted at inci - dentally in a single paragraph : '' It is impossible to determine how far the profes - sional politician was responsible for the Civil War .

		But when we recall the fact that secession followed close on the overthrow of a faction which had long monopolized the spoils of office , and that this faction found compen - sation in the establishment of a new government , it is not easy to resist the suspicion that the secession move - ment was neither more nor less than a conspiracy hatched by a clever and unscrupulous cabal . ''

		The volumes under consideration are remark - ably strong in two respects .

		They set forth a striking picture of
Jackson	PERSON	as a man , and they show the value of strategy in warfare .

		Because
Jackson	PERSON	was so successful as a strategist , he probably appealed to the author as one of the best of characters around whom might be woven the arguments for the most careful study of military science .

		The man appears everywhere . ''

		He never smoked , he was a strict teetotaller , and he never touched a card . ''

		He was '' as exact as the multiplication table , and as full of things mil - itary as an arsenal . '' ''

		Few detected beneath that quiet demeanor and absent manner , the existence of energy incarnate and an iron will . '' ''

		As the playful tenderness he displayed at home was never suspected , so the consuming earnestness , the absolute fearlessness , whether of danger or responsibility , the utter disregard of man , and the unquestioning faith in the
Almighty	LOCATION	, which made up the individuality which men called
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	, remained hidden from all but one '' -LRB- his wife -RRB- .

		Such brief extracts show glimpses of the man as he appeared to his fellows .

		As to his skill in strategy , there is need for little comment .

		He was an ardent admirer of
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	.

		He studied his cam - paigns with eagerness .

		He noted particularly 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the '' swiftness , daring , and energy of his move - ments . ''

		One paragraph will suffice : '' With God 's blessing -LRB- this was a favorite phrase with him -RRB- let us make thorough work of it . '

		When once he had joined battle , no loss , no suffering was permitted to stay his hand .

		He never dreamed of retreat until he had put in his last reserve .

		Yet his victories were won rather by sweat than blood , by skilful manoeuvring rather than sheer hard fighting . '

		I had rather lose one man in marching than five in battle , ' and in order to achieve an easy triumph his men were marched till they dropped in scores .

		But the marches which strewed the wayside with the footsore and the weaklings won his battles .

		The enemy , surprised and outnumbered , was practically beaten before a shot was fired , and success was attained at a trifling cost . ''

		The story of
George Gordon Meade	PERSON	suffers by comparison with the splendid narrative by
Colonel Henderson	PERSON	, and yet there are many points of similarity .

		The early experiences of the two future generals of the Rebellion were much the same .

		Each followed his prelimin - ary training at West Point with service in the Mexican War , and this similarity of experience has naturally produced a similarity of treatment on the part of the two widely separated writers .

		Each has decided views regarding the superior worth of strategy in warfare , and each reaches the conclusion stated in the words of Colonel Henderson : '' Providence is more inclined to side with the big brains than with the big bat - talions . ''

		It is exceedingly interesting to compare the views of the two authors as set forth in the
Jackson	PERSON	life under the chapter heading '' Se - cession '' and in the
Meade	PERSON	story under '' The Cause of the Civil War '' and in a second chap - ter entitled '' Truths and Popular Errors Re - garding the Civil War . ''

		The parallelism might be further illustrated by a reference to the numerous maps and plans furnished by each work , the
Meade	PERSON	biography being illustrated by twenty-two diagrams , some of them , how - ever , lacking the clearness of delineation de - sired by the student ; and the
Jackson	PERSON	volumes by over thirty similar graphic helps .

		In style , however , Mr.
Bache	PERSON	lacks the clear - ness of his contemporary .

		The sentences are often involved and the phrases stilted .

		It is somewhat difficult to read passage after passage , where the thought is expressed in the style of this selected sentence : '' The absurdities which the contemplation of a mul - titude of sovereign states , without marked geographical boundaries , which have lived for nearly a century to - gether the common life of a nation , coupled with the right of secession at any time , exhibit to us , are infinite . ''

		This life of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	, being the first one in a generation since the war , might have been made a model , truth and error being separated in the cold light of dispassionate recital .

		Laudation of an uncle by a nephew might be expected , but a few sentences will indicate the spirit which seems to mark the volume .

		It was
Sheridan	PERSON	's '' habitual practice never to blench from claiming more than the merit in whatever he was concerned '' -LRB- page 36 -RRB- .

		McClellan was '' A man without the poise that is capable of directing to great deeds ... Put to the actual test of war , and suspicions of his shortcomings for his task beginning to invade the sober common-sense of the people , not to be in the long run deceived as to what concerns them nearly , some abatement of this arrogance became perceptible , although he still had so false a view of his relations as a military man to the civil power that he could reconcile himself to writing to the President a letter unprece - dented in its assumption of ability to counsel in a sphere the threshold of which he should not have touched '' -LRB- page 173 -RRB- .


Halleck	PERSON	, too , receives such compliments as the following : ''
Halleck	PERSON	... made progress so slow towards Cor - inth , in
Mississippi	LOCATION	, moving fifteen miles in six weeks , that the enemy availed himself of the ample time placed at his disposal to evacuate the place with all his mate - rial , and leave only the husks of victory behind .

		Yet
Halleck	PERSON	was the general who , from
Washington	LOCATION	, subse - quently told
McClellan	PERSON	that his men did not march enough for exercise ... His generalship , however , had not , as we have seen , prevented
Halleck	PERSON	from being called to
Washington	LOCATION	as general-in-chief of the armies of the United States '' -LRB- page 249 -RRB- .

		Perhaps it is unnecessary to give further illustrations .

		One general after another is treated in such frank manner .

		One after an - other is given trial only to fail .

		Finally from the mists of defeat and demoralization and de - spair the true hero -LRB-
Meade	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- emerges , and from that auspicious moment mistakes are few and difficulties are trifles .

		Getting such an impression of the tone of mind of the author , the result of examination is disappointing . ''

		The alternative which has been discarded always seems to have extraordin - ary fascination for the average human mind , so easy is it to demonstrate success of the thing not tried . ''

		Such is the text which serves to illus - trate the truth that
Meade	PERSON	was right and that all his critics were wrong , and if that statement be not accepted as convincing , then let every critic beware , or each will be treated with such stinging comment as is given one or two mild opponents of
General Meade	ORGANIZATION	's policy .

		Returning once again , for a moment , to a comparison of the two works reviewed , the reader feels that
Colonel Henderson	PERSON	is partial
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 to his hero , but this partiality is evidently the result of such deep study of the man and his time , that it becomes part of the nature of the writer , who sends his message from the heart .

		In the case of Mr.
Bache	PERSON	, the conviction is strong that the desire to have the last word with a generation of writers about the war , and the over-anxiety to have a great general prop - erly appreciated by posterity , have clouded the judgment to such an extent that , in contro - verted questions , the
Life of General Meade	ORGANIZATION	can scarcely be taken as a safe guide to the anxious seeker after the truth .


FRANCIS W. SHEPARDSON	PERSON	.

		OLD-AGE LETTERS or SAVAGE IIANDOR .

		* Any work bearing the name of Landor would be certain to arouse the expectation of the lit - erary public .

		There are several reasons for this .

		In the world of letters Landor was a unique figure . ''

		I am and will be alone as long as I live , and after , '' he wrote
Brougham	PERSON	; and the judgment thus pronounced upon himself has been accepted as final .

		He was , indeed , a sort of paradox .

		To some , to most perhaps , his manner was rough and crabbed , while to others it seemed imbued with all the affable grace of old-world gallantry ; the air of defi - ance with which he hedged himself in prevented many from seeing that he possessed a delicacy of sentiment almost unparalleled in others ; his childish crochets , his whims , his caprices , were but the cloaks to a larger and nobler nature ; and his slavery to impulse was at least extenu - ated by his kingly contempt for all that was mean and vile and base .

		To this man have been applied more epithets , good and bad , than to any English writer of this century , perhaps of any century .

		Carlyle , who had the ability that genius always has of describing a person or a thing in the word or the phrase which is a dis - covery , summed them all up in his '' unsubdu - able old Roman ! ''

		Always at war with the world , ready to marshall his armies at a mo - ment 's notice , though sometimes borne back by force of numbers and never victorious , he yet never acknowledged defeat .

		He lived and died fighting .

		At times it pleases me to think that , as
Coleridge	PERSON	detected in himself '' a smack of Hamlet , '' so we may detect in Landor a smack of the mad Lear . ''

		The mind of
Lear	PERSON	, ''
Haz	PERSON	- * LETTERS OF
WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR	PERSON	, PRIVATE AND PUBLIC .

		Edited by
Stephen Wheeler	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		Phil - adelphia : J. 8 .

		Lippincott Go .

		litt once said , and what I quote may be ap - plied with almost equal force to the mind of Landor , '' is like a tall ship driven about by the winds , buffeted by the furious waves , but that still rides above the storm , having its anchor fixed in the bottom of the sea ; or it is like the sharp rock circled by the eddying whirl - pool that foams and beats against it , or like the solid promontory pushed from its basis by the force of an earthquake . ''

		And Landor , like
Lear	PERSON	, we remember , was the wizard who dis - turbed the elements .

		The letters of such a man as this , it would seem , ought to be particularly interesting , be - cause in them we should naturally look for some expression of this singular personality .

		But when we open the book before us , the '' Letters of
Walter Savage Landor	PERSON	, '' we meet at the very start with a slight disappointment .

		The title promises rather too much , for the book actually contains only a small part of Landor 's correspondence .

		We have here the letters written by him to Lady Graves-Sawle , before and after her marriage , and to her mother , during the years
1838	DATE	to
1863	DATE	.

		In addition to these letters , which , with the ex - ception , so far as I can find , of only three short extracts printed in Foster 's biography of Lan - dor , have hitherto been unpublished , are reprinted the public letters which Landor ad - dressed to '' The Examiner '' during the years
1838	DATE	to
1855	DATE	.

		These public letters may be dismissed with a word .

		Their tone and point of view are pretty well suggested in the follow - ing passage : '' In my views on politics I have given offense to many good and sensible men .

		Perhaps I may be erroneous in some of my opinions , but is it quite certain that they themselves are exempt from fallibility in all of theirs ?

		Permit me to ask whether they have given proofs to the world of more research , more intellect , more infor - mation , more independence ?

		I come forward , not to offend , but to conduct ; not to quarrel , but to teach ; and I would rather make one man wiser than ten thousand friendly to me ; yet I profess no indifference to the fav - ourable opinion of those writers who influence the public judgment .

		I suspect both of moroseness and of false - hood such as are guilty of this arrogant and contemptu - ous demeanor .

		It is only small dogs that run after the stones cast at them ; and these small dogs , importunate to be petted and prompt at tricks , are of a breed not remarkable for sagacity or fidelity . ''

		Dependent on no party , influenced by none , abstain - ing from the society and conversation of the few public men I happen to be acquainted with , for no other reason than because they are in power and office , I shall con - tinue , so long as I live , to notice the politics and politi - cians which may promote or impede the public welfare . ''

		Not all of these public letters were worth pre - serving , nor are they likely to entertain the 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, general reader .

		Some of them , nevertheless , are manly appeals for justice , and their chief merit , I take it , is to show that
Landor	PERSON	was at all times the friend of the oppressed and the enemy of the oppressor .

		It is the private letters that constitute the more valuable portion of the book .

		As might be supposed , these contain some interesting impressions of men and things .

		A few of these impressions are really good , as this one of
Byron	PERSON	, for instance : '' In
Byron	PERSON	there is much to admire but nothing to imitate : for energy is beyond the limits of imitation . ''

		But more , by far , are of the '' slap-dash '' sort as
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	once characterized them , which are interesting only because they bear the stamp of
Landor	ORGANIZATION	's originality .

		Of this kind are Lan - dor 's statements that Aubrey de Vere 's '' En - glish Misrule and Irish Misdeeds `` is `` a work which unites the wisdom of
Bacon	LOCATION	with the elo - quence of
Burke	PERSON	, '' that '' The world has seen only one man in two thousand years so eloquent as Kossuth , '' that Mrs.
Somerville	PERSON	was '' the most wonderful woman the world ever saw , '' and so on .

		The letters themselves are not as quotable as one familiar with
Landor	ORGANIZATION	's works would ex - pect .

		Of the following extracts , which will serve as well as any , perhaps , to illustrate the author 's manner in this form of invention , the last , if I mistake not , are in a strain somewhat unusual with Landor . ''

		It is a horrible thing to have many literary friends .

		They are apt to fancy that , however your time may be occupied , you must at all events have enough to read what they send you .

		Alas !

		alas !

		There are few who have time enough to read even all the very good books that have been written , old and new ; and who can neglect the good for the bad without compunction and remorse ?

		... In regard to small authors , restless for celebrity , and wriggling on their level walks like worms exposed to the sunshine , I have scarcely ever seen one of these poor creatures who did not at one time excite my smiles , and at another my pity ... When years have stored your mind with observation , you will continue to prefer
Goldsmith	PERSON	to
Bulwer	LOCATION	,
Miss Edgeworth	LOCATION	to
Lady Morgan	LOCATION	, Madame de Se ` vigne ' to Chateaubriand : in other words , the very best to the very worst . '' ''

		There are few of us who do not know how a little grief swells a greater .

		Have you never seen two drops of rain upon a window , where the larger has been qui - escent until the lesser was drawn into it then it dropped . '' ''

		Do not let the fishermen catch all the trout , for they are pretty creatures , and I am delighted to see them playing on the surface of the water .

		The very oldest of them may sometimes be detected in this idle occupation so there is a sort of sympathy between us . '' ''

		You did right in not killing the grouse .

		Let men do these things if they will .

		Perhaps there is no harm in it perhaps it makes them no crueller than they would be otherwise .

		But it is hard to take away what we can not give and life is a pleasant thing at least to birds .

		No doubt the young ones say tender things to one another , and even the old ones do not dream of death . '' ''

		I have been to visit your flowers they are doing well , and the roses I planted seemed glad to see me . ''

		Thoughts like the last hint at the precise value of this collection of letters .

		To begin with , there is no treasure-trove of thought here .

		Two - thirds of the letters were written to a young and inexperienced girl wholly incapable of draw - ing from Landor his best ideas .

		The author , however , has thrown about this light gossip of his old age a charm that certainly delights the reader .

		Landor evidently had no thought of the public in mind when he wrote these letters , although , now that they are published , they may in a measure satisfy the curiosity the public always has to get a peep at the interior of the green-room .

		They add nothing to our knowl - edge of Landor , although they do emphasize the fact that under favorable circumstances he could be agreeable even amiable .

		In other words , the old Roman has for once put off his armor and donned the toga of a peaceful citizen of
Rome	LOCATION	, although , it must be owned , we never quite rid ourselves of an uneasy feeling that after all he may have his weapons within easy reach , ready to be seized at a moment 's notice .

		TWO EPOCHS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE .

		* The great name of Gregorovius -LRB- 1821 1891 -RRB- is chiefly associated with mediaeval
Rome	LOCATION	.

		This was the subject of his first his - torical study , and , as recast in
1883	DATE	, the work displays all his mastery of form and abundance of accurate scholarship .

		The story of the em - peror who settled the boundaries and the for - eign policy of the Roman Empire , who made the last and greatest effort to revive the full splendor of Hellenic paganism , is well deserv - ing of such a monograph .

		For the man of gen - eral culture , the sixty-sixth chapter of Meri - vale 's standard work may suffice .

		ROMAN SOCIETY IN THE LAST CENTURY OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE .

		By
Samuel Dill	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 accustomed to the use of German books .

		The present translation must have been intended almost solely for insular students ; it is not intended , however , for the mere general reader .

		The French ,
Latin	LOCATION	, and Greek , which occurs abundantly in the foot-notes , is never translated : German is left standing only in the titles of other works cited .

		Now , that a generation of students equipped in just this peculiar fashion really exists in
England	LOCATION	, there is abundant reason to believe .

		In spite of all ties , of old kin and recent roy - alty , our cousins still turn their backs on the parent Teutonic speech , in which half the vol - umes of constant reference in almost every American scholar 's working library are writ - ten .

		German is a sealed book to many per - haps to most Oxford or
Cambridge	LOCATION	gradu - ates to-day .

		But if such a condition is to be endured and accepted , it must at least be faced consistently .

		Especially , such a work as this must be duly adapted to the reader we should in courtesy say the student who knows no German , and will not learn it .

		A mere translation of
Gregorovius	PERSON	' text , and of the German portion of his foot-notes , does not fully accomplish this end .

		Three-fourths of the references in the notes are still to books cited by their German titles .

		In many cases , English translations exist ; in others , references were possible to English or French books .

		The only supplementary material in the English edition appears to be the all-too-brief and luminous '' Introduction , '' of four pages , by Professor
Henry Pelham	PERSON	.

		The swift sketch therein given of
Hadrian	PERSON	's larger imperial policy supplies a real defect in Gregorovius ' own work .

		But nearly every page needed the aid of the same masterly hand , in the English reader 's interest .

		Thus , to
Merivale	LOCATION	, from whose closing vol - ume nearly everyone will turn to this mono - graph , there is apparently no reference at all .

		That such a vade mecum as
Teuffel	ORGANIZATION	's '' History of Latin Literature '' is available in English , as as well as in German , has apparently not been revealed to the conscientious translator .

		In - deed , I find no serious attempt to supplement the bibliographical material for the fifteen years since
Gregorovius	PERSON	' own work appeared .

		To take a most glaring instance , in the special `` Bibliography '' -LRB- pp. 382-402 -RRB- ,
Theodor Mommsen	PERSON	is credited with three German and two Latin monographs ; there is no mention of the existence , in German or English , of his great work on the '' Provinces under the Em - pire '' !

		We must say , on the whole , then , that almost any student in
America	LOCATION	who needs
Gregoro	PERSON	- vius ' book at all will prefer the original , espe - cially if , as is probable , an edition has appeared , or shall soon appear , with revised bibliography .

		Though unable to compare this version with the original text , I have the impression that the translator has done her work faithfully .

		The printing has also been careful , and the outward appearance of the book is most luxu - rious .

		In general , the task undertaken seems to have been well performed .

		But the truth is , the mere '' oversetting '' of a valuable and scholarly monograph into another language is in itself unscholarly and unsatisfactory .

		The competent specialist , who should alone attempt to introduce an alien book to his own people , will inevitably find himself adapting it to the known needs of the new audience .

		This has not been attempted at all in the present instance .

		It is a pleasure to speak in a much heartier tone of Professor Dill 's book .

		The outward form , and in some degree the subject , set it beside the `` Hadrian , '' at least upon the re - viewer 's desk .

		Our only quarrel , if any , is with its title .

		We hold with Professor Bury , that there never was a Western empire , at any rate until the coronation of Charles the Great .

		From the time of Constantine , the seat of em - pire was on the
Bosporus	LOCATION	; while
Rome	LOCATION	or
Milan	LOCATION	or
Ravenna	LOCATION	was , even in
Diocletian	PERSON	's day , but an outpost , or at best a provincial capital .

		Pro- fessor Dill undertakes to show how much clas - sical culture yet survived in
Italy	LOCATION	, and in
Western Europe	LOCATION	generally , through that terri - ble century from the first incoming of the
Visi	PERSON	- goths to the disappearance of the poor puppet overburdened with the mighty cognomen Rom - ulus Augustulus .

		The very name of '' Roman Society , '' in a local sense , seems to me all but effaced by
Alaric	PERSON	's harrying -LRB- 410 A. D. -RRB- .

		But the task essayed is accomplished with diligence and learning , with grace , even with semi-poetic imagination , kept duly reined in by sober conscientiousness .

		The materials , indeed , are upon the whole scanty and unsatisfying .

		The courtly orator Symmachus ,
Ausonius	PERSON	, and
Sidonius Apollinaris	PERSON	, poets whose very names are but half-remembered , such are the cen - tral figures ; for the mightier champions of early Christianity arise to destroy , not to uphold , the dying civilization .

		So much the defter is the artist 's hand .

		What do the degenerate heirs of a perishing 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, empire think about , before they go over the cataract ?

		Doubtless they meditate as little as possible ; least of all about their own unworthi - ness , as contrasted with their ancestors .

		Of what are the folk of
Madrid	LOCATION	thinking to-day ?

		As little as may be of
Santiago	LOCATION	and
Manila	LOCATION	; never , if they can help it , of Ferdinand and
Charles	PERSON	and
Philip	LOCATION	.

		Their talk is of the mor - row 's bullfight .

		The cultivated classes of Can - ton and
Pekin	LOCATION	are doing little hard thinking .

		So , doubtless , it was in
Rome	LOCATION	, at least until
Alaric	PERSON	actually thundered at the gate .

		A more interesting but unanswerable query to end half-querulously as we began would be : What did the wisest and most far-sighted of the Goths , the
Franks	PERSON	, or the
Lombards	LOCATION	think , when first they began to realize that the star of
Rome	LOCATION	was setting forever , that the future mastery of the world was theirs ?

		How much of childish savagery was there really in their thoughts ?

		Did they pour into the lands of older culture and milder climate as mere ma - rauders , or seeking a real home ?

		How early , how swiftly , how easily , did the blending of
North and South	ORGANIZATION	begin ?

		We shall never know .

		But as we see the complete merging of the two at last , we almost question if the new voice is so certain to be right in assuring us , even , that `` East is East and West is West , and never the twain shall meet . ''

		Strong races meet , and clash , and finally blend .

		Amid political and economic changes , the world over , more momentous than have oc - curred for many centuries , there is to-day a certain timeliness , a peculiar interest , in Pro- fessor Dill 's scholarly and imaginative sketch .

		very likely to be Americans .

		Hence , at the present time a study by an American of what has been doing in
South Africa	LOCATION	in the past few years may well be characterized as timely , not in the same sense as was Professor
Worcester	LOCATION	's book on the
Philippines	LOCATION	, but in the larger sense that it comes when every source of infor - mation and light , even incidental , is likely to be welcomed and utilized .

		In more respects than one , the opening to settlement of
Mashonaland	LOCATION	and
Matabeleland	LOCATION	was analogous to undertakings in which the
United States	LOCATION	is now , more or less against its will , engaged .

		There was , in the one case , a race determinedly hostile to be dealt with ; in the other , a race avowedly friendly , which after a while revolted against the new ways of the white man and especially the white man 's habit of regular labor , and in its revolt inflicted greater sufferings upon the whites than did the other .

		The ultimate result was the same in the two cases .

		It was not primarily the driving out of a resident people by an army of invaders ; there was in the territory ample space for all its occu - pants , black and white , and for a hundredfold more .

		But the new comers believed in labor , and had the effrontery to ask their black neigh - bors to break through their traditions and labor also ; that it was for hire did not matter , un - less , indeed , it made matters worse .

		Then there was revolt and bloodshed , and finally a rees - tablishing of the social order upon a new basis , the power being now definitely in the hands of the white man , that he might secure him - self against further revolt and at the same time compel the black to accept certain things that should ultimately make for his salvation .

		If the book makes one thing clear more than an - other , it is that no permanent improvement can be made in a benighted race that is not based upon power , upon the actual use of the strong hand as it is needed ; that there is no such thing as moral suasion in dealing with a savage , except in so far as the savage suspects that there is power behind it .

		But the author of this book discusses this and other political problems only by implica - tion .

		His object is to give a straightforward narrative of his own personal experiences as a member of the band of pioneers who pushed through the wilderness to
Mashonaland	LOCATION	, founded the town of
Salisbury	LOCATION	, and eventually , as part of a larger force , subdued the uprising inspired by
Lo Bengula	ORGANIZATION	and put an end to the power of the Matabele king .

		As a young man recently graduated from the
University of Kansas	ORGANIZATION	, the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 author found his way to
South Africa	LOCATION	as col - lector for the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution ; and happened there in exciting times , which speed - ily made the young scientist a soldier and a gold-seeker , and finally a prosperous land - owner .

		Through what perils he made his way may best be read in the pages of his book , though the story is told so modestly that one needs to read many a passage a second time to realize what it means .

		Most marked in book as in author is its plain , unassuming style , its manner even and direct .

		Of especial interest , and perhaps best written , are the chapters treating of family and village life among the natives .

		That the author , by virtue of his ex - ploits as a provider of skins for the
Smithso	PERSON	- nian , and consequently of much meat for the natives , had won their entire confidence , is fully evidenced by the freedom with which they im - parted to him their few traditions as of the sun setting in the headwaters of a great river and calmly floating eastward until morning ; and by the certainty with which a young woman who disliked her affianced purchaser appealed to him to provide her a way of escape by marrying her himself .

		If there had been any intention of making the book in any sense political in character , much might have been made of the doings of Mr.
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	and his dealings with the important questions affecting the new colony .

		But as with regard to other matters political , these doings and dealings are left to speak for themselves .

		One may easily draw inferences with regard to the author 's opinion of Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	, and it is very evident that Mr.
Brown	PERSON	is not a hero-worshipper if Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	is to be the hero ; while on the other hand , if it seems that Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	has taken especial care of the interests of Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	and of his Company as distinguished from the interests of the general Rhodesian public , he has nevertheless dealt with very hard questions in an eminently wise way , wiser than it may seem to an observer at a distance .

		And without Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	, there could , of course , have been no
Rhodesia	LOCATION	.

		The world has grown so small , and is becom - ing so well known in all its parts , that we may hardly hope to see many more added to the number of interesting books devoted solely to narrative of personal travel and adventure in strange lands .

		But '' On the South African Frontier '' is certainly one that has a message of interest to the general reader and that will well repay a few hours of study .

		RECENT FOREIGN FICTION .

		* A considerable number of the romantic fictions of Mr.
Maurus Jokai	PERSON	have found their way into a sort of English during the past ten years , but they have generally been open to the suspicion , if the fact were not avowed , of translation through the German , and we have never felt that they brought us into close contact with the thought of the writer .

		They seem , moreover , to have been chosen from the great mass of available material in a rather hap - hazard way , and we have not found it easy to find in them any adequate justification of the author 's immense reputation in his own country .

		The firm of publishers who have now become the authorized rep - resentatives of the Hungarian novelist in this coun - try have undertaken to reproduce some of his novels more faithfully than others have done , and in direct translations by competent hands .

		Few readers un - derstand the importance of direct translation in such a case , or the great difficulty of transferring ideas from an agglutinative to an inflected vehicle of ex - pression .

		We will frankly say that the4wo romances now before us have impressed us more than any of their predecessors in English garb as saying just what their author must have meant to say in his own speech , and as confirming his title to rank among the foremost romanticists of the century .

		They are fantastic in their conception and careless in their attention to matters of detail , for these are doubt - less essential features of the writer 's genius , but their effect is more coherent , or less kaleidoscopic , than that of earlier versions , which we take to be good evidence that they have been intelligently translated .

		The first of them , '' The Nameless Castle , '' is provided with a preface by the author himself , and a sketch of his activity by '' Neltje Blanchan '' which is appreciative and just .

		The story is of the Napoleonic time , and of the Hun - garian army raised in
1809	DATE	to resist the invader .

		310 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, thizers , who centre their hopes in a possible restora - tion which shall bring her to the throne of her ancestors .

		Her death makes the device innocent enough , a device justified , for the rest , by the inter - est of the romance that has been woven about her fortunes .

		`` An Hungarian Nabob , '' the second of these translations , is one of the author 's earlier books , having been published nearly half a century ago , and pictures Hungarian life in a still earlier period of the century , namely , in the twenties .

		Its interest is varied and sustained , and we can easily under - stand that it is reckoned among the classics of Hun - garian fiction .

		The translator has taken the liberty of cutting out '' a good third of the original work , '' in order that the book '' should attract at first sight . ''

		We consider such mutilations unwarrantable , and feel bound to protest against them upon every pos - sible occasion .

		A young Swedish priest in the district of Varm - land is so addicted to drink that he is expelled from his parish and becomes an outcast .

		Filled with re - morse , he is about to take his own life , when he is saved by a wealthy and philanthropic woman , the proprietor of large estates and productive industries .

		This woman has collected about her a number of picturesque ne'er - do-weels , who have become her pensioners , and whom she provides with a home , food , clothing , and whatever else they may want .


Gosta Berling	PERSON	, the drunken priest , becomes one of these pensioners .

		Presently , through a turn of the wheel of fortune , this Lady Bountiful is expelled from her home , and the pensioners remain in pos - session .

		They live riotous lives and indulge in all sorts of mad freaks .

		It is evident enough that the story thus outlined has unusual originality , and promises new sensations even to the most jaded taste .

		But the outline conveys no notion whatever of the book itself , for the case is one in which the scheme counts for nothing and the treatment for everything .

		Imagine , then , that all of these things are told , not as by some first-hand observer , but in the form which they have assumed among a super - stitious and poetically-minded people after trans - mission from mouth to mouth for a hundred years or so .

		The story takes upon itself heroic propor - tions , and becomes invested with the attributes of the epic .

		It becomes , in fact , the '' saga '' of
Gosta Berling	PERSON	, as the author calls it , and not the '' story '' that the translator has so unhappily preferred to style it in the English version .

		The work is certainly impressive , although we can not say that it is alto - gether a work of art .

		It is too incoherent , too rhap - sodical , to deserve that title .

		But it is an exceed - ingly interesting exam pie of what young
Scandinavia	LOCATION	is now doing in literature , for its author ,
Miss Selma Lagerlof	LOCATION	, is one of the very newest of Swedish writers .

		Its success , moreover , in its present form , has been such as to warrant the speedy preparation of another of Miss
Lagerlof	PERSON	s romances for the English-speaking public , and to this second work we will now direct our attention .

		`` The Miracles of Antichrist '' is a work that represents a maturer stage in the development of this talented writer , although it still has the inco - herent and episodical character of the earlier book .

		In this case ,
Miss Lagerlof	PERSON	has turned from the Swedish to the Sicilian peasantry for her subject , and her insight into the racial and temperamental characteristics of a people so remote from her own is really remarkable .

		The fantastic basis of the story is provided by a false image of the
Bambino of Aracoeli	ORGANIZATION	, which somehow finds its way into a vil - lage on Mount JEtna , and is believed to have mirac - ulous virtues .

		It brings various blessings to the village folk , but these are of the temporal rather than the spiritual sort ; in short , they are the mira - cles of Antichrist .

		In some strange way , not clearly worked out , the spirit of socialism is identified with Antichrist , and the one who made the falsified image scratched upon its crown the inscription : '' My kingdom is only of this world . ''

		There is no continuous story of much interest , but there are many faithful and sincere studies of character , and many portions of the work glow with a strange poet - ical beauty .

		Miss
Lagerlof	PERSON	is assuredly a writer to be reckoned with in the new development of Scan - dinavian literature . ''

		Sielanka '' is a companion volume to '' Hania '' in the authorized uniform edition of translations from Mr.
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, as made by Mr.
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	.

		It contains seventeen pieces , of which nine were published in two small volumes several years ago .

		Of those nine , ''
Bartek	PERSON	the
Victor	PERSON	, '' ''
Yanko	PERSON	the Musician , '' and '' The Light - house Keeper of Aspinwall '' have been generally recognized as remarkable examples of the short story , and they remain the best things in the present volume , although we should place with them the tragedy called '' For Bread , '' which tells the story of two Polish emigrants to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Among the remaining pieces are two in dramatic form a sketch in one scene , and a five-act drama and a vigorous piece of literary criticism hpropos of
M. Zola	ORGANIZATION	's nov.els .

		Readers of ''
Cosmopolis	LOCATION	, '' that admirable inter - national review that came to an untimely end
last November	DATE	, were the first to be introduced to the examples of female portraiture to which
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	gave the collective title of '' Voyageuses . ''

		There were six of them altogether , carefully studied pictures of charmingly or pathetically attractive wo - men '' seen for a week , a day , an hour the romance of whose lives I divined -LRB- or , perhaps , imagined -RRB- from some sudden incident of travel . ''

		We are glad to have these stories in Mr.
William Mai-chant	PERSON	's trans - lation , which is far above the ordinary level of such work , as the stories themselves are above the level of the novelist 's productions .

		Indeed , we are im - pelled to say that the delicate charm of
M. Bourget	PERSON	's style , and the penetrative sympathy with which he has studied human life , appeal to us more strongly from this book than from any other that he has written .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 `` The Secret of Fougereuse '' is a romance of
Provence	LOCATION	in the
fifteenth century	DATE	, and is said to be taken '' from the French . ''

		Of the literal truth of this statement we have our suspicions , for the name of no French author is given , and the romance does not read like a translation .

		At all events , we may thank
Miss Guiney	PERSON	, whatever the source of her ma - terials , for an exquisite piece of literature , and , if it be indeed a translation , we can only murmur , si sic omnes .

		The romance is of the time of the crafty French monarch who lives forever in the pages of ''
Quentin Durward	PERSON	, '' although it is more immedi - ately connected with the court of the good but weak
King Rene	ORGANIZATION	' .

		Tout passe fors aymer
Dieu	PERSON	is the motto of the book , and tells the secret of
Guy de Fougereuse	ORGANIZATION	, the hero .

		For this brave knight and steadfast friend is endowed with spiritual no less than with physical heroism , and has no other secret than the service of a higher Master than even the
King	LOCATION	.

		Brought to trial for his life upon charges of sorcery , the secret comes out , he is triumphantly vindicated , and exchanges the garb of knighthood for that of the monk .

		A still greater triumph awaits him when his burning love softens the heart of his most malignant foe , and reclaims what had seemed to be a spirit hopelessly lost .

		The religious feature of this story is strongly pronounced , but this does not prevent it from being a very stirring picture of its age , while its style is a constant delight to the sense .

		The last of our present list of books is the '' Vicomte de Puyjoli , '' a translation made by Miss
Emma M. Phelps	PERSON	from the French of
M. Jules Claretie	PERSON	.

		It is a romance of the French Revolution , with all the familiar accessories unregenerate royalists , stern republicans , revolutionary tribunals , suspects , Emigres , ci-devants , the statuesque St. - Just , the big
Danton	PERSON	, the repulsive
Marat	PERSON	, and the rest .

		The special hero of the tale is one
Charles de la Bussiere	PERSON	, a poor player , whose devotion to his friends during the dark days of Thermidor saved many heads from the guillotine .

		Hackneyed as the whole subject is , it receives fresh interest from
M. Clare	PERSON	- tie 's treatment , and as the story progresses to its climax , the attention of its readers becomes almost breathless .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		French fiction '' A Century of French Fiction '' of the -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the latest nineteenth century , contribution of Professor
Benjamin W. Wells	PERSON	to a series of studies in modern European literature that have won for their writer a high place among our critical essayists .

		Like its prede - cessors , this book is characterized by sobriety of judgment and charm of expression , and impresses the reader throughout with the painstaking processes by which the author approaches whatever task lies before him .

		He discusses , or at least names , no less than 688 stories by 115 novelists , and before ven - turing to discuss them , has read them all , note-book in hand .

		So we feel confident that his generaliza - tions are true critical syntheses , and not the airy speculations that are sometimes imposed upon a complacent public .

		The French fiction of the nine - teenth century is Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's subject , and it is dis - cussed in seventeen chapters .

		Of these , three -LRB- or about a fourth of the whole book -RRB- are devoted to Balzac , '' the greatest novelist of
France	LOCATION	, and per - haps of the world . ''

		Eight other chapters are spe - cial studies of
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	, Me ` rime'e ,
Gautier	PERSON	,
George Sand	PERSON	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Daudet	PERSON	,
Maupassant	PERSON	, and
M. Zola	PERSON	.

		The six remaining chapters are devoted to the con - sideration of groups of less important writers .

		We are unable to justify the treatment of Hugo as a mere member of the romantic group along with
Lamartine and Dumas	PERSON	, and for our own part we have not the slightest doubt that the excessive crit - ical reaction against Hugo , even as a novelist , will be followed in the coming century by a swing of the pendulum whereby his reputation will come once more into its own .

		But we have no other serious quarrel with the perspective in which Mr.
Wells	PERSON	presents his subjects , and we have taken much satis - faction in his lucid expositions .

		More careful proof - reading would have corrected such things as '' Cau - casse , '' '' Cimourdin , '' `` Listz , '' '' Thernardier , '' and '' Le Maitre des Forges '' ; would probably have omitted the second article in `` The Cat and the Racket '' ; and would not have left '' The Mansion of Penarvan '' to stand for '' La
Maison de Penar	ORGANIZATION	- van . ''

		Surely it is not the habitation , but the house , in the sense of family , that we are to understand by the title of
Sandeau	ORGANIZATION	's novel .

		A single new letter from
Charles	LOCATION	uterary circle .

		Lamb to
Thomas Manning	PERSON	would be sufficient reason , if not sufficient ma - terial , for a new volume .

		Unfortunately , Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	is unable to offer us any such Milesian Mul - lets : he has letters from Lamb and letters from
Manning	PERSON	, but not to each other .


Robert Lloyd	PERSON	, to whom are addressed most of the letters in his volume entitled ``
Charles Lamb	PERSON	and the Lloyds '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- , was one of those persons who , though not espe - cially remarkable themselves , have the faculty of attracting remarkable persons to them .

		The same thing is to be said , perhaps , of his brother ; but
Charles Lloyd	PERSON	probably had more individual genius , and therefore was less able to attract and hold the regard of other geniuses .

		For a time , however ,
Charles Lloyd	PERSON	was one of a more brilliant group than his brother
Robert	PERSON	ever knew :
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Southey	LOCATION	, DeQuincey , all in their youth - ful days before being really famous .

		But it would seem that
Robert	PERSON	had the more attractive character ; men took to him more .

		He was not such a genius as his brother , and got no such sermons from
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ; but then , he got better letters from
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, which , whether it consoled him or not , is at least happy enough for us .

		Among these young people sizzling with genius appears the staid figure 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, of
Charles Lloyd	PERSON	senior , who amuses himself by translating Homer into the metre of Pope .

		This harmless occupation has resulted well for humanity , in that it brought forth three letters from Miss
Anna Seward	PERSON	, the Swan of
Litchfield	LOCATION	, than whom the world never knew -LRB- in her sex -RRB- a more affected book-club president .

		These are newly discovered letters , and on the whole the find had something of value .

		Of the letters from
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, some are quite charming , though none -LRB- of course -RRB- are quite as good as our old favorites .

		The letters from
Coleridge	PERSON	are as foolish as he was at the time he wrote them .

		The letters of
Miss Seward	ORGANIZATION	are so preposterous as to be of great value .

		Several letters of
Robert Lloyd	PERSON	's , especially those written to his wife during a visit to
London	LOCATION	, are also worth reading .

		Around these jewels Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	has arranged a very nice setting of minor stones and of the pure and lovely gold of his own writing .

		_ The greatness f excellence is main - and decay tained by the editor of the '' Cam - &
Spain	LOCATION	.

		bridge Historical Series '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- in the successive volumes on the modern history of the great nations of to-day .

		One of the best is
Martin A. S. Hume	PERSON	's on ''
Spain	LOCATION	: Its Greatness and Decay '' -LRB- 1479-1788 -RRB- .

		It is a melancholy story , for
Spain	LOCATION	had every advantage for success in national development .

		If only the modern spirit could have entered , that unfortunate country would not now be the object of the world 's contemptuous pity .

		But the Bull-fight and the Inquisition have remained typical of
Spain	LOCATION	's social and religious con - dition ; greed and oppression have made up its pol - itics .

		The formation of the centralized monarchy by
Ferdinand	ORGANIZATION	and
Isabella	PERSON	, and the glorious reign of Carlos I. -LRB-
Charles V.	PERSON	-RRB- , are described in an intro - duction of a hundred pages by Mr.
Edward Arm	PERSON	- strong .

		Then the author takes up the narrative with the opening of the reign of
Philip II.	LOCATION	, appar - ently the most glorious portion of
Spain	LOCATION	's history , but really the beginning of her decay .

		All the forces that make for national prosperity were neg - lected , while
Spain	LOCATION	went out to do battle for the
Papal Supremacy	ORGANIZATION	and to extirpate all Protestant heresy from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The European complications and mighty wars that followed are described , at the end of which
Spain	LOCATION	is found exhausted and demor - alized , and disappears from active participation in the world 's affairs .

		But the main interest is that indicated by the sub-title of the book the story of the decay of a great nation .

		The book contains bibliography , index , and maps .

		The `` feminine renatssance '' and it s prophet .

		To P ut one ' 8 fin g er on a ical moment '' in modern history is something of an achievement .

		It has been done for the African slave trade and its aboli - tion in
England	LOCATION	; it has been done there for prison reform ; the recent biography of Miss
Clough	PERSON	did it partially for the higher education of woman in
Great Britain	LOCATION	; and now comes Mrs.
Emma Rauschenbusch	PERSON	-
Clough	PERSON	with ''
Mary Wollstonecraf	PERSON	t and ' The Rights An abusive attack upon Mr.
Froude	PERSON	.

		of Women ' '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , to perform a similar service for that widespread and far-reaching move - ment which might perhaps be styled the Feminine Renaissance .

		The work is interesting to the gen - eral reader and to the historian .

		Mary
Wollstone	PERSON	- craft led one of the unhappiest of lives , and the real services she rendered her sex have been obscured by the more brilliant career of her daughter , the second
Mary Wollstonecraf	PERSON	t , author of '' Frankenstein '' and wife to the poet
Shelley	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Rauschenbusch	PERSON	-
Clough	PERSON	gives the facts in the mother 's chequered life with sympathy and succinctness , and then expa - tiates upon her reply to
Edmund Burke	PERSON	's ''
Reflec	PERSON	- tions on the Revolution in
France	LOCATION	, '' which she fairly proves to be the sounding of the first trumpet on behalf of a sex which from being '' down-trodden '' is almost taking on the characteristics of the down - treading .

		The influence of this magnum opus on contemporaneous thought is the occasion for dis - playing a quantity of real erudition , and the chain which connects the theoretical '' Rights of Woman '' in
1792	DATE	with the practical rights they have secured in
1899	DATE	is firmly wrought and secure .

		By dint of knocks so hard that they become abusive , Mr.
David Wilson	PERSON	effectually defeats his own object in his book on `` Mr.
Froude	PERSON	and Carlyle '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The rather bulky volume is an attempt to make
Froude	PERSON	out as pretty much every - thing a rational man would wish not to be , in revenge for the misfortunes of the
Carlyle Biography	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even if the reader begins the book with strong preposses - sions in Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's favor , he will end with the conviction that no one can be quite so feeble and depraved as
Froude	PERSON	is made out to be .

		There seems little reason to doubt the correctness of the author 's criticism of
Froude	PERSON	's course in the publication of the letters , etc. , but the injustice of attacking his personal character and private life , setting him down as a hypocrite who bartered his soul for money , as a weakling and libertine in one , and a friend delib - erately false , is quite too much , and sympathy veers to the side of the over-abused .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, in his preface , threatens to write a life of
Carlyle	LOCATION	himself ; if he can not bring to it a wider range of thought , a higher tolerance , and a nobler charity than manifest themselves in these pages , the book should remain unwritten .

		Modem teaching *
E. S. Talbot	PERSON	, the author of De - on degeneracy generacy , its Causes , Signs , and and heredity .

		Results '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , tells us that he has been at work more than twenty years in a limited department of biology connected with his profession as dentist .

		He had sought for an explanation of observed local defects in individuals , and had discovered that the causes were sometimes not to be found short of a deep study of the entire constitution and heredity .

		From these personal investigations the author was led out into a study of the general doctrine of degeneracy , atavism , and arrested development , and now gives us a summary
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 313 of the teachings of the most important authorities , American and European .

		The discussion is of very great social importance , and covers such subjects as the stigmata of degeneracy , heredity , atavism , con - sanguineous and neurotic marriages , intermixture of races , toxic agents , contagious and infectious dis - eases , climate , soil , and food , school strain , the de - generate cranium , and other anatomical signs , marks of reversion , and degeneracy of mentality and mo - rality .

		Parents , teachers , legislators , judges , and charity workers need to be familiar with the as - sured results and even the hypotheses of this vol - ume .

		The style is necessarily somewhat technical , but any intelligent person can , with the occasional use of a modern dictionary , apprehend the mean - ing .

		Dr.
Talbot	PERSON	has personally made some contri - butions to knowledge , and has here put together reasonings which should influence social thinking and conduct .

		Dr
Briggs	PERSON	Back in
1883	DATE	Professor
Briggs	PERSON	issued < m the study a volume entitled `` Biblical Study . ''

		of Scripture .

		Thig vo i ume proved so popular that it has been issued from the press nine times since that date .

		The giant strides made in Biblical meth - ods and study since
1883	DATE	, and the numerous new results acquired , demanded a revision of the original work .

		This book , '' The Study of Holy Scripture '' -LRB- Seribner -RRB- , is a revision , with considerable addi - tions on the subjects of
Canon	ORGANIZATION	, Text , Higher Criti - cism , Literary Study of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and
Interpreta	LOCATION	- tion of Scriptures .

		Many of the 688 pages of this new book on careful comparison are identical with pages in the 506 of the old book .

		Others are modi - fied by the change of only a few words , while valu - able new material adds many new pages and several chapters to the book .

		The original twelve chapters have become expanded into twenty-six .

		It is a pity that the whole work could not have been written anew .

		A higher critic can often discover the seams between the documents of '83 and those of
' 98	DATE	.

		In spite of this unevenness in style and character , the author has laid under tribute to his pen the best lit - erature extant on the themes he discusses , and the literature is cited in foot-notes , by title , volume , and page .

		The style and spirit of the author are not always to be commended , especially when he is crying down his opponent or dogmatising on the view presented .

		But the addition of new material and a new paragraphing of the text constitute the chief value of this re-issue of a useful book .

		The famous ^ would , we suspect , be a very dif - '' common-sense ficult task to narrate the life of philosopher . ''


Thomas Reid	PERSON	, and to describe his philosophical system in such a way as to enthral the reader and at the same time leave him with a clear understanding of the famous '' Common Sense
Phil	PERSON	- osophy . ''

		In fact , it would not be too easy to effect either one of these results , even at the sacrifice of the other : of the two , the latter would probably be the simpler accomplishment .

		Reid was a noteworthy figure in the history of philosophy .

		He was certainly a famous Scot .

		As such he deserves the volume by Professor
Campbell Fraser	PERSON	which has recently ap - peared in the '' Famous Scots '' series -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		The volume will certainly be of more interest to one who wishes to get a general idea of
Reid	PERSON	's philosophy than to one who has only an intel - ligent curiosity on biography in general .

		Yet Pro- fessor
Campbell Fraser	ORGANIZATION	tells the life easily , and gives us a curious picture of retired eighteenth-century university existence .

		Those who look a little into philosophy will probably like the book best ; but others , with a more merely human interest , will be likely to find something to their minds .

		A book of '' Etiquette for Amer - Forms and phases of insanity .

		anonymously by
Messrs. H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, could readily have a review extending into a history of the American people , so many and so varied are the causes which make a demand for such a treatise .

		This , like others of its kind , is a vade mecum for the manufacture of aristocrats out of the most variously assorted material imaginable .

		It is the work of a woman evidently a bright one and is intended for those who have passed the self-made stage and are preparing to enter the upper walks of life as ready-made .

		It is humorous , as such books must always be , but it differs from others in having its humor known by its writer .

		There is a chapter on the '' Treatment of Reporters , '' which is a gem in its patronage of that useful ad - junct to social distinction .

		-LRB- See
Dooley	PERSON	on Golf , passim -RRB- .

		_ Dr.
L. Forbes Winslow	PERSON	, one of the greatest of English alienists , has col - lected some of the results of his sci - entific studies and observations in a volume entitled '' Mad Humanity '' -LRB-
M. F. Mansfield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		How ignorant the world at large is regarding the import - ant topic of insanity , these pages abundantly prove ; for , though the malady is a growing one and pecu - liarly a concomitant of civilization so-called , Dr.
Winslow	PERSON	shows that we still retain something of the superstition which made the insane in a special sense the work of the Almighty .

		The work is pro- fusely illustrated , is dedicated to
Lombroso	LOCATION	, and the voice of authority speaks from its many pages .

		A book from ^ mildly interesting volume results idle days in from Mr.
William Scott	PERSON	's investiga - te
Riviera	LOCATION	.

		t j ons among < -LRB- The Rock Villages of the Riviera '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There are no scientific nor historical truths enunciated which are not suffi - ciently well known , and the author has been satis - fied to go to popular sources for the little learning which he expends on his subject not always with accuracy .

		He was in the
Riviera	LOCATION	with nothing else to do , the little towns of ancient birth and mediaeval fortification attracted him , and he wandered about among them , obtaining exercise and sufficient men - 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, tal occupation to keep him satisfied for the time .

		Then be mistook the interest he had taken in the matter for a general interest , and put forth a book which will do no particular good , has no particu - lar reason for existence , and can do no particular harm .

		BRIEFER MENTION , Mr.
Frank Russell	PERSON	's unbound volume of '' Explora - tions in the Far North '' -LRB-
University of Iowa Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains an account , quite fully illustrated from photo - graphs , of a collector 's journeys in the
Mackenzie River Region	LOCATION	and the
Barren Grounds of British America	ORGANIZATION	.

		Descriptions are given of the native manner of life , including a record of some Cree Myths ; and there is much about the animal life of the country , with a chap - ter on musk-ox hunting .

		The work is plainly and suc - cinctly written , and is of considerable interest and value .

		With the twelfth volume of the '' Biographical ''
Thackeray	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , we come within one of the last , and Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	's memoranda take on a melancholy tinge , although greatly softened in the retrospect , as she nears the closing years of her father 's life .

		Indeed , these pages seem to be the end of the random biography , for they tell of
Thackeray	PERSON	's brief illness and peaceful death .

		The contents of this volume are : '' The Wolves and the Lamb , '' '' Lovel the Widower , '' the '' Round - about Papers , '' and the torso of ''
Denis Duval	PERSON	, '' includ - ing a hitherto unprinted chapter of that novel , which might have been the author 's greatest , had he lived to complete it .

		The treatise of
Egidio Colonna	ORGANIZATION	's '' De
Regimine Prin	PERSON	- cipiuin '' was written about
1286	DATE	, and , after the inven - tion of printing went through no less than eleven editions , from
1473	DATE	to
1617	DATE	.

		A French translation , or '' rather a cleverly prepared version '' of the work forms the contents of an interesting thirteenth century MS. owned by Mr.
J. E. Kerr	PERSON	, Jr. , of
New York	LOCATION	, and this is now published , with notes , under the editorship of Dr.
Sam	PERSON	- uel
Paul Molenaer	PERSON	.

		The title is ''
Li Livres	PERSON	du Gouv - ernement des Rois , '' and the whole material offered makes a handsome volume of nearly five hundred pages , issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	for the
Columbia Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Press .

		A sixth volume in the uniform '' Eversley '' edition of
Richard Holt Hutton	PERSON	's writings has just been published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	with the title , '' Aspects of Re - ligious and Scientific Thought . ''

		Like earlier volumes of this edition , the contents are reprinted from '' The Spectator , '' where they did service as leaders or reviews .

		There are more than fifty of them in all , upon a great variety of subjects , mostly of an interest sufficiently per - manent to warrant this reproduction in attractive book form .

		The '' American Art Annual '' for
1898	DATE	is the first volume of what we trust may prove to be a long-lived series .

		Its chief feature is a classified list of galleries , private collections , societies , and schools , classified ac - cording to cities , and filling over three hundred pages .

		We have besides directories of artists , institutions , and dealers , reviews of the year at home and abroad , sales and exhibitions of the past and coining years , obituary notices , and special articles .

		The work is abundantly illustrated .

		Miss
Florence N. Levy	PERSON	is the editor , and the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	have undertaken the publication .

		IiITERAKY NOTES .

		The third volume of North 's Plutarch and De
Quin	PERSON	- cey 's '' Confessions of an English Opium Eater '' are the latest additions to the Dent-Macmillan series of '' Tem - ple Classics . '' ''

		Composition , '' by Mr.
Arthur W. Dow	PERSON	, is '' a series of exercises from a new system of art education , '' pub - lished in a handsome quarto volume by Mr.
J. M. Bowles	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish '' An Intro - duction to the Differential and Integral Calculus and Differential Equations , '' by Mr.
F. Glanville Taylor	PERSON	.

		It is a volume of between five and six hundred pages .

		Mr.
James Henry Brownlee	PERSON	is the compiler , and the
Werner Co.	ORGANIZATION	the publishers , of a volume of verses , mostly doggerel , called '' War-Time Echoes , '' relating to -LRB- we can hardly say inspired by -RRB- the recent war on
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		The Return of the
O'Mahony	PERSON	, '' by no means the poorest of the late
Harold Frederic	PERSON	's novels , although not nearly as well known as the others , has just been published in a new edition by the
G. W. Dillingham Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are a few additional poems in the edition of Miss
Lilian Whiting	PERSON	's `` From Dreamland Sent , '' just issued by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	; otherwise the volume contains the matter published in the first edi - tion , four years ago . ''

		Rontgen Rays , '' translated and edited by Dr.
George F. Barker	PERSON	; and `` The Modern Theory of Solution , '' translated and edited by Dr.
Harry C. Jones	PERSON	, form the third and fourth volumes in the series of '' Scientific Memoirs '' published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two little booklets that should find favor with col - lectors of '' Kiplingiana '' have been published recently by
Messrs. M. F. Mansfield & A. Wessels	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first is a study of '' The Religion of Kipling , '' by Mr.
W. B. Parker	PERSON	, associate editor of the `` Atlantic Monthly '' ; , the second , a reprint of two issues of the Horsmonden School '' Budget '' containing a facetious letter from Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, together with Mr.
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	's cari - cature of the writer .

		Professor
Edwin A. Grosvenor	PERSON	's '' Contemporary His - tory of the World '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- '' attempts to outline the most prominent political events in
Europe	LOCATION	and
North America	LOCATION	during the last fifty years . ''

		It was planned in some sort as a continuation of Duruy 's '' General History , '' which stops at
1848	DATE	, and the same general method and manner of narration are employed .

		The same publishers send us a new edition of
Duruy	ORGANIZATION	's `` An - cient History '' in Professor Grosvenor 's revision .

		The first annotated edition of '' Cyrano de Bergerac '' for the classroom has just been issued by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor , Professor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	, gives much interesting light on the manners of the times , and on the historic persons who suggested the characters to
M. Rostand	PERSON	.

		He also gives
Coquelin	ORGANIZATION	's description of the first night , and of his acquaintance with the author .

		Special emphasis is laid on the play as a picture of an interesting period , as well as on its theatrical effectiveness .

		Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	's '' Spinoza : His Life and Philosophy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been for some score of years the standard English work upon the great philos - opher whose thought has so deeply penetrated the con - sciousness of our time , and seems to grow more modern with the passing centuries .

		We are now glad to note the appearance of a second edition , which was greatly
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 315 needed in view of the new material for the study of Spinoza provided by recent scholarly investigations .

		Only the later additions to Spinoza bibliography now appear in the introduction , and for such references as were previously included readers are directed to Van der
Linde	PERSON	and the British Museum catalogue .

		The life by Colerus -LRB-
London	LOCATION	,
1706	DATE	-RRB- '' done out of French , '' serves as an appendix .

		Amidst the hurly-burly of hasty books on the Spanish war , we are glad to see a revival of interest in works relating to the more heroic period of the Rebellion .

		Besides the really great book on
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	-LRB- reviewed in this issue -RRB- , we have had new biographies of Generals
Meade	PERSON	and
Sherman	PERSON	, and , more recently , of Secretary
Stanton	PERSON	and
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	the latter two certainly among the most striking and picturesque subjects to be found in American public life .

		The recent popular clamor in
England	LOCATION	for a moderate - priced edition of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's '' transversion '' of the Rubaiyat has at last been met by
Messrs. Macmillan	PERSON	, the holders of the English copyright , who now issue the work in their familiar '' Golden Treasury Series . ''

		The full text of the first and fourth editions is given , together with
FitzGerald	PERSON	's introduction and notes , the text of the stanzas which appeared in the second edi - tion only , a list of all variations between the four editions , and a comparative table of stanzas .

		It is alto - gether safe to say that
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's immortal rendering has reached its definitive form in this tasteful and inexpensive edition .

		rpHE Proprietors who in
1861	DATE	purchased the Spectator have since that date conducted it themselves .

		They are therefore exempted from many influences which press severely on the independence of jour - nalism , and have from the first made it their chief object to say out what they believe to be truth in theology , politics , and social questions , irrespective , not only of opposition from without , but of the opinion of their own supporters .

		Their object is to reflect the opinion of cultivated Liberals , but in the matter of the American War they fought against the mass of the very class they are trying to represent , and were finally acknowledged by them to have been in the right .

		The news of the current week is compressed into an animated nar - rative , which the laziest or busiest may read , without missing the life or import of the events .

		The Spectator contains a list of all Books published during the week -LRB- not under one shilling in price -RRB- , with the names of the publishers and the prices attached , a feature which will greatly increase its value to booksellers , librarians , literary institutions , and private gentlemen .

		348 THE MENACE TO FREE DISCUS - SION .

		The opponents of the imperial policy in gen - eral , and of our unconstitutional Philippine war in particular , have good cause for congratula - tion in the outburst of fanatical intolerance which their defense of the fundamental princi - ples of democratic civilization has recently evoked .

		This sort of bigotry , arrogating to itself the name of patriotism , might be a dan - gerous symptom in any body politic less organ - ically sound than the American ; but in our own case it may hardly be considered more serious than a severe fever that will run its course and pass away .

		The American public may for a time be deluded by dreams of empire and the imaginary duty of assuming '' bur - dens , '' but we can not believe that it has lapsed for good from the faith that has made our na - tion great , and we are quite certain that it is sound at heart where the great question of free speech and the expression of honest convictions is concerned .

		The fever that is temporarily upon us should not , however , be left exactly to the vis medi - catrix naturae when its mitigation by rational appliances is possible , although one is strongly tempted so to leave it by certain of its manifes - tations .

		When , for example , it takes the fat - uous form of denouncing as unpatriotic and even treasonable the attitude and the utterances of those whom sober-minded Americans most delight to honor of such men as ex-Presidents
Cleveland	LOCATION	and
Harrison	PERSON	, Senators
Hoar	PERSON	and
Edmunds	PERSON	, Bishops Potter and
Spalding	LOCATION	, Presi - dents Eliot and
Rogers	PERSON	and
Jordan	PERSON	, Professors
James	PERSON	,
Laughlin	LOCATION	, and
Sumner	PERSON	, and Messrs.
Godkin	PERSON	,
Schurz	LOCATION	, and
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	its very violence affords the best promise of a speedy recovery .

		One would hardly resent for himself any kind of epithet that associated him with such men as these ; the attribution would arouse , rather than any personal feeling -LRB- save that of pride in the association -RRB- , a sense of mingled indignation and contempt for those who could prefer so ridiculous a charge against so distinguished a company .

		326 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, But the philosopher , however clearly he may foresee the outcome of the conflict , is not thereby justified in holding himself aloof from the field , when there is any possibility that his efforts may hasten the desired end .

		It is , then , quite impossible for us to pass by without com - ment certain recent exhibitions of the spirit of intolerance in dealing with the question that so gravely concerns our country at the present day .

		There are many indications of an attempt , tacitly or otherwise concerted , on the part of those who support the Philippine policy of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, to terrorize its opponents into silence until the nation shall have become so far committed to its present course that with - drawal will be practically impossible .

		No one can examine with a candid mind the ephemeral literature of this subject without recognizing the fact that , broadly speaking , the appeal of the anti-imperialists is an appeal to reason , while the appeal of the imperialists is an ap - peal to sentiment , to prejudice , to passion , to everything , in a word , that is not reason or akin to it .

		Things have come to a grave pass indeed , although we persist in regarding the aberration as merely temporary , when so many organs of public opinion have nothing better with which to meet the arguments of those who oppose our present administrative course than the old cry , '' My country , right or wrong , '' and the studied use of invective .

		In the last analysis , this is the essential argument and this the character - istic method of the agencies that have rallied to the support of the war against the Philippine people as it was of those that rallied to the sup - port of the war against
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Even the abusive term '' copperhead , '' which has lost little of its virulence in the years that have passed since its invention , is now freely applied by reckless editors and clergymen to men of national rep - utation whose every word and deed has always been inspired by the loftiest ideals and the finest patriotism .

		There is no American now living , for example , who deserves better of his fellow-countrymen than Mr.
Charles Eliot	PERSON	Nor - ton , who represents more adequately the higher American conscience , just as
Lowell	LOCATION	and
Curtis	PERSON	represented it when their voices were still raised in admonition and appeal ; yet Mr.
Norton	PERSON	, for his courage in giving utterance to his deepest convictions upon the events of the past year , has been subjected to violent denunciation , frantically undignified , and from every point of view unworthy of the traditions of American manhood .

		A still more serious menace to the right of free discussion is afforded by the case of Mr.
Edward Atkinson	PERSON	, now fresh in the public mind .

		Wanton calumny and wilful misrepre - sentation could not well go farther than they have done in this instance .

		Every intelligent American knows Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	to be a scholar of the highest distinction and a gentleman who illustrates the best type of American citizen - ship .

		Yet the newspaper press of the country has busied itself of late with the circulation of reports skilfully fabricated for the purpose of bringing him into disrepute .

		He has been charged with attempts to create sedition among our soldiers in the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	by send - ing them pamphlets in which they are coun - selled to disobey orders and even to desert from the ranks .

		That such a story as this could be believed by any rational being is a significant illustration of the present excited temper of the public mind , and indicates a danger that should be faced before it assumes uncontrolla - ble dimensions .

		The simple facts of the case are these : Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	prepared two pamphlets in which his views of war in general , and of the present war in particular , were set forth with the cogent logic of which he is so complete a master .

		These pamphlets were introduced into the debates of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at its last session and printed as pub - lic documents of the
United States	LOCATION	government .

		About three weeks ago , '' moved by a sense of profound indignation because it was said that parents of
Nebraska	LOCATION	volunteers in the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines were not allowed to communicate with their sons , and for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the
United States	LOCATION	mails were or were not open to the citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	residing in
Manila	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	noti - fied the administration that he wished to send some pamphlets to the islands , and , receiving no reply , made a test case by posting copies of these pamphlets to Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	, the chief officers of the army , and the members of the
Peace Commission	ORGANIZATION	to eight persons alto - gether . ''

		If this be treason , make the most of it , '' Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	might well say , and a sensa - tional newspaper press certainly has made the most of it .

		When we read that the Cabinet , in solemn conclave , has taken measures to ex - clude these pamphlets from the mails , we seem to be dealing with government as it is pictured in comic opera rather than as it is practised by a great nation .

		And when we recall the fact that the pamphlets thus excluded are public documents of the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	, we may
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL S27 get some notion of what Senator
Hoar	PERSON	meant the other day when he spoke of taking up this subject upon some future occasion .

		One more illustration of the existing menace to free discussion , and we have done .

		The meeting held in
Chicago	LOCATION	on the thirtieth of
April	DATE	for the purpose of protesting against the war in
the Philippines	LOCATION	was so notable for the sober dignity of the addresses made , for the deep earnestness with which they were received , and for the high character of the immense au - dience which the occasion brought together , that it made a profound impression upon the public mind .

		The presiding officer of this meeting was President
Henry Wade Rogers	PERSON	, of the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, and his special contribution to the programme was a statement of the Philippine question from the standpoint of international law , upon which he is an emi - nent authority .

		The conditions under which Dr.
Rogers	PERSON	was placed invested his activity upon this occasion with an unusual degree of moral courage , and all fair-minded persons , whether they may agree with his opinions or not , will hold him higher in their esteem than ever before , just because he has convictions , and recognizes the duty of giving them utter - ance , whatever the cost .

		The way in which Dr.
Rogers	PERSON	has been attacked , during the past fortnight , by ribald newspapers and hot-headed individuals , is perhaps the best illustration that has yet come to our notice of the malign influ - ences that are now at work endeavoring to stifle free discussion by terrorism , and is cer - tainly a disgrace to our civilization .

		But such an incident as this , however unpleasant to chronicle as it is at the time , is really a hope - ful happening , and impels us to recur directly to what we would have our readers take for the keynote of the present discussion namely : that with a public like ours , intolerance always reacts upon the intolerant , and prepares the way for its own discomfiture . ''

		BALLADS ,
Critical Reviews	ORGANIZATION	, Tales , Various Essays , Letters , Sketches , etc. '' make up the miscellaneous con - tents of the thirteenth and last volume of the '' biog - raphical ''
Thackeray	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It proves to be the stoutest volume of the thirteen , and surprisingly inter - esting .

		Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	's introduction alone extends to upwards of eighty pages , and her random biography , now completed , is here supplemented by a reprint of Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's article on
Thackeray	PERSON	written for the '' Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		There are nearly two hundred and fifty pages of the poems alone a quantity of matter far greater than most readers imagine , and the illustrations provided with this vol - ume are unusually numerous and interesting .

		THE KIPLING HYSTERIA .

		Only the hardihood of intense conviction , coupled with a stern sense of duty , impels men , as a rule , to advance an opinion diametrically opposite to the general , at a time when that general opinion has developed into a cult , and a cult militant to boot .

		But there is always high need , in all matters human , of men who are willing to stand alone or with few at their side .

		In the domain of letters proper there is perhaps no such constant necessity for this as in civics , pol - itics , or religious affairs .

		Yet we note in literary annals how frequently the protesting voice of one period becomes the commanding voice of another .

		The voices of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, for exam - ple , though promulgating different protests and artistic preachments , combined to influence for the better the makers of English verse in the
last half century	DATE	.

		To less trivial themes , to loftier views of the function of Art , they directly and indirectly incited ; and to a straightforwardness and simplic - ity of style , in the main , that reached its highest and most shining point in the calm work of
Tenny	PERSON	- son , concerning whom our best critical writer has said : '' His alone are idiosyncratic poems .

		By the enjoyment or non-enjoyment of the ' Morte D' Ar - thur ' or of the ' -LRB-
Enone	ORGANIZATION	' I would test anyone 's ideal sense .

		Other bards produce effects which are , now and then , otherwise produced than by what we call poems ; but
Tennyson	LOCATION	, an effect which only a poem does . ''

		Now we have recently been commanded by a storm of tongues to consider that the true poetic heir of
Alfred the Great	ORGANIZATION	has arrived in the pictur - esque person of
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has been acclaimed the laureate of the Anglo-Saxon race which , however , as an ethnic entity has about as much vital value as
Sairy Gamp	PERSON	's mysterious chum , Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	; and a prodigious amount of hyster - ical and chimerical stuff has been written of him , and even to him , by disciples and imitators toward whom he doubtless entertains a feeling compound of ennui and contempt .

		To this hysteria of unreasoned admiration , to this toy tempest of flatulent adulation , the dangerous illness of this forceful and brilliant writer has nat - urally given increase .

		But already signs of a reac - tion are appearing .

		Trained minds are beginning to question the new gospel of poesy and morals , art and ethics , as enunciated by and personified in this immensely clever and uniquely interesting English - man .

		Dr.
Felix Adler	PERSON	recently , while cheerfully admitting the talents of Kipling , dared to denounce his teaching as a gospel of force , pernicious in the extreme and antagonistic to the true spirit of democ - racy and of civilization .

		It is not , however , with
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's jingoism and frank cynicism toward infe - rior races , as the
Apostle of Force	ORGANIZATION	, of Might against Right , that literature is concerned , except inasmuch as these essentially pagan and very antiquated sen - timents might be shown to affect his art .

		328 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, Since the writer of this was one of the first , if not the very first , of American reviewers to call attention to
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's powers as a composer of short stories , he can not be accused of any animosity on this point .

		Indeed , he maintained stoutly the rare promise indicated in the early output , when other critics were deriding it , and even Mr.
Howells	PERSON	to adopt the amusing phrase of a
New York	LOCATION	jour - nal was '' refusing Kipling a niche in the Temple of Fame , '' probably because Mr.
Howells	PERSON	had been too lavish of his niches , and had n't any fresh ones on hand just then , with the varnish dry and war - ranted not to crack .

		But how has that early promise been kept ?

		Bet - ter than most early promises , beyond a doubt ; yet , while in the realm of the short story Kipling stands with Cable and
Bret Harte	PERSON	, can he sanely be said to overtop them ; and has he as a presenter of hu - man character come anywhere near
Thackeray	PERSON	or
George Eliot	PERSON	to say nothing of Balzac ?

		Stress is laid on the extraordinary familiarity he shows with the technics and terminologies of different occu - pations and trades .

		But all that sort of stuff can be easily '' crammed . ''

		Any first-rate journalist will turn out a story on a subject of which he knew naught forty-eight hours before , if he can get access to a good library or even mingle socially for a few hours with men who have the terms of that subject at their tongue 's end .

		In the loftier region of poetry , what has Kipling done that should make him a laureate of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	race , even supposing there were such a thing ?

		Can any calmly critical mind regard the ''
Barrack	PERSON	- Room Ballads '' as more than clever ephemeralities , destined not even to the same place in future liter - ary estimation as
Lowell	PERSON	's ''
Biglow	PERSON	Papers '' now hold ?

		The `` Last Chantey , '' though marred by several serious blemishes in technique , strikes a bold , high note , and makes a felicitous nuptial of the gro - tesque and sublime which would have delighted that master in similar effects ,
Edgar Poe	PERSON	.

		The ''
Mary Gloster	PERSON	, '' though somewhat too risque '' , Virginians pnerisque , is a piece of rare power ; and some other things in like wise undoubtedly entitle Kipling to serious consideration as a poet .

		But , on the other hand , are not the most of his verses on the same plane with the work of many minor English and American poets ; and are not some , which have achieved wide popularity , echoes of other bards ?

		Such phrases as `` Euchred God Almighty 's storm , '' '' Bluffed the Eternal Sea , '' must have raised an amused and flattered smile on
Bret Harte	PERSON	's face ; and the metrical manner of '' The Vampire '' is that of
Poe	PERSON	in his ballad of ''
Annabel Lee	PERSON	'' a rather bad manner , too , in some thinking , or , at least , one close to triviality .

		The phrase '' hank of hair , '' by the bye , is '' rem - inisced '' from
Browning	PERSON	's poem ''
James Lee	PERSON	's Wife . ''

		As for the much-belauded '' Recessional , '' while the sentiment , aside from laying claim to
Jehovah	PERSON	as peculiarly the God of the English , is far healthier , saner , and more to the purpose of civilization , than much of Kipling 's , who will seriously assert that so far as technique or style goes there are not a dozen Englishmen who could have put the case as well or better ?

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	does n't count for much , of course , though that luckless official laureate has written some good verses ; but , surely ,
Henley	LOCATION	, or
Rennell Rodd	PERSON	, has given earnest of better work than this .

		And if we may venture to consider critically that jingo jingle , '' The White Man 's Burden '' entirely apart from its horrible cynical indifference to the plainest facts of modern history , what can be said in defense of its style ?

		Taking the same measure as that of
Heber	PERSON	's noble hymn '' From
Greenland	LOCATION	's Icy Mountains , '' to do which in itself seems like a covert sneer against the spirit of Christianity , the laureate of the Anglo-Saxon myth falls far behind the good , unlaurelled bishop in technique , as anyone can see by comparing the two productions .

		Heber 's is double-rhymed , flow - ing , musical : and without rhetorical inversions of phrase .

		It leaves on the inner ear of the mind , as on the outer , a sense of beauty as well as a sense of benevolence .

		Kipling 's is calculated to make those who `` learn Messiah 's name '' learn it chiefly to curse with .

		Must not a great poet be a reflector , at least , if not an inspirer , of the noblest passions of his age and of the unfolding spirit of general hu - manity ?

		How much nobler than anything Kipling has cas - ually emitted in his glorifications of force or his clanging apotheoses of machinery , British muscle and British trade , are these quiet lines of
Rennell Rodd	ORGANIZATION	a name dimly known to his own country - men , and not at all to us !

		Singing to future men of Future Man , this poet declares : '' They shall build their new romances , new dreams of a world to be ; Conceive a snblimer outcome than the end of the world we see ; And their maids shall be pure as morning and their youth shall be taught no lie ; But all shall be smooth and open to all men beneath the sky .

		And the shadow shall ` pass that we dwell in , till under the self-same sun The names of the myriad nations are writ in the name of one . ''

		Not writ by the sword , ye semi-civilized Apostles and
Disciples of Force	ORGANIZATION	and Fraud , but by the pen .

		It is this lamentable large lack in the spirit , in the outlook and the insight , in the foresight , if you will , of the richly-endowed man of talent , now recipient of so much loose laudation in American-speaking lands , which moves a warm admirer of his talent , and of all talents , to assert that , unless that lack shall be remedied , he has not the making of a great , enduring poet .

		That he may break away from false ideals , and renounce bad literary manners , remains a hope .

		He is yet gloriously young , and to youth all things are possible .

		THE DIAL 329 COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE PASSING OF THE MAN-POET .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the current issue of '' The Nation , '' the reviewer of recent poetry rightly finds that the best of that poetry is by women .

		There is nothing surprising in this .

		It is more surprising that , as opinion trends , there should now be any poetry at all to speak of that is not by women .

		The fact is , men -LRB- manly men , I mean -RRB- are growing more and more shy of writing poetry , or at least of letting people know they do it , because they feel that a man making verses is more or less a ridiculous object .

		So if they do make verses it is usually sub rosa , in the secresy of their sanctums , and with every precaution against being caught red-handed in the act .

		Our age is practical .

		The sensibility that men used a hundred years ago to pride themselves on is nowadays looked on as a weakness in men at least .

		Prose is felt to be the essentially masculine form of expression , and the more prosaic the prose the more masculine it is felt to be .

		The old lurking popular notion that there is some - thing unmanly , or unmasculine , in the make-up of the poet has gained ground .

		As
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	says somewhere , '' A poet , with a great many people , seems a sort of woman . ''

		They expect to find him as Chi - cago 's acute thinker , '' Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	, '' expected to find Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	`` in a shirt-waist . ''

		They accept him grudgingly as a man , an all-round manly man , only on condition that his poetry is essentially good strong prose , virile prose cut up in lengths , like Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's .

		Their gorge rises at the notion of a big , brawny , bearded he-creature like
Tennyson	PERSON	, with the frame of a coal-heaver and the face of a buccaneer , chirping about '' Airy , fairy
Lilian	PERSON	, '' crooning cradle - songs , or caterwauling in erotic strain over love and the moon .

		This current impression of a hard-fact , practical age the impression , namely , that writing verse is an effeminate pursuit has to be reckoned with by men who want to keep the respect of their ruggeder fellows .

		Will anyone deny that Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	went down several pegs in the estimation of the practical world as a virile philosophic thinker the moment he shocked his friends with that ill-omened volume of verse ?

		That the book contained proof positive that Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	was not a poet did not much help the matter , for few people read it .

		In fine , the trend of opinion points to the eventual van - ishing of the man-poet .

		This view will probably find small grace in your eyes ; and to forestall rebuke I sub - scribe myself PHILISTER .


Kansas City	LOCATION	,

		TENNYSON BIBLIOGRAPHIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Within very recent years at least four noteworthy bibliographies of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's works have appeared : Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's in the
Study of Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- now in its tenth edition -RRB- , Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's in his Tennyson Primer , Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	's in the Memoir , and Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	's in the
Cambridge Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Students of the poet are under the greatest obligation to these workers , for they have given us a substantially correct and complete list of all his most important works .

		Especially must we who are unfortunately isolated from great libraries cherish the sense of personal gratitude for these guides through
Tennyson	PERSON	land .

		There is one respect , however , in which these other - wise excellent guides are likely to lead the special stu - dent astray : they give so much that they tempt us to believe they give all .

		But this they do not do .

		For example , no one mentions a later edition of the '' Poems '' than the eighth , published in
1853	DATE	, and having men - tioned so many the natural inference is that this eighth edition was the last .

		The mind is lead almost unavoid - ably to this conclusion in following the very full lists of Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	and Professor
Dixon	PERSON	, where complete - ness seems to be aimed at .

		But the fact is , however , that between the year
1853	DATE	, when the eighth edition was published , and the
year 1872	DATE	, when according to Prof - essor
Dixon	PERSON	the next edition appeared , there were issued no less than eleven editions , as follows : the ninth in
1853	DATE	, the tenth in
1855	DATE	, eleventh in
1856	DATE	, twelfth in
1858	DATE	, thirteenth in
1860	DATE	, fourteenth in
1862	DATE	, fifteenth in
1863	DATE	, sixteenth in
1864	DATE	, seventeenth in
1865	DATE	, eight - eenth in
1866	DATE	, and the unnumbered edition by
Strahan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in
1870	DATE	.

		These are all , except the last , from the same -LRB-
Moxon	PERSON	-RRB- press as the earlier editions ; are num - bered as above ; and corrections and additions , slight to be sure , are found in most of them ; so that they deserve a place in a complete bibliography .

		What is true of the '' Poems '' is equally true of '' The Princess , '' '' In Memoriam , '' ''
Maud	PERSON	, '' and the '' Idylls of the King . ''

		Professor
Dixon	PERSON	mentions no later edi - tion of '' In Memoriam '' than the fourth published in
1851	DATE	, nor any later of The Princess '' than the fifth in
1853	DATE	, nor any later of '' Maud '' than the second in
1856	DATE	.

		But there are many later editions , not mere reprints but numbered editions usually with alterations .

		Of '' In Memoriam '' there are at least eighteen editions , of '' The Princess '' seventeen , and of '' Maud '' four - teen .

		Some of these later editions are of much import - ance , for example , the sixth of '' In Memoriam . ''

		Excellent as are these lists already published , still it is evident that an exhaustive bibliography of
Tennyson	PERSON	's works is a desideratum .

		Head downward , brutelike , pent in selfish ways Who wanders stumbling , shall decry at best The vision shattered , meaningless , confused : Kosmos , for him , to Chaos turned again .

		And ever as the pathway onward runs The life and color vanish from the scene .

		If he had comrades , mute they slip away Into the shadow as the twilight nears .

		Companionless and dreaded is the dusk : Grimmer and closer steals the spectre pale .

		But he who seeks and holds the bench assigned , Although it be the lowest , straightway feels His straining muscles keep harmonious time To the great pulse that bears the galley on .

		His foamswept porthole rims a glorious world .

		With every passing hour the vision clears , A simpler meaning linking all to each .

		Sped by his stroke with those who toil beside Triumphant fares the great ship past the shores Of time , upon the path to wider ways .

		Perchance , in happiest hours , he wins a glimpse Of that unmeasured curve whereon we sweep Through countless a3ons toward the goal undreamed .

		MR.
MURRAY	PERSON	'S BYRON .

		* It is now many years since
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, speaking of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and of
Byron	PERSON	, made his somewhat bold prophecy : '' When the year
1900	DATE	is turned , and our nation comes to recount her poetic glories in the century which has then just ended , the first names with her will be these . ''

		This was said at a time when some - thing was still to be expected from
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Browning	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	, and when Kipling was but a boy of sixteen .

		We are now very near the date referred to , and already the achievements of the nineteenth century seem to recede in rapidly diminishing perspective .

		Partly , doubtless , owing to the influence of Ar - nold himself , English -LRB- or Anglo-American -RRB- criticism is less provincial than formerly , and consequently saner and less intolerant .

		Byron is coming to hold some such place in our esti - mate as he has long held in the estimate of the '' Amphictyonic Council of European opinion '' which
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	used to appeal to .

		He is no longer without honor even in his own country .

		It seems a piece of justice which may fitly be called poetic , that now , in the closing year of the cen - tury , a
John Murray	PERSON	in Albemarle Street should be engaged in the publication , on the most generous scale , of the complete works of Lord
Byron	PERSON	.

		Nearly two years ago I spoke in these '' col - umnsf of Mr.
W. E. Henley	PERSON	's interesting first volume of an edition of Byron .

		Inasmuch as no second volume has been issued , it may be pre - sumed that the project has been dropped .

		Con - sidering the greater completeness and attract - iveness of Mr.

Henley	PERSON	from the field is on the whole not greatly to be regretted .

		Could he be prevailed upon to utilize his materials in another way , and to devote his great talents to the writing of a definitive biography of

		I See THE DIAL ,
September 1 , 1897	DATE	.

		Mr.
Murray	PERSON	has at command great masses of unpublished Byron manuscripts which are be - ing utilized for the present edition .

		Thus , while Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's volume contains 231 letters , Mr.
Murray	PERSON	's two volumes , covering the same period , contain 379 .

		The text varies consid - erably in detail , and there are some passages omitted by
Henley	ORGANIZATION	and restored in the present edition .

		It is to be presumed that these pas - sages , which often contain some freedom of ex - o pression , are restored from originals to which Mr.
Henley	PERSON	was denied access ; but one is puz - zled to find some such free expressions in
Hen	ORGANIZATION	- ley 's text which are omitted in
Murray 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are two instances of this in the letter to
Drury	PERSON	of
June 25 , 1809	DATE	.

		Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	, the editor of the '' Letters and Journals , '' informs us that a bundle of letters from
Byron	PERSON	's father '' still exists , to attest , with startling plainness of speech , the strength of the tendencies which
John Byron	PERSON	transmitted to his son . ''

		The only passage containing an allusion to the child is printed here ; but why not print them all ?

		It would be absurd to sup - press them at this time of day on account of their '' startling plainness of speech . ''

		In an age when even novelists deem it necessary to invent pedigrees for their heroes , the suppres - sion of a '' human document '' of such interest as these letters is a sheer anachronism .

		Noth - ing that advances our knowledge of man should be withheld .

		Moreover , in the present instance the suppression is a wrong to the poet 's mem - ory , which would surely be held in greater honor could we know more about '' his birth 's invidious bar . ''

		They would form quite as ap - propriate an appendix as do the letters of Ber - nard
Barton	PERSON	or of Lady
Caroline Lamb	PERSON	.

		For Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	's editing of the Letters I have little but praise .

		He is vigilant , judicious , and barring a few minor slips accurate .

		His notes are not masterpieces of characteriza - tion like many of Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's , nor have they the defects incident to the latter 's lively tem - per and positive opinions .

		Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	's notes are very full perhaps as full as Mr.
Hen	PERSON	- ley 's : they are never obtrusive or impertinent , and they often contain information not supplied by the earlier editor .

		Most of the notes are biographical ; no one is mentioned in the let - ters about whom something is not told us .

		The same is true of Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	's edition of the early poems .

		These notes will make this edi - tion a mine of information concerning
Byron	PERSON	's friends and contemporaries .

		Sometimes infor - mation given by Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	is repeated by
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	, and there is no system of cross - references to notes on the same subject .

		Thus , in Volume II .

		of the '' Letters and Journals '' there is a long note , beginning at page 314 , on Monk
Lewis	PERSON	.

		At page 356 there is a short note concerning him ; and at page 317 of the Poems Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	gives another biography of
Lewis	PERSON	, apropos of the reference to him in '' English Bards and Scotch Reviewers . ''

		- We can only trust that it is the intention of the editors to enable the reader to coordinate all these notes by means of an index at the end of the whole work ; but even with an index a sys - tem of cross-references is a time-saver , partic - ularly in a work like this of many volumes .

		Of Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	's work I will only say that it seems to be well done , although his scrupulos - ity in giving variant readings for the '' Hours of Idleness '' seems a bit pedantic .

		Variant readings to poems that are themselves of no human interest , except as having been written by a great poet in the nonage of his muse , might surely be dispensed with .

		If the dulness of the verse is mortal , these variants give us '' super - fluous death . ''

		Encouraged by such a fatal example , some candidate for
University	ORGANIZATION	honors may any day present us with an apparatus crit - icus to the '' Poems of Two
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' or a variorum edition of '' Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire '' !

		In the Preface to the Letters , Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	sets forth three special grounds on which they appeal '' to all lovers of English literature . '' ''

		They offer , '' he asserts , '' the most suggestive commentary on his poetry ; they give the truest portrait of the man ; they possess , at their best , in their ease , freshness , and racy vigor , a very high literary value . ''

		Every one of these asser - tions may be true , but I , for one , can not accept them without question .

		Perhaps a brief exam - ination of them here may be at least suggestive .

		Let us select one or two passages which are good samples of what we find by way of com - mentary on the poems .

		Byron writes laconic - ally to
Murray	PERSON	under date of
September , 1813	DATE	: '' Dear Sir , Pray suspend the proofs for I am bit - ten again and have quantities for other parts of The Giaour . ''

		Again in
November	DATE	to
Moore	LOCATION	, with reference this time to '' The Bride of
Abydos	LOCATION	'' : `` All convulsions end with me in rhyme ; and to sol - ace my midnights , I have scribbled another Turkish story not a Fragment which you will receive soon after this .

		It does not trench upon your kingdom in the least , and if it did , you would soon reduce me to my proper boundaries .

		You will think , and justly , that I run some risk of losing the little I have gained in fame , by this further experiment on public patience ; but I have really ceased to care on that head .

		I have written this and published it , for the sake of the em - ployment , to wring my thoughts from reality , and take refuge in ' imaginings , ' however ' horrible ' ; and as to success !

		those who succeed will console me for a failure excepting yourself and one or two more , whom luckily I love too well to wish one leaf of their laurels a tint yellower .

		This is the work of a week , and will be the reading of an hour to you , or even less , and so let it go ... '' The curious interest of many passages of which these are favorable examples is undeni - able .

		If merely these two were from the hand of Sophocles or of Shakespeare and had rela - tion to works of theirs , a certain number of inter - esting inferences might be drawn from them .

		They are sufficient to show that the author is probably on good terms with his publisher and with one or two rival poets ; that he writes rap - idly and is apt to be seized , at inconvenient moments , with the impulse to make additions and alterations ; that he puts , or affects to put , a modest estimate upon what he writes , and is willing to be thought to have '' ceased to care '' for fame ; that there is something in his life which he does not enjoy thinking about and so writes to solace his midnights ; these infer - ences might fairly be drawn , and in default of other evidence many others would doubtless be made , and would have more or less weight ac - cording to one 's faith in the truthfulness of the writer .

		Inferences like these , when abundantly supported by external evidence , are doubtless contributions to biographical knowledge , and so to our knowledge of man .

		But in what im - portant respect do they supply a commentary upon the poems in question ?

		Do we appre - ciate the '' Giaour '' or the '' Bride '' one whit the better for knowing these things , or from knowing that the author chose to assert them ?

		Does not the poetry of Byron find its best com - mentary in the events and the conditions of the time in which he lived ?

		Is not the character of its author writ large upon every page of it ?

		Are not the self-revelations
Byron	PERSON	gives us in his poetry incomparably deeper and truer than those given by the Letters ?

		This is of course not the place for anything like a satisfactory examination of such ques - tions as these .

		In going over the Letters once more , they have presented themselves to me more and more obstinately .

		Not that I would for a moment deny the very great interest of the Letters ; but who can fail to see that , in comparison with the poetry , the Letters are superficial and external ?

		Still , the true
Byron	PERSON	is here , there can be no doubt of it ; and the true
Byron	PERSON	none the less that he is often un - 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, true to his better self .

		Here are
Byron	PERSON	's flip - pant wit , his impatience , his rebellious temper , his foible of taking his role at times for reality , of forgetting himself at moments in the part he fancies he plays .

		Tangled in with this com - plex skein we descry traits of penetrating insight , of English moderation and good sense , of delicate generosity , of self-forgetful friend - liness .

		In order to perceive all this , one must have some faith in the man and not be so hasty as to mistake a passing cloud for the sun 's eclipse .

		In order to know
Byron	PERSON	for the manly fellow he is , one must have the tact to take him off his guard .

		The moment he fancies the
eye %	PERCENT	of the world fixed curiously upon him , he be - comes self-conscious ; and what follows is too apt to be something for which there is no one sufficient English word , but which the French expressively term grimace .

		The sad miscon - ception that some have fallen into , that
Byron	PERSON	is a hollow personage one chiefly histrionic may be partly due to unsympathetic and undiscriminatiug reading of his Letters and Journals .

		The quite external things they re - cord need to be related by the reader to other things that are not recorded , to a thousand causes that are not disclosed to the casual or impatient reader .

		In brief , an exercise of imagination is required in order to create the true , deep , living
Byron	PERSON	from the data furnished by the Betters .

		Letters , journals , anecdotes , show him as he looked , not altogether as he was .

		They show
Byron	PERSON	in two dimensions ; an effort of creative imagination may body him forth in three dimensions .

		To claim '' a very high literary value '' for these Letters implies the ascription to them of qualities by virtue of which they would retain an interest quite independent of their author - ship .

		In the time of
Madame de Sevigne	ORGANIZATION	, letter - writing was a branch of fine art , and her letters belong to literature as undeniably as do the '' Characters '' of La Bruyere .

		Madame de Sevigne is at her best in her letters ;
Byron	PERSON	is , in a literary sense , pretty nearly at his worst in his .

		He dashed them off at the last moment be - fore going to bed in the small hours , and they commonly show the low spirits of a man jaded with pleasure , bored by society , or exhausted by production . ''

		I am dull and drowsy , as usual .

		I do nothing , and even that nothing fatigues me . ''

		Confidences like these would be worse than tedious coming from a person otherwise unknown .

		Such things are the mere expression of the momentary mood , or even excuses for slap-dash brevity .

		Byron seldom takes pleas - ure in writing a letter , but writes the necessary things in the tersest terms .

		His letters to Mur - ray often have the ring of a skipper giving orders in the teeth of a gale .

		Not that he is morose , but dead tired : one fairly sees him fling pen on table and himself into bed .

		When he chances to be in high spirits , as he occasion - ally is , he lets himself run on in an amusing if not always a becoming style .

		The anecdotage of the Letters strikes one as not especially tasteful ; and the philosophy is that of one who says in his haste that all men are liars , and other things almost as bad !

		The letters writ - ten during his travels in the East are for the most part extremely summary , not to say per - functory .

		There is absolutely nothing of that loving and lingering description which delights us in the letters written from
Italy	LOCATION	by
Shelley just ten years later	DATE	.

		There are , indeed , two long letters of Byron to his mother , one from
Gibraltar	LOCATION	giving some account of his adven - tures with the women of
Spain	LOCATION	; another de - scribing his visit to
Ali Pacha	LOCATION	.

		To judge from the Letters , the incident of his travels to which he attached the greatest importance was his exploit of swimming the Hellespont , which he refers to in at least ten different letters .

		It is obvious that he was reserving all his art for ''
Childe Harold	PERSON	, '' which is the real diary of his voyage , and to which the Letters furnish but a lean commentary .

		The volumes before us contain only the Letters down to the end of
1813	DATE	, when
Byron	PERSON	had not yet completed his twenty-fifth year .

		Those that are to come will be in most respects more interesting , and the great numbers of unpublished ones are looked forward to with some curiosity .

		When this beautiful edition is once completed , we shall be for the first time in a position to form something like a true image of what the man
Byron	PERSON	really was .

		By that time , too , it is to be hoped , a truer esti - mate of Byron the poet will prevail .

		Re-read to-day , his poetry seems singularly fresh , partly , doubtless , by reason of the fashionable neglect of it .

		That it has some saving quali - ties , I believe : but this is a large subject which must be reserved for a later article .

		THE DIAL 333 THE WRITINGS or PRESIDENT
MONROE	PERSON	.

		* Historically , the new interest that has sprung up in the writings of our early statesmen is a most encouraging feature of our intellectual life .

		Politically , we do not feel so confident .

		It is indeed difficult to judge in such matters ; but we can not lay aside the belief that the new interest belongs much more to students , teach - ers , and writers of history , than to our politi - cians and statesmen .

		Still , if this is the case it does not follow that the new interest will not touch and influence politics ; for the work of the scholars and writers , through their own writings and the men that they send out from the colleges and universities , is sure to enter more or less into the circles of political life .

		The list of splendid editions of the works of early American statesmen that the Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons have brought out within the last few years , beginning with
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	and closing for the time with
James Monroe	PERSON	, has immediately prompted the forego - ing remarks .

		Some of these editions have been second or third ones , although generally or always more complete than the earlier editions ; others are wholly new .

		This is the case with this last candidate for the public favor : no collection of the writings of
Monroe	PERSON	until now had ever apppeared .

		In view of his long and successful career of more than fifty years , this seems not a little strange .


Monroe	PERSON	was a gal - lant soldier in the Revolution ; served in the legislature and executive council of
Virginia	LOCATION	; sat in the Old
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and in the
National Senate	ORGANIZATION	; was twice governor of his native state ; represented his country in
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	; was a prominent member of Presi - dent
Madison	PERSON	's cabinet ; was twice president himself , and finally retired from the public view as he laid down the presidency of the con - vention which sat in 1829-30 to revise the constitution of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		And yet , as Presi - dent Oilman said in the introduction to his useful biography : '' No adequate memoir of his life has been written ; and while the papers of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Adams	PERSON	,
Jefferson	PERSON	, and
Madison	PERSON	his four predecessors in the office of president have been collected and printed in a con - venient form , the student of
Monroe	ORGANIZATION	's career must search for the data in numerous public documents and in the unassorted files of unpublished correspondence . ''

		* THE WHITINGS OF
JAMES MONROE	PERSON	.

		Including a collec - tion of his public and private papers and correspondence , now for the first time printed .

		Edited by
Stanislas Murray	PERSON	Ham - ilton .

		Volumes I. and II. , 1778-1796 .


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		We offer no explanation of this strange fact , although we shall presently state a circumstance that may suggest a part of the explanation .

		But now the reproach , whatever the cause may have been , is about to be removed ; we have the first two volumes of an edition of
Monroe	PERSON	that promises to be all that our historical schol - ars and public men could reasonably expect .

		The materials to draw upon , the editor thus describes : ''
Monroe	PERSON	has left material in the shape of notes , together with a large collection of letters from and to the most distinguished men of this and other countries .

		In the early period , while in congress , his correspond - ence with
Jefferson	PERSON	and
Madison	PERSON	is the most conspicu - ous .

		With both , for nearly the whole of his life , he maintained relations of great confidential intercourse , and was closely connected with them in many important official trusts .

		Such intercourse led to a constant inter - change of intelligence , opinions , and views , resulting in an immense mass of correspondence and documentary history .

		That which marks the period of the War of
1812	DATE	is of great importance in exhibiting the untiring zeal and patriotism that lightened the public councils of the nation during that gloomy period .

		The letters written during his missions to
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and En - gland , contain instructive lessons to students in Amer - ican diplomacy . ''

		Of the places where these materials are found , he tells us : '' The greater part of this collection was acquired by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	from
Monroe	PERSON	's heirs , under an appropriation of
$ 20,000	MONEY	by Act approved
March 3 , 1849	DATE	.

		These manuscripts are now deposited in the
Bureau of Rolls	ORGANIZATION	and Library of the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	, handsomely mounted and bound and calendared ; others are in our greater libraries and familiar archives , and many yet remain in the hands of individual owners .

		From the greater collection this edition is substantially drawn ; but generous and cordial responses from other sources have enabled me to include many of the scattered papers . ''

		The first volume consists mainly of letters .

		The series opens with one to
Washington	LOCATION	dated
June 28 , 1778	DATE	, and closes with one to
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
June 6 , 1794	DATE	, dates which will suggest to the reader that the series does not cover the most important events of
Monroe	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		And yet many interesting transactions are included within these two dates .

		We may mention in particular the adoption of the
Federal Consti	ORGANIZATION	- tution .


Monroe	PERSON	was a member of the
Virginia	LOCATION	convention that ratified the Constitution , and , as is well known , took the wrong side ; but this he did in a manner thoroughly consonant with the general tenor of his mind and life , that is , with moderation .

		The letters that deal with these matters , especially those to
Jefferson	LOCATION	, while they perhaps do not yield new light , are nevertheless interesting reading .

		Writing to
Jefferson	LOCATION	, then in
Paris	LOCATION	,
April 10 , 1788	DATE	, Mon - 334 THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, roe sums up the situation as he sees it at the time , with these words : '' The event of this business is altogether incertain , as to its passage thro the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		That it will nowhere be rejected admits of little doubt .

		And that it will ulti - mately , perhaps in 2 or three years terminate in some wise and happy establishment for our country , is what we have good reason to expect . ''

		On
July 12	DATE	of the same year , after the Vir - ginia ratification , he explains to the same cor - respondent that it is really a conditional ratifi - cation , and offers some remarks upon the course pursued throughout by
Washington	LOCATION	: '' The conduct of Genl .


Washington	LOCATION	upon this occasion has no doubt been right and meritorious .

		All parties had acknowledged defects in the federal system , and been sensible of the propriety of some material change .

		To forsake the honorable retreat to which he had retir 'd , & risque the reputation he had so deservedly acquired , manifested a zeal for the public interest , that could after so many and illustrious services , & at this stage of his life , scarcely have been expected from him .

		Having , however , commenc 'd again on the publick theatre , the course which he takes becomes not only highly inter - esting to him but likewise so to us : the human character is not perfect ; if he partakes of those qualities which we have too much reason to believe are almost insep - arable from the frail nature of our being , the people of
America	LOCATION	will perhaps be lost .

		Be assured his influence carried this government ; for my own part I have a boundless confidence in him , nor have I any reason to believe he will ever furnish occasion for withdrawing it .

		More is to be apprehended if he takes a part in the pub - lic councils again , as he advances in age , from the de - signs of those around him than from any disposition of his own . ''

		The two appendices , together making some ninety pages , contain the two forms of a pam - phlet on the Constitution that
Monroe	PERSON	laid be - fore his constituents on the eve of the
Virginia	LOCATION	convention , the first one of which , however , was never published .

		Volume II. , consisting also of correspond - ence , covers the three years 1794-5-6 .

		Events now move much more rapidly than before ; for
Monroe	PERSON	is the minister plenipotentiary of his country in
Paris	LOCATION	, which is seething with all the interests and passions of the Revolution .

		The first letter is from
Randolph	PERSON	to
Monroe	PERSON	, con - veying
Washington	LOCATION	's instructions ; the last one , from
Monroe	PERSON	to
Pickering	LOCATION	,
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, just before the minister 's recall from the em - bassy .

		The threatening relations of the two republics are all the time at the front , but other important questions as
Jay	PERSON	's Treaty , and the negotiations with the
Barbary States	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	are not far in the background .

		The letters are nearly all addressed to the
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	, the
French Committee of Pub	ORGANIZATION	-
lic Safety and Minister of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, Mad - ison and
Jefferson	PERSON	.

		Notes are more frequent than in the previous volume .

		The editor will find a provoking blunder in the '' Contents '' : the letters to
Madison	PERSON	and the Secretary of State have changed places -LRB- pp. 456 , 460 -RRB- .

		The value of both volumes is enhanced by '' annals '' of
Monroe	ORGANIZATION	's life , which materially assist the reader in keeping track of contemporary events .

		The place that President
Monroe	PERSON	will hold in history is already settled , at least so far as his general classification is concerned .

		Particular facts in his life may become more significant or less significant as time goes on ; these Writings will more fully illuminate his public career ; but nothing can occur that will advance him to the first rank among our statesmen , or relegate him to the third rank .

		In this sense he is a second-rate man , standing well up in his class .

		This is the circumstance referred to above as possibly tending to explain why his works have never before been published .

		To us , the most interesting feature in his long and useful life is his thorough comprehension of the problem of the territorial integrity of the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	, what it involved , and the policies by which it must be maintained .

		One interesting instance or proof of this comprehension is covered by the open - ing volume : namely , his opposition , in common with Southern men generally , to any surrender or yielding of our rights on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, at the time of
Jay	PERSON	's unsuccessful negotiations with
Gardoqui	PERSON	.

		The remarks that we had intended to offer on this interesting topic , however , may well be held in reserve until the progress of the publication brings further evidence of the same comprehension before us .

		ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE MODERN PLAY .

		There are not nearly so many peo - ple who enjoy reading a play they have not seen , as enjoy reading a novel .

		THE DIAL 335 aeter .

		A play leaves character and scenery , when you read it , largely to the tender mercies of our imagination .

		In fact , a play has a great deal that we like in a novel , and it does not have a good deal that we do not like .

		Why , then , should not people like to read plays ?

		One thing that may have something to do with the matter is that the drama is not , in
America	LOCATION	, an entirely recognized branch of lit - erature , or rather of contemporary literature .

		Say what we will of what ought to be , the fact is that it is not , taking the general conception of literature which commonly obtains .

		When we think of current literature , we think of novels , poems , essays , histories , but not of plays .

		This may be a cause or an effect of people 's not reading plays ; it would take too long to deter - mine which .

		Abroad , the drama is far more a recognized branch of literature .

		In
America	LOCATION	there are certainly several novelists and poets who have now and then cast their .

		work in dramatic form , but as a rule it is merely for their own amuse - ment , or as an experiment , or as a wholly minor matter .

		Nor do these dramatic pieces see the stage except in private .

		On the other hand , our dramatists do not publish their plays : they write for the stage , and not for book form .

		Thus , although we may hear that '' Secret Ser - vice '' or ''
Nathan Hale	PERSON	'' has '' literary quality , '' or `` is literature , '' or something of the sort , yet there is no good way of knowing anything about it .

		To some degree , the matter is different in
England	LOCATION	.

		There , two of the popular play - wrights , Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	and Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, publish their plays ; and so do two of the non-popular , Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	.

		Still , even in
England	LOCATION	the matter does not go quite as far as it does on the Continent .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, in
Norway	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	, we have the spectacle , curious to us , of men of letters of commanding reputations both at home and abroad being dramatists , and generally dram - atists successful on the stage .

		Hence there is more point in translating foreign plays than there would be in translating English plays .

		English and American plays are not as a rule significant of anything except the popular taste ;
Continental	ORGANIZATION	plays often are .

		Ibsen ,
Maeter	PERSON	- linck ,
Rostand	PERSON	,
Sudermann	LOCATION	,
Hauptmann	PERSON	, these are representative names , as representative almost as any in contemporary letters that could be found .

		Thus , although we may not think of it at once , a series like '' Modern Plays , '' of which the first three volumes are before us , offers us something which we may well be really glad to have .

		Plays have been as a rule less translated than novels .

		We can , it is true , read almost all of Ibsen or
Maeterlinck	PERSON	in English , but we can read only a play or two of
Hauptmann	LOCATION	,
Sudermann	LOCATION	,
Rostand	PERSON	, and generally nothing at all by many lesser men whose work yet has a good deal of interest .

		The plays chosen for translation in this series have a good deal of interest : there are also a number of interesting plays which are not so far announced .

		Thus , it is good to have something by Villiers de 1 ` Isle
Adam	PERSON	, and of
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	, espe - cially if one likes to read
Maeterlinck	PERSON	: we get thereby a better idea of the tendencies of dra - matic writing .

		But I can not see why we have nothing in the list by the German dramatists ; even if the work of the strongest men is to appear elsewhere , there are other plays , like
Ernst Rosmer	ORGANIZATION	's `` Konigskinder '' or
Fulda	LOCATION	's `` Talisman , '' to show that there are dramatists in
Germany	LOCATION	as well as in
Belgium	LOCATION	or
Norway	LOCATION	or
Russia	LOCATION	.

		But to turn to the plays that are translated , instead of carping about those that are not .

		Of the three volumes issued , `` The Storm , '' by
Ostrovsky	PERSON	, is probably the greatest stranger to all not especially acquainted with Russian lit - erature .

		It is a modern play in the same sense in which we might call '' La Dame aux Game - lias '' modern ; it was written about the same time .

		But of course mere chronology does not settle such a matter : we think of '' The Ordeal of
Richard Feverel	PERSON	'' as being `` modern '' in a sense in which ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' and '' Pen - dennis '' are not , although the three come in the same decade .

		Still , I rather think that '' The Storm '' is of about the same generation as `` Fathers and Sons '' or `` War and Peace , '' which means that , however good in itself , it is hardly significant of contemporary thought .

		Good in itself the play is .

		Realism has lost a little of its fascination for us , partly through self - consciousness and its consequences .

		A realist nowadays can hardly help being self - conscious , can he ?

		Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	shows genius in not being so .

		Ostrovsky wrote before realism was fashionable , and it is therefore refreshing to read his play .

		Something has been said as to its value in psychology and its reflecting the life of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		On the whole , so far as those matters are concerned , I should be more inter - ested in the work of a psychologist , or of a traveller , say .

		In reading a play , I like it to be chiefly a play .

		This '' The Storm '' is , what - 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, ever else , although , as Miss
Garnett	PERSON	remarks , it is delightfully untheatrical . ''

		The Dawn , '' by
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	, I am not inclined to value very highly .

		There are un - doubtedly some rather stirring things about its method , for instance , the curious handling of the Groups which '' act as a single person of multiple and contradictory aspects . ''

		There are other things , too ; but if you ask for more than method , I think you will find the play strangely vague and illusory .

		It is a curious thing that when writers are dealing with Revolution they prefer to deal in sounding generalities .

		It was so in `` The Revolt of Islam , '' in `` The Tragic Comedians , '' in `` The Princess Casamassima . ''

		You hear of wonderful things , but you get small idea of what these things really are .

		Something of this difficulty exists in '' The Dawn . ''

		Now in real life when we get a leader of the people who deals only with phrases we call him a demagogue .

		I am not able to offer evidence that
Jacques Herenien	PERSON	was a greater man than
Cleon	PERSON	or
Dennis Kearney	PERSON	, although I think that was
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	's idea .

		The `` Three Plays '' of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	have been translated before ; indeed , two of them in this volume are reprinted .

		They are , however , excellent plays to have in the series , for they are very characteristic .

		`` Alladine and Palo - mides '' is representative of a romantic class consisting otherwise of `` Pelleas and
Meli	PERSON	- sande '' and '' Aglavaine and Selysette . '' ''

		In - terior '' represents the realistic class to which belong `` The Intruder '' and `` The Blind . ''

		`` The Death of Tintagiles '' hardly represents any class , although there is a good deal in it that reminds one of the fourth act of '' The Princess Maleine . ''

		Still , I always think of the play by itself : I think it has always been my favorite .

		The romantic plays I can not persuade myself to care for , except in a literary way .

		The realistic plays I certainly do like , in spite of their symbolism .

		It might seem that a play which , like `` The Death of Tintagiles , '' com - bined the drawbacks of both , would be less agreeable than either .

		On the contrary , as I have said , I like it better than the others , pos - sibly because it is more purely characteristic of its author . ''

		Modern Plays '' then , are so far interesting ; and from the announcements it would seem that the rest would be so .

		One thing at least may be said : Here are plays that you can probably never see on the stage ; if you want to know about them you will have to trust to the books .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		RTJSKIN , ROSSETTI , PR ^ RAPHAELITISM .

		* The publication of private correspondence should have its reason not merely in the fact that the writers were persons of distinction , but also in some intrinsic charm of the letters , or in their relation to particular time , influence , or social conditions .

		To students of the En - glish romantic movement , the volume ''
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	, Prseraphaelitism '' a collection of letters and other papers , edited by Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	can not fail to be of interest , but even they will hardly claim for its publication such ideal apology .

		The names are distin - guished indeed , but there is no special grace of writing , and the matter with certain nota - ble exceptions , which constitute about a fourth of the volume is either purely personal or of small importance , while the connection , even of the excepted fourth , with Prasraphaelite prin - ciples and history is but slightly apparent save to those already familiar and concerned with them .

		It is for such , perhaps , that the book is intended ; certainly they will be its close read - ers , and they will probably find in the more im - portant passages an excuse , at least , for the publication of the whole .

		The papers which include , besides letters , a few miscellaneous items , and fragments from the diaries of
Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	and
W. M. Ros	PERSON	- setti belong to the period between
1854	DATE	and
1862	DATE	.

		Among the most interesting as one who knows his
Ruskin	PERSON	might expect are Rus - kin 's letters to
Rossetti	PERSON	, which suggest keenly the writer 's character and beliefs .

		Their criti - cism is , as a rule , concerned with
Rossetti	PERSON	's own work , but once or twice becomes quite general in application .

		In a letter of
1854	DATE	with regard to some ordered sketches the critic preaches thus to the young painter : '' Now about myself and your drawings .

		I am not more sure of anything in this world -LRB- and I am very positive about a great many things -RRB- than that the utmost a man can do is that which he can do without effort .

		All beau - tiful work singing , painting , dancing , speaking is the easy result of long and painful practice .

		Immedi - ate effort always leads to shrieking , blotching , postur - ing , mouthing .

		If you send me a picture in which you try to do your best , you may depend upon it it will be beneath your proper mark of power , and will disappoint me .

		If you make a careless couple of sketches , with bright and full colour in them , you are sure to do what will please me .

		... I do n't say this in the slightest de - gree out of delicacy , to keep you from giving me too much time .

		If I really liked the laboured sketch better , I would take it at once .

		I tell you the plain truth *

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 837 and I always said the same to
Turner	ORGANIZATION	' If you will do me a drawing in three days , I shall be obliged to you ; but if you take three months to do it , you may put it behind the fire when it is done . '

		And I should have said precisely the same thing to Tintoret or any other very great man .

		I do n't mean to say you ought n't to do the hard work .

		But the laboured picture will always be in part an exercise not a result .

		You ought n't to do many careless or slight works , but you ought to do them some - times ; and , depend upon it , the whole cream of you will be in them . ''

		Equally in character are
Raskin	PERSON	's scattered bits of technical criticism , whether on matters ar - tistic or matters literary ; for example , his plea , after reading some of
Rossetti	PERSON	's translations from the Italian , '' for entire clearness of mod - ern and unantiquated expression '' ; or , again , the following bit of advice in a letter to Miss Siddal regarding the use of color : '' Work as much as possible in colour .

		I do not care whether they be separate drawings or illuminations , but try always to sketch with colour rather than with pen - cil only I mean so far as is agreeable to you .

		The slightest blot of blue or green is pleasanter to me than a whole month 's work with chalk or ink . ''

		Whatever it may have been at a later time ,
Ruskin	PERSON	's attitude toward
Rossetti	PERSON	is here one of extreme friendliness and admiration , proved by a delicate liberality , not only to Ros - setti himself , but also to
Miss Siddal	LOCATION	, to whom the painter was then affianced .

		In an early letter one almost too intimate to be quoted he puts his buying in a way which is at once airy and earnest .

		He says : '' Thus then it stands .

		It seems to me that , amongst all the painters I know , you on the whole have the greatest genius , and you appear to me also to be as far as I can make out a very good sort of person .

		I see that you are unhappy and that you can ' t bring out your genius as you should .

		It seems to me then the proper and necessary thing , if I can , to make you more happy , and that I should be more really useful in enabling you to paint properly and keep your room in order than in any other way . ''

		Of the letters written by
Rossetti	PERSON	, only two are of special importance , the others , indeed , giving occasional glimpses of his character , but revealing nothing more than has been revealed in correspondence heretofore published .

		These two addressed to Mr.
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	contain news which takes us back into the very midst of a group of ardent young roman - ticists .

		The first dated
July , 1858	DATE	gives an account of the tempora painting , now per - ished , in the
Union Debating Hall	ORGANIZATION	at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is difficult to select passages for quotation , but the following will perhaps be most sug - gestive : '' I may now go on to tell you something about the Oxford pictures .

		I dare say that you know that the building is one by
Woodward	PERSON	the Debating Room of the
Union Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its beauty and simple character seemed to make it a delightful receptacle for wall paint - ings , and accordingly a few of us thought we would decorate it , as an experiment in a style to which I , for one , should like to devote the whole of my time better than to any other branch of art .

		With the ex - ception of
Arthur Hughes	PERSON	and myself , those engaged upon it have made there almost their debut as paint - ers ; they are
Edward Jones	PERSON	,
W. Morris	PERSON	-LRB- of whom you saw some stories in the O -LRB- xford -RRB- and C -LRB- ambridge -RRB- Mag -LRB- azine -RRB- , and who , I think , must have sent you his volume of poems ,
Spencer Stanhope	PERSON	, Pollen , and
V. C. Prinsep	ORGANIZATION	.

		Jones 's picture is a perfect masterpiece , as is all he does .

		His subject in the series -LRB- which you know is from ' the Mort Arthur -RRB- represents Merlin be - ing imprisoned beneath a stone by the Damsel of the Lake . ''

		My own subject ... is Sir
Launcelot	PERSON	prevented by his sin from entering the chapel of the
San Grail	LOCATION	.

		He has fallen asleep before the shrine full of angels , and between him and it rises , in his dream , Queen Guenevere , the cause of all .

		She stands gazing at him , with her arms extended in the branches of an apple-tree .

		As a companion to this I shall paint a design , which I have made for the purpose , of the attainment of the
San Grail	LOCATION	by
Launcelot	PERSON	's son Galahad , together with Bors and
Percival	PERSON	... The works , you know , are all very large the figures considerably above life-size , though at their heighth from the ground they hardly look so .

		I trust , when the work is finished , you will see it some day .

		There is no work like it for delight - fulness in the doing , and none , I believe , in which one might hope to delight others more according to his powers . ''

		The second letter to Professor
Norton	PERSON	written in
January , 1862	DATE	tells of '' the firm of
Morris , Marshall	ORGANIZATION	,
Faulkner	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, Art workmen , '' and encloses a prospectus .

		Burne-Jones is again mentioned , and this time with a prophecy which has long been ful - filled .

		Apropos of the new firm ,
Rossetti	PERSON	says : '' Our commissions as yet are chiefly in stained glass , but I wish you could see a painted cabinet with the his - tory of St.
George	PERSON	, and other furniture of great beauty which we have in hand ...
Morris	PERSON	, and
Webb	PERSON	the architect , are our most active men of business as regards the actual conduct of the concern ; the rest of us chiefly confine ourselves to contributing designs when called for , as of course the plan is to effect something worth doing by cooperation , but without the least interfering with the individual pursuits of those among us who are painters .

		A name perhaps new to you on our list but destined to be unsurpassed , perhaps unequalled , in fame by any name of this generation is
Edward Burne-Jones	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is a painter still younger than most of us by a good deal , and who has not yet exhibited , except at some private places ; but I can not convey to you in words any idea of the exquisite beauty of all he does .

		To me no art I know is so delightful , except that of the best Venetians . ''

		Among the '' miscellaneous items '' is a no - tice , taken from `` The Athenaeum , '' of the Praraphaelite Exhibition of
1857	DATE	.

		In this , THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 16	DATE	,
Millais	PERSON	is spoken of as '' the chief of the sect , ''
Holman	PERSON	Hunt as '' the apostle of the order , '' and
Rossetti	PERSON	as '' the original founder of the three-lettered race , who is generally spoken of by them in a low voice '' and who '' does not and will not exhibit in public . ''

		Praeraphaelit - ism is praised , however , in that '' its errors , eccentricities , and wilful aberrations are fast softening and modifying . ''

		A few months later there was held in
New York	LOCATION	an exhibit of pic - tures by English artists , in which the Prse - raphaelites were largely represented and it is claimed by Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	that their work was more fully appreciated in
America	LOCATION	than in
England	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Ruxton	PERSON	, the manager of the exhibit , wrote : ''
P. R. Bism	PERSON	takes with the working men .

		They look , and they look , and they look , and they say something that the au - thor of the picture would be pleased to hear . ''

		I have indicated only the important matter of the volume .

		The poems by Miss Siddal are notable , but mainly so because of her early environment ; the letters from
Robert Brown	PERSON	- ing are unimportant ; and the literary criticism , though extremely interesting , consists of mere fragments .

		As for reading from these papers either the Prasraphaelite doctrines or the char - acteristics of
Rossetti	PERSON	's genius a genius which far transcended all that that early '' ism '' could suggest such reading is , as I have said , for those who know .

		They will mark -LRB- for example -RRB- a letter of
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	's which affirms the symbolism of '' The Passover , '' and one of
Ruskiu	ORGANIZATION	's which denies it ; and they will recall
Rossetti	PERSON	's beautiful sonnet for '' The Passover , '' which begins '' Here meet together the prefiguring day And day prefigured '' a comment which , even if inspired by
Patmore	PERSON	, points out the discerning critic .

		Such faint hints as to
Rossetti	PERSON	's qualities occur quite often in the book , and the little poem '' At Last '' one of those mentioned is distinctly Praeraphaelite ; but as to the meaning , spirit , and ideals of
Praeraphaelitisrn	LOCATION	, there is nothing definite .

		The letters quoted , however , breathe something of the atmosphere of their time and herein lies their chief value .

		The illustra - tion of the book is in photogravure the pic - tures selected for this being , with a single exception ,
Rossetti	PERSON	's work .

		The exception , a picture by
W. L. Windus	PERSON	, is one which
Rossetti	PERSON	greatly admired , and which takes its subject from the naive and passionate old ballad of ''
Burd Helen	PERSON	. ''

STEELE ANDERSON	PERSON	.

		MUSICAL , MATTERS , AND OTHERS .

		* The books which are grouped together for men - tion in this article are all concerned , wholly or in part , with musical history or aesthetics ; yet in two or three cases the contents are of so varied a nature that this commentary can not avoid touching upon extra-musical matters , and the qualification of our title is thus accounted for .

		Before taking the books up one by one , we would like to call attention to the recent marked development , of which there is much more evidence than this list of books affords , of popular interest in musical subjects , of a better taste among listeners to music , and of a clearer comprehension of both the aims and the technique of the art .

		The number of people who can listen to a musical performance with intelligence and ap - preciative sympathy was never before in this coun - try so large as it is at present , and it is a fortunate thing that the popular literature of the subject should keep pace with the growth of interest .

		The book to which attention shall be called first of all is the collection of essays upon '' Music and Poetry , '' which Mrs.
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	has just brought together , partly from the periodicals of twenty and
thirty years ago	DATE	, partly from the manuscripts left by her husband at his death .

		It is well known that
Lanier	PERSON	was a musician of no mean accomplishment , but it is not quite so well known although it migbt be inferred safely enough from his treatise upon English verse as well as from the volume of his own poems that he was a serious philosophical thinker * Music AND POETRY .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 upon the art of music , its physical and psycholog - ical bases , and the secret of its deep appeal to the soul .

		That
Lanier	PERSON	was this also , is made evident by the three essays which open the present volume , and which have for their titles '' From Bacon to Beethoven , '' '' The Orchestra of To-day , '' and '' The Physics of Music . ''

		The first of these essays is the most important in the volume , and furnishes it with a key-note .

		The title embodies an antithesis which the author frames for the purpose of showing how very modern an art -LRB- as we understand it -RRB- music is , and which he hastens to illustrate by a quotation from the '' Essays , '' in which '' the wise fool Fran - cis '' expresses his contempt for all `` fiddling . ''

		Having asserted the claim of music to be considered the modern art par excellence , the author goes on to make it very clear that a musical composition has no power to tell a story , although it may heighten the effect of a story by association with it . ''

		Per - haps the most effectual step a man can take in ridding himself of the clouds which darken most speculations upon these matters is to abandon imme - diately the idea that music is a species of language which is not true , and to substitute for that the converse idea that language is a species of music . ''

		He meant by this substantially what Pater meant when , in '' The School of Giorgione , '' he said : `` All art constantly aspires towards the condition of mu - sic .

		Music , then , and not poetry , as is so often supposed , is the true type or measure of perfected art . ''

		We believe this idea to be fundamental to all rational discussion of musical aesthetics .

		Yet
Lanier	PERSON	does not go to the extreme of condemning '' programme-music , '' but rather urges that , although we should not be misled by it into an unsound logic , we may very properly enjoy it for what it really does accomplish . ''

		Certainly if programme-music is ab - surd , all songs are nonsense . ''

		Again , nothing could be more soundly or beautifully put than
Lanier	PERSON	's claim that music is a moral agent .

		These sentences will illustrate the point of view : '' Just as persist - ently as our thought seeks the Infinite , does our emotion seek the Infinite . ''

		`` It can not be that music has taken this place in the deepest and holiest matters of man 's life through mere fortuitous ar - rangement . ''

		The other musical essays contained in this collection are less valuable than that hitherto under discussion , and one of them , '' The Physics of Music , '' is devoted to some rather unworthy quib - bling over some contentions of
Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	, who certainly knew more about the physical aspect of music than
Lanier	PERSON	was willing to admit , although he never reached a true philosophy of the art .

		The literary essays are upon such subjects as
Bartholo	PERSON	- mew
Griffin	PERSON	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
John Barbour	PERSON	,
Paul Hayne	PERSON	, and the use of nature-metaphors in poetry .

		They are all suggestive and worth reprint - ing , although rather fragmentary in their character .

		Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	's volume of essays on '' Music and Manners in the Classical Period '' is devoted to five main subjects .

		The first two , '' A Poet 's Music '' and '' Haydn in
London	LOCATION	, '' are studies based upon manuscript volumes in the author 's possession .

		The second of these titles explains itself ; the first relates to
Thomas Gray	PERSON	, whose nine volumes of annotated transcriptions of music , made by the poet in
Italy	LOCATION	about
1740	DATE	, contain examples of many forgotten composers and singers of the early eighteenth cen - tury .

		These two essays have a certain measure of curious historical interest , but little of any other kind .

		In `` A
Mozart Centenary	ORGANIZATION	, '' Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	records his impressions of the
Salzburg	LOCATION	festival of
1891	DATE	.

		The account is agreeably readable , and is supplemented by a brief paper on ''
Da Ponte	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Da Ponte , it will be remembered , was the librettist of ''
Don Giovanni	PERSON	'' and '' Le Nozze . ''

		He came to
New York	LOCATION	in
1805	DATE	, and died there in
1838	DATE	.

		His activity as a teacher of Italian and an interpreter of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	has been discussed by Mr.
T. W. Koch	PERSON	in his valuable work , ''
Dante	PERSON	in
America	LOCATION	, '' but it has remained for Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	to write the story of his life , as far as it can be re - covered , and to settle some disputed points in its chronology .

		In ''
Beethoven	PERSON	and His Biographer , '' Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	writes of the life of
A. W. Thayer	PERSON	, with extracts from his note-books , and describes the
Beethoven Museum	ORGANIZATION	at
Bonn	LOCATION	.

		The closing essay , entitled '' Reflections at
Weimar	LOCATION	, '' brings into con - junction and comparison the two periods of Wei - mar 's artistic efflorescence the period of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and that of Liszt .

		Mr.
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	's '' critical and explanatory account of the growth of modern music ' ' is one of the most satisfactory books of its kind that we have ever read .

		It is , of course , an elementary sketch , being intended for the wider public that takes an interest in music without knowing much about it , but , within these limits , it is an exceptionally suc - cessful performance .

		If we were to make any gen - eral criticism upon its perspective , it would be that opera gets a disproportionate share of attention .

		The history is considered under three periods , the poly - phonic , the classic , and the romantic .

		The first '' is chiefly notable for its intellectual characteristics .

		It displays immense mastery of the elementary ma - terials of music and an enormous profundity of thought in purely technical processes . ''

		In the sec - ond period '' we find wonderful symmetry of form , a continual subordination of profound learning to a pleasing style , and a sweetness and serenity of the emotional atmosphere . ''

		In the third period , '' one finds a constant struggle for the definite expression of the profoundest emotions of our nature .

		Its forms are flexible , its diction the richest attainable , and its conception of beauty based largely on its ideal of truth . ''

		Speaking generally of these periods , the author properly says : '' In listening to the music of any composer , the hearer should take into account the general tendency , purpose , and scope of musical art of his period , and also the par - ticular aims of the composer .

		No one has a right to say that
Mozart	PERSON	failed because he did not accomplish what
Beethoven	PERSON	did .

		Mozart accomplished all that could be accomplished with the resources of musical art in his 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, day , and he himself enormously enlarged those re - sources .

		That is the achievement of a genius .

		Every - one has a right to say that
Donizetti	ORGANIZATION	and
Bellini	PERSON	failed because they not only did not succeed in accomplishing all that it was possible to accomplish in opera in their time , but deliberately ignored the fundamental princi - ples of the art and also the immense advances in its technic made by
Gluck	PERSON	and
Mozart	PERSON	.

		Everyone must admit that
Verdi	PERSON	has achieved the triumph of a great master in his ' Falstaff , ' for he has utilized everything contributed to operatic art by its leading geniuses , old and new , and yet has produced an entirely original and independent work . ''

		Besides such general criticism as this , the sanity of which is obvious , Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	naturally has occa - sion to enrich his history with much critical com - ment of the specific sort .

		With this we are gen - erally in agreement , although we should not he willing to say , for example , that '' there is no depth , no sincerity , in the music of Rossini . ''

		There is not much , it is true ; but ''
William Tell	PERSON	'' remains one of the immortal masterpieces of the lyric drama .

		On the other hand , we believe that Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	strikes the true critical note in his treatment of the man who was until about a year ago the greatest of living composers . ''

		Some time , I think , if not soon , the world will see how profoundly representative of his nation and his time
Brahms	PERSON	was , and he will be hailed , as
Milton	PERSON	was , an organ voice of his country .

		The irresistible serious - ness of
Germany	LOCATION	has never spoken with more convincing accent than in the music of
Brahms	PERSON	.

		There is a feeling in this music which is far removed from the possibility of a purely sensuous embodiment . ''

		Another book by Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	, the first in a new '' Music Lover 's Library , '' is entitled '' The Orchestra and Orchestral Music . ''

		It may best be described in the author 's own prefatory words , as '' simply an attempt to give to music lovers such facts about the modern orchestra as will help them in assuming an intelligent attitude toward the con - temporaneous instrumental body and its perform - ances . ''

		Further , `` the author has endeavored to put before the reader a description of each instru - ment , with an illustration which will enable him to identify its tone when next heard in the delivery of the passage quoted . ''

		Other chapters are devoted to the methods of scoring , historically considered , to the evolution of the conductor , and to the evolution of orchestral composition .

		The task attempted is no easy one , and Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	has been perhaps as successful as was to be expected .

		Such a matter as the theory of transposing instruments is not easy of comprehension to the amateur .

		The writer does not seem always to have given his explanations in the simplest form possible .

		He gives a long account , with examples in notation , of the pitch of the string family of instruments .

		It would have been better to say outright that the viola is a fifth lower than the violin , and to describe the double-bass as tuned in fourths , exactly reversing the G D A E of the violin .

		But this is a minor matter .

		The book is mostly matter-of-fact in its statements , although now and then an anecdote or a bit of criticism comes in to enliven the treatise .

		Of the latter , this is an example : '' A symphony of Mozart orchestrated in the
Richard Strauss	PERSON	style would be a tinted Venus ; while a tone poem of
Strauss	PERSON	scored a la
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	would be like one of
Cropsey	LOCATION	's autumn landscapes reduced to the dead level of a pen-and-ink drawing . ''

		By way of anecdote , the following is so good that it must be quoted : '' A conductor once went from another city to
Boston	LOCATION	to conduct an orchestra at the first appearance in this country of an eminent pianist , whose piece de resistance was to be Liszt 's E flat concerto .

		At the beginning of the scherzo there are some lightly tripping notes for the triangle , which the player struck too heavily to please the conductor 's fancy .

		He rapped with his baton to stop the orchestra . ''

		Sir , ' he said , gravely , addressing the triangle player , ` those notes should sound like a blue-bell struck by a fairy . '

		`` Whereupon the whole body of instrumentalists burst into uncontrollable laughter .

		I told this story subse - quently to a
New York	LOCATION	musician , a member of
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	's orchestra , and he looked so amazed that I said : '' ' But does n't Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	talk to you at rehearsal ? ' '' '

		Oh , yes !

		Oh , certainly ! '

		was the reply . '' '

		Well , what does he say ? ' ''

		` He says D n ! '' ' ''

		The book is illustrated by many passages of music printed in notation , and with eight portraits of emi - nent conductors , from
Haydn	LOCATION	to Mr.
Nikisch	PERSON	.

		Mr.
James Huneker	PERSON	's '' Mezzotints in Modern Music '' have for their subjects
Brahms	PERSON	,
Tschai	PERSON	- kowsky ,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	,
R. Strauss	PERSON	,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wagner	PERSON	.

		There is also a chapter on the literature of Etudes for the piano .

		Indeed , Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's interest in the men of whom he writes is predominantly pian - istic , although his windows are frequently opened for a wider outlook .

		The chapter on
Brahms	PERSON	is highly eulogistic , although not unreservedly so , yet the writer is not without high appreciation of Wag - ner .

		On the whole , however , he holds
Brahms	PERSON	to have been the greater and the more enduring artist of the two .

		Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's style is too pretentious , but he often says striking things .

		Here is a passage concerning the closing movement of Tschaikowsky 's '' Pathetic '' symphony in B minor : '' Since the music of the march in the
Eroica	LOCATION	, ' since the mighty funeral music in
' Siegfried	DATE	, ' there has been no such death music as this adagio lamentoso , this as - tounding torso , which
Michel Angelo	PERSON	would have under - stood and
Dante	PERSON	wept over .

		It is the very apotheosis of mortality , and its gloomy accents , poignant melody , and harmonic coloring make it one of the most impressive of contributions to mortuary music .

		It sings of the en - tombment of a nation , and is incomparably noble , dig - nified , and unspeakably tender .

		It is only at the close that the rustling of the basses conveys a sinister shud - der ; the shudder of the Dies Irse when the heavens shall be a fiery scroll and the sublime trump sound its sum - mons to eternity . ''

		Such writing can not be freed from the charge of extravagance , although the subject in this case
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 almost justifies it .

		But the writer strains for his literary effects too frequently and too much to pro- duce the best impression .

		In his reaction from the academic manner in criticism , he goes too far , like some of his English contemporaries , of whom we shall have a word to say a little later in this review .

		Mr.
W. F. Apthorp	PERSON	's two small volumes entitled '' By the Way '' consist of short essays upon musical subjects originally written for the programme-books of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	during five years of the writer 's editorship of that publication .

		Al - though he has set himself about '' furbishing them up a bit '' for publication in book form , these essays remain essentially what they were when written musical journalism of a better than the usual sort , yet hardly literary productions in the more dignified sense .

		The process of furbishing should at least have expunged such colloquialisms as `` from the word go '' or that particularly vile phrase '' a par - ticularly brainy composer . ''

		It should also have led the writer to look up his Moliere and avoid the error of saying '' trombe marine '' for '' trompette marine . ''

		These essays are upon all sorts of subjects .

		A few taken at random are '' Musical Slips , '' '' The Influ - ence of Surroundings , '' '' People Who Hate Music , '' '' Some Points in Modern Orchestration , '' ''
Tschai	PERSON	- kowsky in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' and '' Musical Reminiscences of
Boston	LOCATION	Thirty Years Ago . ''

		The last of these is one of a peculiarly interesting group anecdotal in character .

		We have heard , but do not remember to have seen in print before , the anecdote of Billow , coming upon the platform after an atrociously bad piece of vocalization , and softly preluding on the theme from the Ninth Symphony : '' O brothers , these tones no longer !

		Rather let us join to sing in cheerful measures a song of joyfulness . ''

		He had an intelligent audience , and the joke achieved complete success .

		Readers of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's early prose will recall the story of the French dramatist author whose piece was entitled '' L'amour a vaincu Loth '' -LRB- vingt culottes -RRB- the announcement of which was greeted from the gallery with the cry , '' Qu'il en donne une a 1 ` auteur , '' the author being known as an impecunious and seedy individual .

		This story is matched by Mr.
Apthorp	PERSON	as follows : An actor had the line : '' Mon pere k manger m ` apporte , '' and the interpellation from the gallery was : '' Eh bien !

		alors , pourquoi done que tu ne files pas ? ''

		Upon one of Mr.
Apthorp	PERSON	's essays we feel impelled to comment .

		He is writing of '' The Non-Musician 's Enjoyment of Music , '' and seems really puzzled to understand how it is that a man may take pleasure in hearing a composition of the technical structure of which he can not possibly have any grasp .

		That a musician should be thus perplexed makes us sus - picious that he himself does not enjoy music in the true sense that he subordinates the essence of such enjoyment to its accidents .

		It is much as if a philologist should ask how a reader can enjoy Shake - speare without knowing anything of the natural history of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's language , or of the rhe - torical and syntactical terminology with which the philologist sets forth his analysis .

		No doubt the complete knowledge of the musician may add to his enjoyment of a composition , but to assume that it supplies the chief element of that enjoyment is to misapprehend the very nature of all artistic achieve - ment .

		The musician and the non-musician alike enjoy in music the rich emotional experience of the composer , in which they become temporary partici - pants ; this is the chief thing to say .

		In addition , the musician gets a certain intellectual satisfaction out of his appreciation of the structure of the work to which he is listening , but this is of small account in comparison with the message which the music has for all listeners alike , for the untrained no less than for the trained .

		The transition is a natural one from Mr. Ap - thop 's little books , which are largely reminiscent of the musical life of
Boston	LOCATION	in the sixties and seven - ties , to the interesting biography of
John Sullivan Dwight	PERSON	, who was for nearly half a century the mu - sical autocrat of the city in which he lived .

		In pre - paring this biography Mr.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	has done a highly acceptable piece of work , besides con - tributing an important new chapter to the spiritual history of
New England	LOCATION	's greatest period .

		The interest of
Dwight	PERSON	's life is , of course , more than a narrowly musical one .

		It relates to
Brook Farm	ORGANIZATION	and the
Saturday Club	ORGANIZATION	only in lesser measure than to the art that he chose for his special domain of criticism .

		He knew most of the choice spirits of his time , and enjoyed both their esteem and their love .

		The story of his life is thus deeply rooted in all that was noblest and best in mid-century
New England	LOCATION	, and the associations evoked by its pages are indeed various .

		This extra-musical interest is so great that the book will find as many readers among those why do not care for the art -LRB- '' Es muss doch solche Kauze geben '' -RRB- as among those who do .

		As a critic of music , and as editor of his `` Journal '' for twenty years , the influence of Dwight upon the development of taste was great and lasting , this in spite of obvious limitations and short - comings .

		And there is always something inspiring in the contemplation of any life which , like his , is consistently devoted to the furtherance of high ideals , and which scorns to purchase popular favor at the price of sincerity .

		Dr.
T. L. Phipson	PERSON	, the author of '' Voice and Violin , '' is an old-timer in more senses than one .

		A writer who speaks of the '' sublime beauties '' of
Bellini	PERSON	, comparing that tuneful composer with
Dante	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, can not be taken very seriously ; yet his volume of '' Sketches , anecdotes , and remin - iscences is by no means devoid of a certain sort of interest .

		The author is himself a veteran violinist , and this is not the first book of the kind that he has put forth .

		He draws upon a rich fund of pleasant material , gleaned from out-of-the-way sources and a life of personal associations with his fellow-artists , the whole being arranged with little or no coherence , and interesting in bits rather than as an entirety .

		Music is only an incident , although an important 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, one , in the series of '' essays on art and its relation to life '' that Mr.
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	has brought together into a volume entitled '' Angels ' Wings . ''

		The titular essay has for its text the query of many a child , on viewing the winged figures of sculpture and painting , as to how these beings got their clothes on , a query supplemented in maturer years by one concerning the anatomical difficulties of the concep - tion of a winged human figure .

		To the author , the abandonment of wings in the later developments of art is symbolical of the process by which art first becomes real , and enters into the fullest relations with life .

		`` Art and Democracy '' is the essential subject of this entire volume -LRB- as it is the literal subject of one of the chapters -RRB- , and we must say that we approached the author 's treatment with misgivings .

		There has been so much rubbish written of late upon this sub - ject , from
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	down to the least of the Whitmaniacs , that suspicion is surely justifiable in such a case .

		Relief soon came , however , in a char - acterization of Count Tolstoy 's '' What Is Art ? ''

		as '' that strange jumble of real acumen and bad logic , of large-heartedness and fanaticism , '' and the fur - ther expression of regret that the great Russian writer '' should be so completely dominated by the fear of the senses . ''

		Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	's attempted parallel between
Wagner	PERSON	,
Millet	LOCATION	, and Whitman , also gave us pause , until it was discovered that he did not push it to an illegitimate extent .

		Our mis - givings thus removed , it was discovered that the essays were both stimulating and subtly suggestive , the product of a trained and regulated intellect , occupied with matters of the gravest human con - cern .

		The strictly musical section of the work is confined to the two chapters devoted to the sonatas and later symphonies of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here we have aesthetic interpretation of a very fine sort , which contrives to express the full of enthusiasm without plunging into excess of rhapsody .

		We commend these beautiful chapters to all lovers of music .

		There has been much talk in
England	LOCATION	during the past two or three years concerning the '' new criti - cism '' of music .

		The foremost exponents of this development are Mr.
G. Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and Mr.
James F. Runciman	PERSON	, who have had for their spe - cial organ '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' and whose most characteristic work is represented by two volumes now at hand .

		Of this '' new criticism '' in general it may be said that it is so violent a reaction from the severely academic and technical method that it tends to defeat itself by its own excesses .

		It is bound to be startling at any cost , and in its strain - ing for effects it strays far from the paths of sobri - ety .

		Yet we can not deny that it makes interesting reading , is provocative of thought , and that a sound kernel is nearly always to be extracted from the husks of its paradoxical envelope .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's '' The Perfect Wagnerite , '' for example , is the work of a writer who really does appreciate the greatness of the Wagnerian art , and this being the case we shall not quarrel with him for seeking to make a pre - posterous interpretation of the Niblung story accord - ing to
Wagner	PERSON	.

		If it amuses him to read a socialistic system of doctrine into the '' Ring , '' it amuses his readers no less ; and we have no fear that they will take the vagary any too seriously .

		We are given , for instance , such extraordinary interpretations as this of the Tarnhelm : '' This helmet is a very common article in our streets , where it generally takes the form of a tall hat .

		It makes a man invisible as a shareholder , and changes him into various shapes , such as a pious Christian , a subscriber to hospitals , a benefactor of the poor , a model husband and father , a shrewd , practical , independent Englishman , and what not , when he is really a pitiful parasite on the commonwealth , consuming a great deal , and producing nothing , knowing nothing , believing nothing , and doing nothing except what all the rest do , and that only because he is afraid not to do it , or at least pretend to do it . ''

		Mr.
Runciman	PERSON	, dedicating his '' Old Scores and New Readings '' to the quondam editor of the '' Review '' in which the chapters first saw the light , makes some attempt to explain the attitude toward music of the '' new critic . '' ''

		If criticism is to be written at all , it must be written with a view of giving us new sensations and emotions and thoughts : it must open a new world to our view , the world created by the energy and temperament of the man who writes it .

		... I claim to look at music with the expert 's knowledge and with all my faculties , to see it always in relation to humanity , to all the activ - ities , thoughts , desires , joys , and sorrows of humanity : in a word , in relation to life .

		To me an opera or mass of
Mozart	PERSON	or a symphony of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	is not only a complete thing , but also an extension of the composer 's individuality , which I never forget nor could find it possible to forget . ''

		This is certainly a lucid statement of a doctrine essentially sound , our only objection being to its excess of emphasis upon the subjective element of criticism ; for in music , as in literature , we believe in the existence of objective standards , which it is the business of the critic to recognize , and to assert in every possible way .

		Mr.
Runciman	PERSON	is three - fourth a sane and rational critic ; the other fourth of him , we regret to say , is compounded of paradox and prejudice .

		But he has all due reverence for the masters
Bach	PERSON	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wagner	PERSON	and expresses it in no merely perfunctory forms of speech .

		He has , moreover , the saving grace of a true appreciation of
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	, and he who has this can not go far astray .

		Mr.
Runciman	PERSON	has produced what is certainly one of the most readable books of musical criticism that have ever come to our notice .

		Mr.
Vernon Blackburn	PERSON	, who for a time took Mr.
Runciman	PERSON	's place as critic for the ''
Saturday	DATE	, '' is a gentler spirit who writes graceful little papers round about music '' The Fringe of an Art , '' he appro - priately names his volume .

		He is a trifle over - subtle at times , as in the following distinction be - tween melody and tune : `` Tune is melody a little overripe .

		The adjectives that are applicable to melody are of an order altogether different from those applicable to tune .

		You associate tune with a suspicion of slang ; melody demands the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 language of literature .

		The quality , for instance , that gives melody the title of ' beautiful ' inspires you to call a tune ' fetching . '

		Gluck never wrote a ' tune ' in his life ;
Rossini	ORGANIZATION	seldom wrote pure melody . ''

		And yet there is an undoubted truth back of this rather strained antithesis .

		Sometimes Mr.
Black	PERSON	- burn gives us a pretty epigram , as when he calls Tschaikowsky '' a barbarian smitten by the musical Zeit-geist '' And sometimes he writes words of true inspiration , as these of
Wagner	PERSON	's last work : '' Just now I compared the whole work to the opening and shutting of a flower ; and I would use the same illustration to describe the separate motifs and particu - larly the Good
Friday	DATE	music of Parsifal . '

		They open , as it were , like the petals of a flower , slowly expanding , to reveal the depth and beauty of the blossom , and they close rhythmically , leaving unutterable memories , and dim , tearful signs of beauty within the inner circles of the heart .

		They are full of thoughts that lie too deep for tears .

		Long after the ear has listened to the actual sound , they return with a power , with an overwhelming and indefinite shadowing , that make this music a thing forever apart and sacred . ''

		If one had to restrict his musical library to a single volume , we doubt if he could do better than select the work called `` Music and Musicians '' which has just been translated from the French of
M. Albert Lavignac	PERSON	.

		It is only a few months since we reviewed
M. Lavignac	PERSON	's admirable work on
Wagner	PERSON	; and we find in this new volume the same lucidity of exposition , the same economy of arrange - ment , and the same comprehensiveness that make the
Wagner	PERSON	volume one of the very best that have ever been prepared upon its subject .

		`` Music and Musicians '' gives us the acoustics of music , the gram - mar of the art , the description of the instruments which express it , and its history stated with much biographical and bibliographical detail .

		The volume is in fact , although not in form , a veritable encyclo - paedia of music , and will be found equally satisfac - tory as a work of reference and as a text-book for the actual study of counterpoint , the structure of instruments , the history of music , and the physical basis of musical production .

		A few supplementary pages , by Mr.
H. E. Krehbiel	PERSON	, add American com - posers to
M. Lavignac	PERSON	's list , and put the finishing touch of usefulness upon a work which we cordially recommend to both students and general readers .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Whatever else the critics may say of Mr *
Charles H. Peck	PERSON	's book on `` The Jacksonian Epoch '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , they are pretty certain to agree that it is readable .

		The period has always been one of great interest to stu - dents of our history and politics , and it is more likely to become still more interesting than less as time goes on .

		No doubt the '' questions '' of the epoch , or at least most of them , are now seen to have been monstrously exaggerated by the men who partici - pated in their discussion ; but the loss of interest on this score is more than made up by the better un - derstanding of the epoch itself as a period of national transition .

		Then , Mr.
Peck	PERSON	is well read on his theme , and has thrown his materials into good lit - erary form .

		He is , indeed , altogether too sure of some things , but his very positiveness will be one of the best features of his book to some minds .

		An - other of his merits is his distinct conception of the fact that , in the epoch treated , far less was due to what
Carlyle	PERSON	called '' individualities , '' and far more to general causes , than our fathers supposed .

		He sees clearly , for example , that General
Jackson	PERSON	was a man of his time , and the
Jackson	PERSON	party a party of its time ; he sees that the American republic was bound not only to become democratized , but to be - come democratized in a rude way ; and yet he might advantageously have used space that he has given to minor matters to give a fuller and better exposition of the causes that made these things inev - itable .

		The topic is an inviting one , and has never been adequately treated in all its bearings by any writer .

		So confident a writer as our author with such a subject could not have avoided offering nu - merous moot points to the critic .

		Here it must be said that if he is never dull he is often wrong or paradoxical .

		We read on one page that
John Ran	PERSON	- dolph , having retired from political leadership , '' re - mained to the end of his days the most consistent advocate , barring his occasional extravagances and abberrations , of the true theory of government , '' and on another page that he organized the South to a systematic defense of the slaveholding interest , and formulated the political theory by which it was to be maintained ; moreover , this theory `` was wholly derived from the political doctrines with which he had begun public life . ''

		The meaning , of course , is that
Randolph	PERSON	's devotion to slavery was merely one of his '' extravagances '' or '' abberrations , '' and ought not to be counted against him in determining his rank as a political philosopher .

		Mr.
Peck	PERSON	adds : '' It is one of the seeming paradoxes of politics that the ablest early exponents of democracy were slave - holders . ''

		From his point of view he should have added , '' and often aristocrats . ''

		The account of the introduction of the spoils system presents some very just observations and important facts that the stu - dent of the time needs to heed , but it can not be accepted as a proper presentation of the subject .

		Mr.
Peck	PERSON	thinks that
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	was more to blame for the system than
Jackson	PERSON	, owing to his absolute refusal to allow political considerations to influence the retention or selection of appointees , which stimulated the clamor and the efforts of the multiplying '' outs . ''

		Even more unsatisfactory is the handling of the slavery question .

		The author sees that slavery was a great evil , but he criticizes all the men who strove to oppose it , and the Aboli - tionists with great fierceness ; but he does not , that we remember , drop a single hint as to what should have been done in reference to slavery .

		Nothing 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, is easier than to criticize every practical proposition that was ever made , looking to the doing away of the institution , or to restricting its influence ; but it was in the country , and something had to be done about it , as a writer of history at this late day ought to discern .

		Chapters from There are few books of the P * 81 year the inner life which thoughtful readers will find of a philosopher .

		better worth peru8a l t h an J ^ J ^
Beattie Crozier	PERSON	's remarkable piece of mental auto - biography entitled `` My Inner Life '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Mr.
Crozier	PERSON	is the distinguished author of two pro- found and original works -LRB- one of them as yet un - finished -RRB- in the field of social philosophy ; and upon the general system therein unfolded the present Life has certain specific bearings .

		As we gather from the author 's brief Autobiography , one of the main considerations that led him to compose the present work was the belief that the philosophic system elaborated in his books on '' Civilization and Pro- gress '' and '' The History of Intellectual Develop - ment '' could be most clearly expounded and in a measure popularized through a detailed account of the successive steps by which it grew and took shape in his own mind .

		We may therefore regard '' My Inner Life '' not only as an autobiography proper -LRB- and it is a thoroughly charming and singularly candid one -RRB- , but as in some sort a clew or supple - ment to the author 's larger works .

		With a gener - ous leaven of lighter episode and digression , Mr.
Crozier	PERSON	traces in the main the story of his intel - lectual life and effort , from the immature days of his early dabblings in phrenology down to the period of measurably settled philosophic conviction .

		The chapters describing the author 's earlier examination of the various abstruser philosophic systems are rich in comment and suggestion , and they should prove most helpful to the tyro in need of those brief indi - catory hints or flashes of elementary exposition and illustration which so often are to the puzzled be - ginner the magic key to the essential understanding of a novel system of thought .

		Mr.
Crozier	PERSON	's account of the simple mental devices and homely compari - sons that helped him through his first perplexities in respect to thinkers like
Kant	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	may well prove serviceable to the student whose path is blocked by like difficulties .

		Very delightful and refreshingly free from stale conventions are Mr.
Crozier	PERSON	's chapters on men like
Macaulay	LOCATION	, De
Quin	PERSON	- cey ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Addison	PERSON	, the exem - plars of literary form to whom he turned succes - sively during the period of his efforts to achieve a style that might serve to allure the public to a con - sideration of his ideas .

		The opening chapters of the volume sketch with a light and animated touch the story of the writer 's boyhood in a Canadian town , and introduce to us some odd , Shandean humorists notably a queer character called the '' Man with the Bootjack , '' of whom Mr.
Crozier	PERSON	might make much should he care to turn his hand to fiction .

		The book has a rich anecdotal and remi - niscential side .

		The most amusing chapter in this kind tells of a visit to
Carlyle	LOCATION	at
Chelsea	LOCATION	, under - taken by the author with a view of finding counsel and solace at a time of spiritual difficulties .

		He found the oracle in a bad humor , which was vented in abuse of eminent fellow-thinkers whom Mr.
Crozier	PERSON	was rash enough to quote as worth consideration .


Stuart Mill	PERSON	, for instance , was waved aside by the sage as '' a thin , wire-drawn , sawdustish , logic - chopping kind of body , '' while
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	was flatly dubbed '' An immeasurable ass ! ''

		As to the latter thinker , Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	went on to say : '' And so ye have been meddling with
Spencer	PERSON	, have ye ?

		He was brought to me by
Lewes	LOCATION	, and a more con - ceited young man I thought I had never seen .

		He seemed to think himself just a perfect Owl of Minerva for knowledge ! ''

		and then , looking fiercely at Mr.
Crozier	PERSON	, '' ye '11 get little good out of him , young man . ''

		Must it not be regretfully owned that , with all his genius ,
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	's nature was warped by some of the meanest , most hateful qualities that can disfigure humanity ?

		Mr.
Crozier	PERSON	's book is a rarely readable , multifarious , and nutri - tive one of is kind ; and we heartily recommend it to our readers .

		Mystery and ' ^ nat t ^ ie ^ ate Elizabeth of
Austria	LOCATION	, romance of the a woman whose dislike of publicity
Austrian Empress	ORGANIZATION	, became latterly a sort of mania , and who had ever loved to draw the veil of privacy alike over her benefactions and her sorrows , should have met death at the hands of a man whose chief motive for his deed was a thirst for notoriety , suggests a dra - matic contrast .

		Not long before the tragedy at Gen - eva ,
Luccheni	LOCATION	, the assassin , said to a friend , '' I am going to kill some person of high rank , so that I can at last see my name in the newspapers . ''

		This wretched fellow seems to have been a mere '' notori - ety crank '' of the dangerous sort who turn naturally to murder as the swiftest and surest means of gaining the distinction they crave .

		The web of the career of Elizabeth of
Austria	LOCATION	was woven largely of sorrow and romance , and the terrible closing episode of her life was scarcely more grimly tragic than some incidents that preceded it .

		Elizabeth was warm - hearted , generous , visionary , and eccentric .

		She was a rarely interesting and striking personality , and much was written of her during her life and immediately after her death .

		The two handsome volumes now before us ''
Elizabeth Empress	ORGANIZATION	of
Austria	LOCATION	, '' by A. De Burgh -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , and `` The Martyrdom of an Empress '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , represent , we think , the first attempts at a full and definitive account of her life and character .

		Both books are extremely readable , and each occupies a field of its own .

		Mr.
De Burgh	PERSON	gives us a fairly written and tolerably accurate continuous biographical sketch , in which the profuse and well chosen illustrations form a commendable feature .

		The anonymous au - thor of `` The Martyrdom of an Empress '' confines herself in the main to matter of her own personal ob - servation and recollection .

		Her attitude is frankly
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 that of an adorer of her heroine , and her adoration is clearly unfeigned and not ill-grounded .

		She des - cribes herself as having been for some time the Empress 's '' only confidante and truest friend , '' and readers seeking personal details and `` revelations '' as to family concerns and secrets will find their account in her hook .

		A notable chapter is the one wherein the writer unriddles , or professes to unriddle , the ghastly episode at
Mayerling	LOCATION	, to which the gos - siping world has long sought the key .

		The book is picturesquely and effusively written , and bears every evidence of originating from the fulness of immediate knowledge .

		Many guesses will doubt - less be made at the author 's identity .

		There are a number of pleasing illustrations , mainly portraits .

		In our issue of
March 1 , 1898	DATE	, we reviewed at 8ome len s th the initial volume of the Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire 's '' Encyclopaedia of Sport . ''

		The second and concluding volume -LRB- Li Z -RRB- of this sumptuous work is now issued -LRB-
Putnam	LOCATION	-RRB- and it shows the same wealth of illustration and degree of expert collabo - ration that we praised in its predecessor .

		There are twenty full-page photogravures , together with a profusion of text-cuts ; and the table of contents shows a great array of names whose authority sports - men throughout the English-speaking world will recognize .

		Among these we may note Sir
W. M. Conway	PERSON	, Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, Mr.
John Bick	PERSON	- erdyke , Mr.
Caspar Whitney	PERSON	, Captain
Hutton	PERSON	, Mr.
G. E. A. Ross	PERSON	,
Lord Dunraven	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
A. Rogers	PERSON	, Mr.
A. E. T. Watson	PERSON	, Mr.
A. Trevor-Battye	PERSON	, etc. .

		In short , each article has been undertaken by a well - known expert and enthusiast in the branch of sport it treats of .

		Racing , Riding ,
Mountaineering	ORGANIZATION	, the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	, the
Partridge	ORGANIZATION	, the Pheasant , the Red Deer ,
Rowing	ORGANIZATION	, Yachting , Shooting ,
Salmon	ORGANIZATION	, Wrestling , Trout , Swimming , Skating , are among the leading themes in this volume .

		We were a little surprised to find included an article on Snakes snake-hunting being a form of sport we should scarcely expect to see anyone given to .

		But Mr.
P. W. L'Estrange	PERSON	, who contributes this section , writes with due enthu - siasm of his pet pastime , and favors us with some explicit directions how to catch and keep snakes which we shall be very careful not to follow .

		The volumes make a good showing in their substantial bindings of dark-green buckram ; and they certainly form a very desirable adjunct to the sportsman 's library .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		At the Royal Institution of
London	LOCATION	,
Faraday	PERSON	was the connecting link between
Davy	ORGANIZATION	and
Tyndall	PERSON	.

		Beginning with chemistry , his work was expended mainly upon studies which led to the discovery of the fundamental principles of the electric science of to-day .

		His mental vision was singularly acute .

		It discriminated clearly the facts revealed by his skilful experimentation , it per - ceived the relations between these facts and the science then known , and by an intuition almost divine it discerned the avenues leading to further progress .

		Like our own
Henry	PERSON	, he made his life wholly unselfish .

		He bent all his energies to the elucidation of science , and was singularly oblivious to the seductions of wealth .

		For years he served the Royal Institution for the pittance of
$ 500	MONEY	per annum , with fuel , lights , and the house-room of two apartments for himself and his wife .

		Afterwards he was made rich with a pension of
$ 1500	MONEY	per an - num .

		Although constantly making discoveries of great commercial value , he never claimed for them any patent rights .

		It can not be said of him , as of a famous American electrician , that the grass could not grow in the path between his laboratory and the patent office .

		The most notable of
Faraday	LOCATION	's dis - coveries were those of terrestrial magnetism ; the para-magnetic or dia-magnetic qualities which char - acterize and classify all substances ; and the basic principles of magneto-electric induction which fore - shadowed all the remarkable modern developments in dynamic electricity and the uses of electric mo - tors .

		He was not forgetful of the practical utilities of the forces he found .

		For example , in
1847	DATE	he proposed to the officials of
Trinity House	ORGANIZATION	to mark harbor channels with incandescent lights carrying electric platinum wire spirals , and later gave much attention to the lighting of lighthouses by electricity .

		His life furnishes a most inspiring chapter in the history of modern science .

		Scattered through the pages of his - tory , such accounts as there are of the city of
Rouen	LOCATION	leave little impres - sion of its importance ; brought into the compass of a single book as in the pretty volume in the '' Mediaeval Towns '' series -LRB-

		The book is interesting , and serves to bind one 's knowledge into a Compact and port - able sheaf .

		Rouen is recalled as the closing scene in the tragic history of
Joan of Arc	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is also the city whence
William	PERSON	the Bastard set forth for his conquest of
England	LOCATION	; the home of those delicious kings of Yvet6t whom BeVanger sang and
Thack	PERSON	- eray kept in memory ; the birthplace of
Corneille	LOCATION	, for whom a street has been named ; the place of
Lord Clarendon	LOCATION	's death ; the former residence of
Pascal	LOCATION	, where he invented his calculating machine , and a long list of other matters of less interest are to be gathered from these annals .

		The book is delicately and beautifully illustrated , and well pro- vided with maps .

		Lieutenant
Peary	PERSON	made two cam - paigns to northern
Greenland	LOCATION	in the seasons of '91 - '92 and '93 -
' 94	DATE	.

		Among his associates was a hardy Norwegian youth ,
Eivind Astrup	PERSON	, who was both a close observer , and a ready fellow for all the peculiar conditions which befall an explorer .

		This young man has given us , 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, in `` With Peary Near the Pole '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a very readable book .

		After briefly outlining the two campaigns , he takes the points of interest by chap - ters .

		The most instructive of these are '' The Na - tives of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's Sound , '' '' Hunting , '' '' Sledge Jour - neys of the Esquimaux , '' '' The Esquimaux Manner of Life , Customs , Character , Moral and Social Circumstances , '' '' Intelligence and Artistic Gifts , Religious Ideas , Customs , '' etc. .

		The
Greenland	LOCATION	dog also claims large attention , as he is the most import - ant factor in Esquimau-travelling .

		The author vividly sets before his readers the hardships of that frozen clime , the life of its hardy occupants , and the struggle for existence on the part of every liv - ing thing .

		The results of the expeditions were not great , but the good done the natives , the more cer - tain definition of some coast-line of
Greenland	LOCATION	, and a knowledge through other eyes of the life of those regions , fully justify the appearance of this contri - bution of Mr.
Astrup	PERSON	.

		In the '' feminine renaissance '' now u P on U8 ' .

		one of the most interesting features is the sort of book which is becoming possible through the remarkable interest taken by woman in herself and her ancestresses .

		While a number of paltry novels continue to pour out upon the world for the more belated of the sisterhood , such a book as '' The Reign of Margaret of
Denmark	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	-RRB- , by
Mary Hill	PERSON	, is surely in response to the newly awakened sense of feminine importance .

		Queen
Margaret	PERSON	was one of those earlier women who found time both to rock the cradle and to rule the world -LRB- to adapt
Wallace	PERSON	's phrase -RRB- , the latter very literally so far as the Scandinavian peninsula is concerned .

		She was daughter to that
King Valdemar	ORGANIZATION	who made a rather famous reply to the Pope upon occasion ; wife to
Hakon	PERSON	,
King	PERSON	of
Norway	LOCATION	; mother to
Olaf	PERSON	, King of
Denmark	LOCATION	; mother by marriage to
Philippa	LOCATION	, daughter of
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		of
England	LOCATION	; conqueror of
Albert	LOCATION	, king of
Sweden	LOCATION	, upon whose captive head she set a fool 's cap in reply to an earlier gift from him of a stone to sharpen her scissors on ; and was in every respect a queenly , almost a kingly , woman .

		Miss Hill has brought the scanty facts concerning her into a succinct and very entertaining narrative , which should be exceedingly encouraging to all wo - men of to-day who need encouragement .

		Matter as intimate as that which goes to make up
P. A. Sergyeenko	PERSON	's '' How Count
L. N. Tolstoy	PERSON	Lives and Works '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is seldom free from f ulsomeness ; but if a minor modern
Boswell	PERSON	,
Sergyeenko	PERSON	is still a
Boswell	LOCATION	, moreover , he has a keen sense of hu - mor .

		Pleasant anecdote enlivens his pages , and goes far to redeem what might be called the '' cant of familiarily with the great . ''

		Upon an occasion ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	was recognized on the street by an admirer not less drunk than enthusiastic .

		Rushing up to the author , with rolling eye , he exclaimed , '' Oh , Home and private life of Tolstoy .

		Count Tolstoy , I am your adorer and imitator ! ''

		The irrepressible American , man and woman , visits the Count with frequency .

		Two of our women called one day to inform him that they had travelled around the world in opposite directions , and were now met at his house in accordance with their agree - ment . ''

		You might have made a better use of your time , '' said he . ''

		There !

		I told you he 'd say some - thing like that , '' they exclaimed to one another .

		The book , for all its praise , leaves the chief of Rus - sian writers human , which is probably all that should be asked from it in addition to the undoubted en - tertainment it provides .

		Miss
Isabel F. Hapgood	ORGANIZATION	furnishes the translation , and the book is attrac - tively illustrated .

		Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	, essayist , mem - ber of parliament , queen 's counsel , and professor of law at
University College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, is an ideal lecturer on such a topic as is now embodied in '' The Law of Copyright '' ; and his small book forms a suitable and valuable appendix to the greater work on the same subject from the pen of Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, who , fitly , is the publisher also of Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	's book .

		The latter has given the subject a literary treat - ment what could deserve one more ?

		and is most amiably enthusiastic over the future .

		While he adds not a great deal to the information contained in the larger American work , he does present another point of view , and is exceedingly encouraging .

		The law oj copyright .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mme.
Blanc	PERSON	-LRB- Th .

		Bentzon -RRB- is a most industrious maker of books , and turns to the account of '' copy '' whatever sort of experience happens to come her way .

		A list of no less than thirty-three volumes is now cred - ited to her pen , the last of these being a collection of '' Notes de Voyage '' concerning '' Nouvelle-France et Nouvelle-Angleterre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: C. Le `` vy -RRB- .

		Three-fourths of this readable volume are devoted to
Canada	LOCATION	, its women , its education , and its scenery .

		The other fourth is a series of rapid impressions of
New England	LOCATION	.

		Mme.
Blanc	PERSON	is always a pleasing writer , and we have read these random sketches with much interest .

		The Text-Book of General Physics '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , pre - pared by Drs.
Charles S. Hastings	PERSON	and
Frederick E. Beach	PERSON	of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, is a work of advanced grade for the use of colleges and scientific schools .

		It is es - sentially '' a strictly quantitative study of various trans - ferences and transformations of energy , '' and as such , treats the subject of mechanics in an exceptionally thorough manner .

		It presupposes trigonometry but not calculus .

		We note one special feature in the form of a chapter on the limiting powers of optical instruments .

		A welcome volume in the '' Temple Classics '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is that containing the '' Shorter Poems '' of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
H. Buxton Forman	PERSON	.

		The vol - ume includes only what may be called the longest of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's shorter poems , fifteen or sixteen in all ; the short lyrics being -LRB- presumably -RRB- reserved for a separate volume .

Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	with the title A Dividend to Labor . ''

		The phenomenal success of '' Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	'' justifies his publishers -LRB- Messrs. Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in an - nouncing a new book by him , '' Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	in the Hearts of his Countrymen , '' to be published in a few months .

		His first book , '' Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	in Peace and in War , '' has , it is said , reached a sale of fifty thousand copies .

		The Chautauqua Assembly announcements for
1899	DATE	include a number of courses in literature , among them being lectures by
Professor C. T. Winchester of Wes	ORGANIZATION	- leyau University ; Professor
Alcee ' Fortier	PERSON	of
Tulane University	ORGANIZATION	; and Mr.
Walter H. Page	PERSON	, the editor of the '' Atlantic Monthly , '' who will treat '' The Practical As - pects of Literature . ''

		A call has been issued for the organization of an
Illinois Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, an institution which is emi - nently desirable .

		A preliminary meeting of those inter - ested will be held at
the University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, on the nineteenth of this month , and all who wish to do so are invited to attend .

		A special rate of one fare for the round trip to
Champaign	LOCATION	can be had from all points in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Superintendent of Public Schools in
Chicago	LOCATION	has , it is stated by the daily press , instructed the school principals to teach their pupils that '' thru '' spells through , '' altho '' spells although , and other philological vagaries .

		If there are any '' fine old educational mas - todons '' in our
School Board	ORGANIZATION	, this seems to be a case where the mastodontic foot should be put down , and put down hard .

		A valuable addition to American bibliography is fur - nished in the new Catalogue of Authors whose works are published by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Bos	LOCATION	- ton .

		It includes the best of our native writers of the century , and illustrates the supremacy of this house in American literature .

		The catalogue , with more than two hundred pages , well printed and neatly bound in boards , gives brief biographical sketches of the authors , with the titles of their books and the year of their pub - lication .

		Great care has been taken to secure accuracy and precision of statement .

		The frontispiece contains a photogravure of a group of six great American authors
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		Heretofore there has been but one scientific journal in the world devoted to the prevention and cure of tuber - culosis ; this was published at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Another of like character has now been started in this country , at
Ashe	LOCATION	- ville , N. C .

		It is a well-printed quarterly , with Dr.
Karl von Ruck	PERSON	, a prominent specialist , as editor , and Mr.
A. H. McQuilkin	PERSON	, well and favorably known in
Chicago	LOCATION	, as publisher .

		It is expected that the '' War of the
Rebellion Record of the Union	ORGANIZATION	and Confederate Armies , '' that most elaborate of our Government publications , will be completed in little over a year .

		Begun in
1874	DATE	, the work has gone deliberately on , and will represent , when completed , an outlay of nearly three
millions of dollars	MONEY	.

		The total number of volumes will be one hundred and twenty-nine , of which only about fifteen are yet un - priuted or undistributed .

		The
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	has hitherto had no
summer	DATE	session , although
Madison	PERSON	has been a favorite meeting-place for institutions of the Chautauqua type .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	now announces a
summer	DATE	school of six weeks ' duration , beginning
July 3 , 1899	DATE	.

		The courses cover all the principal departments , and are fully manned by resident and non-resident lecturers .

		Credit toward degrees will be given for work done at this ses - sion , just as has been the case from the start with the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, of whose example the sister insti - tution is evidently emulous .

		Some curious questions regarding the rights of liter - ary property are raised by a suit against Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , brought by Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	, who appears to have quite regained his vigorous health .

		It seems that the firm named lately purchased from various American publishers of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's works some copies of these books in sheets , which they then bound up in their own styles of covers and offered for sale in their retail store in complete sets .

		So far , there was nothing unusual in this , the re-binding of books being common in the retail trade , and the sheets purchased yielding Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, of course , whatever royalty was fixed be - tween him and his authorized publishers who sold the sheets to the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		There was thus evidently no intention to interfere with the author 's rights of roy - alty , since he was sure of his legal percentages , no mat - ter in what form the works were sold .

		But in re-binding the volumes the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	had given the set the name of '' Brushwood edition , '' and used decorations which are claimed to be in the nature of trade-marks ; and here the legal rights are not so easily determinable .

		A further grievance is the inclusion , in this alleged '' edi - tion , '' of matter which Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	repudiates ; and the arrangement of the pieces and the general scheme he regards as unauthorized and injurious .

		The develop - ments of the suit will be watched with much interest .

		It is but fair to add that the defendants have a reputa - tion for punctiliousness in their regard for the rights of authors as well as for the courtesies of the trade ; and any injury sustained by Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	through them will be felt to be an inadvertence rather than a deliberate or conscious attempt at wrong .

		TWO NEW BOOKS FOR STUDENTS OF SOCIAL QUESTIONS .

		Pauperizing the Rich .

		By
ALFRED J. FERRIS	PERSON	.

		This book contains a discussion of the merits and demerits of our social system which does not belong in any of the recognized classes .

		It is neither anarchistic nor socialistic , nor does it uphold the Single Tax , the
People 's Party	ORGANIZATION	, or the Free Silver propaganda ; yet it contains an unsparing arraignment of the present re ` gime , and proposes as a corrective a measure of reform which is not lacking in radicalism .

		Its aim , as stated in the preface , is '' to be as conservative as the Liberty and
Property Defence League	ORGANIZATION	and as radical as the Socialists .

		It accepts , at least in spirit , the aspirations of the most visionary reformers , and attempts to reach their substantial fulfilment by a measure which yet respects the great underlying principles of the existing social system , and which will stand the closest scrutiny of the practical intellect . ''

		The book is stated by the author to be '' directly founded '' upon
Henry George	PERSON	's '' Progress and Poverty , '' but its conclusions and the process of reasoning on which they are based are far from coinciding with those set forth in the monumental work of the great apostle of the Single Tax .

		The need of such a work as this , and the place which it must fill , have been brought to the attention of the compiler in the course of her work as librarian of the
Free Library of Economics and Political Science	ORGANIZATION	,
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		The constantly increasing volume and complexity of the literature on this subject have made it almost impossible even for specialists to keep abreast of its various growths , and have made it a trackless wilderness for the general reader .

		As librarians and others who are called on for advice upon the subject well know , it is a branch of inquiry which is increasingly attracting public attention , and on which intelligent advice is increasingly sought .

		It is as a help to the giving of such advice , and a direct guide to the general reader , that this work has been compiled and is now offered to the public .

		Professor
Ripley	PERSON	's important work furnishes a lucid description of the present living population of

		Simple maps , specially drawn for the purpose , and a rich collection of original portrait types from all parts of the continent , increase the interest of the text for the general reader .

		The book is especially suggestive to the observant traveller who ventures beyond the great cities , and who would understand the life history of the European peas - antry from a study of their physical traits , such as the stature , color of hair and eyes , head form , and features .

		The final chapter , concerning the possible adaptation of Europeans to the climate of the tropics , is of special interest in the

		378 AN
AMERICAN ACADEMY	ORGANIZATION	.

		What we once called '' the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	game '' has of late been going merrily on in the pages of '' Literature '' that is , in the American edition thereof under the genial direction of Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	, and it seems to be worth while to announce the outcome , and point two or three of the more obvious morals of this and other similar plans for organizing a body of '' immortals '' on our own side of the
Atlan	LOCATION	- tic .

		It is difficult for minds of a certain class to escape from the obsession of this idea .

		That it has worked well in
France	LOCATION	is not seriously to be disputed , in spite of sarcasms about the '' forty-first armchair , '' and the unpleasant part played by intrigue and wire-pulling in filling the vacant seats .

		The French Forty have , on the whole , always constituted a distinguished body of thinkers and men of letters .

		If their number has failed to include , now and then , some writer who was one of the chief intellec - tual forces of his time , it has rarely given place to a writer who was either a charlatan or a nonentity .

		If it has not always risen to the height of its opportunities , at least it has not , on the other hand , fallen far below them .

		The secret of this relative and considerable success in bodying forth , for two centuries and a half , the fine idea of
Richelieu	LOCATION	, is due to the fact that popular suffrage has had next to nothing to do with the selection of academi - cians .

		It also suggests the reason why an
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	would not be likely to be a body truly representative of American cul - ture .

		In other words , our democracy is still far from having learned the lesson that it is a farcical proceeding to settle some questions by popular vote , and we can not imagine any plan of organization likely to win general accept - ance which should not be based , in consider - able measure , upon the suffrages of more people than could possibly be expected to act intelli - gently in so delicate a matter .

		Even the body of readers gathered by so distinctly bookish a periodical as '' Literature '' displays little judgment in its choice , as may be seen by an inspection of the following list of names , the outcome of a ballot extending over several weeks .

Richard Harding Davis Bronson Howard	PERSON	,
45 43 36 36 36 34 27 2X 19	DATE	> 11 Since each participant in this ballot voted for ten persons , and the total number of votes is .

		well within one thousand , we are safe in assum - ing that about one hundred voters are repre - sented .

		It is a small number , no doubt , but little significance need be attached to that
fact %	PERCENT	for had the number of voters been ten or a hun - dred times as great , we doubt if the result would have been essentially different from that now 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, recorded .

		And a glance at that result is enough to show its critical worthlessness .

		To substantiate this judgment , let us exam - ine the list somewhat in detail .

		While the claim that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is our foremost man of letters is not far astray , if at all , it may yet be reasonably urged that Mr.
Stedinan	PERSON	, who is at once our leading poet and our leading critic , is even better entitled to head the list .

		And the place of Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	should at least be very near the head .

		The critical ineptitude that could set Mr.
Riley	PERSON	above Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	, or set him anywhere in such a list of twenty , is alone sufficient to prove our case .

		And Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	, delightful as is his gift of whimsical humor , is probably as much surprised as any of his read - ers to find himself outranking Mr.
James	PERSON	, Mr.
Harte	PERSON	, and Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, to say nothing of half a dozen others .

		And Mr.
Davis	PERSON	, what on earth is he doing in this gallery ?

		Such ab - surdities as these , and others almost equally glaring , make the list too freakish to deserve serious attention .

		For one reason , however , not yet adduced , we wish to take it seriously for a moment .

		Three - fourths of the names selected are of poets and novelists ; to their company being admitted , by way of makeweight , one historian , one natural - ist , one old-fashioned essayist , one clergyman of letters , and one dramatist .

		Considered merely as a list of poets and novelists , it is conspicu - ously defective , for Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	, Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	, Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	,
Miss Murfree	LOCATION	, and
Miss Thomas	PERSON	, at least , perhaps several others , count for more than some of the writers included .

		But the fatal defect of the list , of course , is to be found in its failure to include some of the most honored men in American letters , simply be - cause they are not primarily novelists or poets .

		We scan the list in vain for the two deans of our literary guild , Dr.
Hale	PERSON	and
Colonel Hig	ORGANIZATION	- ginson ; we note with absolute amazement the absence of the most typical academician we have , Mr.
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	.

		It is for such reasons , rather than for any vagaries of ranking , that the list is so distinct an illustra - tion of what the membership of our Academy ought not to be .

		They do these things much better in the home of academies .

		A few weeks ago , the ranks of the French Forty were complete , a condition which had not previously obtained for more than a score of years .

		A classification of the members showed the following results : eight historians , five each of the classes of politicians , professors , dramatists , and novelists , four poets , two critics , two journalists , one ecclesiastic , one lawyer , one sculptor , and one scientist ; in a word , nine novelists and poets , thirty-one rep - resentatives of other types of intellectual dis - tinction .

		This tells the whole story .

		We might find it difficult to honor so many politicians and dramatists , but our Academy , constituted in the same spirit , would find places for such men as Senator
Hoar	PERSON	, Professor
William James	PERSON	, Mr.
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	,
Bishop Potter	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
St. Gaudens	PERSON	, to take typical examples of the five classes absolutely ignored in the list we have been considering .

		It is because no form of popular vote would ever , by any possibility , single out the men most deserving of this sort of distinction that the plebiscite Academy can never be anything but a rather bad jest .

		TWO ORDERS OF CRITICS .


Keats	PERSON	said that one of the three things his time afforded for rejoicing was
Hazlitt	PERSON	's depth of taste .

		In the enunciation of general principles , the illum - ination of dark passages of the mind ,
Keats	PERSON	was himself a better critic than
Hazlitt	PERSON	.

		The sense of pleasure in literature and art , and the expression of it , is the marked thing in
Hazlitt	LOCATION	; the attempt to get at the meaning and underlying principles of poetry , the characteristic of
Keats	PERSON	.

		Sir
Richard Steele	PERSON	's saying , that it was a great service one man did another to tell him the manner of his being pleased , about indicates
Hazlitt	PERSON	's achievement .

		We might call this method of criticism the criticism of enjoyment ; the other , the criticism of definition .

		When
Hazlitt	PERSON	writes a sparkling and vivacious character of
Millamant	LOCATION	, when
Walter Pater	PERSON	re - paints in words a picture of
Leonardo	LOCATION	, when Ste.
Beuve	PERSON	projects on his pages the personalities of
Cowper	PERSON	or
Guerin	PERSON	, they each and all of them ex - ercise a minor sort of creative art .

		They are poets themselves or the satellites of poets .

		They reflect a light and heat from their principals , though they have little power or vitality of their own .

		But when
Aristotle	PERSON	takes his compasses and fixes the bounds of the different kinds of poetry ; when
Lessing	PERSON	defines the provinces of poetry , painting , and sculpture ; when
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	gives us the distinc - tion between imagination and fancy ; or when Ar - nold decomposes diction and provides such phrases as '' natural magic '' or '' the grand style '' to denote different qualities of expression , we are confronted by another order of critical talent , a kind which has none of the half - creative warmth of the first , none of its engaging sympathy , but which , never - theless , is probably more useful and more permanent .

		The one kind of criticism is qualified by depth of taste ; the other , by lucidity of reason .

		I am very far from denying reasoned judgment to
Hazlitt	PERSON	, or Pater , or Ste.
Beuve	PERSON	, or to critics who
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 361 share their gifts .

		They have enough of it to set up whole colleges .

		But it is , I think , a secondary thing with them .

		The main appeal with them is to taste , to sympathy .

		They deal with particulars rather than with generals .

		They are sensitively made to respond to excellence in special shapes .

		They viv - idly realize , and compel us to realize , concrete mani - festations of beauty or greatness .

		But we have to take them on faith ; their power over us is as of a laying on of hands .

		Hazlitt is perhaps the most vivid and various of English Essayists .

		He said of himself that nothing but abstract ideas made any impression on him ; but surely he was mistaken here .

		What impressed him most was that figured world existent in books and pictures .

		No one ever had a deeper sense of its reality .

		But when
Haz	PERSON	- litt tries to think , he is , if not a child , at least a very boyish philosopher .

		No single generalization of his is a lamp for one 's private feet or a star to pilot the world .

		I must confess to a very moderate appetite for
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's books .

		His style so sweet , so cloying , so sticky is not for me .

		Yet he has sub - tle gifts of discrimination and definition .

		His re - marks as to the architectural necessities of style , and about the quality of soul in style , are very ad - mirably put , if they are not entirely new .

		And there is a web of close reasoning in all his works .

		But his force is elsewhere than in analysis .

		He is a half artist , a half creator .

		He tries to reproduce in prose the cadences of the verse he loves , and he tries to re-create with words the forms and colors of the statues and paintings that are ever hovering in his eye .

		Ste.
Beuve	PERSON	is a library , and to dismiss him in a sentence is absurd .

		Yet I believe his weak - ness is akin to that of the two critics I have dis - cussed .

		Dealing with particulars , he is always sound ; dealing with generals , he is usually vague and unsatisfactory .

		His basis is the shifting un - certain one of taste .

		We are at sea with him .

		Every direction is a road , and one is as good as another .

		His definition of a classic is a good example of his strength and weakness .

		It is admirably thought out on the side of order , elegance , and art ; it fails en - tirely on the side of power , inspiration , and person - ality .

		It seems expressly framed to exclude the great books of the
Bible	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and most of the Greeks .

		A definition is , as it were , a fence .

		A fence is certainly at fault when it leaves almost everything of value outside of it .

		The criticism of taste , of enjoyment , is a great breeder of fads and fancies and errors ; but it is also a propagator of enthusiasms .

		It seizes upon some partial truth and makes a banner of it , and calls the cohorts of literature to its back to press to victory .

		The armed camp of opposition awakes , and the strife is on that keeps the world of ideas from stagnating .

		The motto on the flag changes every decade : now it is the revival of the classics ; now the exploitation of the naive and the new ; now realism ; now roman - ticism .

		Great minds liberate themselves in the struggle , and do work which probably bears little relation to the theories on which it was founded .

		The abstract definitions and distinctions of the other kind of criticism do not in any similar degree con - tribute to human sociability or literary production .

		When once propounded they are almost as self - evident as the axioms of mathematics .

		Like mathe - matical axioms , also , they are apt to be brief , and not to depend on literary style for their value .

		Analyt - ical treatises of extent of course exist , such as the Poetics of
Aristotle	LOCATION	, the Laokoon of Leasing , and the aesthetic systems fathered by nearly every great German philosopher .

		But pretty nearly all of these are represented to the world by a few phrases or distinctions which have the validity of laws .

		Such are
the Unities of Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	, at least the unity of action ;
Lessing	PERSON	's discovery that poetry is a time - art , and painting and sculpture are space-arts , with the corollary that description is not a main business of poetry ;
Schiller	PERSON	's theory of the play origin or nature of art ; and so forth .

		Pregnant phrases and sentences which are criticisms of definition have been dropped by great writers of all kinds .

		Such authors find their enjoyment in original work , and criticism for them is not an affair of pleasure or gratified taste , but a problem of guiding principles .

		Shakespeare 's '' The lunatic , the lover , and the poet '' is a criticism of definition .

		So is Lord
Bacon	PERSON	's description of '' historians , compilers , and critics '' as `` takers of second prizes . ''

		Shelley 's asser - tion that '' poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world '' is one ; and so is De
Quincey	PERSON	's sep - aration of the literature of knowledge and the lit - erature of power .

		Perhaps the best recent criticism of definition is Mr.
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	's class - ification of poets as those of Relative and of Absolute Vision .

		Perhaps this distinction derives from
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's eternal object and subject , and it may draw something from that famous passage in the '' Mod - ern Painters '' where
Ruskin	PERSON	contrasts the sculptor who carved the griffin he had seen with the other sculptor who merely carved a griffin as he thought it ought to be .

		But Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	's distinction is not merely profound it is a good working one .

		It may be objected that the criticism of definition has covered the whole ground ; that , like mathe - matics or logic , it is nearly a finished business .

		But it has to deal with a subject-matter the produc - tions of the human spirit , infinitely more varied than numbers or the relations of sentences .

		And , besides , new applications of old principles are always in order .

		We moderns call ourselves the heirs of the ages ; and in a measure and in a material way we are so .

		We have huge accumulations of books , and art treasures , and the like .

		But all these posses - sions are not in any single man 's head , still less in the general mind .

		Every generation comes forward full of bounce and confidence , and with an unim - paired fund of original ignorance .

		It does not know anything about literature or art , but it knows what it likes .

		It has a taste , the taste of the age .

		It is a serious objection to the theories of heredity and evolution , that the idea of excellence is not progres - sive in the human mind .

		Have our grandfathers 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, labored for nothing , that our heads are so unfur - nished ?

		Sir
Francis Galton	PERSON	says , if I remember rightly , that as the modern Englishman is to the Hottentot so was the Athenian of the best period to the modern Englishman .

		Man 's faculty of forget - ting is as miraculous as his gift of memory .

		And so it happens that in art and literature and criticism we are all the time beginning anew .

		This newness of impulse and experience is a fine thing .

		In bustle and change is production .

		The literature of every age must be a record of what that age has experi - enced , not necessarily in action alone , but in thought and fancy .

		Yet there are things also which are enduring , and the best criticism will not allow the taste of the age to be imposed upon it , but will rather seek to impose upon the age the long-tested precepts o per ec ion .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		A PHILISTINE VIEW OF POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		How to reply to the '' Philister '' who in your last issue attacks the manhood of the poet , and be both truthful and parliamentary at the same time , is not an easy mat - ter , so wholly unfounded is every leading statement he makes .

		With prefatory apologies for a series of flat contradictions , let me then say : That the reviewer of recently published verse in '' The Nation '' should find better poems from women than from men is surprising and purely adventitious .

		It is so unusual that it probably never happened before , and it may never hap - pen again .

		There are now an average of ten volumes of original verse being published every week in the En - glish-speaking world about five hundred every year .

		Of these , not less than fifty deserve to be read by all who know and love literature in its highest form of ex - pression ; and of these fifty , about forty are written by men .

		Women are not holding their own in poetical ex - pression are making nothing like the impression in poetry that they are making in almost every other department of the world of letters , particularly in romance and essay writing .

		Any magazine almost any newspaper should convince '' Philister '' that there were never so many persons struggling for poetic fame , and that the proportion of men among them was never so large as now .

		It is true that the poetry of most men does not '' pay '' in the monetary sense ; but that is an advantage which almost no other department of litera - ture enjoys , and its effects are rather favorable than otherwise , as the growing body of beautiful English verse abundantly attests .

		The notion that there is '' something unmanly , or un - masculine , in the make-up of a poet '' is neither '' old , '' `` lurking , '' nor `` popular , '' nor is it `` gaining ground . ''

		There is a feeling among English-speaking persons whose associations are remote from cultivated society that all artists are in some way reprehensible ; but these folk set all forms of enjoyment for enjoyment 's sake in the same category , notably athletic exercise .

		This feel - ing , which is no older than puritanism , is frowned upon by everyone pretending to civilization , and is losing ground along with other forms of illiteracy .

		There has never been a time , from Homer to
Browning	PERSON	and
Tenny	PERSON	- son , when the poet was not worshipped in the old sense of the word by intellect and cultivation ; and though we are to-day in a sort of poetical interregnum , many men now writing will attain undoubted worship of the same sort .

		Mr.
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	, one of the most respected men of business in Wall street , and a manly and virile writer of manly and virile poems -LRB- and essays as well -RRB- , had occasion to say a few months ago that many Americans who have put forth poems within the last fifteen years would have achieved eminence had they written earlier ; Mr.
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	has said the same for the Englishman , and Mr.
William Sharp	PERSON	for the Celt : and it is a truism to anyone who knows contemporaneous verse .

		This verse is conspic - uously robust ; and one must have queer notions of ef - feminacy who thinks
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Stedman	PERSON	,
Stoddard	PERSON	, and a score more of our modern '' man-poets , '' are '' effeminate '' !

		There are even in your correspondent 's own
Kansas City	LOCATION	a number of men now striving earnestly and manfully for poetic reputation ; and it is conceivable that the residents of that
Missouri	LOCATION	metropolis might be as willing to go down to fame as the townsmen of these poets , as to draw an example from '' practical '' life of those virile men of business who canned '' roast '' beef for the American soldiers during the recent war .

		WALLACE RICE .


Chicago	LOCATION	,
May 20 , 1899	DATE	.

		IS THE `` MAN-POET '' PASSING ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am not a poet nor the son of a poet , so that any remarks that follow are not prompted by the '' pinch of the shoe . ''

		Your contributor , in his communication -LRB- is - sue of
May 16	DATE	-RRB- on '' The Passing of the Man-Poet , '' seems for some reason to have swung to an extreme of cynicism , and it occurred to me that possibly the '' pinch '' was on the foot of '' Philister '' himself .

		But the West - ern city from which he writes would hardly be favor - able to the production of '' a big , brawny , bearded he - creature like Tennyson ... chirping about ' Airy , fairy
Lilian	PERSON	' '' ; no , that would be expecting too much .

		Per - haps we should not be disappointed if we sought there for men of the class to which `` Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	'' belongs : men who represent the contributor 's idea of the incar - nation of the practical tendencies of our age ; men who can talk politics over the bar , and make occasional re - marks that are commented upon by even '' Cousin George ''
Dewey	PERSON	.

		Yes , / m de siecle common-sense , and plenty of it the kind that thinks poetry should be given over to women because of a lurking popular no - tion that '' there is something unmanly , or unmasculine , in the make-up of a poet '' such common-sense is doubt - less what would most richly reward a searcher in that city .

		Your contributor would have us believe that men , manly men , in this age must yield to vulgar notions about matters of art .

		Granting for a moment that this notion about poets has a real existence , is it not true that there is a popular notion about painters and artists in general similar to that about poets ?

		Suppose that this lurking popular notion were allowed to grow into a prejudice strong enough to put down men who are burning with the divine flame of artistic inspiration : we should cer - tainly have an age prosaic indeed .

		But this is just what '' Philister '' says we are now coming to except for the poetry of women .

		Though it could be done , it is not our purpose to take the time and space to produce an
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 363 array of facts showing that some of the best poetry of the age is written by men ; manly men , who are not ashamed that they write poetry .

		The opinion of the reviewer in '' The Nation '' is the opinion of an individual who had a pile of books on his table , among which -LRB- and he probably did not read all of them -RRB- he thought the best parts were written by women ; he is seconded in his opin - ion by '' Philister '' : two opinions make the passing of the man-poet !

		In all previous literature , two great , really great , women-poets have appeared : Sappho and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	.

		The great men-poets are almost numberless .

		Is the ratio to be reversed at once ?

		But possibly your contributor did not intend his com - munication to be taken seriously .

		If he did not , he has allowed his cynicism to carry him too far .

		He not only does not encourage the writing of poetry by men , but he contemptuously discourages it ; and he discourages not only the writing of poetry , but indirectly all forms of artistic endeavor that do not exactly coincide with popular notions .

		What cynics say must usually be taken with due allowance for the cynical mood .

		And so we should doubtless take what is said by '' Philister . ''

		THE RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I wish with all my heart to congratulate THE DIAL on its spirited defense of the genuine American prin - ciple of freedom of speech .

		The
Republic of Letters	ORGANIZATION	has no room for the official censor , and to be safe within its own domain it must at all times maintain its
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	of letters , forbidding the encroachment of the monarchical principle of censorship even upon the neigh - boring realm of political discussion .

		The man who does not see that the attack upon Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	threatens literature itself has simply failed to follow the matter to its logical end .

		One of the great powers across the sea has been imprisoning men of the type of Mr.
Atkin	PERSON	- son about as fast as they have appeared during recent years , but it has also included men of the type of the author of '' Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	. ''

		Granting the premises on which it imprisons the one , it is perfectly logical in including the other .

		Our own authorities stop where they do , not because they have a logical stopping-place , but because they fear the people at the polls .

		They will go further if the people show themselves satisfied with the first step .

		It has already been hinted from
Washington	LOCATION	that the same censorship might be applied at home , if deemed desirable in the future , and that Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	might possibly be subjected to a criminal prosecution .

		Now , with conditions as they are , the press is liable to bring forth at any time a comedy on some such theme as '' The Genesis of an Empire , '' before the effective sarcasm of which the heat of the authori - ties would wax much greater than before the
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts pamphleteer .

		The material is at hand for such a play , and every city of size in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	would have a fine audience at hand for it .

		If it should come , would it be prohibited as seditious ?

		The country is strong enough , and ought to be intel - ligent enough , to rise above persecution for opinion 's sake , whether that persecution be through the press and platform , or the
Postoffice Department	ORGANIZATION	and the Federal courts .

		Imperialism can furnish no satisfactory return for the sacrifice of the principles of free speech .

		KNAPP 'S LIFE OF GEORGE BORROW .

		* In point of documental richness , Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's Life of that eccentric man and original writer ,
George Borrow	PERSON	, should prove a pleasant sur - prise to even sanguine Borrovians .

		So far as we now know , the only noteworthy omission in this kind is the sheaf of newly discovered let - ters of Borrow to the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	; and one is almost glad , out of sympathy with Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	, who has been at such immense pains to ferret out every shred and scrap of writing necessary to the completeness of his collection , to learn that the new '' find '' is of no special intrinsic importance .

		Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's plan has been to allow the original writings to speak for them - selves wherever feasible .

		His book may there - fore be defined as in the main a mosaic of documents relating to Borrow , so arranged , explained and supplemented as to give the care - ful reader a tolerably clear idea of what the real Borrow really was and did .

		Not that Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	has essayed the impossible task of re - ducing
George Borrow	PERSON	to the humdrum level of commonplace humanity , or the ungrateful one of proving him to have been , for all his mystic assumptions and bravura airs , a mere poseur and exploiter of human gullibility , of the Cagliostro or
George Psalmanazar	PERSON	stripe .

		On the contrary , Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	inclines to take Borrow , except as to his linguistic attainments , pretty much at his own valuation . ''


Laven	PERSON	- gro '' he accepts as substantially an autobiog - raphy which of course it is , although , as Borrow put it , '' in
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	style . ''

		Perhaps we shall not go far wrong if we regard that extraordinary book , and its sequel '' Ro - many Rye , '' as reflecting the life and adven - tures of
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	as seen through the prism of
George Sorrow	ORGANIZATION	's imagination .

		Let us glance at this remarkable life in outline , with the aid of the dry light of Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's researches .


George Henry Borrow	PERSON	, born at East Dere - ham ,
Norfolk	LOCATION	,
July 5 , 1803	DATE	, was the younger son of Captain
Thomas Borrow	PERSON	, an athletic Cornishman of good family , and
Ann Perfre	PERSON	- rnent , a
Norfolk	LOCATION	woman of French Huguenot extraction .


Ann Perfrement	PERSON	, prior to her mar - riage , was an actress of small parts at Dereham * LIFE , WRITINGS , AND CORRESPONDENCE OF GEORGE BORROW -LRB- 1803-1881 -RRB- .

		By
William I. Knapp	PERSON	, Ph.D. .

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		364 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Theatre .

		Captain Borrow rose from the ranks .

		He had '' taken the Queen 's shilling '' to evade arrest as ringleader and chief combatant in a rural riot , in the course of which he had sig - nalized his known prowess by knocking down a score or so of people , including a peace offi - cer .

		Captain Sorrow 's puissant fists were much in evidence throughout his career .

		He won fame as the conqueror of the celebrated bruiser , '' Big Ben , '' in a Homeric combat in
Hyde Park	LOCATION	; and he must have wept for joy to hear of his son 's immortal victory over the '' Flaming Tinman . ''

		These facts about the elder Borrow are noted as partly accounting for the pugilistic bent of his gifted son , who was much given to the ways and company of '' the fancy , '' who attended many a '' merry mill '' in the days of his vagrom youth , who celebrated in manly prose the deeds of
Spring	DATE	,
Cribb	PERSON	,
Oli	PERSON	- ver , Painter , and
Molineaux	PERSON	, and who was him - self , in his prime , second to few men in
England	LOCATION	in the use of nature 's weapons . ''

		Don Jorge '' -LRB- who must have distributed '' apostolic blows and knocks '' almost as freely as Bibles in
Spain	LOCATION	-RRB- thus summed up in rhyme his youthful gifts and attainments : '' A lad who twenty tongues can talk , And sixty miles a day can walk ; Drink at a draught a pint of rum , And then be neither sick nor -RSB- -LSB- dumb ; Can tune a song or make a verse , And deeds of Northern kings rehearse ; Who never will forsake his friend While he his bony fist can bend ; And , though averse to brawl and strife , Will fight a Dutchman with a knife ; Oh , that is just the lad for me , And such is honest six-foot-three . ''


George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's regular schooling -LRB- there was not much of it -RRB- was had at
Edinburgh High School	ORGANIZATION	, and latterly at
Norwich Gram	LOCATION	- mar School , where he slighted his set tasks , and plunged ardently into the study of the Ko - mance languages under such chance tutorship as offered itself .

		At
Norwich	LOCATION	he led an irreg - ular life , quite in the Lavengro way , consorting much with bruisers , strollers , horse-dealers , and other loose fish , including
Thurtell	PERSON	, who after - wards murdered .


William Weare	PERSON	, * and was hanged at
Hertford	LOCATION	in
1824	DATE	, as Borrow 's other crony ,
David Haggart	PERSON	, had been hanged at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	in
1821	DATE	.

		Queer beginnings these for the future translator and disseminator of the Gospel !

		It is difficult to acquit young Borrow of a taste for bad , or at least loose , * '' His throat they cut from ear to ear His brains they battered in ; His name was Mr.
William Weare	PERSON	, He lived in
Lyon	LOCATION	's Inn . ''

		Old Song .

		company , though in his case it sprang from an overflow of animal vigor and an inborn impa - tience of restraint and convention .

		High - mettled youth is apt to confound the lawless and vicious with the spirited and romantic , until experience and reflection come to its aid .

		No man could be morally sounder at the core than was
George Borrow	PERSON	; and , after all , these grimy doings and grimier companionships of his un - regenerate youth were grist for the mill of the future Lavengro .

		What Borrovian regrets them ?

		Another of Borrow 's
Norwich	LOCATION	friends was scholarly , free - thinking , loose-living Will - iam
Taylor	PERSON	, whose precept and example did him no good .

		At
Norwich	LOCATION	, too , his old gypsy friend
Jasper Petulengro	PERSON	-LRB- now '' orphaned '' through the transportation of his worthy pa - rents -RRB- again turned up ; and many and weird were the dialogues of the twain on lonely
Household Heath	ORGANIZATION	, where the wind blew , and the stars shone , and '' Mr.
Petulengro	PERSON	'' devel - oped his truly great theory of the beauty and the delight of life .

		In
1819	DATE	Borrow was articled for five years to a firm of solicitors at
Norwich	LOCATION	, with whom he , naturally , learned little law , and a vast amount of matter that had nothing at all to do with law .

		He had formerly studied Latin ,
Greek	LOCATION	,
Irish	LOCATION	, French , Italian , Spanish , and English-Gypsy ; he now began
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	, Danish , German ,
Hebrew	LOCATION	, Arabic , Gaelic , and Arme - nian as if he meant to rise superior to the curse of the builders of Babel .

		It is needless to say that Borrow 's knowledge of tongues was always and at best wide rather than deep .

		In point of quantity he was , as Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	says , '' prodigious '' -LRB- at the age of twenty he is re - ported to have '' translated with facility and elegance twenty different languages '' -RRB- , and , as to quality , he was undoubtedly considerably more than the mere smatterer .

		But it is not on his scholarship , but on his remarkable style as a writer of English prose from
1841	DATE	to
1862	DATE	, that his reputation rests .

		In
1821	DATE	Borrow met Sir
John Bowring	PERSON	, then engaged in translating his way into public office and emoluments , and at once '' fell into the translation snare . ''

		Bowring , a shrewd man , regarded translating merely as a stepping - stone to office , and he throve accordingly ; poor Borrow , on the contrary , regarded it as a life-absorbing work that would yield him fame and a competence .

		For ten years of mortifi - cation and poverty he was under this delusion , translating into English rhyme Welsh -LRB- '' ten thousand lines of Ab Gwilym '' ! -RRB-

		, Danish , and
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 365 German , and hunting a market for his indif - ferent and unsalable wares .

		Sorrow 's father died in
1824	DATE	, and in that year his term in the solicitor 's office expired .

		So he packed up his precious versions of '' Faustus , '' the '' Ancient Songs of
Denmark	LOCATION	, '' and the everlasting '' Ab Gwilym , '' and set out for
London	LOCATION	, eager to '' begin '' Then came a long season of poorly paid and unpaid pen-drudgery , casual gypsy - ing , actual want , of '' drifting on the sea of the world '' and of '' digging holes in the sand and filling them up again , '' as Borrow mourn - fully put it , which we may pass over .

		These years included that mysterious '' veiled period '' of seven years , which Borrow hints were spent in '' roving adventure '' in distant countries , but which Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	prosaically concludes were mainly passed between
London	LOCATION	and Nor - wich in '' doing common work for booksellers '' and earning the indispensable modicum of daily bread .

		It was
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's humor to mystify , and he was quite willing his ad - mirers should infer from his vague hints that this really commonplace and squalid interim of eclipse in his ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' autobiog - raphy was spent in romantic wanderings and strange , nay unhallowed , enterprises in the
Orient	LOCATION	, over which it were well to drop the veil .

		Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	assigns as Borrow 's two leading principles : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- What was disastrous in his career was carefully concealed , and the proofs -LRB- he thought -RRB- destroyed .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- The secrets thus obliterated were treasured up , and duly reappear in his writings under other names and characters , more or less distorted to evade detection and interpretation .

		A third might be added , viz .

		that he never created a character , and that the originals are easily recognizable to one who thoroughly knows his times and his writings . ''

		Borrow gave up the fight in
London	LOCATION	in
1830	DATE	, and returned to
Norwich	LOCATION	, where he tarried three years , still '' digging holes in the sand and fill - ing them up again . ''

		Just how the wind was tempered to him at this time does not clearly appear , and we find his artist brother
John	PERSON	-LRB- equally in the dark it seems -RRB- writing him from
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' You never tell me what you are doing ; you ca n't be living on nothing . ''

		This brother , who was of a practical turn , first recommended the army -LRB- for , he cheerfully urged , '' you would make a good grenadier '' -RRB- , then '' sticking to the law '' ; and he once ob - served , with considerable truth , '' I am con - vinced that your want of success in life is more owing to your being unlike other people than to any other cause . ''

		Thus was the very qual - ity , by virtue of which in the main
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	lives and grows in the minds of men to-day , sincerely deplored .

		At last , in
1833	DATE	, the dawn came .

		George Borrow 's hitherto burdensome acquirements were to be turned to profitable account .

		The British and
Foreign Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	happened to need an agent versed in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	languages to superintend the printing at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	of a
Manchu	ORGANIZATION	translation of the New Testament ; and Borrow was recommended by Mr.
Gurney	PERSON	of
Norwich	LOCATION	as precisely the man for the work .

		The preliminary bargain was promptly struck much to the amusement of respectable Nor - wich , which laughed consumedly to think of the quondam chum of
Thurtell	PERSON	and disciple of godless '' Billy ''
Taylor	PERSON	thus suddenly con - verted into an instrument for saving the heathen .

		Says Miss Martineau : '' When this polyglott gentleman appeared before the public as a devout agent of the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	in foreign parts , there was one burst of laughter from all who re - membered the old
Norwich	LOCATION	days . ''

		But it was to be '' the devout agent , '' and not
Norwich	LOCATION	'' gigmanity , '' who laughed last .

		Borrow spent his stipulated six months in studying Manchu-Tartar , then passed the Soci - ety 's competitive examination brilliantly , and , on
July 31 , 1833	DATE	, started for
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's chapters on the Russian mission show Borrow in a new light .

		His duties were ardu - ous -LRB- the entire conduct of the business in hand fell upon him -RRB- , and he performed them with a tact , zeal , and practical '' push '' that surprised and delighted his employers .

		The
Government	ORGANIZATION	imprimatur secured , which was no small task to begin with , Borrow contracted for his mate - rial , engaged his printers , taught them to set the strange type , bullied , bribed , or cajoled them back to their work when they went '' on strike , '' battled successfully with the thousand - and-one difficulties of red-tapeism , ignorance , and human wrong-headedness that daily beset him , and , in
September , 1835	DATE	, had his whole edition of one thousand copies of the
Manchu Scriptures	ORGANIZATION	ready for use .

		He had also , largely with his own hands , cleansed , separated , and generally repaired an abandoned font of Man - chu type which had been apparently ruined in the disastrous inundation of the
Neva	LOCATION	ten years before .

		The stipulated work done , Borrow astounded the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	with the '' noble offer '' to himself distribute his Bibles in the benighted regions of the then dim and myste - rious Far East .

		In his own words , he '' would wander , Testament in hand , overland to Pe - king , '' by way of
Lake Baikal	LOCATION	and
Kiakhta	LOCATION	, 366 -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, '' with side-glances at Tartar hordes . ''

		This scheme , long seriously considered by the Soci - ety , in the end came to naught ; but , says Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	slyly , '' Borrow always believed that he went to
Kiakhta	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and over the
East	LOCATION	, and so did the readers of his books . ''

		When it came to his repute as a traveller ,
George Borrow	PERSON	never stood in his own light .

		Of the details of Sorrow 's colportage in
Spain	LOCATION	, nothing need be said here .

		Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	tells us not much that is new in this connec - tion , but he throws some light on what has been doubtful .

		It was evidently more due to the unfavorable change in Spanish politics in
1838	DATE	, than to differences with his principals at home , that
Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's work in
Spain	LOCATION	was dis - continued .

		Such a mission as his could not flourish under a reactionary regime .

		How he , his work , and his immortal book , appeared in orthodox Spanish eyes , is manifest in the fol - lowing passage from the '' History of Religious Dissent in
Spain	LOCATION	'' by
Don Menendez Pelayo	PERSON	: '' The first emissary of these Societies was a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	by the name of
George Borrow	PERSON	, a hoity-toity indi - vidual of little learning and less wit , and with a large amount of gullibility .

		Borrow wrote a most absurdly grotesque book on his travels in
Spain	LOCATION	, of which we might say as of Tirante el
Blanco	PERSON	, that it is a ' storehouse of amusement and a mine of diversion ' a book , in fine , capable of exciting roars of laughter in the most ascetic of readers . ''

		The laughter of
Don Menendez	PERSON	himself over Borrow 's account of his countrymen does not appear to have been of the mirthful and jocund order .

		Borrow 's marriage to Mrs.
Clarke	PERSON	, in
1840	DATE	, put an end to his wanderings and his vagrant - ism , gave him a comfortable home in
England	LOCATION	, and the leisure he needed for his real work in life .

		Of his wife he contentedly , if unroman - tically , writes , in '' Wild Wales , '' that she is a `` perfect paragon of wives can make puddings and sweets and treacle posset , and is the best woman of business in
Eastern Anglia	LOCATION	. ''

		Evi - dently
Lavengro	PERSON	was in a snug harbor at last .

		The pair settled down at
Oulton Cottage	ORGANIZATION	,
Lowestoft	LOCATION	, where Borrow proceeded to finish the '' Gypsies of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' his first original book , the dutiful '' paragon of wives '' acting as aman - uensis .

		The gipsying , tinkering days of the wind-swept heath and the roadside dingle were gone indeed but their memory , as we know , loomed tinged and softened through the mists of time .

		The '' Gypsies '' was duly finished and submitted to
Murray	LOCATION	, as Dr. Smiles relates : `` In
November , 1840	DATE	, a tall athletic gentleman in black called upon Mr.
Murray	PERSON	, offering a MS. for pe - rusal and publication .

		Mr.
Murray	PERSON	could not fail to be taken at first sight with this extraordinary man .

		He had a splendid physique , standing six feet two in bis stockings , and he had brains as well as muscles , as his works sufficiently show . ''

		The '' Gypsies '' was published in
April , 1841	DATE	, and succeeded fairly well .

		Then came '' The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- substantially a mosaic of the author 's letters to the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , issued in
December , 1842	DATE	, which at once took the reading and the reviewing world by storm .

		In
England	LOCATION	the sales far outran the hopes of author and publisher .

		As to
America	LOCATION	-LRB- alas ! -RRB-

		, the two works were printed at
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	'' in tens of thousands , '' '' by three rival houses '' ; and from these sales , we learn ,
George	PERSON	Borrow '' derived nothing '' !

		The wronged man wrote to his wife : '' A letter appeared
last Saturday	DATE	in the ` Athenseum ' which states that an edition of thirty thousand copies has just been brought out in
America	LOCATION	.

		I really never heard of anything so infamous . ''

		Let us congratulate ourselves that our law - makers have now shown signs of a dawning or rudimentary conscience in respect of the rights of the foreign author .

		The origin , progress , and character of '' La - vengro '' are satisfactorily indicated in Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's copious extracts from Borrow 's corre - spondence .

		The book was '' on the stocks '' virtually before the '' Bible '' was issued .

		On
October 2 , 1843	DATE	, Borrow wrote to Murray : '' The book I am at present about , will consist of a series of Rembrandt pictures interspersed here and there with a
Claude	PERSON	.

		I shall tell the world of my parentage , iny early thoughts , and habits ; how I became a sapengro , or viper-catcher ; my wanderings with the regiment in
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and
Ireland	LOCATION	, in which latter place my jockey habits first commenced .

		Then a great deal about
Norwich	LOCATION	,
Billy Taylor	PERSON	,
Thurtell	LOCATION	, etc. , etc. ; how I took to study and became a lav-engro .

		* ... Whenever the book comes out it will be a rum one . ''

		A '' rum one '' it was , in all conscience , too '' rum '' for the wiseacres of the reviews , who shook their sapient heads at it , and con - demned it with scarcely a dissenting voice .

		Borrow , of course , was furious , and laid about him like an angry bull tormented by a swarm of gnats .

		In the preface to a later edition he declared that he had had the honor of being rancorously abused '' by every unmanly scoun - drel , every sycophantic lacquey , and every po - litical and religious renegade in
Britain	LOCATION	f '' ; and in his Appendix he truculently held up his critics , '' blood and foam streaming from their * Word - master .

		t These were the words of the autograph original .

		Murray judiciously softened them into : '' by the very people of whom the country has least reason to be proud . ''

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 367 jaws . ''

		Sorrow 's abuse of his censors was of course as ill-judged and ineffectual as was their dispraise of his book .

		No author , as somebody observes , was ever permanently written down -LRB- or , let us add , written up -RRB- by anyone but himself ; and time is verifying Dr.
Hake	PERSON	's pre - diction that '' ' Lavengro 's ' roots will strike deep into the soil of English letters . ''

		But we must now take leave of Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's valuable book .

		After the death , in
1869	DATE	, of Borrow 's wife , the course of his life ran un - eventfully and drearily to the end .

		The old fitful hypochondria dogged his closing years ; and the '' Romany Rye '' died alone in the more melancholy sense of the word , as there is reason to believe at
Oulton	LOCATION	, on
July 26 , 1881	DATE	.

		Soon afterward the cottage was pulled down and the grounds were modernized ; but the summer-house where '' Lavengro '' was written still stands among the trees a shrine for Borrovian pilgrims .

		On the score of style , Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	's book can - not in candor be praised ; but it is on the whole a noteworthy and useful performance , for which students of Borrow especially will be thankful .


E. G. J. LOWELL	PERSON	, AND HIS FRIENDS .

		* Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	has drunk deep from the Fountain of Youth ; for , notwithstand - ing the fact that he wants but a few years of attaining to the dignity of an octogenarian , he still writes with all the vigor of the happy prime of manhood .

		Not all his years and labors have exhausted his inventiveness .

		His work is still characterized by the features which distin - guished it years ago .

		It is marked by the same genial humor , the same wholesome optim - ism , the same sound sense ; and the charm of his style with its ease , its simplicity , its seem - ing disregard of method is as fascinating as ever .

		He is still the supreme master of the material in which he works .

		In his latest work , ''
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	and his Friends , '' his object , he reminds us , was not so much to give a history of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's life as '' to show the circumstances which sur - rounded his life and which account for the course of it . ''

		Here certainly , there was need of a supreme master of material , for the friends
Lowell	PERSON	made in the course of his many-sided career were legion , and a less gifted author *

		than Dr.
Hale	PERSON	might easily have been led to say too much .

		That Dr.
Hale	PERSON	has not said too much , goes without saying .

		In an age gone mad with the ungovernable desire of sweeping up the chips of every author 's literary work - shop and of displaying these worthless frag - ments to the gaze of the public , it is refreshing to come across such a book as this , for the self - restraint which the author has shown in exclud - ing from his book all that was not absolutely essential is as admirable as it is unusual .

		Added to this there was the intimate personal knowledge of the men and manners described , which has enabled Dr.
Hale	PERSON	to reproduce the life of the time the thoughts , the feelings , and the actions of these men of whom he him - self was an associate .

		The result of all this is that , no matter what period of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's life we follow whether it be his childhood and boy - hood at
Elmwood	LOCATION	, his undergraduate days at
Harvard	LOCATION	, his rustication to
Concord	LOCATION	, his asso - ciations in
Boston	LOCATION	in the forties , his inner com - panionship with the young men and women known respectively as '' The Club '' and '' The Band , '' his entrance upon a career of letters , his experiences as public speaker and editor , his professorship at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	or his connection with politics and war , his ministry in
Spain	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	or his last years in the Elmwood of his youth no one can rise from the perusal of this book without feeling that he has learned to know
Lowell	PERSON	as a man better than ever be - fore , that he has come to regard
Lowell	PERSON	with something of the affection that most people bestow upon
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and that of all men living Dr.
Hale	PERSON	was the one best fitted to bring us to an appreciation of the really loveable side of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		It would be manifestly impossible , in the space of a brief article , to give the reader any adequate idea of Dr.
Bale	PERSON	's treatment of the several phases of
Lowell	LOCATION	's life , unless we were to select some one or two for special considera - tion .

		Perhaps the two most interesting por - tions of his book are the chapters dealing with
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	during
Lowell	PERSON	's undergraduate days , and with
Boston	LOCATION	in the forties , just as
Lowell	PERSON	was entering upon his literary career .

		When
Lowell	PERSON	entered
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1834	DATE	to follow Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's account that institution was what we should now call an
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		There were some two hundred and fifty stu - dents , most of whom were between the ages of sixteen and twenty-two ; and these gave their days and nights when they were studiously inclined to the study of Latin , Greek , and 368 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, mathematics .

		On three days of the week ,
Monday	DATE	,
Wednesday	DATE	, and
Friday	DATE	, teachers of modern languages appeared , and everyone not a freshman was obliged to choose some one of these languages and pursue it for four terms .

		When the student came to count up his credits , however , a modern language was worth only half as much as a classical language .

		Later in his career the student read rhetoric , logic , moral philosophy , political economy , chemistry , and natural history .

		There was at that time no study of English literature , although excellent drill was had in writing the English language .

		A day in the older
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	was a rather dull affair .

		You attended morning and evening prayers in the chapel , half the year at six in the morning and six in the
evening	TIME	, or , when the days shortened , as late as half-past seven in the morning and as early as quarter past four in the afternoon .

		After morning prayers you went to the class-rooms and recited your lessons .

		The rest of the day you spent in the library , or reading and studying in your own room .

		In
Lowell	LOCATION	's undergraduate days ,
Josiah Quin	PERSON	- cey was president of the college the man who had been a leader of the old Federalists in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, who had opposed
Eandolph	ORGANIZATION	and Jef - ferson , and who , like
Socrates	PERSON	, believed he had a ''
Daimon	ORGANIZATION	'' to direct him .

		Fortunately for
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	,
Edward Tyrrel Channing	PERSON	, one of those great teachers who have an individuality to im - press upon their students , was then a member of the Faculty , and to him , says Dr.
Hale	PERSON	, was due the English of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Sumner	PERSON	,
Clarke	PERSON	,
Bellows	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Higginson	PERSON	, and other men who came under his training .

		And if one stops to think of it what a tribute this is !

		When
Longfellow	PERSON	came to
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
1836	DATE	, he inaugurated a sort of renaissance in modern continental literature .

		He was fresh from study in
Europe	LOCATION	* he came from
Bowdoin	LOCATION	thus show - ing the
Cambridge	LOCATION	undergraduates that accom - plished men could be trained outside of
Harvard	LOCATION	and he was already known as a man of let - ters .

		At that time the atmosphere of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	was distinctly a literary one ; and
Longfellow	PERSON	's arrival made it more so .

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	says that the books which the fellows took from the col - lege library , and those they bought for their own subscription libraries , were books of liter - ature that is , '' mere '' literature .

		One of the books seen everywhere , for instance , was a volume printed in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, containing the poems of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	.

		We are told that
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's copy of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's first volume of poems passed eagerly from hand to hand , and that
Carlyle	PERSON	's books were purchased and read as fast as they appeared .

		Three or four literary societies helped to foster this love of literature , as did also the
Alpha Delta Phi	ORGANIZATION	when it was founded .

		The truth seems to be that if the fellows did dabble in anything be - sides literature , they were very like to show an indifference splendidly illustrated by one of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's anecdotes .

		He says : '' In the
year 1840	DATE	, 1 was at West Point for the first time , with
William Story	PERSON	,
Lowell	PERSON	's classmate and friend , and with
Story	ORGANIZATION	's sister and mine .

		We enjoyed to the full the matchless hospitality of
West Point	LOCATION	, seeing its lions under the special care of two young officers of our own age .

		They had just finished their course , as we had recently finished ours at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		One day when Story and I were by ourselves , after we had been talking of our studies with these gentlemen ,
Story	ORGANIZATION	said to me : '
Ned	PERSON	, it is all very well to keep a stiff upper lip with these fellows , but how did you dare tell them that we studied about projectiles at
Cambridge	LOCATION	? ' ''

		Because we did , ' said I. '' ` Did I ever study projectiles ? '

		asked Story , puzzled . '' '

		Certainly you did , ' said I .

		You used to go up to
Peirce	LOCATION
Tuesday	DATE	and
Thursday	DATE	afternoons in the
summer	DATE	when you were a junior , with a blue book which had a white back . ' '' '

		I know I did , ' said Story ; ` and I was studying projectiles then ?

		This is the first time I ever heard of it . ' ''

		Not five of the fellows , says Dr.
Hale	PERSON	, saw a daily newspaper , and the isolation from the world outside of
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	was well nigh complete .

		Even as late as
1860	DATE	, the men at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	paid little attention to what was going on elsewhere , a fact made clear by the story which follows .

		The accuracy of this story has been questioned , but Dr.
Hale	PERSON	says he has taken care to verify all its details . ''

		One of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's fellow professors told me this curi - ous story , which will illustrate the narrowness of
New England	LOCATION	observation at that time .

		There appeared at
Cambridge	LOCATION	in the year 1860 a young gentleman named
Robert Todd Lincoln	PERSON	, who ... is quite well known in this country and
England	LOCATION	.

		This young man wished to enter
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, and his father , one
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, who has since been known in the larger world , had fortified him with a letter of introduction to Dr.
Walker	PERSON	, the president of the college .

		This letter of introduction was given by one
Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	, who was a person also then quite well known in political life , and he presented the young man to Dr.
Walker	PERSON	as being the son of his friend
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, ' with whom I have lately been canvassing the
State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	. '

		When this letter , now so curious in history , was read ,
Lowell	PERSON	said to my friend who tells me the story , ' I suppose I am the only man in this room who has ever heard of this
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	; but he is the person with whom
Douglas	PERSON	has been traveling up and down in
Illinois	LOCATION	, canvassing the
State	ORGANIZATION	in their new Western fashion , as representatives of the two parties , each of them being the candidate for the vacant seat in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	. '

		What is more , my friend says it is probably true that at the moment when this letter was presented by young Robert
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		369 Lincoln , none of the faculty of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, ex - cepting
Lowell	PERSON	, had ever heard of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		The story is a good one , as showing how far it was in those days possible for a circle of intelligent men to know little or nothing of what was happening in the world beyond the sound of their college bell . ''

		So much for
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	begins his account of
Boston	LOCATION	in the forties with the state - ment that he despairs of making anyone appre - ciate the ferment in the life of
Boston	LOCATION	at that time .

		However that may be , he has assuredly written a most entertaining account .


Boston	LOCATION	was then a town where everybody knew pretty nearly everbody else , he says , and where , as someone said , `` You could go anywhere in ten minutes . ''

		Most of the people were of the old Puritan stock , who '' lived to the glory of God '' and who '' believed in the infinite capacity of human nature . ''

		Whatever they did , they did on a generous scale and as if confident of suc - cess .


Boston	LOCATION	, in fact , '' became the headquar - ters for
New England	LOCATION	, and in a measure for the country , of every sort of enthusiasm , not to say of every sort of fanaticism ... There was not an ' ism ' but had its shrine , nor a cause but had its prophet . ''

		Those were the days , too , of '' The Five of Clubs , '' known also as the '' Mutual
Admira	PERSON	- tion Society , '' which was composed of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	and his law partner ,
George Stillman Hillard	PERSON	;
H. W. Longfellow	PERSON	;
Cornelius Con way Felton	PERSON	, professor of Greek at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and afterwards president of the college ; and
H. R. Cleveland	PERSON	.

		Here is the story of an epigram which the
Club	ORGANIZATION	made upon '' In Memoriam '' : '' The firm , then
Ticknor & Fields	ORGANIZATION	, were
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's American publishers .

		They had just brought out ' In Memoriam . '

		One of the five gentlemen looked in as he went down town , took up the book , and said ,
Tennyson	PERSON	has done for friendship what
Petrarch	PERSON	did for love , Mr. Fields , ' to which Mr.
Fields	PERSON	assented ; and his friend say Mr.
Hillard	PERSON	went his way .

		Not displeased with his own remark when he came to his office if it were
Hillard	PERSON	he repeated it to Sumner , who in turn repeated it to
Cleveland	LOCATION	, perhaps , when he looked in .

		Going home to lunch ,
Sumner	PERSON	goes in at the shop , takes up the new book , and says ,
Your Tennyson	PERSON	is out , Mr. Fields .

		What
Petrarch	PERSON	did for love ,
Tennyson	PERSON	has done for friendship . '

		Mr. Fields again assents , and it is half an hour before Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	enters .

		He also is led to say that
Tennyson	PERSON	has done for friendship what Petrarch has done for love ; and before the sun sets Mr. Fields receives the same suggestion from
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and then from
Felton	PERSON	, who have fallen in with their accustomed friends , and look in to see the new books , on their way out to
Cambridge	LOCATION	. ''

		In this same chapter , ''
Boston	LOCATION	in the Forties , '' there is a paragraph about
Emerson	PERSON	which is worth quoting , partly because it shows how Dr.
Hale	PERSON	makes use of
Lowell	PERSON	's friends to enliven his book and partly because it hints at some of the practical difficulties
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	himself had to overcome when he adopted a literary career : '' The truth was that literature was not yet a profes - sion .

		The men who wrote for the ' North American ' were earning their bread and butter , their sheets , blan - kets , fuel , broadcloth , shingles , and slates in other en - terprises .

		Emerson was an exception ; and perhaps the impression as to his being crazy was helped by the observation that these ' things which perish in the using ' came to him in the uncanny and unusual channel of literary workmanship .

		Even
Emerson	PERSON	printed in the ' North American Review ' lectures which had been delivered elsewhere .

		He told me in
1849	DATE	, after he had returned from
England	LOCATION	, that he had then never received a dollar from the sale of any of his own published works .

		He said he owned a great many copies of his own books , but that these were all the returns which he had received from his publishers .

		And Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	told me that when , after ' English Traits , ' published by him , had in the first six months ' sales paid for its plates and earned a balance besides in
Emerson	LOCATION	's favor ,
Emerson	PERSON	could not believe this .

		He came to the office to explain to Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	that he wanted and meant to hold the property in his own stereotype plates .

		And Mr.
Phil	PERSON	- lips had difficulty in persuading him that he had already paid for them and did own them .

		Emerson was then so unused to the methods of business that Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	had also to explain to him how to indorse the virgin check , so that he could place it at his own bank account . ''

		Perhaps these passages will suffice to show at least the entertaining character of this work .

		While not all the passages here quoted bear directly upon
Lowell	PERSON	's life , it should be re - marked that the reader is never allowed to for - get that
Lowell	PERSON	is the central figure of this biography .

		Each period of his life is treated with a true sense of the proportion due it , although the chief object of the work , as already stated , was rather to show
Lowell	PERSON	's environ - ment and the extent to which his life and char - acter were the products of that environment .

		The pleasure of tracing with Dr.
Hale	PERSON	the course of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's career , and be assured it is no small pleasure , we must leave to the reader .

		It should be said , in conclusion , that the attractiveness of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's book is enhanced by more than two score of portraits , facsimiles , and other illustrations , that in the course of his narration not a few of
Lowell	LOCATION	's poems are printed which either have not appeared before in print or are not now easily accessible .

		The most important of these poems , and a really beautiful poem it is , is one of sixty lines called '' My Brook , '' which was written at Whitby in
1889	DATE	and published the next year in the ''
New York	LOCATION	Ledger . ''

		Owing to the circumstances of its publication , it does not appear in the '' Li - brary edition '' of
Lowell	LOCATION	's works .

		370 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, FOLK-LORE TAL.ES or AMERICAN INDIANS .

		*
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	needs no introduction to the folk-lore student or to the lover of good litera - ture .

		In his folk-lore work he is an original investigator , gathering his stories at first hand .

		His collections of Irish and Slav folk-tales are unsurpassed .

		The book before us , '' Creation Myths of Primitive America , '' while not his first work upon American Indian legends , is the first he has presented in form for popular reading .

		The stories are gathered from two Californian tribes the
Wintu	LOCATION	and the
Yana	LOCATION	.

		These tribes have little importance numerically , and present a rather low grade of culture .

		Their stories are , however , rather unusually consistent and well-told .

		Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	recognizes two cycles of myths among American tribes . ''

		The first cycle of myths that is , those which relate to creation , in other words to the metamorphoses of the first people or gods into everything which is in the world , including the world itself is suc - ceeded by another in which are described the various changes , phenomena , and processes observed throughout nature .

		In this second cycle ... light and darkness , heat and cold , opposing winds , heavenly bodies , appear as heroes and leading actors . ''

		These two groups Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	calls creation myths and action myths .

		If these two are to be recognized and they should be , although they are often confused and intermingled a third group should be as clearly recognized .

		Barbarous or savage myths may profitably be distinguished as three in kind cosmogonic or creation myths , hero or action myths , and migration legends .

		Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	considers only cosmogonic myths in this little book .

		Nine of those he presents are from the
Wintu	LOCATION	, thirteen from the
Yana	LOCATION	.

		They present considerable similarity , and illus - trate one system of thought .

		In an introduc - tory chapter the author , rather laboredly , dis - cusses '' the Indian myth system . ''

		He quotes a native American as saying : `` There was a world before this one in which we are living at present ; that was the world of the first people , who were different from us altogether .

		Those people were very numerous , so numerous that if a count could be made of all the stars in the sky , all the feathers on birds , all the hairs and fur on animals , all the hairs of our own heads , they would not be so numerous as the first people . ''

		Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	claims that the creation story * CREATION MYTHS OF PRIMITIVE
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		By
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	.

		Boston : Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		always begins with these conditions , and traces the actions of these '' first people '' and their final destruction or transformation giving rise to the world , animals , plants , and man .

		Certainly these
Wintu	LOCATION	and Yana stories illus - trate such a system .

		But is it not a little un - fortunate at this time to emphasize , as Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	thus does , the unity of the American tribes ?

		All tribes do not give just such stories .

		We should cease , for a little , asserting the great likeness of all American Indians that '' when you have seen one Indian you have seen all . ''

		Do not the works of
Boas	LOCATION	on American phys - ical types and the
Northwest Coast	ORGANIZATION	myths , and the monographic studies of the
Bureau of Eth	ORGANIZATION	- nology , show our present need to be the exam - ination of tribes in detail and the bringing out of differences rather than of similarities ?

		Just now , to lay out great systems for the whole '' race '' is confusing rather than helpful .

		Of course the stories are well-told : trust Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	for that .

		The great number of actors and the strange names make it difficult sometimes to follow the narration , but on the whole the legends exhibit quaint ingenuity and shrewdness .

		Sometimes they show bold and lofty conceptions .

		The book is rather elegantly made up , but the binding is bad : the pages are likely to fall out with a single reading .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 exceedingly fond of fighting not , indeed , of the strife with weapons on the battlefield , but of a good rough - and-tumble contest with fists and feet , cudgels and stone-throwing , such as the lower classes indulge in to this day , in the first month of the year , ward against ward in a city , and village against village in the coun - try .

		To him it is as much a ' divarsion ' as to any broth of a bhoy ' in the palmy days of Donnybrook Fair .

		This sportive pugnacity is not the only point of resemblance between the characteristics of
Koreans	LOCATION	and Milesians ; both races combine charm of manner with a disinclination for sustained effort in serious matters ; both are much attracted by politics of a militant sort .

		The condition of an earthenware hat , three feet in diam - eter , after a lively scrimmage between rival factions , may easily be imagined .

		Even that reproach to our civilization , the silk hat , would come better out of the fray .

		Now , a broken hat gives a disreputable appear - ance to its wearer in any civilized community ; in ancient
Korea	LOCATION	it entailed more serious consequences than mere loss of outward respectability .

		Its possession rendered the purchase of a new hat unnecessary , as it involved , when brought under official notice , the instant decapi - tation of the owner .

		Nor was this the only advantage of the hat as a preserver of the public peace : it became simply impossible for the disaffected to put their heads together for the purpose of plotting treason when their skulls were surrounded by brittle brims a yard across . ''

		The author regards the Japanese as having no great vices and being free from many of the smaller ones .

		For example : '' The Japanese can not swear , even if he had a mind to ; his language will not allow itself to be thus defiled ; it contains absolutely no ' swear - words . '

		This limita - ation has its inconveniences ; when a Japanese takes to playing golf he is obliged to learn English . ''

		The Japanese , Mr. Di < 5sy maintains , are not merely imitative , they are constructing a new civilization as an expression of their own virtues and powers , the European civilization being merely an external stimulus .

		The enterprising cheap industry of
Japan	LOCATION	threatens the industrial supremacy of the
West	LOCATION	.

		The power of
Russia	LOCATION	and the inaptness of
Britain	LOCATION	in the
Far East	LOCATION	are emphasized .


Russia	LOCATION	regards it as her heaven-sent destiny to rule
Asia	LOCATION	and
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , to be the World-Power , and the Peace Con - ference is but '' the truce of the Bear . ''

		Only if
Britain	LOCATION	ally herself with
Japan	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, can
Russia	LOCATION	he kept in hounds .

		Such are the author 's conclusions , and the book is certainly of interest and value as giving much real information on the vexed Eastern question from one who evi - dently has an intimate acquaintance with the peoples of the Orient .

		Another interesting hook on the
New Japan	LOCATION	is Mrs.
Hugh Eraser	PERSON	's '' Letters from
Japan	LOCATION	, '' a very pleasant account from the standpoint of a three years ' residence in
Tokyo	LOCATION	and of some excursions in the country .

		The picturesque in landscape and people , and the poetic in legend and folklore , attract Mrs.
Eraser	PERSON	, and she is of course greatly interested in the Japanese woman and child , both of whom she much admires .

		The intense patriotism of the Japanese , their unbounded simple-minded pride in their nation , was never more manifest than in the matter of the attack by a Japanese on the Cesare - vitch in
1891	DATE	. ''

		The theatres were closed , the shops and markets abandoned ; everywhere people spoke in groups and with profound sadness in their tones .

		The little daugh - ter of Viscount A oka , the Minister for Foreign Affairs -LRB- she is ten years old -RRB- , heard the announcement of the outrage with a stony face , and went away in silence to her room .

		There , for hours , she lay on the floor in an agony of grief and shame , moaning , ' I am a Japanese !

		I must live with this shame !

		I can not I can not ! '

		... A little samurai girl , a mere child of sixteen , I think , was in service near
Yokohama	LOCATION	.

		She travelled to
Kyoto	LOCATION	, dressed herself in holiday robes , composed her little body for death by tying her sash tightly round her knees after the custom of samurai women , and cut her throat in the doorway of the great government offices .

		They found on her two letters : one , a farewell to her family ; the other containing a message , which she begged those who found her to convey to the Emperor , saying that she gave her life gladly , hoping that though so lowly it might wipe out the insult , and she entreated him to be comforted by her death .

		Her name , they say was
Yuko	PERSON	, which means full of valor ... People who were on board the
Cesarevitch	ORGANIZATION	's ship told me that it seemed to sink with gifts ; the decks , the saloons , the passages were encumbered , and still they came and came and came !

		The universality and spontaneousness of the manifestation gave it an overwhelming value , which the Prince here and his parents at home were quick to appreciate .

		Rich people gave out of their riches , and objects of unexampled beauty and rarity were brought out from the treasure-houses and sent with messages of love and respect to the boy who lay healing of his wounds in
Kobe Harbour	PERSON	.

		The poor sent the most touching gifts the rice and shoyu , the fish and barley-flour , which would have fed the little family for a year ; poor old peasants walked for days so as to bring a tiny offering of eggs . ''

		Mrs.
Eraser	PERSON	has much to say of the social life of the highest circles of the Japanese officials ; she had exceptional opportunities of observation , and do - mestic life is portrayed with sympathetic insight .

		If ladies can be interested in books of travel , they will assuredly like this one .

		The illustrations are abundant and dainty .


Africa	LOCATION	, the New South of the Old World , ia changing most rapidly in the Far South .

		In the hook entitled '' On the South African Frontier , '' Mr.
W. H. Brown	PERSON	recounts his experiences and ob - servations '' during seven years ' participation in the settlement and development of
Rhodesia	LOCATION	. ''

		The hook '' treats variedly of travel , collecting , hunting , prospecting , farming , scouting , fighting , '' and '' had its origin principally in a desire to give to my fellow-countrymen in
America	LOCATION	a clearer idea than it has been possible to glean from fragmentary ac - counts , appearing from time to time , of the events which have taken place during the past nine years in connection with Anglo-Saxon conquest and colo - nization on the South African frontier . ''

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	had a hand in the opening up of
Rhodesia	LOCATION	, a country larger than
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	combined , with a climate like that of
California	LOCATION	; a country fertile , 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, and rich in gold , iron , and coal .

		The natives made trouble on the African frontier much as the Indians did on our frontier , and several thrilling tales are given of conflicts between the whites and blacks in the
Matabele	LOCATION	and
Mashona	LOCATION	uprisings .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	had a varied experience with them in war and peace .

		He notes an interesting trait of the
Banyai	PERSON	.

		`` High up among the rocks , in almost inaccessible places , these timid beings dwelt in neighborly proximity to the baboons and monkeys .

		Their fields were in the valleys below , where they raised Kafir corn , mealies , and melons ... The Banyai were apparently good - natured creatures , small of stature , though symmetri - cally and strongly built .

		The scouting party came upon a man working in his field , near whom were several big , shaggy baboons , industriously digging for roots .

		The savage was frightened at the appearance of the white men , but the baboons worked on , paying little heed to the intruders ... During the interview the baby baboons , up among the rocks near the dwelling of the natives , were heard crying , exactly like human babies .

		The
Banyai	PERSON	were asked if the baboons did not molest the children , but they replied , ' No , they are friends with one another . ' ''

		`` Under the African Sun , '' by
W. J. Ansorge	PERSON	, concerns itself with the heart of
Africa	LOCATION	and the rise there of the
Uganda	LOCATION	Protectorate under British rule . ''

		The
Uganda	LOCATION	Protectorate does not mean simply
Uganda	LOCATION	the kingdom which the famous autocrat King Mtesa ruled over once upon a time but it includes also the vast realms around it , territories where no white man has ever passed , lakes only recently dis - covered by hardy explorers and travellers , and races of men differing from each other in language , in manners , and in customs .

		Those who read stirring records of exploration and discoveries associated with names like
Livingstone	PERSON	,
Speke	ORGANIZATION	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	, and
Mungo Park	LOCATION	, are very much mistaken if they imagine that similar achieve - ments are out of their reach because all that can be dis - covered has been discovered .

		Within the last few years Count
Teleki	PERSON	has added to the map two new lakes lying close together , and named by him
Lake Rudolph	PERSON	and
Lake Stephanie	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Ansorge	PERSON	's work was not , however , that of ex - ploration ; but as medical officer and administrator he visited the various stations in
Uganda	LOCATION	, and re - cords in this book impressions of travel made since
1894	DATE	, describing the various districts and tribes , and giving some notes on hunting and collecting .

		Per - haps the most interesting of the tribes he visited were the
Kavirondo	PERSON	.

		This people are not savages , nor even the lowest of barbarians , being farmers and iron-workers ; yet it is the fashion of all to go entirely nude .

		`` Scanty dress may naturally be expected amongst savages of a low type and living in a tropical climate , but to find oneself among a race absolutely naked is a strange experience ; and yet within a few weeks or months the novelty wears off , and one fails to notice anything extraordinary in such a mode of life .

		The inhabitants of Kavirondo recall the state of mankind in the Garden of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	before the Fall .

		Banana-trees and other tropical vegetation around the huts , at least in some parts of their country , would strengthen this impression of being in a garden , were it not for the tree - less grass-plains outside the village .

		Young and old go about in the same primeval garb .

		Women often wear a curious ornament , in the shape of a tail , which con - sists of a number of plaited strings manufactured out of some sort of vegetable fibre .

		A tiny apron of the same material is worn by a few of the women .

		As it is never worn by the unmarried , I was told that its presence was the equivalent for the European wedding-ring ; but I am sure this is incorrect , as I have come across numbers of young mothers and wives without this apron , and have seen widows with and without it .

		I believe it is simply a fashion , like the tail , without another object . ''

		The latter portion of the book is taken up with hunting adventures with elephants , lions , rhinocer - oses , hippopotami , gazelles , antelopes , and smaller game .

		This simple , clear , modest narrative makes attractive and agreeable reading , and the abundant illustrations are very good .

		While the advance of British influence is more rapid in
South and Central Africa	LOCATION	than in
West Africa	LOCATION	, yet here also , as Miss
Kingsley	PERSON	indicates in her ''
West Africa	LOCATION	Studies , ''
England	LOCATION	is fast increas - ing her power .

		But Miss
Kingsley	PERSON	devotes some chapters to a sharp indictment of the English Colo - nial system , ending thus : '' You have got a grand rich region there , populated by an uncommon fine sort of human being .

		You have been trying your present set of ideas on it for over 400 years ; they have failed in a heart-breaking drizzling sort of way to perform any single solitary one of the things you say you want done there .

		West
Africa	LOCATION	to-day is just a quarry of paving-stones for Hell , and those stones were cemented in place with men 's blood mixed with wasted gold . ''

		Miss
Kingsley	PERSON	probably knows more at first-hand about African fetish than any other living person , and there is much that is suggestive in her treat - ment of the subject .

		She finds in fetish a thoroughly natural and logical point of view which culminates in the highest philosophy .

		She can even learn wis - dom from a witch doctor . ''

		He talked for an hour , softly , wordily , and gently ; and the gist of what that man talked was
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Pro- metheus .

		I recognized it after half an hour , and when he had done , said , '' You got that stuff from a white man . ' '

		No , sir , ' he said , that no be white man fash , that be country fash ; white man no fit to savee our fash . '

		Are n't they , my friend ? '

		I said ; and we parted for the night , I the wiser for it , he the richer . ''

		Fetish often infects white people in
Africa	LOCATION	, and we suspect
Miss Kingsley	PERSON	is too much of a fetishist to give the thorough objective analysis which science requires , though many of her remarks are very penetrating .

		Superstition everywhere is logical and rational in its own childish and foolish way .

		Miss
Kingsley	PERSON	has many vivid sketches of the native African and we must close this notice with one ad - mirable bit on African volubility . ''

		Woe to the man in
Africa	LOCATION	who can not stand perpet - ual uproar .

		Few things surprised me more than the rarity of silence and the intensity of it when you did get it .

		There is only that time which comes between 10:30
A. M.	PERSON	and
4:30 P. M.	PERSON	, in which you can look for anything like the usual quiet of an English village .

		We will give
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 373 man the first place in the orchestra ; he deserves it .

		I fancy the main body of the lower classes of
Africa	LOCATION	think externally instead of internally .

		You will hear them when they are engaged together on some job each man issuing the fullest directions and prophecies con - cerning it , in shouts ; no one taking the least notice of his neighbors .

		If the head man really wants them to do something definite , he fetches those within his reach an introductory whack ; and even when you are sitting alone in the forest you will hear a man or woman coming down the narrow bush-path chattering away with such energy and expression that you can hardly believe your eyes when you learn from him that he has no companion .

		This statement , indeed , is such a commonplace to the student of European humanism that we marvel at its seeming to need a defence , even for the popular mind , at the hands of the men who have prepared the very interesting book about Petrarch now before us .

		This book , which has for a title '' Petrarch : The First Modern Scholar and Man of Letters '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is the joint work of Professors
James Harvey Robinson	PERSON	and
Henry Winchester Rolfe	PERSON	.

		It consists mainly of selections from
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's letters ; but the editors have added much matter of their own in the way of criticism , biography , and connective tissue .

		The result is such a presentation of the subject to English readers as had not previously been made , and we are heartily glad to have it .

		And it is an important thing to set Petrarch right in the popular estimate . ''

		It is a sad commonplace to the thoughtful student of the past that the successful reformer is sometimes remembered for his weaknesses rather than for his true strength .

		Nothing is easier than to pronounce Voltaire a shallow deist , Erasmus a timorous dys - peptic crying peace when there was no peace , and to see in
Petrarch	LOCATION	only the lifelong victim of an unfor - tunate love affair . ''

		When we remember that '' to their author , the incomparable sonnets seemed little more than a youthful diversion , '' we begin to get some notion of the true perspective of his life .

		He himself wrote of them thus disparagingly : '' These popular songs , the result of my youthful distress , now overwhelm me with shame and regret , although , as we see , they are still acceptable enough to those suffering from the same malady . ''

		Again , we should recall the fact that , if it is important for us to know Petrarch for what he was in the history of culture , we are abundantly provided with the necessary ma - terials .

		Say our editors : '' There is perhaps no other historical character before the age of Luther , with the possible exception of
Cicero	PERSON	, who has left so complete and satisfactory account of his spiritual life and en - vironment . ''

		Thus we see that both the need and the matter for such a book as the one before us made its preparation desirable ; and in recognizing the one and dealing so intelligently with the other , Messrs.
Robinson	PERSON	and
Rolfe	PERSON	have laid us under a consider - able obligation .

		Among the interesting features of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's correspondence here given are some of the '' Letters to Dead Authors , '' the letters to and about
Rienzo	PERSON	, the famous description of the ascent of
Mount Ventoux	LOCATION	, and a series of letters and ex - tracts from letters in illustration of his classical studies .

		Letters of Two tastefully printed volumes of the
18th century	DATE	letters of Swif t ,
Addison	PERSON	, and
Steele	PERSON	, essays .

		and of j o h n80 n and
Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
R. Brimley Johnson	PERSON	-LRB- Holt -RRB- , intro - duce a series of a literary form most interesting to literary connoisseurs .

		The letter presented in serial groups , '' each sufficiently large to create an atmos - phere , '' and together illustrative of the style and manners of the age chosen , is a new and welcome departure that promises to succeed , for the field is rich .

		In this century of Queen
Anne	PERSON	and the first
Georges	PERSON	, letter-writing was an art ; and then flour - ished also political parties and party literature .

		Although the tone of literature was lowered by the combative spirit , the fierce contention brought forth the greatest of English satirists and the most orig - inal writer of his age ; it unfolded the genius of the retiring scholar who gave to English literature a perfectly graceful style ; and its varying issues carried , now high , now low , the gay , imprudent , but generous , witty , and lovable adventurer ,
Dick Steele	PERSON	, whose name is always linked with those of Swift and
Addison	PERSON	.

		In this turmoil , political and literary , we see on terms of intimacy the affairs great and small of each character .

		But familiarity does not breed contempt .

		Delightful are
Steele	PERSON	's misspelled letters , '' the most spontaneous unfeigned love-letters in the language . ''

		Addison appears here , as always , the Greek ideal , a just harmony of the virtues , noth - ing in excess , everything in measure , a model in propriety .

		Of the 239 pages of Volume I. , 178 , or three-quarters , are given to Swift ; and , indeed , the purpose of the book is to correct the common mistaken judgment of him derived from the essays of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Taine	PERSON	.

		This is the book 's chief claim to a place on our already crowded shelves .

		The editor has placed the reading public under obligation for a real contribution to its knowl - 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, edge ; he has put into convenient form interesting letters available until now '' only in more or less elaborate and expensive complete editions , or in small anthologies containing at most half a dozen letters by the same writer . ''

		The introductions do not attempt to cover the whole history of the time , and the notes are not chronological tables .

		Very properly , the letters are left to tell their own story , and thus the volumes seem well calculated for lovers of literature who enjoy the selection of letters , and can connote the historical , biographical , and literary setting .

		Memoir * of an The name of
Henl 7 Reeve	PERSON	is not a English gentleman familiar one to the American public , and scholar .

		an -LRB- j one mav question whether it was much more widely known at home .

		This is sug - gested by the words that Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	dedicated to his memory in the ''
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Review , '' over whose destinies Mr.
Reeve	PERSON	had presided for forty years . '

		The career of Mr.
Henry Reeve	PERSON	is per - haps the most striking illustration in our time of how little in English life influence is measured by notoriety .

		To the outer world , his name was but little known .

		He is remembered as the translator of
Tocqueville	LOCATION	, as the editor of the ' Greville Mem - oirs , ' as the author of a not quite forgotten book on Royal and Republican
France	LOCATION	, showing much knowl - edge of French literature and politics ; as the holder during fifty years of the respectable , but not very prominent , post of Registrar of the
Privy Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		To those who have a more intimate knowledge of the political and literary life in
England	LOCATION	, it is well known that during nearly the whole of his long life he was a powerful and living force in English litera - ture ; that few men of his time have filled a larger place in some of the most select circles of English social life ; and that he exercised during many years a political influence such as rarely falls to the lot of any Englishman outside of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, or indeed outside the Cabinet . ''

		But it is not for the interest that we may find in this career , singu - larly long and full as it was , nor for the pleasure and profit of knowing a fine specimen of English gentleman , that the two stately volumes of
Reeve	ORGANIZATION	's '' Memoirs '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- have their sole nor indeed their main value .

		It is rather for the familiar con - tact into which they bring us with many of the great political events and many of the most prominent men of
Europe	LOCATION	during the century just closing .

		One must not look to these volumes for '' revela - tions '' ; but the near glimpses and the direct im - pressions of famous men , both of
England	LOCATION	and the Continent , and the selections from their letters to him , refresh and enlarge our knowledge of them .

		It was not a colorless medium in which they are here reflected .

		He brought to the observation of the men he met very positive opinions of his own prejudices , if you will ; but this contributes to heighten the vividness if not the truthfulness of his pictures as , for instance , in his account of his first meeting with
Victor Hugo	PERSON	and
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
M. A. De Wolfe Howe	PERSON	's volume Some American `` American Bookmen '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	, men of letters .

		i ri \ i ml
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- does not call for the particular comment which would properly be given it were its contents not already widely known .

		The series of articles of which it consists was originally published in '' The Bookman . ''

		This fact probably accounts for what seems to us an unfortunate title : in the ordinary use of the word -LRB- if there be an or - dinary use of a word so uncommon -RRB- a number of the men of letters here spoken of were not bookmen .

		We hesitate to think of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	as a book - man , as Mr.
Howe	PERSON	himself remarks ; and we should add
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	or
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		But a title is often a minor matter : the title in its simplest significance has in this case little connection with the treatment .

		In some other ways the name does give an idea of the book , which is not a history of American liter - ature , nor a series of criticisms of American men of letters , although it contains a good deal that is historical and is written under the guidance of crit - ical estimate .

		It is a series of biographical sketches of the chief figures in our literature , well written and well illustrated .

		A book like this is of a good deal of value just now .

		Not that we have not enough books about American literature .

		There have been published in the last few years half a dozen school histories .

		Nor that this book is -LRB- or pretends to be -RRB- an adequate treatment of the de - velopment of letters in
America	LOCATION	.

		We can afford to wait for such a book until the
end of the first century	DATE	of American letters , which we incline to place in the year
1909	DATE	, the centennial of '' Knick - erbocker 's
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		But while we wait , public interest is aroused and public opinion is stirred by such books as this .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	had here a good opportunity , to which he proved himself quite equal .

		He includes the chief of our men of letters ; he writes a fluent account with rich illustration by por - trait , picture , and facsimile ; he has always some - thing of the critical idea in mind , and yet never really departs from his own plan to present his facts '' primarily as a narrative . ''

		We are not sure that there is any other book which takes just the place for which this is planned : we certainly do not think of any that is better .

		Somefamou , Bibliophiles will find some interest - oid English ing facts handily and compactly got took auction * .

		together in Mr.
John Lawler	PERSON	's '' Book Auctions in
England	LOCATION	in the Seventeenth Century , '' the latest addition to '' The Book-Lover 's Library '' -LRB-
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The subject of book auctions at this period has not heretofore been treated in any de - tailed form , information relating to them , except what may with difficulty be gleaned from the orig - inal catalogues , being meagre and scattered .

		Mr.
Lawler	PERSON	's little book , therefore , fills a want .

		Though book auctions had been common in
Holland	LOCATION	at least since
1604	DATE	, the custom of disposing of libraries sub
Jiasta	PERSON	did not begin in
England	LOCATION	till
1676	DATE	, at which date a sale was held by
William Cooper	PERSON	, a dealer
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 375 dwelling at the sign of the '' Pelican '' in
Little Britain	LOCATION	.

		The example of
Cooper	PERSON	, who probably took his cue from the Elzevirs , soon found imitators , the method at once commending itself to collectors and persons wishing to dispose of their libraries .

		So from
1676	DATE	to
1700	DATE	over a hundred auctions were held , which meant the disposal of some 350,000 works , bringing about 250,000 or a much greater sum if reckoned in the money value of to-day .

		The auctions soon spread to the provinces , and were held even in booths at country fairs .

		Dunton boasted of shipping '' ten tuns '' of books to
Ireland	LOCATION	to be sold under the hammer .

		Those were days of good bargains , too , of what would now be bar - gains undreamed of by the most sanguine collector , in books that now form the summum bonum of his pursuit .

		Fancy getting
Holland	PERSON	's '' HerOologia , '' with the fine portraits by Pass , for seven shillings ;
Edward VI	ORGANIZATION	.

		's '' Prayer Book '' of
1552	DATE	for sixteen shillings ; the
Jenny Geddes	PERSON	'' Prayer Book '' of
1637	DATE	for four shillings ; or a first edition
Bacon	PERSON	's '' Advancement of Learning '' for one shilling !

		One 's mouth waters at many such an item in these old lists .

		Mr.
Law	PERSON	- ler 's book comprises a general Introduction , followed by separate chapters on
William Cooper	PERSON	's sales ,
Edward Millington	PERSON	's sales , those of other auction - eers of the century , the sale of Dr.

		Afamou * j n a pre tty volume entitled '' Story Frenchwoman , , r _ , J , TT ... f at the court or the Jrrmcess des ursms in
Spam of Spain	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- R. jj .

		Russell -RRB- , we have an account of one of those women of two centuries ago , who occupied high social station and made it the means of wielding real political influence .

		In
1701	DATE	, the Princess des Ursins , then fifty-nine years of age , was appointed Camarera-Mayar at the court of the newly-established Bourbon dynasty in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Her previous history and her experience in diplomatic affairs seemed to
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		to fit her for this post , and it was expected by him that her influence would serve to keep the vacillating
Philip V.	PERSON	of
Spain	LOCATION	faithful to French interests in the war of the Span - ish Succession , then just breaking over
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The author of the present work ,
Miss Constance Hill	PERSON	, shows us that in this expectation
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		was disappointed , for from the moment of her ar - rival in
Spain	LOCATION	the Princess threw herself heart and soul into the cause of the Spanish Bourbons a course highly satisfactory to the King of
France	LOCATION	at first , but later distasteful to him when he would have sacrificed the interests of his grandson to the necessities of French policy .

		To her , indeed , more than to any other one person was due the stubborn courage which animated the loyal party in
Spain	LOCATION	, at a time when all seemed lost .

		Her discriminat - ing judgment of men , her careful estimate of the relative importance of events , her good sense in the every-day affairs of life , her skill in diplomacy , and above all her unfailing good nature and cheerful courage , are made plain by the pleasantly written narrative of her labors and by excellent selections from her letters to
Madame de Maintenon	ORGANIZATION	and other personages of note in
France	LOCATION	.

		Even in her fall from power , after the contest with
Austria	LOCATION	was over and the battle won , we sympathize with her and admire her bravery , for in a measure she for - feited her position because she dared to attempt a reformation of that bHe noir of so many Spanish politicians , the Holy Inquisition .

		Possibly her part in the direction of Spanish policy is overestimated in the present volume , but certainly she was an influential woman , and her story is here prettily told .

		The new glory of the American Heroes of the TVT u u i. i i u. s.
Navy	ORGANIZATION	.


Navy	ORGANIZATION	, which is shown on one side by the great increase in number and im - provement in character of the men anxious for naval service since the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, is reflected on another side by such a book as '' From Reefer to Rear - Admiral '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , prepared a few years before his death by the late Rear - Admiral
Benja	PERSON	- min F. Sands ,
U.S.	LOCATION	N .

		The word `` Reefer `` in the title is misleading to a landsman , as indicating a rise from the ranks ; whereas Sands was a duly appointed midshipman from the beginning of his long and successful career .

		It is such a life as his which shows how unbroken is the tradition of our forces afloat .

		Sands , who was in active service for forty-seven years , from
1828	DATE	to
1874	DATE	, including both the Mexican and
Civil Wars	ORGANIZATION	, was the contemporary of
Dewey	LOCATION	,
Sampson	PERSON	, and
Schley	PERSON	, as he was of Far - ragut and
Porter	PERSON	, the former having been a lieu - tenant on the first ship in which Sands saw service , and as the three great admirals of the war with
Spain	LOCATION	were of the two great admirals in the war between the
States	LOCATION	.


David D. Porter	PERSON	was at the gallant taking of Tabasco from the Mexicans , as well as the gallant taking of Fort
Fisher	PERSON	from the South ; and Farragut served with
Porter	PERSON	's father ,
David Porter	PERSON	, Jr. , in the famous cruise of the '' Essex '' in the war of
1812	DATE	; while
David Porter , Jr.	PERSON	, was in the fight of the '' Constellation '' and the '' Insurgente '' in the naval war with
France	LOCATION	, serv - ing under Captain
Thomas Truxton	PERSON	, one of the naval heroes of the Revolutionary War , and later with
Decatur	LOCATION	,
Macdonough	PERSON	,
Barney	ORGANIZATION	, and the rest , off
Tripoli	LOCATION	.


David Porter	PERSON	, Sr. , was also a Revolution - ary hero .

		Sands was a gallant officer , but his more memorable exploits were in the direction of the sci - ences .

		Here he was something of an extremest , inventing a deep-sea sounding apparatus , and being an astronomer at the bead of the
Naval Observa	ORGANIZATION	- tory .

		The book is excellent reading , even if it makes no great addition to our knowledge of history .

		Old-time criticism .

		Ought those who like Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's novels to like his poetry also ?

		And what is to be said of the novels them - selves ?

		And what should we remember of the De Veres ?

		And of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's poems , now half a century old ?

		Anyone who is in a state of sus - pense on these matters , and desires something to 376 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, .

		effect a precipitate , may turn to Mr.
W. M. Dixon	PERSON	's '' In the Republic of Letters '' -LRB- imported by
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- .

		These essays have been already published in magazines ; their author is Professor of English Literature in
Mason College	ORGANIZATION	,
Birmingham	LOCATION	.

		So much will give a hint of what help Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	will give the seeker .

		We have read the essays with interest .

		There are many critical essays published nowadays : in each we try to distinguish some new note .

		Here we distinguish none ; but to make up , we hear at times the clear , beautiful music which is now more like a reminiscence of some golden days of youthful appreciation than an allurement toward anything to come .

		There is no harm in that : we are prone to be too eager for '' new notes '' and '' modern ideas '' ; there is such a thing as a charm , a beauty which is always old as old , say , as New - man , or
Pascal	LOCATION	, or
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, and which is still mod - ern in spite of the Des Goncourts and Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		We would hardly say that Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's work has the charm of those great persuasive writers whom we have just thought of .

		It does , however , have something more like it than we have found in much critical writing that has of late come to our notice , which is in some ways not saying very much , but in others is more than a little .

		The latest of In '' The Physician '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the plays of the latest of the plays of Mr.
Henry H. A. Jones	PERSON	.


Arthur Jones	PERSON	to come to us in book form , we find the same originality of imagination and the same conventional staginess of treatment that have excited and depressed us before .

		It is something fresh and real to take for protagonist a famous specialist in nervous diseases who feels that his own life is poisoned by some strange trouble that his greatest skill can not cure .

		There , it seems to us , the dramatist has a chance for some pretty deep - sea sounding in the human heart .

		But it also seems to us that it is not making the most of so good a chance to set your specialist down for six months ' attendance on a temperance worker who is a victim to alcoholism to the extent of about one spree a month , all unsuspected by his charming fiancee whose tender solicitude it is that calls in the doctor .

		When one has got as far as that , it is not hard to foresee that the drunkard will escape the specialist and die in the gutter , and that the doctor 's cruel nervous disease will be cured by the love of the ex-fiancee .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	has been very successful in pleasing the many who gather in the theatres to see and hear ; it will be interesting to see how far he will please those who stay at home and read books .

		In the early part of the present cen - tury , that eccentric naturalist Con - statine
Samuel Rafinesque	PERSON	published in '' The Western Review and Miscellaneous
Maga	PERSON	- zine '' of
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Ky.	LOCATION	, a series of articles on the fishes of the
Ohio River	LOCATION	.

		These were subsequently issued in book form , under the title '' Ichthyologia A classic of fresh-icaler ichthyology .

		Ohiensis . ''

		This work contains the original descrip - tions of a considerable number of the fresh-water fishes of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	river system ; for the author had the evil fortune at least so far as his suc - cesses are concerned to stumble upon and to name many of the most common species of this great river and its tributaries .

		Indeed , he often wove a scien - tific description from an idle fisherman 's tale , with - out ever seeing the mythical fish .

		Execrable as much of
Rafinesque	ORGANIZATION	's work was , his ''
Ichthyologia Ohiensis	PERSON	'' has become the foundation of fresh-water ichthyology in
America	LOCATION	.

		For many years his de - scriptions were often ignored , but the stricter appli - cation of rules of nomenclature in these later years has made his work the starting-point for all who would deal comprehensively with the subject .

		Dr.
R. E. Call	PERSON	has done the science a service by his carefully edited reprint -LRB-
Burrows Brothers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of this ichthyological classic .

		The book contains a portrait , several facsimiles , a complete bibliography of Ra - finesque 's ichthyological publications , and a brief sketch of this versatile but unfortunate naturalist .

		The volume is handsomely gotten up , and will be a welcome addition to the library of every student of our fresh-water fishes .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Heretofore , our own country has been represented in '' The Statesman 's Year Book '' by a modest outline account of its form of government and existing admin - istration , inserted somewhere between

		With the
1899	DATE	issue -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- this is all changed , and the
United States	LOCATION	now glories in an extensive chapter , set in the forefront of the volume , filling nearly three hundred pages , and made authoritatiye by the name of Mr.
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	.

		The other features of the work remain practically as in earlier editions .

		Messrs.

		404 BOYS AND GIRLS AND BOOKS .

		The curse -LRB- we use the word deliberately -RRB- which at present rests upon the teaching of English literature in our elementary and sec - ondary schools is the imposition upon young people of a priori programmes .

		We try to inculcate a love of literature by making boys and girls read books that they do not like , sim - ply because in our Olympian opinion , and from our superior point of view , they ought to like them .

		The result is the natural one that a large proportion of our grammar and high - school children learn to hate the very name of literature , and by our injudicious treatment are cut off -LRB- many of them for good -RRB- from one of the chief joys of life .

		And yet nearly all of them have their literary interests , have some - where in their mental make-up the germs of good taste .

		Any intelligent teacher , free to deal with the problem presented by a particu - lar individual or even a particular class of stu - dents , can get at these interests and develope these germs .

		But this necessary freedom in diagnosis and treatment is denied to most teach - ers by the stupidity of the authorities placed over them , and they are condemned to the hope - less task of working within the rigid limits of prescribed texts and courses .

		The colleges , for example , announce that they will examine can - didates in certain texts , and the consequence of this announcement is that thousands of hap - less young students -LRB- to take two peculiarly flagrant cases of recent years -RRB- are set to study - ing
Defoe	PERSON	's '' History of the Plague '' and
Burke	PERSON	's speech on '' Conciliation . ''

		Small won - der if , under these circumstances , the study of literature itself becomes a plague , because ab - solutely devoid of the sort of conciliation that is really needed .

		And if undue deference is not paid to the requirements of the colleges , there is never any lack of doctrinaires among superintendents and committeemen to devise programmes that are equally well calculated to destroy the nascent liking for literature that is the normal possession of healthy young minds .

		This way of dealing with the most sacred interests of children is educational quackery and nothing else , whether it proceed from auto - cratic individuals or from bodies of educators in solemn conclave .

		It is the proprietary - 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, medicine principle applied to the treatment of the mind .

		The fatuousness of prescribing cer - tain texts to be studied by children in certain stages of their education is so amazing that words are inadequate to deal with it .

		That one man 's meat is another man 's poison is a statement as true in psychology as it is in phys - iology .

		Imagine a body of representative phys - icians meeting for the purpose of preparing a course of drugs to be administered uniformly to young people of certain ages .

		At fifteen , let us say , they should take calomel for so many months , quinine for so many others , and thus throughout the whole period of development .

		The illustration is grotesque , no doubt , yet it offers a fair parallel to the methods of many educators when dealing with this delicate ques - tion of literary instruction .

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	once described himself as '' a violent Tory , '' and the contemplation of such methods as these should be enough to make '' a violent Individualist '' of everyone having a proper appreciation of the aims to be kept in view by the teacher of literature . ''

		Chaos is come again '' would doubtless be the cry of the partisans of routine should their precious schemes be roughly set aside in the interests of the individual student .

		But in pedagogy , at least , there is one thing worse than chaos , and that thing is the sort of regimentation toward which so much of our modern education tends .

		We are impelled to these observations by the recent publication of a small book called '' An Introduction to the Study of Literature , '' compiled by Dr.
Edwin Herbert Lewis	PERSON	.

		It is a book of detached pieces , about one hundred and fifty in all , and , as we look it over , our first impression is that it offers one more incen - tive to that '' reading by sample '' against which Mr.
Pancoast	PERSON	protests so effectively in the last number of '' The Educational Review . ''

		A further examination , disclosing such juxta - positions as
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	and Mrs.
Charlotte Perkins Stetson	PERSON	,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	and Mr.
William Canton	PERSON	, Shakespeare on '' the fop '' and Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	on '' the gentle - man , '' gives the impression that we are plung - ing into a sort of literary grab-bag , and curi - osity as to what will come out next becomes the predominant element in the consciousness .

		But our thoughts take a more serious turn when we seek in the preface of the book to discover the principle upon which it has been put together .

		It then appears in its true light as an attempt -LRB- the first of its sort that has come to our knowledge -RRB- to place before young peo - ple the kind of literature that they really like instead of the kind that their elders think they ought to like .

		The book is based upon actual experiment rather than upon a priori reasoning ; each selection is the result of an induction from many observations rather than of a deduction from any pedantic principle .

		But in this mat - ter Dr.
Lewis	PERSON	must speak for himself .

		First of all , he tells us that the appeal of literature should be made to the '' highest nor - mal interests '' of the student .

		Then , '' it must be ascertained by what stages the imagination , the emotions , and the character develope .

		The - oretically , there is a masterpiece for every month of the student 's life .

		The surest way of learning where the masterpieces fit is to allow the student to ' browse ' in a library . ''

		The following passage describes the method which has resulted in the volume now under consid - eration . ''

		Various classes in the
Lewis Institute	ORGANIZATION	have been en - couraged to ' browse , ' to see if they might not hit upon a body of literature that would remain a constant inter - est to their equals in age .

		However imperfect and incomplete these investigations , the sifting process , upon which the students entered actively and honestly , has been of the greatest value to all concerned .

		It has shown that noticeable differences of interest exist be - tween ninth and tenth , tenth and eleventh grades .

		In the nature-sense , for instance , as it appears in the youth not hopelessly hardened by ' business ' aims , there are usually marked changes between thirteen and sixteen .

		The change is first from the child 's scientific curiosity about nature to a half-poetic , but objective , interest in her ; the boy becomes capable of direct , unreflecting joy in nature , or even of direct displeasure with her , in something of the Homeric manner ; then he slowly grows to sympathize with the modern view , so much more imaginative and sometimes so much less wholesome than Homer 's . ''

		That the method thus outlined is the only rational one for the teaching of literature to young students seems to us beyond question .

		It makes the work attractive rather than forbid - ding .

		It coaxes the recalcitrant tastes and emotions instead of domineering over them .

		It prepares the way for that systematic study of literary history and aesthetics that has its un - disputed place in the later stages of education , but is entirely out of place in the earlier years .

		We should not be taken to mean that Dr.
Lewis	PERSON	has prepared a book that may properly be administered to any class of young people of the age with which he has dealt .

		That would be denying the fundamental principle of our philosophy .

		But he undoubtedly has prepared the best sort of book for his own particular set of young people , and a book , furthermore , which points to other teachers the way in which
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 389 they should get at the interests of their own students .

		Nor must it be imagined that hia method runs to '' chatter , '' or that it neglects the disciplinary aspect of instruction .

		He says at the outset that '' there is need of Spartan severity regarding chirography , orthography , punctuation , syntax , and logic .

		The task of securing correctness by Spartan methods , and , at the same time , of arousing an unconstrained love for noble literature , is the almost hopeless labor set for the English teacher .


Gradgrind	PERSON	and enemy of
Gradgrind	PERSON	he must be within the same hour .

		But there is no escaping the double duty , and no denying that the second part of it is the more important . ''

		Note the emphasis of this latter clause , and note also the word '' uncon - strained , '' which must be the keynote of suc - cessful endeavor .

		It is because constraint is applied at the wrong points that our schools make so miserable a failure of that part of their work which should exemplify the most shining success .

		And this misapplied constraint , be it observed , rarely comes from the initiative of the intelligent teacher ; it rather originates in the councils of those set above him in author - ity , and is transmitted by him , unwillingly enough , to the hapless victims of the system with which both teachers and students are burdened .

		SPIRIT OF SONG .

		O where , O where , Into the blue engirdling vasts of air , As fair and evanescent as the dawn , blithe and winged spirit , art thou gone , And why so far withdrawn ?

		Of yore , of yore , When sea and shore Were glad with
summer	DATE	or with winter frore , 1 knew thy radiant presence eve and morn ; Now am I lone and lorn !

		From day to day I wait thy coming in the old sweet way , Thy zephyr-soft surprisings grave or gay ; Thy tremulous minors and thy majors bold ; Thy melodies manifold !

		Return , return , O thou for whom I yearn !

		Gladden my heart , as doth the stir of
spring	DATE	The earth , with vernal hopes on fairy wing , All clearly cadencing !

		So .

		shall I know Once more the ecstacy , the thrill , the glow , That lifts above the whelm and surge of strife Wherewith the rondure of our days is rife , So shall I touch the haloed heights of life !

		MR. KIPLING 'S `` CYNICAL JINGOISM '' TOWARD THE BROWN MAN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read with rather special interest the pages of your issue of
May 16	DATE	, in which Mr.
Henry Austin	PERSON	-LRB- im - pelled by '' the hardihood of intense conviction , coupled with a stern sense of duty '' -RRB- reproves a public given over to a '' hysteria of unreasoned admiration , '' to a '' toy tempest of flatulent adulation , '' of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	.

		It is quite unnecessary for any admirer of Mr.
Kip	PERSON	- ling 's work to attempt any reply to assertions that the '' Recessional '' is inferior in technique and style to the work of `` a dozen other English poets , '' particularly Mr.
Rennell Rodd	PERSON	; or that '' most of his verses '' are '' on the same plane with the work of many minor En - glish and American poets . ''

		With all due respect to Mr.
Austin	PERSON	, such statements , even when they appear in THE DIAL , violate all laws of physics by having no ac - tion except a reaction .

		But when a journal like yours gives place to a char - acterization such as the following , I feel as if the most obscure reader had a right to protest .

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	, after quoting Dr. .


Felix Adler	PERSON	's denunciation of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's '' teaching as a gospel of force , '' goes on : `` It is not , however , with
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's jingoism and frank cynicism toward inferior races , as the
Apostle of Force	ORGANIZATION	, of Might against Right , that literature is concerned , except inas - much as these essentially pagan and very antiquated senti - ments might be shown to affect his art . ''

		Now , it is the penalty of candor to subject itself to misunderstanding as well as wilful misrepresentation ; yet it is difficult to conceive how a man of Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's intelligence can make a declaration of so peculiarly inaccurate and unjust a nature as the above , except on the supposition that he has not read a large majority of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's writings .

		Here is an author who writes of things as they are not as they might be ; of men who do the world s work , dirty work , hard work , unpoetic work much of it , not of those who delude themselves and others into believing that matters are as they would like to have them .

		He is perhaps more entirely sincere , more thoroughly free from hypocritic cant or shadow of self-deception than any writer now prominently before the public : it is very natural that such frank disregard of their little air-structures should offend the sentimentalists ; but it is almost incredible that any fair-minded person could speak of his '' cyni - cism toward inferior races '' after even the most super - ficial examination of his stories and poems that deal with the natives of
India	LOCATION	and the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		Is this quality to be found in '' The Masque of Plenty '' -LRB- '' De - partmental Ditties '' -RRB- written , too , when his work showed a far greater preponderance of head over heart than was later visible ?

		Or perhaps in '' The Song of the Women '' ?

		or '' What the People Said '' ?

		Does Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's '' intense conviction '' result from a con - templation of `` The Ballad of East and West '' or '' Guuga Din , '' or , in prose , of '' The Story of Muham - mad Din , '' '' Without Benefit of Clergy , '' '' The Judg - ment of Dungara , '' `` At Howli Thana , '' `` Gemini , '' `` The Sending of
Dana Da	PERSON	, '' `` On the City Wall , '' or any other of dozens of poems and stories which are to be found in Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's books ?

		What a miserably unfair thing is it , because an author 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, tells more intimately and openly than ever before of ''
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	'' whose chief business is policing and fighting black and brown men to cry out upon him as the '' Apostle of Might against Right '' !

		Ignor - ing all the innumerable ways in which he has shown an understanding of the native , and a real manly , brotherly feeling for him , such as our literature does not equal elsewhere !

		The truth is that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has been the first man who has ever introduced the Anglo-Saxon to the real native of
India	LOCATION	a fellow-man , with hopes and fears , and pride and resentment , and hopeless resigna - tion .

		His best claim to attention is his infinite sympa - thy with all things animate and inanimate : this is the very warp and woof of his whole literary fabric .

		He has well earned the right to inscribe in his books as he has done in the beginning of his new '' From Sea to Sea '' : `` Write me as one that loved his fellow-men . ''

WYSHAM LANIER	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	,
June 3 , 1899	DATE	.

		FREE DISCUSSION OF THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In reading your timely and pertinent editorial on '' The Menace to Free Discussion , '' in your issue of
May 16	DATE	, one smiles at the thought that Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	's little pamphlet should demoralize our soldiers at
Manila	LOCATION	.

		These soldiers can tell far more those who have re - turned have told me far more than Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	ever dreamed of , of the horrors of war and disease .

		No doubt THE DIAL is right in believing that the impulse to emulate British colonial methods is '' noth - ing more than a severe fever that will run its course and pass away . ''

		The heart of the patient is sound , and the reaction will come sooner or later .

		But one neces - sity of convalescence is that the patient be very careful to guard his ways .

		The sequelae of this illness promise to be appalling .

		Most of us have admitted , in loose fashion , that we were likely in a new enterprise to make blunders ; but few anticipated such colossal and fatal mistakes as we have been led into , without our consent , within the last few months .

		No one dreamed , for example , -LRB- 1 -RRB- that we should break our pledge not to seek extension of territory by force of arms ; or -LRB- 2 -RRB- that we should repudiate without explanation our promises to our allies in
Luzon	LOCATION	, what - ever these pledges were .

		We have -LRB- 3 -RRB- failed to con - ciliate these people , once our allies , or even to appear to try to conciliate them .

		We have -LRB- 4 -RRB- refused for mouths to give them any answer to their questions as to our plans .

		We have -LRB- 5 -RRB- rejected or insulted their en - voys .

		If the determination of policy rests with Con - gress , we have failed to tell them so , or -LRB- 6 -RRB- to arrange for a peaceful modus vivendi until
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should meet .

		We failed -LRB- 7 -RRB- to take advantage of the hopeful begin - ning of civil government at Malolos .

		We have -LRB- 8 -RRB- played fast and loose with ourselves , talking in one breath of duties to civilization , in another of impe - rial conquest ; in one breath of free constitutional rule in the islands , in another of industrial slavery and the demands of commerce .

		We have -LRB- 9 -RRB- adopted no pol - icy of our own , in the hope , apparently , that chance called '' manifest destiny '' may give us what justice must refuse .

		We began war -LRB- 10 -RRB- on
February 5	DATE	, the general in charge using as an excuse a drunken escapade of natives for which their leaders were not responsible .

		We -LRB- 11 -RRB- refused their explanations , and their request for a neutral zone and a truce .

		We -LRB- 12 -RRB- have held our army in such relations that friction with the natives was inevitable .

		We have -LRB- 13 -RRB- rejected all later offers of peace except on the outrageous terms of '' uncon - ditional surrender . ''

		We have -LRB- 14 -RRB- treated these peo - ple on their own soil as '' rebels , '' in defiance of fact , of justice , and apparently in defiance of our own Con - stitution and of the recognized law of nations .

		We have -LRB- 15 -RRB- permitted a declaration of war to be virtu - ally made by a general who at the best is regardless of statesmanship , and who is reported rarely to leave his office '' where he devotes himself faithfully to the duties of a quartermaster 's clerk . ''

		The operations of this most undemocratic war have been in part conducted -LRB- 16 -RRB- with the same waste and cruelty that roused us all to indignation in
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		The towns we occupy have been burned and looted ; and the natives , rich and poor , ed - ucated and barbarous alike , have been alike shot or driven to the swamps .

		I suppose that successful war - fare in tropical islands can be waged in no other way .

		Guerrilla warfare means devastation .

		Why not end the horror at once ?

		We have nothing to gain by victory , nor our opponents anything to lose save their lives by defeat .

		Meanwhile , the most gigantic blunder -LRB- 17 -RRB- known to man or nation is to refuse to retrace false steps .

		As matters are , we can only wait till the curtain falls .

		If in trying to do what seems wrong we have blundered so awkwardly , what would be the result of an attempt on the part of the powers that be to do what is right ?

		In hands unskilful or unclean any policy is doomed to failure .

		The American people can only watch the play till it is played out , and maybe heed its lessons for the future .

		Meanwhile , the problem of what to do with
Cuba	LOCATION	and
the Philippines	LOCATION	is tenfold more difficult than it was a year ago .

		ATJBKEY BEARDSL.EY IN PERSPECTIVE .

		* It was while watching the progress of a friendship between two exceedingly unattract - ive boys an attraction between two repellants that I arrived at a sense of the possible charm of unlovely things .

		The connection of Beauty and the
Beast	LOCATION	is pathetic in some minds for Beauty , in others for the Beast ; but in the companionship of
Beast and Beast	LOCATION	, in - stead of a double pathos one finds a double beauty .

		This is a surprise that the hideous often contains for those who are apt to consider the non-existence of a quality proved by their inability to perceive it .

		Adroitly evaded as companions by their brighter eyed and more ready tongued kind , these two youths had dis - covered in each other of necessity piercing below externals that charm inherent in all humanity , the perception of which is love .

		The occasional wonder , to which we are all subject , as to whatever he saw in her or she in him , and why they married , is after all only a proof of our inferior and their superior sympathy or perception in that especial case , of course .

		So , in view of the first repulsive impression of the bulk of
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	's work , and the strongly expressed sympathy of such trained perceptions as Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	and Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, it becomes somewhat of a duty to endeavor to understand what they saw in him , rather than to insist on what most of us do n't see .

		Of the three books dealing with
Beardsley	PERSON	recently published , the smallest is a reprint of Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	's essay which originally appeared in '' The Fortnightly Review . ''

		The next in size is a collection of fifty drawings , published without comment ; and the last and largest is the sumptuous volume published by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	with a preface by Mr.
H. C. Marillier	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Marillier	PERSON	avails himself of Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's essay to a degree which would seem to make that essay the authoritative statement , backed up as its spirit is , in my mind , by Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's generous-spirited letter to the '' Lon - don Daily Chronicle '' soon after
Beardsley	PERSON	's death .

New York	LOCATION	:
M. F. Mansfield	PERSON	and
A. Wessels	PERSON	.

		Beardsley 's work in its relation to the absolute , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's critique is somewhat of a disap - pointment , as it deals mainly with
Beardsley	PERSON	's work in its relation to
Beardsley	LOCATION	.

		Acknowl - edging the impossibility of entirely eliminating the personal equation , the real interest of the present moment would , however , seem to be rather the value of
Beardsley	PERSON	's work in relation to ourselves and to our existence .

		Letting this unknown quantity be represented for the mo - ment by a : , we have , in considering these draw - ings , to remember three things : that they are the work of a young man who died at the age of twenty-six , that they are largely of that char - acter we have agreed to describe as Pagan , and that , given a few more years of life , the young man would probably have gone alto - gether to the good .

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	indicates the beginning of this last process in referring to
Beardsley	PERSON	's last drawings , in which , he says , ``
Beardsley	PERSON	has accepted the convention of nature itself , turning it to his own uses , extracting from it his own symbols , but no longer rejecting it for a convention entirely of his own making .

		And thus in his last work we find new possibilities for an art which , after many hesitations , has resolved finally upon the great compro - mise , that compromise which the greatest have made between the mind 's outline and the outline of visible things . ''

		That is very good , both for
Beardsley	PERSON	and for Mr.
Symons	PERSON	, who has put an important prin - ciple very featly and instilled a very definite regret that
Beardsley	PERSON	died before these possi - ble futurities were consummated .

		The state - ment enables us to transfer to x the third fac - tor , that of
Beardsley	PERSON	's probable volte-face , so that x = value of
Beardsley	PERSON	's work to us and our existence = our regret at early death before it had any .

		This leaves the two factors of Beards - ley 's youth and his paganism ; and looking over the drawings , one realizes that he was indeed young bitterly young .

		An assumption of knowledge of good and evil especially evil seems inseparably connected with the inexpe - rience of youth ; but this phase , evident as it is in
Beardsley	LOCATION	, is slight compared with another the impressionable quality with which he receives and records in rapid succession the many and varied influences of masters past and present .

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	, in discussing
Beardsley	PERSON	's work , assists us to an understanding of it with epi - grams like this : '' At one time of his life , a man works in order to please a woman ; then he works because he has not pleased the woman ; then because he is tired of pleasing her , '' which is good as an epigram , but hardly uni - 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, versal .

		We also find phrases such as `` the spectacular vices , '' '' sin transfigured by beauty and then disclosed by beauty , '' and he later tells us that '' a profound spiritual corruption is a form of divine possession by which the inactive and material soul is set in fiery motion , lured from the ground into at least a certain high liberty .

		And so we find evil justified of itself , and an art consecrated to the revelation of evil equally justified . ''

		These illuminating sentences are powdered with descriptions of '' bloated harlequins , '' '' bald and plumed Pier - rots , '' '' leering dwarfs , '' '' immense bodies swollen with the lees of pleasure , '' `` cloaked and masked desires smiling ambiguously at interminable toilets . ''

		Anyone reading this essay before seeing the drawings would be justi - fied in inferring that the dead artist did not draw very nice things ; but somehow the gen - eral impression is that the essay and the draw - ings are concerned with something too artificial to be really evil .

		One might even argue from Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's pleasure in his own descriptions that he himself is somewhat youthful ; for '' lees of pleasure '' and '' masked desires smiling ambiguously '' are excellent terms , but terms derived rather from a good literary instinct than from any cryptic experience of the kind so darkly hinted at .

		And then , looking at the drawings and seeing the very evident and marked reflection of Burne-Jones ,
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Velasquez	PERSON	, various Japanese artists ,
Diirer	PERSON	,
Flaxman	PERSON	, and others , one is convinced that the character , plastic enough to receive so rapidly so many impressions , is youthful enough to be its own excuse for many errors of judgment .

		So it happens that when Mr.
Symons	PERSON	says
Beardsley	PERSON	expresses evil with an intensity which lifts it into a region almost of asceticism , there arises a mild impression that he is talking about a knowledge and an experience of evil which
Beardsley	PERSON	could not and naturally did not ex - press .

		The general impression given by most of the subjects of the drawings is truly one of much vulgarity ; but to imply that the strange creatures therein represented are evil , or even unconventional , would be distressingly anthro - pomorphic .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, in his very exciting story '' The War of the Worlds , '' has invented a race of Martians who can not possibly be judged by our code of sexual morality , because they are bi-sexual , and reproduce by a budding - off process .

		Du
Maurier	PERSON	did the same thing ; so have others ; and it would be uncritical , be - cause the nice people I know usually take wraps to the theatre , to condemn the race invented by
Beardsley	PERSON	who conspicuously do n't .

		They are evidently the product of different condi - tions , and different systems of ventilation , and can not be judged by the standards by which we judge .

		As Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's people , from our point of view , are neither moral , immoral , nor supra-moral , but are rather non-moral , so
Beardsley	PERSON	's people at the theatre or other - wheres can only be described in the same way .

		They are a strange race to whom may well be applied the artist 's comment on himself : '' Par les dieux jumeaux tous les monstres ne sout pas en Afrique '' ; their ethical standard is un - known , and , frankly , they inspire one with no desire for further love or knowledge of them .

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	and Mr.
Marillier	PERSON	apparently think them profoundly evil .

		I may miss the point ; but then I have my consolations , and both gentlemen must know that we have seen the swollen bodies and lees of pleasure before , in Japanese work , rendered with a much greater skill than
Beardsley	PERSON	's ; and of them we have always said that , judged by occidental stand - ards , they were rather low .

		The terrible annunciation of evil , which is insisted on so strongly , will , I think , when investigated , simmer down to an unpleasant vulgarity .

		Most terrible annunciations and denunciations do , and the dwarfs and monkeys and swollen bodies , and so forth , can not mean - while obtain admission to the Palace of Art , on Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's pretense that they are sym - bols .

		A symbol is something substituted by general consent for something else , and we are by no means agreed on these .

		The justification of this vulgarity in the minds of most , includ - ing Mr.
Symons	PERSON	, is that '' perfection of line is virtue . '' ''

		That line which rounds the deformity of the cloven - footed sin , the line itself , is at once the revelation and the condemnation of vice , for it is part of that artistic logic which is morality .

		And , after all , the secret of
Beardsley	PERSON	is there , in the line itself rather than in any - thing intellectually realized which the line is intended to express . ''

		Supposing the end it is wished to realize is a very ill-defined one , such as a terrible annun - ciation of evil is likely to be , it is of course pleasant to find that the medium per se is charming .

		Still , to be insulted wittily , to be drugged sweetly , to be smothered with roses , are states achieved by means which may be consolations but are by no means compensations .

		That struggle with his material which is the despair of every artist may well account for Mr. PennelPs admiration of one who seemed to dominate his so easily , but it is hardly a
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 393 factor that can be transferred to x. Drawings of the sort that
Beardsley	PERSON	did with such power over line and mass and decoration , always seem to me to be accurately described by reference to one of
Poe	PERSON	's stories , '' The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar . ''

		M. Valdemar is mesmer - ized in articulo mortis .

		This arrested the nat - ural post-mortem process , and retained the body in statu quo ante mortem for some months until the experiment of awakening him was made .

		As soon as the mesmeric influence was withdrawn ,
M. Valdemar	PERSON	became what seven months ' death makes of us all .

		It is not a pleasant story , and those interested in details are referred to the original ; but , taking Beards - ley 's power over mass and line as the parallel to the mesmeric force of the story , it seems as though in the majority of his drawings it were used in the same way to arrest the natural decomposition of a mass of matter which can only be maintained in a horrid semblance of life , has no virtue in it , and were better entirely dead .

		It is not a pleasant use of power -LRB- ref - erence is again made to
Poe	PERSON	's story for details -RRB- , but , however used , it is power ; and it is un - doubtedly in this very ability to delineate , to compose , to balance mass and void , to sustain a harmonious relation of line to line , of whole to unit , in this sensitiveness to organic rela - tionship , we begin to get a hint of that charm , that fineness , which Beauty discovered in the Beast , and Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	in
Beardsley	LOCATION	's draw - ings .

		By any trained or sympathetic percep - tion , this inherent charm is doubtless at once divined ; but it must not be forgotten how large a part loneliness must have played in quickening the perceptions of Beauty ; the loneliness of a worker struggling with his material in the vast - ness of any art is a parallel situation , but one impossible to the multitude of us .

		With all due credit , then , to Beauty and to Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	for their generous perception , it is yet somewhat of a relief to consider how much emotional effort was economized , and how many apologies Beauty was saved by the translation of the
Beast	LOCATION	into a handsome Prince that transformation which Mr.
Symons	PERSON	mentions as occurring in
Beardsley	LOCATION	's last drawings , the possibility of which is evident in all .

		Beauty was probably as glad to be relieved from the strain of reminding herself that though hid - eous her husband had a beautiful disposition , as Mr.
Symons	PERSON	must be at not having to sustain his paradox of an abstract spiritual corruption revealed in beautiful form .

		In the same way , most of us prefer the line of least resistance ; and we shall undoubtedly evade those drawings in which the subject is nasty but the drawing skilful , in favor of those in which the Prince 's sense of life is conveyed in a fine smile rather than a sneer .

		This qual - ity we find in such drawings as the '' Chopin Nocturne '' and '' Ballade , '' the two Venus de - signs , '' Les Revenants de la Musique , '' the outline portrait of Re jane , and most of the cover and catalogue designs .

		Herein we have the Prince -LRB- the fairy-tale Prince perhaps , somewhat light and glancing -RRB- ; Mr.
Pen	PERSON	- nell is justified , and x ceases to be a merely minus quantity .

		For herein is the subject that attracts and induces us to linger until the innate quality penetrates also .

		Here we have no poor dead
M. Valdemar	ORGANIZATION	maintained in an unconvincing semblance of life by a misuse of power , but life itself in a most delicate and evanescent aspect caught and depicted in a way that makes it a force in quickening the feeling for the delicate and fanciful in others .

		There never yet was anything but regret at the death of anyone who gave promise of ministering with power to the needs of the human character ; and in that promise , and some slight beginnings of fulfilment , lies the value of
Beardsley	LOCATION	to us : not the thing he did for the most part , nor the thing he started others doing , but the work he gave promise of doing .

		That promise , scat - tered through his executed work , excites a regret , a deep and tender regret , he nearly missed , but which is nearer to fame than the notoriety he desired and achieved .

		With regard to the books as books , it must be added that the Unicorn quarto came to pieces at the first possible opportunity , and Mr.
Marillier	PERSON	's prefatory note in the large edition is , for a prefatory note bearing the address of
Kelmscott House	ORGANIZATION	, vilely printed , ranging from a smudgy black to a very pale gray .

		The ''
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- ond Book of Fifty Drawings '' is of course mainly interesting to those who have the '' First Book , '' since it is a sort of addendum containing many drawings whose only interest is that they were done by
A. V. B. G. M. R. TWOSE	PERSON	.

		THE '' Cumulative Index to a Selected List of Peri - odicals , '' edited by the staff of the
Cleveland Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and published by the
Helman-Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has just appeared in its third annual volume , betokening a success that is richly deserved , and promising a perma - nent existence to what must have been at the outset a very doubtful venture .

		There are nearly eight hundred pages in this volume , making it much the thickest of the three thus far produced .

June 16	DATE	, OUR NEW ISLAND POSSESSIONS .

		* Our national events of the past year have opened a new door to old writers and developed a host of new ones .

		Book-stalls are already groaning under the burden of books descriptive either of the events of the year or of the lands touched by these events .

		The new and fresh works on these islands are a welcome addition to our geographical and ethnographical litera - ture .

		Doubtless many who considered them - selves well-read in matters of general interest could have told little about them a year ago .

		The
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	especially were to the most of us an unknown land .

		One of the freshest and best of the accounts of this great archi - pelago , now the point of chief interest in our military affairs , is that written by Mr.
Ramon Lala	PERSON	, a native Manilan , educated in
England	LOCATION	and in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and now a naturalized American citizen .

		He is thoroughly conver - sant with his native land , its peoples , its former and present oppressors , its struggles for liberty , its customs , its resources and commercial im - portance .

		He writes as a man who has gathered his information at first-hand , and is enthusiastic in the telling of it .

		He sketches fluently the early history of the islands , the British , Dutch , and Chinese struggles on its shores , and the final Spanish colonial system of -LRB- mis -RRB- govern - ment .

		The poor Filipinos have been beaten , lashed , robbed , and almost crushed out of ex - istence by long centuries of corrupt and vicious methods of control .

		But we can not properly speak of the Filipinos as a nation : they are no nation .

		They consist of about eighty different tribes distributed among the hundreds of islands of the archipelago .

		They vary in the scale of civilization all the way from the educated Ma - nilan or
Tagalog	LOCATION	to the wild men of central
Mindoro	LOCATION	or
Mindanao	LOCATION	, who recognize no supe - rior authority , and know as little about the refinements of civilization .

		All of the islands are mountain - ous , and of volcanic formation .

Mindanao	LOCATION	, and
Luzon	LOCATION	, rise more than eight thousand feet above the sea .

		The flora of the islands is beautiful beyond description . ''

		One that has never seen it can form no idea of the splendor of such a tropical forest teeming with all that is brilliant and grand in nature .

		It would seem as if the Creator had emptied the cornucopia of his gifts over this garden-spot of the world , making it a veritable Eden . ''

		This prodigious growth is forced by the hu - midity of the atmosphere , and by the enormous annual rainfall averaging ninety inches .

		This botanist 's paradise is not surpassed any - where on the globe , either for the variety of its species or for the stupendous growths seen on every hand .

		Mr.
Lala	PERSON	describes the principal agricultural industries of the islands , such as that of raising rice , hemp , tobacco , coffee , fruits , etc. .

		The mineral wealth is supposed to be great , and its future a boon to the islanders .

		The volume closes with the American occupa - tion of
Manila	LOCATION	and the long wait for the con - clusions of the peace commission .

		Mr.
Lala	PERSON	has done an excellent service for his native land , and , so far as we may judge from the scope of our reading , has done it in a fairly impartial manner , though leaving a more favorable impression of the Filipinos than found in other writers .

		The book is well written , very read - able and instructive , and profusely illustrated .

		For an all-around view of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, it is surpassed in modern works only by that of Mr.
Foreman	PERSON	.

		Major
Younghusband	PERSON	's work entitled ''
The Philippines	LOCATION	and Round About '' is a free-and - easy description of the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	,
Aguinaldo	ORGANIZATION	,
Iloilo	LOCATION	,

Dewey	PERSON	, the American soldier , the career of

		The value of his work lies in the fact that it gives the impressions of a widely-travelled , wide - awake , and straightforward Englishman .

		The '' inside '' information furnished on the events of the last three years in
the Philippines	LOCATION	is enough to arouse the ire of the most phleg - matic temperament .

		The Spanish methods of buying off Aguinaldo , of robbing merchants to pay fees and fill their own pockets , of wresting exorbitant fines , of bloody , almost indiscrimi - nate , slaughter of suspects , furnish us examples

		THE DIAL 395 of the species of political and civil training that the Filipinos received at the hands of Spaniards .

		The author visited Aguinaldo at his own head - quarters and paints in vivid colors what he saw . ''

		Aguinaldo is a young man of only twenty-nine years of age , stands about five feet four inches in height , is slightly built , and dressed in a coat and trousers of drab tussore silk .

		He is a pure Philippine native , though showing a slight trace of Chinese origin , of dark com - plexion and much pock-marked .

		His face is square and determined , the lower lip protruding markedly .

		On the whole a man of pleasant demeanor , even-tempered , and with strong characteristics .

		Slow of speech , and per - haps also of thought , his past career has hall-marked him as a man of prompt decision and prompter action .

		... A short time ago it appears that another of the insurgent leaders began to secure a following which bade fair to shake the supremacy of Aguinaldo .

		The Presi - dent stayed to take no half measures , attempted no parleying ; he grasped the nettle firmly , and ordering his reputed rival out into the courtyard , had him shot on the spot .

		... In conversation Aguinaldo professed his complete ignorance of the terms on which the En - glish exercise jurisdiction over the protected states of the
Malay Peninsula	LOCATION	, and of how a dependency like
India	LOCATION	is governed , and capped his ignorance of the out - side world by asking whether
Australia	LOCATION	was an island , and whether it belonged to
America	LOCATION	... therefore it was no surprise to be asked whether the Americans or the English won the battle -LSB- of Omdurman -RSB- .

		In spite of the strict embargo placed on the importation of arms ,
Aguinaldo	PERSON	said that he was then expecting a large con - signment of Mauser rifles and ammunition from a Ger - man firm . ''

		The author attributes to Aguinaldo great credit for the manner in which he maintains his hold upon his people , and the determination which he exhibits to fight for complete independence .

		His criticisms of the American army are free and outspoken : '' The army and navy of
America	LOCATION	and t ` heir welfare are not in the hands of well-tried sages of the military and naval services , but are like many other vital mat - ters the shuttlecocks of political parties ... With - out for a moment wishing to criticize too severely a force thus thrown together , under officers without stand - ing , experience , or training , and remembering well what excellent troops men of the same nation were trans - formed into in the course of a prolonged campaign by leaders like
Washington	LOCATION	,
Lee	PERSON	, or Grant , yet it would be only inviting the Americans to court future disaster if an outside critic were to refrain from expressing an opinion that such troops are not fit , under the rapid conditions of modern warfare , to meet an army highly organized and highly trained , and ready to take the initiative at a moment 's notice ... We should be doing the Amer - icans an unkindness if we allowed it to be thought that such tardy mobilization -LSB- as that shown at the beginning of the campaign in
the Philippines	LOCATION	-RSB- would not put them under the severest disadvantages if their antagonists happened to be any one of the first-class Powers of the world . ''

		The author describes an arrangement with the Spaniards during the last days of the siege of
Manila	LOCATION	, '' Whereby the town was to be saved from bombard - ment , and the Americans , after the brief show of resist - ance which would satisfy Spanish honour , were to be allowed to enter and occupy the place ... The Amer - ican fleet was for the space of an hour or so to shell the
Polverina	LOCATION	or Powder Magazine .

		... At the end of the given period the fleet was to cease firing , and the Span - ish Governor would then hoist the white flag in token of capitulation , after which the American troops were to enter the town and occupy it . ''

		The subsequent clash between the Spanish and American troops , on the eve of surrender , was due to a failure to see the proper signal .

		Major
Younghusband	PERSON	's tributes to the valor , good be - havior , and gentlemanly bearing of the Amer - ican soldier must be noted as in striking con - trast with that of the former occupants of the fortresses and camps about
Manila	LOCATION	. ''

		Fully 75 per cent of the men are mature , power - fully built fellows , averaging probably 24 or 25 years of age , fine strapping fellows , who would do credit to the
Grenadier Guards	ORGANIZATION	, and taken all round a more pow - erful and hardy set than are now to be found in a Brit - ish line regiment even after a prolonged foreign tour . ''

		Mr.
Noa	PERSON	's little book entitled '' The Pearl of the Antilles '' is a brief , concise statement of some of the Spanish movements which aroused and justified the Cuban struggle for independ - ence .

		His access to sources and state papers not mentioned by other writers gives his book a kind of permanent value to students of Cuban history .

		`` Our Island Empire , '' by Mr.
Charles Morris	PERSON	, is a handbook of the four groups of islands mentioned in the title
Cuba	LOCATION	,
Porto Rico	LOCATION	,
Hawaii	LOCATION	, and
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		The author has compiled useful material regarding each of these on such points as -LRB- 1 -RRB- history , -LRB- 2 -RRB- phys - ical conditions , -LRB- 3 -RRB- natural productions , -LRB- 4 -RRB- civil and political relations , -LRB- 5 -RRB- centres of pop - ulation , -LRB- 6 -RRB- manners and customs , -LRB- 7 -RRB- agri - cultural productions , -LRB- 8 -RRB- manufactures and commerce .

		A very good small map and an index accompany the volume making it a kind of vade-mecum .

		Its information is not , as that of many new works on special islands , first-hand , but collated from many sources . ''

		Everything about Our New Possessions '' is a compilation , much of it in statistical form , of some things only , rather than everything , about our new possessions .

		It contains many valuable facts gleaned from many sources ; but lack of discrimination in the use of material , lack of harmony in matter taken from different sources , lack of any map or chart or table of contents , and a poor index , rather hastily de - cide the fate of this little book .

June 16	DATE	, THE ECONOMICS AND PHILANTHROPY OF
BUSKIN	PERSON	.

		* Although much has been written about Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's economic heresies , and about his social theories in general , it is interesting to learn the opinion of one who is himself known as an economist , if not a very orthodox one ; and especially when the opinion is so clearly and attractively expressed as Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's always are .

		That he is an appreciative critic appears from the preface , where it is said : '' Mr.
Raskin	PERSON	will rank as the greatest social teacher of his age , not merely because he has told the largest number of important truths upon the largest variety of vital matters , in language of penetrative force , but be - cause he lias made the most powerful and the most felic - itous attempt to grasp and to express , as a comprehensive whole , the needs of a human society and the processes of social reform . ''

		The further claim is made that Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	'' has done more than any other Englishman to compel people to realize the nature of the social problem in its wider related issues affecting every department of work and life , and to en - force the supreme moral obligation of confront - ing it '' ; and again , he is called `` the man who , by the conjunction of the keenest sense of jus - tice with the widest culture and the finest gifts of literary expression , has succeeded in telling our age more of the truths it most requires to know than any other man . ''

		But Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	by no means permits his admiration to blind him to the economic defects of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's writings ; on the contrary , he criticizes particular propositions more in detail than one feels to be really necessary .

		Minute dissection is not the kind of examination which seems most appropriate to Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's polit - ical economy ; the exaggeration of eloquence leaves many points vulnerable , and yet the shafts of criticism aimed at these may leave the main body of the argument untouched .

		But at any rate , it speaks well for the real worth of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's philosophy that so severe a critic can be at the same time so enthusiastic a disciple .

		And it fulfils the saying of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	himself , that no true disciple of his would ever be a Ruskinian : `` he will follow , not me , but the instincts of his own soul , and the guidance of its Creator . ''

		However open to criticism Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's po - litical economy may be in certain details , there are other points at which it will bear the closest scrutiny .

		There is no more representative example of this than his insistence upon the fundamental im - portance of Consumption , as the human end for which the industrial processes of Produc - tion , Distribution , and Exchange all exist .

Ruskin	PERSON	never thought the abuse of the Queen 's English an unimportant matter -RRB- , the economists now approximate his use of the word '' cost '' as meaning human dis - utility , and when they mean money cost or expense instead of real cost they now think it worth while to say so .

		Even in denying the name of Political Economy to the orthdox indus - trial science of his day , and calling it
Mercan	PERSON	- tile Economy instead , Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was right , and doubtless meant to enforce a lesson which might have been learned , or at least begun , with '' The Wealth of Nations '' for a primer .

		For a long time after
Adam Smith	PERSON	's day eco - nomic theories were evolved with a notable disregard for the political or social point of view , and even Mill professed to consider only '' some of their applications to social philoso - In Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's view , the most revolution - ary of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's positions is his use of the term '' value '' to mean intrinsic usefulness instead of value in exchange ; yet in that too he only amplified
Adam Smith	PERSON	's conception of '' value in use . ''

		While that is not just the sense in which the term is used by economists to-day , it is a use quite consistent with , and following naturally from , or else leading logic - cally to , his subjective conception of cost ; and the economists have at least gone far enough in the same direction to see that value is largely a subjective phenomenon .

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	attaches so much importance to the reduction of cost and utility to their true bases in human joy and pain , that he is led to say of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's work that it '' will hereafter be recognized as the first serious attempt in
England	LOCATION	to establish a scientific basis of economic study from the social standpoint . ''

		We must at least admit , if we are reasonably unprejudiced , that while Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	may have been as far from the literal truth on some points as were the econo - mists whom he held up to ridicule and scorn , he has proved on the whole a true prophet ; and true prophets are as rare and as valuable to society -LRB- in the Ruskinian sense -RRB- even as scientific economists .

		They are not as valuable in the commercial sense , of course , because no one cares to pay a prophet a salary for merely

		THE DIAL 397 being a true prophet ; they must '' get out and hustle '' with the rest of us .

		Even a prophet who is lucky enough to have prosperous and thrifty forbears is likely to spend his fortune and most of his earnings in good works , as Mr.
Kuskin	PERSON	has done .

		It is in Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's politics , rather than in his economics , that Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	finds the most fundamental errors , and points out certain ap - parent inconsistencies , not of word or phrase merely , but of very substance , which are difficult to harmonize .

		Mr.
Kuskin	PERSON	is at once a good deal of a socialist and an arch-individualist : the latter because of his aristocratic instincts , rein - forced by the philosophy of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and the former owing perhaps to the negative influence of the mercantile economists .

		At times he recognizes that the democratic movement is inevitable , and not altogether to be regretted ; yet again he seems to stake the future upon the virtue of a ruling class to be composed of a regenerated nobility .

		If
Mazzini	PERSON	, with whom he has much in common , had been his master in politics instead of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, his whole social philosophy would have been more consistent ; for it would have lost much of its individualism , and with it the dependence upon aristocracy , and gained more of collectivism and the demo - cratic spirit .

		To be sure , democracies need often to be reminded that they must have trained leaders that politics is a science and administration a profession ; but the reminder would have carried more weight with English - men and the sons of Englishmen if the de - mocracy of the message had been more apparent .

		Mr.
Kuskin	PERSON	deserves to be called a social reformer quite as much because of his own actual attempts to improve matters as on ac - count of the ideas expressed in his books ; but Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	gives no complete account of these experiments , though he devotes one chapter to a few of them , including especially the
St. George 's Guild	ORGANIZATION	and the revival of hand weav - ing and spinning .

		He also tells something about the principal institutions and associations which serve as monuments to Mr.
Kuskin	PERSON	by carrying out his ideas , such as the Museum at
Sheffield	ORGANIZATION	begun by the master himself , the
Home Arts and Industries Association	ORGANIZATION	, the
Kuskin Linen Industry of Keswick	ORGANIZATION	, the craft school in
Westmoreland	LOCATION	, and the
Ruskin Soci	LOCATION	- eties at
Birmingham	LOCATION	,
Liverpool	LOCATION	,
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and elsewhere in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		To many readers this will prove the most interest - ing part of the book ; but they will wish there were more about the Working Men 's College , the improved tenements , and even the '' Hink - sey diggin 's , '' and something at least about the tea-shop and the street - cleaning .

		Perhaps Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	thought these matters sufficiently treated in Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	's '' Life '' ; but there is other material in various out-of-the-way places , * and it would seem well worth someone 's while to bring it all together .

		One growing class of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's admirers would like above all to know more about Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's influence upon the
University Settlement	ORGANIZATION	movement ; they know that the idea was born at his house , at a meeting in which he had called together a hand - ful of university men who were already living in
East London	LOCATION	, but no one seems to know just how much of the plan was conceived by
Edward Denison	ORGANIZATION	and
John Richard Green	PERSON	, and how far it was Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's own .

		There is a remark - able correspondence between the activities of the Settlements and Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's conception of the functions of Bishops , which suggests that both ideas may be products of the same mind to a greater extent than has been supposed .

		In giving to the world this guide to the study of the Ruskinian social philosophy , Mr.
Hob	PERSON	- son has performed a real service , for the phil - osophy in question is scattered through so many works , and sometimes expressed in such fanci - ful language , that most readers get but a hazy idea of what Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's views really are .

		But , as Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	says : '' The confusion , even chaos , of which some careless readers of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	complain , yields to a clear unity of system as we regard the meanderings of his versatile intelligence from the standpoint of social justice , a plea for honesty of transactions between man and man .

		This unity of system is not indeed a mechanical unity , an objective system of thought , but rather a unity imposed by personal temperament and valuation .

		When we understand it , we understand
John Ruskin	PERSON	, his person - ality , his view of life . ''

		The tributes expressed and implied in this volume ought to gladden the heart of the grand old man at
Brantwood	LOCATION	, who believes his social and economic teachings to be the most import - ant part of all his varied work .

		It is indeed rare that so radical an iconoclast comes to be so all but universally hailed as a true prophet during his lifetime , or even has the satisfaction of reading so sympathetic and discriminating an exposition of his heresies .

		* Professor
Giddings	PERSON	has followed his '' Principles of Sociology '' with a '' text-book for colleges and schools . ''

		In the effort to reduce his material to more elementary form for young students , there is a gain in clearness of style , and at many points the author has wisely learned from his critics .

		The claim is made , in the '' note to the reviewer , '' that there are important developments of theory not fully presented in the earlier and larger work : the analysis of the practical activities of social popula - tions and of the motives from which they
spring	DATE	; cooperation ; a fuller analysis of the social mind ; civilization , progress , and democracy ; and a new statement of psychological causes of social phe - nomena .

		In essential features , and modes of thought and treatment , we have the same book as '' The
Prin	PERSON	- ciples of Sociology '' ; but at many points this virile writer has written his way to greater clearness and fresh points of view .

		It is very desirable that so - ciology should be presented from many sides by minds of different orders ; and all students of the subject will be grateful for the many suggestive hints and interesting speculations of Professor
Gid	ORGANIZATION	- dings .

		The teachers and the students who use this text-book for beginners ought to be put on their guard , however , against a certain danger in the writ - er 's way of statement .

		This way may be illustrated by a part of the last chapter -LRB- p. 342 -RRB- , in which we are taught that our interpretations of our fellow-men are made by ascribing to them our own experiences .

		While there is an important truth in this statement , it needs more qualification in order to prevent im - posing on the outer world our own subjective modes of thought .

		There is a confidence in some of the generalizations set down which does not seem justi - fied by the present state of knowledge .

		At one place -LRB- p. 237 -RRB- we read : '' We are unable to ascer - tain very much about the earliest beginnings of hu - man society . ''

		But in the immediate connection we have generalizations which would require quite com - plete and connected knowledge to justify .

		In another place we have the unqualified assertion -LRB- p. 232 -RRB- : '' There is hardly a single fact in the whole range of sociological knowledge that does not support the conclusion that the race was social before it was human , and that its social qualities were the chief means of developing its human nature . ''

		But the eminent naturalist Dr.
L. F. Ward	PERSON	-LRB- `` Outlines of Sociology , '' p. 90 ff . -RRB-

		seems to take precisely oppo - site grounds .

		The reader should at least take pains to compare the statements and see if the difference does not lie in different definitions of the word '' social . ''

		While it does give one a comfortable sense of finality and completeness to have his sociology served up in such neat , comprehensive , and author - itative form , one can hardly avoid the feeling that much work remains to be done .

		The solution here offered appears to be too easy , in view of the mul - titude of unsettled problems in all the sciences on which sociology depends .

		If , therefore , this strong , clear , massive book is used with youngsters , already too quick to catch the dogmatic spirit and be done with philosophy at a gulp , we would advise a com - panion volume of more modest scope .

		The true pedagogue will know how to start with outward ex - pressions of social thinking , with local and verifi - able phenomena , and lead the pupil up to these heights of bold speculation .

		And the teacher who realizes the peril of prematurely closing discussion under the spell of a powerful book will be careful to start inquiry as to the grounds of assertion .

		In doing this , the teacher will but obey pedagogic sug - gestions made by the author himself , but not by any means uniformly followed .

		In the chapter on '' The Theory of Society , '' the '' law of least effort '' is made to play a command - ing role .

		The claim must not pass without critical challenge . ''

		The law of least effort '' has a place , but it is too vague , general , and negative to give a true cause of , say , the English Constitution , the world of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the million social aspirations which seek expression in
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
Browning	PERSON	.

		The attempt to explain the psychical life by modes of reasoning applicable to the physical sphere is unsatisfying .

		The formula which is adequate for a wind or a stream breaks down when it professes to meet the demands of the infinitely wide processes and contents of spiritual being .

		The '' law of least effort '' does have place in the physical side of being which is correlated to the psychical .

		But prema - ture identification of the two sides is not fruitful of discovery or explanation .

		One may agree with Professor Giddings -LRB- Preface , p. vi . -RRB-

		that the field of social phenomena should be outlined in high school and college , in order to coordinate politics , eco - nomics , ethics , and law , and yet see the necessity of having this text-book used by an instructor who knows enough of the history and schools of sociology to prevent his becoming a slave of any one of them .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 399 A certain university training in sociology would be necessary for one who proposed to use this or any other text-hook in preparatory school or college .

		To these sentences of caution we may now add , in good conscience , that no one who professes to teach soci - ology has a moral right to neglect this volume .

		The
United States Commissioner of Labor	ORGANIZATION	is in the most advantageous position for preparing the materials for such a hook as '' Practical Sociology . ''

		The strength and limitations of this volume lie in the fact that the industrial and economic element is made the commanding feature of the discussion .

		This is entirely natural for one whose life has been devoted to collecting and interpreting materials of the economic order .

		In this field of thought , Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's book presents more abundant stores of fact than any similar publication .

		The statistical matter is actually made interesting .

		Nor would it be fair to say that the author neglects those social values which are the really ultimate ends of wealth itself and of political organization .

		Indeed , the idealist is delighted to find everywhere a frank rec - ognition of the cultural aims of enlightened human - ity .

		But the limitation of the method of treatment may be seen in the meagre discussion of the aesthetic social interest , and the relatively large space given to industrial and commercial phenomena .

		Sociology still suffers from being in the frontier stage where the bare struggle for being monopolizes attention , and Aristotle 's '' well-being '' loses its full meaning and is reduced to the economic order .

		This criti - cism does not signify that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	has said too much on economics , when he talks as master and expert ; but only that the complete presentation of so vast a subject can not be made by any one mind .

		The student of society is here supplied with a mass of data of great importance , and is directed to abundant and valuable sources of information and discussion .

		The treatment is rather elementary and popular in form , and the spirit almost too optimis - tic .

		One is grateful that we have such a man as Mr.
Wright	PERSON	at the head of our
Department of Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		The papers relating to the work and studies of
South End House	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, now collected into a vol - ume entitled `` The City Wilderness , '' deserve a fuller notice than can here be given .

		They consti - tute one of the most weighty and significant con - tributions ever made in
America	LOCATION	to the interpreta - tion of crowded urban conditions and heterogeneous populations .

		The essays are not extemporized , but are the '' hard-won gains of actual experience . ''

		Every phase of life is portrayed with a master-hand ; the history of the district , the elements of popula - tion , the conditions of health , the work and wages , the secret of political corruption , tendencies to vice and crime , amusements , religion , education , charity , philanthropy , city government , are all adequately described .

		Students of social amelioration will here learn the price of progress and the grounds of hope .

		It is far more satisfactory to read Mr.
Wyckoff	PERSON	's story of '' The Workers '' in book form than in the fragments of magazine articles .

		The second vol - ume is even better than the first .

		The author has grown in power of observation .

		He has learned at every step .

		He gains in respect for the working - man as he understands his situation and motives .

		Old residents of
Chicago	LOCATION	will learn something of their own city from this volume , and if readers are not moved to act for betterment they are incapable of response to one of the finest appeals ever made to the higher nature of man .

		Every city official should ponder the treatment given the street wanderers , and be led to study the achievements of
Boston	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Indianapolis	LOCATION	.

		In the next genera - tion these pictures of human beings , guiltless of crime , sleeping on stone floors in police stations , which reek with disease and swarm with vermin , will seem incredible .

		But there are the photo - graphs , and here is the testimony of a sensitive scholar , finely bred , who lay down among the vaga - bonds that he might help to know and redeem them .

		Mr.
Wyckoff	PERSON	's account of country life in the West is charming and cheering .

		It is a soul 's rest after the tragedy of the city and its congested labor mar - ket and sweating dens .

		If the public remains ignorant and apathetic in relation to the Unemployable , it will not be the fault of such writers as Professor
Wyckoff	PERSON	and Mr.
Jacob Riis	PERSON	.

		The latter 's sketches of
New York City	LOCATION	life among the lowly are set forth by a master-hand , and tell the story with mighty pathos .

		One does not think of '' literature , '' but of life , as he reads these stories .

		Here is one who has looked and thought and sympathized .

		He has watched the motley com - pany which throngs the miserable streets and police courts of the metropolis , until he knows all their types of character , all their tragedies and comedies .

		When our cities become habitable , and the poor are decently provided for , and the slums are cleansed , and humanity is restored , among the sons of the tribe of Abou
Ben Adhem	PERSON	, Mr.
Riis	PERSON	will be in the front row to receive plaudits .

		To bless his name will arise Denny the Robber ,
John Gavin	PERSON	the Misfit , the foundling Chinese baby , the brave fireman whose story he tells , the policemen whose vices he repro - bates while he glorifies their humanity and good - ness .

		It is not high life ; it is not beautiful , nor even clean ; but divine elements are discovered , and the promise of better things . ''

		Love hopeth all things . ''

		The little volume of essays by Mrs.
Bernard Bosanquet	PERSON	are fine illustrations of the working of a mind trained in the explanation of concrete phe - nomena of society .

		The paper on '' The Standard of Life '' is a trenchant treatment of a vital theme , and shows how definition and a certain ideal of comfort and culture help working people to stand firmly in the regulation of their own conduct and in facing the employers in unions .

		The criticism of a philanthropy which thoughtlessly helps to make wages lower is just and telling .

		The essay on the psychology of social progress is clearly writ - ten , and helps to grasp some of the elementary no - tions of social psychology .

		The treatment of the 400 THE DIAL education of women is instructive , without giving a new contribution to our knowledge .

		Full of social optimism and confidence in the regenerating power of kindergartens is Mr.
Horace Fletcher	PERSON	, the genial friend of little children . ''

		That Last Waif '' is a phrase which shows confidence that the '' unfit '' are soon to disappear from the streets of our sodden cities .

		Perhaps the author has not counted in all the adverse forces which biologists and teachers are compelled to measure in their depths .

		Perhaps he has not made full account of heredity and the momentum of tradition .

		But then , he sees the hopeful side , and he urges the most timely meas - ure of progress .

		It is a pleasure to call attention to the scheme which the affable author calls '' Social Quarantine '' especially as all profits of his publi - cation go to kindergarten work .

		The little volume entitled '' The Cry of the
Chil	ORGANIZATION	- dren '' draws its illustrations from English city life .

		The author has evidently studied at first-hand the occupations of young children in box making , belt and umbrella making , paper bags and sack making , artificial flower making , furniture polishing , and canal life .

		One may hope that this constant reitera - tion of the wrongs of children will help to promote the movements on their behalf kindergartens , parental schools , clubs , settlements , factory inspec - tion , compulsory education , and kindred measures .

England	LOCATION	.

		haye cons id e rable difficulty in under - standing just what historical connection exists be - tween the subjects chosen for elaboration by Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	in his '' England in the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		There are in the first volume eleven chapters , each treating of some interesting event or political movement , but each leaving the impression of a separate essay whose exact bearing on or relation to that which precedes or follows it is difficult to determine .

		Nor is the work as a whole up to Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's usual standard .

		Never an exact historian , it is the less surprising that he re - peats at length the errors of the popular historian in the old tale of
Canning	ORGANIZATION	's superlative prescience , and -LRB- by inference -RRB-
Castlereagh	LOCATION	's feeble grasp , .

		in diplomatic affairs .

		Canning is pictured as alone responsible for
Enpland	ORGANIZATION	's emergence from the toils of the
Holy Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, a fable long accepted by politicians , but never seriously asserted by any careful student of British state papers .

		Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Carthy	PERSON	's carelessness in historical statement is illus - trated also by his calm assertion of another historic lie , namely , that the Holy Alliance of
1815	DATE	did at that time definitely intend the suppression of all revolutionary movements in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The chief merits of previous works by this author have been readableness and attractive characterizations ; and it is in respect to these features that the present work is not up to the usual standard .

		Haste is evi - dent in every chapter , and here and there extra - neous matter is inserted as if having come to mind at the moment of writing .

		The vim and movement usual with the author are utterly lacking , and the volume sinks to a dull level depressing in its effect upon the reader .

		Coming from Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	, the work is a distinct disappointment .

		The second volume -LRB- received since the above was written -RRB- in na way alters the opinion formed from a perusal of the first volume .

		Carelessness in language , in statement of fact , and in generalization , constitute its short - comings .

		For example , on page 171 of the second volume the misleading generalization , '' the whole ambition of the Emperor
Napoleon	PERSON	's life was to re - store the glories of the great Napoleonic time , '' is given , and in the same paragraph the inaccuracy of detail is shown in crediting to Prince

Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		On the whole , however , the second volume is more readable than the first , because of a better selection of topics illuminating
England	LOCATION	's history .

		Yet Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's reputation for enter - taining and fairly accurate historical writing will ; not be benefited by the present work .

		The translator of the critical essays Critical essays of M Ren Doumic hag done well in from the French .

		, taking no one book of his , but rather making a selection .

		M. Doumic 's volumes have not , as a rule , much logical unity : they gather up the essays of a year or two , much as it may chance .

		In each volume a good many of the subjects are more interesting to the French reader than they would be to the American .

		But by selecting from several books the essays on the novelists ,
Miss Mary Frost	ORGANIZATION	has made an attractive collection in '' Con - temporary French Novelists '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		People have heard more of French novelists than of French poets , preachers , or critics .

		So far as these latter are concerned , they have probably heard something of M. Doumic himself , because he was here in
America	LOCATION	a year ago , and because he writes for the '' Revue des Deux Mondes . ''

		Those who regard that standard periodical as the cream of French lit - erature naturally regard
M. Doumic	PERSON	as a critic both sound and rare .

		For ourselves , we have but a gen - eral interest in
M. Doumic	ORGANIZATION	's criticism .

		It has not the attraction of the academic quality -LRB- so charac - teristic of

		THE DIAL M.
Paul Desjardins	PERSON	.

		Of course a man need not have these things , or anything like them , to be good .

		M. Brunetiere has not them ; he has something else .

		What has M. Rene '' Doumic ?

		Well , he is objective ; he has chiefly facts and inferences .

		He regards literature as the product of men of letters ; there - fore , this book is on novelists rather than on novels .

		He has pretty definite ideas of what is worth doing , and a great deal of common sense ; so that his criti - cism , even if not very stimulating , is pretty sound .

		The present translation is not a model of excellence .

		Miss Frost has allowed herself various liberties : she has sometimes quite disregarded the original arrange - ment of paragraphs and sections , a matter about which modern French essayists are rather particu - lar ; she has always omitted a sentence or two when she felt like it ; she has sometimes overstepped the conventions of mood and tense , so as to offer us a freer translation than would be otherwise possible .

		We do not think , however , that she has anywhere really perverted the meaning of the original , so that those who want merely the ideas of the original will be pretty sure to find them .

		The fact that the regular diurnal The problem variations in the level of the sea , as of the tides .

		. '

		observed in varying degrees at all sea-ports , are caused by the moon and the sun , was ages ago recognized .

		The modern theories of grav - itation and of the translation of wave movements have accounted for most of the complicated and often contradictory phenomena , leaving yet much that is difficult of comprehension , so remote and so subtle are the influences in action .

		Professor
George Howard Darwin	PERSON	, of
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, elucidates the subject in a well-devised course of lectures given in
1897	DATE	at the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	, and now issued in book form by
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The range of the phenomena described and discussed is of the widest .

		From tidal activities detected in lakes and in enclosed seas , in the estua - ries of rivers , in the earth 's interior , it extends to other planets , particularly to
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	, to the forms of nebulae , and to the movements of double stars .

		The terrestrial tides are discussed as to their causes , their place of beginning and progressive movements , the prediction of their recurrence at specified ports , their influence upon the earth 's figure , the periods of its rotation , and upon the revolution of the moon .

		On the crucial point , the attempt to show how the attraction of the moon can cause a heaping up of the waters upon the side of the earth opposite the moon involves the usual obscurity of representing a reversal of forces , as indicated in figure 22 on page 100 .

		The influence of a centrifugal force , resulting from the revolution of the earth about the centre of gravity of the system composed of the earth and the moon , is brought into the account , properly of course , so far as it goes .

		But the cen - trifugal force generated in the time of a lunar revo - lution can have little part in the production of a re - sult like the reverse terrestrial tide which is a matter of daily occurrence .

		The key to the solution of the problem of the tidal form lies in the difference of the lunar force of attraction , as found at the centre of the earth and on the nearer and remoter surfaces .

		The distances of these representative particles from the moon vary as the numbers 51 , 60 , and 61 , and the corresponding attractions vary as the squares of those numbers .

		The three particles may be figured by three boys holding to a rope and running in suc - cession with forces corresponding to their strength or to the influences arousing them .

		If the three were of equal strength there would be no strain upon the rope .

		If the foremost boy were stronger and the rear boy weaker than the middle boy , the fore - most will pull the middle boy forward ; while the rear boy , being unable to keep up , though running with all his might , seems to pull back .

		But for the rope which drags him along he would fall behind , as do the waters on the remote side of the earth .

		All the particles of the earth are falling toward the moon those on the nearer side with greater , those on the farther side with less , movement ; conse - quently they are distributed over a greater space in the direction of the lunar force .

		The resulting figure of the earth is a prolate spheroid , such as any body assumes when falling toward a centre of attraction .

Charles Kingsley	PERSON	,
John Keble	PERSON	,
William Edward Forster	PERSON	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, and the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	in the closing days of the American Civil War .

		Three of these chapters have been pre - viously published in a more or less complete form .

		Mr.
Yarnall	PERSON	's acquaintance with the men he writes of , with one or two exceptions , seems to have been too slight to enable him to ascertain the distinctive traits of character possessed by each , a fact that has obliged him frequently to supplement his own opinions with those of others , and sometimes to introduce irrelevant matter into his book .

		His rec - ollections impress us as being those of a sympathetic and appreciative visitor to the homes and haunts of certain great men , rather than the memories of an intimate friend .

		On the other hand , Mr.
Yarnall	PERSON	's 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, style is easy and natural , and he has written a very readable book .

		He has recorded many of the wise sayings which fell from the lips of the men and women he met , and he has related some interesting incidents that are worth remembering .

		He has also told us something of the awe with which most peo - ple came into the presence of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	; some - thing , too , of the beautiful old age of Mrs. Words - worth ; something of the traits of the wonderful author of '' The Ancient Mariner '' which could still be traced in the poet 's children ,
Sara	PERSON	,
Hartley	PERSON	, and
Derwent Coleridge	PERSON	; and a good deal about the late Lord Chief Justice of
England	LOCATION	,
Lord Coleridge	PERSON	, with whom Mr.
Yarnall	PERSON	was on terms of cordial friendship and with whom he carried on a corre - spondence which extended over a period of thirty - seven years , all of which was well worth the telling .

		We are hardly familiar enough with The American ^ e American acting drama of to-day acting drama .

		,11 -111 to be able to judge whether or not it is proper to regard Mr.
Augustus Thomas	PERSON	's '' Ala - bama '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- as properly representative in a series that includes some of the finest dramatic work done of late in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		We should incline to hope -LRB- if nothing more -RRB- that we had something a little more serious to offer ; but we may demand more than there is .


M. Rostand	PERSON	is certainly a dis - tinguished figure in the French drama of to-day ,
Hauptmann	PERSON	in the German : possibly
America	LOCATION	is fitly represented by Mr.
Augustus Thomas	PERSON	.

		``
Alabama	LOCATION	'' is an American play .

		It deals with peculiarly American situations , namely , such as might arise in the influx of Northern capital and energy into the South , some twenty years after the war .

		It deals with American characters , too ; Northern men of business and
Southern	ORGANIZATION	planters .

		The play is thus perhaps as representatively American as any - thing we have , although personally we should have preferred one of Mr.
Harrigan	PERSON	's Irish and Negro conglomerates , or one of Mr.
Hoyt	PERSON	's racy eccentric - ities , or something like '' The Old Homestead '' or '' Shore Acres . ''

		These plays seem to us to be more typical of some aspects of our civilization than ``
Alabama	LOCATION	'' is of others .

		Yet there is no use grumbling in such an embarrassment of riches .

		Perhaps the courage of Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	in printing his play will lead others to follow his example .

		It is the first step that costs : we hope it will not cost Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	and Mr.
Russell	PERSON	very much , for we want to see more American dramas in print .

		Completion of The ^ na ^ instalment -LRB- Volume III . -RRB-

		Ratzeiv * Hittory of Prof essor
Ratzel	ORGANIZATION	's great work on of
Mankind	LOCATION	.

		Tne History of Mankind '' in an English dress -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- presents the same char - acteristics as the preceding volumes , which have been fully noticed in these columns .

		The present volume is loaded with good cuts of ethnic types and ethnographic objects , and is supplied with some ex - cellent colored plates and maps .

		In Book IV .

		the discussion of the
Negro Races	ORGANIZATION	is completed by chapters upon the Africans of the
Interior	ORGANIZATION	and the
West Africans	LOCATION	.

		The final division of the work , Book V. , deals with the Cultured Races of the Old World .

		In following the discussion of African ne - groes , we are constantly impressed by their political instability : how many kingdoms have risen sud - denly to power , and as suddenly have disappeared , leaving no trace !

		Preliminary to the study of the Cultured Races of
Africa	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	, the author con - siders the desert and nomadism most suggestively .

		Islam and its influence are fairly treated .

		Consid - ering the great size of the work , the conditions de - scribed are astonishingly up to date .

		Recent political events in
Africa	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	are taken into the account .

		The discussion of
China	LOCATION	social and religious is good ; that of the European peoples is less notable .

		In a work of so wide scope , full and detailed accounts of peoples can not be expected : Professor
Ratzel	PERSON	has done wonderfully well in giving so much as he does .

		The subject and plan of the work necessitated dry and terse statement .

		Still , it is unfortunate that
Ratzel	PERSON	could not have fallen into the hands of a better translator .

		The English could hardly be more difficult and obscure ; the author 's meaning is sometimes lost ; the grammar is bad .

		The translator does not appear to know either authors or literature .

		He several times re - fers to Crawfurd as
Crawford	PERSON	.

		Where English authors are quoted , it appears that their original statement is not looked up , but is retranslated .

		These translator 's faults , manifest and constant , will prevent this English edition of volkerkunde from becoming popular .

		The work is , however , too valuable to students to be neglected , and will become an important book of reference .

		Mr.
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	has been rather ingenious in making criticism on his f > later book '' More -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- im - possible .

		In criticism of any such book the all - important thing is point of view .

		Now the most obvious point of view for the critic of Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	to take is that of Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	himself : a proceed - ing quite out of the question , not because it would be difficult , but because it would be imitative and there - fore silly in anyone except the gifted author .

		And any other point of view would also be impossible , for it would have to be either in earnest or not .

		One can - not , of course , consider these bits in earnest .

		And if one is to think of them affectedly , one is practic - ally in the position of trying to go beyond Mr.
Beer	PERSON	- bohm or else to vary from him , neither of which acts is self-respecting .

		We say nothing , then , ex - cept that one should not read these essays in a rage .

		This may seem a needless caution , but Mr.
Beer	PERSON	- bohm 's earlier labors did arouse rage in some hearts .

		These latter works will not be likely to do so ; in fact , in our heart they have aroused on the whole pleasure .

		One thing only we rather regret : we are quite unable to regard Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	as a great thinker , veiling his ideas under a trivial form .

		We find a good many very sensible remarks here and .


Max Beerbohm	PERSON	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 403 there in his essays ; but we can not think of him as a delver after truth .

		He has no message to his time ; and that is a pity .

		The gifted man whom he so sedulously imitates did have a message , though he would have been zealous in denying the fact .

		Perhaps further and more careful study of Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	would have shown that he has one , too ; but we doubt it .

		Still , we commend a study of the question to those who find themselves some
summer	DATE	afternoon with nothing of greater import - ance to do .

		The book is of a size suitable for a hammock .

		The two names
Pollok	PERSON	and Aytoun Two forgotten w jjj ra j ge j n manv no answering rec - men of letters .

		.

		J / - i T i ollection . ''

		The Bon Gualtier Bal - lads '' have hardly survived the half-century , and '' The Course of Time '' has had even a shorter life .

		Yet Mrs.
Masson	PERSON	's volume on these two '' Famous Scots '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- is worth reading for all that .

		It is a book which is more interesting on account of the considerations it gives rise to , than on account of the facts it details .

		These two men may be said to be a typical pair : the one , a poor and hard-working Scotch ploughboy student , work - ing at divinity and literature by the hardest toils , and reaching fame and position only a short season before his death ; the other , the well-to-do man of literary tastes and inclinations , passing a pleasant and appreciated life as contributor to '' Black - wood 's '' and professor of belles-lettres .

		By all proper expectation , the former should be the real genius whose poetic fire still shines for the delectation of lovers of letters , and the latter should be merely the literary man of the hour whose productions have closely followed him into obscurity .

		The fact is , however , that the hard-working genius and the well - to-do litterateur are both forgotten , one almost as thoroughly as the other , with the odds against the genius .

		It is curious how often poetic justice is foiled .

		In spite of the prosaic harshness of destiny , Mrs.
Masson	PERSON	's book is , as we have said , pleasant to turn over .

		We might think her a bit frivolous in her manner of dealing with so sacred a topic as a man of genius ; still , this is better than taking the matter too seriously .

		Beside the frivolities and the necessities of her narrative , she often turns a good phrase on her own account '' the opal wonders of the
Western Highlands	LOCATION	, '' for instance .

		When we last wrote of Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	, Mn .

		Mtymivt ag we rememD er , we regretted a little new volume .

		6 .

		that her work was becoming better known .

		Literary likings have three phases : first , they are enthusiasms ; then , cults ; then , fashions .

		All literary likings do not go through these three phases .

		The '' Rubaiyat , '' however , is a very per - fect instance of all : first , in the seventies , when it was the passion of a few individuals ; then , in the eighties , when it was the esoteric possession of various coteries ; now , in the nineties , when it has become an ordinary drawing-room dissipation .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, however , skipped the second stage , and some people have skipped the first as well .


Browning	PERSON	will never reach the third , and
Landor	ORGANIZATION	will never get even to the second .

		To return to Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	, who is on the border-land between a sincere enthusiasm and a cult .

		In certain circles it is getting necessary to `` know '' Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	, meaning , of course , her writings ; and we regret that pleasure in Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's essays should become compulsory .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	is an essayist of a high order .

		She does not sit among pigeonholes , like Miss Repplier , and decoct the choice treasure of her cells ; nor drop bunches of artificial grass about the floors of modern salons , like
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	.

		She has her own mode of distinction , a mode that we tried to describe some time ago .

		It is a mode that demands something of reader as well as writer , demands not more than it gives , certainly , but more than do most of the recent essays which are too often only the weekly wool-gathering of some mind that has wandered much in literature and life .

		We said , some years since , that the interest in Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's essays lay largely in the temperament that they conveyed , in their quality .

		We think that this may be said of '' The Spirit of Place '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- ; nor does it seem to us that the quality has changed in the last few years , or that its mode of expression has become less delicate and sure .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	''
Milton	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is uniform with the other poets included in this favorite and inex - pensive edition that is , it forms a single volume with double-columned pages , has a portrait frontispiece , a compact body of notes , and an introductory essay .

		The latter , as well as the editing in general , comes from Mr.
William Vaughan Moody	PERSON	, who has also provided prose translations of the Latin poems .

		Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's intro - duction , considered both as biography and criticism , is an excellent piece of work .

		Mr.
George Burton Adams	PERSON	's handbook of European History -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- should be of great value to teach - ers of history , for it contains in concise form just the material required in outlining for students the supple - mentary reading necessary in each epoch .

		The work is not in itself sufficiently expanded to be used as a text-book , indeed , it was not the author 's intention that it should be so used , but taken as a basis for a lecture course , or for the seminary method of study , it will serve as the best of guides .

		It is particularly strong in well-selected references to such works in English , or in translation , as are easily obtainable , at small expense , by any school or college library .

		The following French texts are of recent publication : Augier et Sandeau 's '' Le Gendre de M. Poirier '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , edited by Dr.
Stuart Symington	PERSON	; a '' Precis de 1 ` His - toire de
