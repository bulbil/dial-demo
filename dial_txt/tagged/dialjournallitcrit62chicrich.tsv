MARAH ELLIS	PERSON	RYAN A distinct addition to the literature of the Irish Renaissance To the telling of these tales the author has brought a profound knowledge of Celtic legends and folk-lore , together with a richness of poetic feeling and imagination .

		Out of the
Druid	ORGANIZATION	mood of
Erin	PERSON	she has wrought magical tales of love , of courage and mad gallantry .

		She has opened a door through which blow the fragrant winds of old romance .

		So strong is the undernote of mysti - cism that the elemental appeal of the stars , the ur & e of the sea , the desire for all mysterious things wake a & ain under the spell conjured by these extraordi - nary stories .

		36 THE SECRET OF FAR EASTERN PAINTING .

		Since Admiral
Perry	PERSON	's fleet definitely opened
Japan	LOCATION	to the West , barely sixty years have elapsed ; but during that time scholars and men of science have discovered that in all the arts of civilization music , poetry , painting , sculpture , architecture , religion , philosophy
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	can boast of a record as long and as fruitful as any in the
West	LOCATION	.

		Particularly has this been noteworthy up to the present in matters of painting .

		Chinese and Japanese painting in this country can boast of its enthusiastic collectors like
Fenollosa	PERSON	and Freer , its admirers and fol - lowers like La Farge and
Whistler	LOCATION	, its students like Boss and Cram .

		In the great Freer collection at
Detroit	LOCATION	, which will some day become part of the national collection at
Washington	LOCATION	, and in the
Boston	LOCATION	Museum of Fine Arts collection , we have materials for estimating the value and importance of Chinese painting -LRB- of which Japanese is only an offshoot -RRB- which can only be equalled , if equalled at all , in the Far East itself .

		A few bold spirits even now are beginning to declare that they are able to draw more pleasure and inspiration from the masterpieces of Far Eastern painting than from the best Western efforts of to-day and yesterday .

		What , then , is this charm wherein lies the secret of Chinese and Japanese painting ?

		A great mistake is made by the Western nations in supposing that education is a mat - ter of the development of purely intellectual faculties .

		Education is not of the mind only , but of the body also .

		To fill the memory with immense quantities of uncorrelated , misin - terpreted , and undigested facts is far more noxious than to remain in sheer ignorance .

		A true education is that which trains the senses to investigate for themselves , the brain .

		to observe and correlate sensation , the spirit to receive it and give it out to the world .

		Now the extraordinary point about Chinese and Japanese painters is that , although they were trained to observe nature and life , their THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	work looks to us altogether artificial and con - ventional .

		How deep that training went may be shown when I say that in the later Sung period , about
1200	DATE	A. D. , when Chinese land - scape art reached its high-water mark , the artists who achieved this summit were trained in the Zen Buddhist doctrine , a natural pan - theism , the cardinal point of which was that everything in nature has , not only its outer form , but its inner state of feeling , with which the artist must be in sympathy before he can properly paint it .

		If the aim of the Chinese landscapists of the Sung period was to get as far as possible into sympathy with their sub - jects , why is it that they painted in such a conventional manner ?

		It is because the act of receiving inspiration from nature and the art of rendering it again , are altogether dif - ferent processes .

		In nature everything exists in a state of diffusion .

		You look at a figure or a landscape , and you come away with a feeling of peace ; at another , and you have a shrinking of hor - ror ; at another , and you have a feeling of conflict , of battle .

		To make plain all these underlying emotions and feelings is the aim of art of any art .

		If one sits down and attempts to absorb all the various detail that made up this feeling , one simply absorbs the illusion and not the underlying reality .

		Everything remains diffused , unsynthetized , uncoordinated .

		Mental effort of this sort is only the absorption of a certain number of curious statistics .

		If one tries merely to put these statistics down on canvas again , one produces a sort of statistical analysis , drier and less interesting than the reality , which not only contained these statistics but some - thing which appealed to normal universal emotion as well .

		If one proceeds by the Oriental method , one does not necessarily seek to put down any of the statistics of the reality .

		One selects from the whole object or series of objects before one a few features which contain all the emotional import of that object , and strives to render these in such a way as to suggest all the rest .

		One art is an art of statement ; the other , an art of selec - tion and restatement in another medium .

		One is uncreative ; the other is creative .

		The first secret of Oriental art is therefore that , unlike Western art of to-day , it does not rest on the doctrine that the eye transmits certain things to the brain , and the brain , through the medium of the hand , tries to transmit them unaltered to the picture ; but that the brain constantly uses the eye to grasp the meaning of what is set before it , and the hand renders again this meaning in a dif - ferent way .

		The Western artist uses nature as an end , and painting as a means to that end ; the Oriental uses painting as an end , and nature as a means .

		Western art is a worship of external form ; Eastern art is a rendering of internal mood .

		In no ways are Western and Chinese art more contrasted than in their ideas of com - position , perspective , and color .

		Let us take up composition and perspective first , and try to grasp what the Oriental means by them .

		Of the famous six canons of Chinese paint - ing formulated about fifteen hundred years ago , the first is life-rhythm , and the last com - position and finish .

		Perspective is not men - tioned .

		This is instructive , but more instruct - ive still is the old anecdote of some Chinese artist who became famous for his ability to render a hundred miles of landscape on a fan .

		The Western artist always conceives of his picture as fitting into a frame .

		He literally grows into the habit of looking at nature through the medium of a round or square or oblong hole .

		To fill this blank space is his object .

		The habit of squaring off one 's draw - ing , or measuring the proportion of objects with the stump of a pencil extended at arm 's length , finishing a painting after it has been framed , is altogether Western .

		The Western picture is evidently a well-filled , but limited cross-section of space .

		To the Oriental nothing seems more absurd .

		He conceives of a piece of silk or of paper as capable of infinite extension .

		He does not work inward from the frame ; he does not stand mentally outside his picture and look into it ; he works outward from the centre , and standing at ease there looks about him on every side and sees the dignity and beauty of infinite space .

		Thus many Chinese and Japanese works look empty to our untrained eyes .

		The objects therein are simply space - boundaries which are enclosed by emptiness .

		When a Chinese speaks of composition , he means the spacing of his objects .

		He arranges
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL his spaces in such a way that the material or filled element becomes merely a boundary of line or tone to restrain the extent of the immaterial or unfilled space .

		This is done , first , by lines tending to the horizontal , expressive of breadth ; by lines tending to the vertical , expressing height and depth ; by gradation of tone , expressing the infinite variations of materiality ; and , finally , by spotting , which is perhaps the most important of all , since every touch in this art tends to become a spot of interest on which the eye can rest for a moment before traversing another free space .

		It is this conception of composition as arrangement of subject-matter diverging into space , rather than as filling a square or oblong or circle with converging shapes , that makes the actually smaller Chinese and Japanese kakemonos more decor - ative and bigger in effect than the enormous walls of European and American public buildings , crowded with figures .

		It is also this which enabled the Oriental artists to give us the makimono , or roll picture , of which only one section could be seen at a time , but which had the continuity of a frieze , as well as an infinite variety of movement and arrangement .

		Beside many of these maki - monos , the
Parthenon	LOCATION	frieze looks conven - tional the mere repetition of a pattern .

		Finally , it was this constant freedom from space limitations which enabled the Chinese and Japanese to give us different and unre - lated aspects of a scene or landscape in one work ; as , for instance , the painting of all four seasons on a single screen , or of a hun - dred miles of landscape on a fan , or the tell - ing of an entire story in one picture .

		As for perspective , the idea that Chinese artists knew nothing about perspective still persists as the popular view .

		Now , it may be true that far objects do appear smaller than near ones .

		But a thing may be true to fact without being true in art .

		When one seeks to interpret nature , not merely to state her , one may discover that a tiny speck of distant mountain overpowers all the fore - ground .

		The real perspective is the mental perspective , not the ocular .

		It is bad art to try to paint objects at their relative depth for the eye , because , in the first place , it denies the most obvious fact about painting , namely , that painting is something on a flat space of paper , silk , or canvas ; and , secondly , because thereby we are merely parroting nature , without thought , without attaining any nearer to nature 's meaning .

		It is enough to see things in perspective ; why should we trouble to paint them in that way ?

		The last , the greatest , the most difficult secret of Chinese painters is their science of color .

		There has been a great deal of talk about the beauty of color in Oriental art .

		Incidentally , a goodly portion of this refers to the later realistic work of the color-print school , which , as every student of Oriental art knows , represents the decadence .

		The astounding , paradoxical fact about Chinese color is that the great Chinese artists avoided color as much as possible .

		Their highest art was simple monochrome in black and white ; their science of color was not a science of color at all but of the relations of tone .

		To appreciate the highest Chinese art an eye trained to distinguish the most subtle grada - tions is necessary , just as to appreciate Chin - ese music the ear must catch the subtlest dis - sonances and variations of rhythm .

		It is a fact that black in painting does not necessarily represent darkness , nor does white represent light .

		The
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	painter particularly if he be of an academic cast appears to think that he need only paint in dark colors to represent shade and in light colors to represent sunlight .

		He even goes further and talks of hot and cold coloring .

		All this would appear sheer nonsense to the subtle Oriental .

		There can be glossy warm blacks or dull dirty blacks , just as there can be dull lifeless whites or singing dazzling ones .

		It is this play of illuminated or of unlit sur - faces , this grading of tone , not according to its color , but its value as light or the reverse , that is the great secret of Oriental art .

		The Japanese call it notan .

		The reason for this astonishing diversity between the
East	LOCATION	and the
West	LOCATION	, is after all , less a divergence of conception than a diver - gence of technical means .

		The Chinese and Japanese never employed oil-painting .

		All their work is done in washes of water-color on silk or paper .

		The surface of the silk or paper represents , in this case , light .

		The washes permit certain amounts of light to filter through , or block these out , as the case 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	may be .

		Oil-painting is not capable of such translucency .

		All the light in an oil-painting must fall directly on the canvas .

		Hence the old convention so puzzling to an outsider which leads Western painters to paint in a deeper range of tone than that which nature offers them , is justified .

		Take an old Chinese picture and hang it alongside an old oil-paint - ing .

		In the Chinese picture the silk has gone brown , but the colors have not altered ; in the Western picture the colors have grown dark and clogged with age , but the canvas under - neath remains the same .

		It is an interesting problem to settle : has oil-painting given us the most satisfactory , the highest form of painting possible ?

		I do not pretend to answer this question .

		Notan the gradation of tone-harmonies is possible to a certain extent even in oil - painting , though not to such a subtle extent as the Chinese offer us .

		Although the Oriental mind accepts monochrome as the highest form of art , again and again the great Chinese and Japanese have put color into their work .

		This is especially true of relig - ious paintings , which were especially meant to give richness of effect among the gorgeous splendor of temple-decoration .

		But even then color was used in a restrained way , and always in combination with notan .

		Among Western artists the quarrel still persists whether art should or should not have a moral purpose .

		This quarrel has never existed in the
East	LOCATION	.

		To the Oriental , educa - tion is just as much of the body as of the soul .

		A beautiful material thing is the outer envel - ope of a beautiful spiritual thing .

		The Oriental shuns vulgar coarseness as he shuns narrow didacticism .

		And here again he is right .

		Anything that is so presented to us as to impress us with its dignity is not only beautiful but also morally uplifting and cleansing .

		Little does it matter whether
Michelangelo	PERSON	has preached for us a sermon on the Sistine ceiling ; the dignity of the pres - entation is in itself better than any sermon , while in the case of the `` Last Judgment , '' the want of dignity makes the sermon fail .

		When
Ma Yuan	PERSON	in one of his landscapes gives us a fisherman 's hut , a few sprays of bamboo , and the outlines of immense distant moun - tains , the subject matters very little , the treatment becomes everything .

		Style , therefore , becomes the secret of art .

		Style is artistic morality ; it is more it is the means by which our consciousness of man 's mission asserts and expresses itself .

		Man differs from the rest of the animal king - dom precisely because he is concerned with the purposes of things rather than their effects .

		To explain and investigate his vague and hesitating notions of the purpose of crea - tion , he has invented speech , music , drawing , arts , and sciences .

		To draw anything is to describe it , to fix the consciousness stead - fastly upon it .

		It is to write its meaning in a hieroglyphic freer and less conventional than that the author uses , but at the same time more comprehensive .

		Hence the stress laid upon line by the Oriental artists .

		Hence the long and earnest study of style , which to their eyes is always inherent in line .

		Hence the analysis of every form of brush stroke that it is possible to make , for a brush stroke is only a line .

		Hence the alliance between good writing and good painting the join - ing together of drawing and caligraphy .

		The superiority of a great Oriental painter over a great
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	is a purely moral superior - ity .

		The Western artist may have spent all his life trying to drive home moral teachings .

		He may be richer in color , more diverse in range , more skilled in science of form , capable of bolder conceptions .

		But all this avails him nothing against the dignity with which the Oriental has invested a spray of simple bamboo .

		The dignity was not in the plant itself , but solely in the painter 's eye , mind , and hand , as these worked together to render it in line , tone , and feeling .

		Let no one suppose that I am advocating a slavish submission on the part of Western artists to Oriental doctrines and precepts .

		To create a tribe of imitators is not my aim .

		High as Chinese and Japanese art was at its zenith , it , too , suffered complete decadence through a facile and feeble eclecticism which went on producing copies of copies of copies until nothing was left .

		There is no painting worthy the name now in
China	LOCATION	; and in
Japan	LOCATION	we have nothing but a feeble and meaningless compromise between realism and the weak - ened dregs of stylistic training , or an even more preposterous aping of European methods .

		Great Chinese and Japanese art is gone as completely , as utterly as Greek ,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL Florentine , or Venetian .

		But while it is gone , there have been signs that a new development of Western art was coming .

		The movement labelled loosely Post-Impres - sionism has proved at least one thing that there is a genuine revolt against the shallow pseudo-scientific training of Western artists and art schools .

		Men like
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	,
Gauguin	LOCATION	,
Van Gogh	PERSON	, were undoubtedly men who were honestly seeking to bring about a greater con - ception of painting , based on primitive impulse and feeling rather than on scientific perspective or analysis of light .

		Whether their work was successful or not , it was right in its aim , in that it combated the stifling realism and super-culture of the nineteenth century .

		Unfortunately , the mannerisms and not the aims of these great men have borne their fruit in the cubist 's and the futurist 's efforts work which agitates the brain to no end , as Okakura pointed out , work devoid of anything but surface sensation .

		The war has ended this craze for novelty at any cost .

		And now art , if it survives at all in
Europe	LOCATION	, will probably revert to the sterile academic for - mulas of the Salon schools and the
Eoyal Academies	PERSON	, the shadow of a shadow of a shadow , or it will have to start again from the very beginning .

		America is more fortunate .

		We are escap - ing the war at a period when it is more neces - sary then ever before that we cease taking in elements from without and begin to create something like a homogeneous national devel - opment .


Paris	LOCATION	has nothng more to teach our artists .

		We have at least twenty men who can beat anything in
Paris	LOCATION	-LRB- except the work of a few veterans -RRB- on its own ground .

		But
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	can teach us these great lessons : Natural form is necessary to a pic - ture , but natural form that is not felt is unnecessary .

		Realism is bad art , but reality that is interpreted and made lofty and dig - nified by its interpretation , is great art .

		In a picture nature must appeal to our emotions just as much as she does in a scene , and not to our knowledge of cast shadows , or brush - work , or perspective , or a dozen-and-one other interesting matters for scientific not artis - tic investigation .

		Finally we must under - stand style but never degrade it , for style is the universal morality of art .

GOULD FLETCHER	ORGANIZATION	.

		POET AND PAINTER : A RENAISSANCE FANCY .

		Admiration for the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	has become a little exhausted .

		It has been almost over - studied and every bourgeois has reproduc - tions of its works of art in his parlor .

		But there is an interesting , because comparatively unstudied , side to the garden of the Renais - sance .

		I mean its Latin poets .

		And these have a particular pleasure for us because of their intimate relationship with the painters of the same period .

		We have all read of the influence which Poliziano and
Marsilio Ficino	PERSON	had upon
Sandro	PERSON	how , for instance , they guided him in those pagan frescoes he painted for Lo - renzo .

		We all know those wistful goddesses with their long delicate fingers and melan - choly eyes , and also those moulded fair lads , of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	.

		But if we are at all curious about the specifically Hellenic elements of Renaissance art , we will know other less studied painters and poets than
Sandro	PERSON	and
Poliziano	ORGANIZATION	.

		We will certainly know that strange , eccentric person
Piero di Cosimo	PERSON	, whose `` Cephalus and Procris '' in
London	LOCATION	must have seemed to many people like an un-Botticellian Botticelli wild and faun - esque ... Piero di Cosimo is not a great artist as
Sandro	PERSON	is , but he has a charm for those who have extracted the few golden grains of poetry from the dreary wastes of Latin in the `` Deliciae Poetarum Italorum . ''

		At the moment I can not recall any
Renais	PERSON	- sance Latin poet who has written an idyl on this subject .

		Yet this very picture of Ceph - alus kneeling in sadness by the side of dead Procris has a kinship with these poets , and might be taken as a symbol of their mournful ecstatic brooding over a beauty that was dead though not slain by them .

		If we take the wistful , melancholy yet beautiful face of
Sandro 's Venus	PERSON	as a symbol of the yearning of all the artists of the
Renais	PERSON	- sance for that lost Hellenic blitheness and beauty which had gone forever , it is no less apt to take this picture of
Piero	LOCATION	's as a symbol of these Latin poets in particular .

		You will find in their poetry a love of flowers , of the fairness of women , a sense of the pity and loveliness of early death , and also a faunesque feeling for fields and meadows and trees .

		Now in this picture of
Piero	LOCATION	's , Cephalus is represented as a wild woodland creature with pointed ears and a little ragged beard and shaggy legs .

		And Procris lies upon the bright meadow `` studded with flowers '' for they are painted with a meticulous yet entirely 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	artificial grace , as one might imagine a gold - smith handles jewels and in the distance is a sea-strand with tall white birds standing upon it .

		It is indeed as far distant from the Hellenism it seeks to portray as
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's terza rima differs from
Virgil	PERSON	's honeyed hexam - eters .

		For that reason it is the more original .

		And whatever one may claim for the Latin poets of the Renaissance , one can scarcely claim originality .

		They were so in love with classic models , and especially with Roman models , that nothing but the very language of these ancient poets whom they loved so much would content them as a means of expression .

		They have this much in common with the poets of the Middle Ages : they were content to vary a well-worn theme in lan - guage accepted and conventional .

		They pre - ferred to use the words of Virgil or
Ovid	LOCATION	before their own ; nothing would have shocked them so much as originality of expression .

		It was
Bembo	PERSON	's chief est praise to be called `` Cicero 's ape . ''

		Yet since these poets were a means by which the more original painters came into contact with that part of the spirit of antiquity which remains enshrined in literature , their poems are worth at least a cursory glance .

		Most of these poets belong to the late Quat - trocento and early Cinquecento .

		One of them ,
Andrea Navagero	PERSON	, a Venetian noble - man , is remembered solely because his Latin epigram on the winds was turned into French by
Du Bellay	PERSON	in his `` Vanneur du Ble aux Vents . ''

		There is another poem of his on a fountain , which has been translated into French by
Philippe Desportes	PERSON	in a sonnet which is included in most anthologies of ancient French poetry .

		Desportes 's French is less attractive than
Navagero	ORGANIZATION	's Latin , which is as delicate as the Greek it echoes .

		It has in a lesser degree something of that intense arrested loveliness of
Giorgione	ORGANIZATION	's `` Venetian Pastoral . ''

		Perhaps it is fantastic and a little exaggerated to claim so much for so obscure a poet : here is the poem in plain English prose : The fountain is cold and there is no water more healing .

		The margin is green with fine grass and the alders ward off the sunlight with many-leaved boughs .

		The burning sun hangs in mid-Heaven and the parched meads glare under his light .

		Stay , wayfarer , since you are heated by the noon sunshine and your languid feet can bear you no further .

		Here you may rest from your weariness , and grow cool in the wind and the green shadows , and ease your thirst with the limpid water .

		Is there not De generous to the forgotten poet !

		something in that of `` life touching lips with immortality '' ?

		Just now , in speaking of
Piero	ORGANIZATION	's `` Cephalus and Procris , '' I mentioned that tenderness for early death which is one of the qualities of Renaissance artists whether painters or poets .

		Just as the painters and sculptors dwelt on this motive in many `` pietas '' and youthful figures upon tombs , so the poets lamented in Ovidian Latin the bitter fate of Adonis and the fall of Hylas like a bright star from Heaven !

		It must be admitted that the poignancy and sincerity of the painters and sculptors leave the poets far behind on the dusty paths of conventionality .

		But here is a little poem by a Quattrocento poet Giovanni Pontano : THE TOMB OF His LITTLE DAUGHTER LUCIA .

		You leave your father in darkness , my
Lucia	LOCATION	; from light to darkness , little daughter , you are taken .

		But yet you are not taken into darkness ; you leave darkness behind you , and you shine in the sun .

		I see you , little daughter , in the Heavens .

		Do you see me ?

		Or do I comfort myself with foolish pre - texts ?

		Only this grave of yours I touch , little daughter ; no life is left in this poor dust .

		Yet if your soul still lives I should think you happy , for you died young .

		And we drag out our life through light and dark - ness .

		Was it for this alone , little daughter , you were born ?

		This is genuine , not a mere copy of some Greek or Latin poet 's emotion , for
Pontano	PERSON	did actually lose a daughter by death .

		And in the despair which sees nothing but the too palpable grave and scarcely dares to hope for the continuance of life in the disembodied spirit , there is a sentiment which is at once common to the Greeks and to ourselves .

		There is the same despair in
Moschus	LOCATION	's `` Lament for Bion '' and in
Swinburne	LOCATION	's `` Ave atque Vale . ''

		Pontano is , of course , much less than these poets , but the same emotion is pictorially imaged in
Piero	LOCATION	's `` Cephalus and Procris , '' and if we are to do justice to
Pontano	LOCATION	, we must think of him as inspiring Piero rather than as expressing himself com - pletely and inevitably .

		One more picture and one more poem though in this case the poem must have been written long after the picture was painted .

		The poet is
Cornelio Amaltheo	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the painter is Piero di Cosimo .

		If you wander into that side gallery of the
Louvre	LOCATION	which contains many Italian `` primitives , '' among them Angelico 's famous `` Coronation of the Virgin , '' you will find in a corner two small oil panels attributed to
Piero	LOCATION	.

		They are far beneath the level of his work in
London	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	but they have something of his quaint spirit .

		They represent the `` Marriage of Peleus and Thetis . ''

		In the first , Proteus is seen with sea maidens and Tritons plunging
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL through the waves toward a curved white sand shore .

		The air is brilliant with dawn and the bodies of the white Nereids gleam gracefully through the water beaten into foam by the strong limbs of Tritons and sea mon - sters .

		This is the poem :
Golden Aurora	LOCATION	had drawn away the shadows ; she had hidden the falling stars with the rose-red glow of her face .

		Then the sun , lifting his chariot from the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	foam , revealed the great world with his lustrous torch .

		Suddenly Proteus rose from the
Adriatic	LOCATION	waves ; and then came
Cymothea	LOCATION	, shaking free her yellow hair ,
Hyale	PERSON	,
Arethusa	ORGANIZATION	, white of arm Nereids mar - velling at the poet .

		Like the wind upon the shore they plucked dark berries , pale violets and soft hyacinths ; and then they gathered about him beseeching his song .

		And Proteus , sitting among them , bade the seas calm their high murmur and the winds and Aeolus their sounding blasts .

		At his bidding the waters were still and the winds of

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		M.
Jean Monne	PERSON	, one of the most distin - guished Felibristes of
Provence	LOCATION	, has died recently at an advanced age .

		My friend ,
M. Charles Ratier	PERSON	, of Agen , an equally distin - guished Felibriste of the
Languedoc	LOCATION	region of
France	LOCATION	, sends me these interesting notes on this poet in particular and on Felibrisime in general : Monn6 was an exceedingly amiable companion as well as a personality quite to the fore in the move - ment of the southern literary Eenaissance .

		He had been a Felibrige Majoral since
1881	DATE	, in which year he was awarded the Cigalo de Roussihoun -LRB- the
Cigale de Koussillon	ORGANIZATION	, the last name being that of
Monne	ORGANIZATION	's native province , and the first , grasshopper , in English , I believe -RRB- .

		I should explain that instead of being titularies , as at the French Academy , of a numbered chair , the Majoraux , who form our
Southern Academy	ORGANIZATION	, or
Aeademie Meridionale	ORGANIZATION	, receive a gold cigale bear - ing the name of either a little southern region , river , or mountain ; and these
Majoraux	PERSON	are generally designated by the name of their cigale .

		Thus , in
Felibrige	LOCATION	, I am known as the Cigalo de la Garono , Agen being situated on the Garonne river .

		Monne was for some time syndic of the
Mainte	PERSON	- nance , the title of our regional Felibrige associations , of
Provence	LOCATION	and edited a monthly , which he had founded , called ``
Lou Felibrige	PERSON	, '' which for many years was the official organ of our ideas and our movement .

		As a poet , he published several volumes and a mass of fugitive pieces scattered through the pages of our reviews , newspapers , and almanacs .

		He had announced his intention of soon publishing a '' Dictionnaire de Eimes Provencal , '' and he has left in manuscript a volume of verse .

		All his writings are in the Rhodanien , or
Rhone	LOCATION	, Provencal dialect , that used by
Mistral	LOCATION	; which fact is all the more interest - ing when one remembers that Provencal was not the maternal dialect of Monne , who was born at
Perpig	LOCATION	- nan , whose Roussillonnais is very closely allied to Catalan .

		But he early abandoned his mother tongue in favor of
Mistral	ORGANIZATION	's , which he knew and handled in a remarkable manner , in the hope , which he enter - tained for a long time , that it would be possible to fix in a single literary dialect the southern languages ; and this unique dialect he held should be that in which was written `` Mireille '' and the other master - pieces of
Mistral	LOCATION	.

		During many years this tendency was very strong among my .

		Provencal confreres , whose amour-propre was however rather exasperating at times .

		Through my efforts , begun some thirty years ago , we succeeded finally in securing equal recogni - tion , as instruments of literary expression , for each of our dialects .

		Another French writer , dead for the moment to the literary world , has , however , been resuscitated for an instant .

		The second volume of Professor
Andre Koszul	PERSON	's `` Anthol - ogie de la Litterature Anglaise '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Delagrave , 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , which was stopped by the war , is just out .

		In a letter to THE DIAL more than a year ago , I spoke at some length of this admirable work and gave some extracts from the second volume , then partly in proof and partly in manuscript .

		I now speak of it again mainly to give news of the learned and unfortunate author .

		At the beginning of
August , 1914	DATE	, when Professor
Koszul	PERSON	sud - denly left the Sorbonne for the entrenched camp of
Maubeuge	LOCATION	as a military interpreter , the proof-reading of this book had been scarcely begun .

		This task has now been per - formed by the author 's friend , Professor
Theodore Gamier	PERSON	, of the
Paris Lycee Henri IV.	ORGANIZATION	, who ,
Mme. Koszul	ORGANIZATION	informs me , has seen the volume through the press .

		The head of the English department of
the University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, my friend Professor
Emile Legouis	PERSON	, the distinguished French authority on Words - worth , writes me as follows about our com - mon friend : I am delighted to hear of your intention to speak of Koszul and his book .

		The news will do him good in his prison .

		Our poor friend was captured at
Maubeuge	LOCATION	in
the first days of September , 1914	DATE	, dur - ing the German onrush towards
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He was first sent to the Gefangenlager at
Wiinsdorf	LOCATION	near
Zossen	LOCATION	, in
Brandenburg	LOCATION	, then to Chemnitz-Ebersdorf , and lastly to Gross-Poritsch , in
Saxony	LOCATION	.

		From the scanty cards he has sent me , I infer his health has not been much impaired .

		He has fought against despon - dency by devoting himself to his illiterate co-prisoners for whose benefit he had a class while he was at
Chemnitz	LOCATION	.

		For your notice of his book you may wish to remember that at the university ,
Koszul	PERSON	sat under
Auguste Angellier	PERSON	, our foremost English scholar , whose thesis on
Robert Burns	PERSON	is widely known in the learned world .

		Angellier , who was also one of our best poets , has often told me that he considered Koszul the most distinguished student he ever had .

		Koszul stood first in the severe competitive examina - tion which we call agregatlon d'anglais .

		For his doctorate , he offered a fine thesis on `` La
Jeunesse de Shelley	PERSON	, '' the merit of which is well known .

		Later , he was intrusted by a
London	LOCATION	publisher with the editing and the prefaces of a two-volume edition of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's poems , a rare homage paid to a foreign - 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	writer .

		He is so modest that he rather hides than shows off his worth .

		The following paragraph is also interesting especially when it is known that the writer 's two sons `` are fighting on the banks of the
Somme	LOCATION	, in the most exposed places '' : What effect this war is to have on our university life , I can only conjecture : It will surely relax the hold of German erudition which threatened to wrench our intellect from its natural bent .

		We were fast losing our French characteristics and I now hope they will tend to revive with great distinctness .

		There is no fear now of their being spoilt by an excess of flippancy .

		But the greatest change I am looking forward to is the broad opening of our French univer - sities to foreign students , chiefly to your countrymen .

		We have been till now passive and inert , never mak - ing any effort to draw to our lecture-rooms a part of the numerous cosmopolitan clientele that yearly resorted to the German universities , and afterwards did most to spread German influence and prestige over the world .

		Our disinterestedness , in which there was too much apathy , ought now to make room for an appeal to those whose ingenuous faith in the German ideal has been shaken by recent events .

		There have been many other examples since the
summer of 1914	DATE	that the bitterness occasioned by this war has unfortuntely but perfectly justifiably penetrated the usually serene walks of European scholarship .

		Here is a fresh one .

		The learned Professor
Jacques Flach	PERSON	, of the
French Institute	ORGANIZATION	and the
College of France	ORGANIZATION	, sends me a pamphlet entitled '' Beyendication contre 1 ` Allemagne '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Alphonse Picard	PERSON	, 50 centimes -RRB- , which is an attempt to prove , and a very successful one , it seems to me , that the mediaeval poem about
Gauthier	PERSON	d'Aquitaine , `` Waltharius , '' is not to be attributed to German but to French culture , notwithstanding that
Gaston Paris	PERSON	put it the other way .

		The closing lines of Professor
Flach	PERSON	's strong argument well illus - trate what I said at the beginning of this paragraph : The poem of
Gauthier	PERSON	d'Aquitaine has been claimed by
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Because of the paucity of her epics ,
Germany	LOCATION	has tried to enrich herself at our expense by appropriating our goods , and by so doing she has remained faithful to her traditions , which have always impelled her and are still impelling her to try and seize upon the riches of other peoples .

		In revenge , an attempt is now being made on the French side to rob
Germany	LOCATION	of one of her literary institutions .

		Since the war broke out I have made three ineffectual attempts to get news as to how the `` Tauchnitz Edition of British and American Authors '' is getting on .

		In the meanwhile ,
M. Louis Conard	PERSON	, 17
Boule	PERSON	- vard de la
Madeleine	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, has started a very strong rival , `` The Standard Collection of British and American Authors , '' whose aim is `` to replace the Leipsic Tauchnitz Edition . ''

		On this subject , he writes me as follows : It took me six months to gather in the fold a certain number of authors formerly included in the
Tauchnitz Edition	ORGANIZATION	.

		I began in
1915	DATE	, and on the
6th of July	DATE	, the same year , I started my Collection with `` Bealby , '' by
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		Since then the number of authors who have signed contracts with me for the duration of the war and for five years after its termination has reached 90 per cent of the total number of authors , alive and available , included in the last Tauchnitz catalogue , that for
July , 1914	DATE	.

		Two works are published monthly and this will be increased to one a week as soon as hostilities cease .

		Tauchnitz had no permanent contracts with the authors , but made a separate agreement for each volume ; so they had not to break their word to come to us .

		The sales are satisfactory , the neutral and allied countries sending important orders .

		The Tauchnitz people , we are told , are publishing occa - sional books in their continental edition , not novels but books on the war , written in English by Germans Among the American writers who have joined the
Standard	ORGANIZATION	collection are
Amelie Kives	PERSON	, Booth Tarking - ton ,
Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	,
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	, Mrs.
A. M. Williamson	PERSON	,
Baroness von Hutten	PERSON	, and
Elizabeth Eobins	PERSON	.

		Even the French musical world has turned on the Fatherland .

		`` Germanophilie '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Dorbon , 1 fr .

		50 -RRB- , by the well-known French composer Saint-Saens , is a most violent diatribe against
Germany	LOCATION	in general and German music and musicians , especially
Wagner	PERSON	, in particular .

		The little book even bears on the present political situation in
Europe	LOCATION	by showing what an intense hatred for
Germany	LOCATION	now exists in
France	LOCATION	, a hatred , it should be noted , which had almost wholly dis - appeared but which this war has made stronger than ever before .

		But
M. Saint-Saens	PERSON	, who seems just now to be in a very bellicose state of mind , is rather neutral in his dislikes .

		Having given
Wagner	PERSON	harsh treatment , he turns toward the Allies and treats Shakespeare in much the same fashion in - an article which appeared in a recent number of the `` Renaissance . ''

		I have not seen this article but the author sends me this resume of the position which he takes in it : The question is being agitated in
Paris	LOCATION	of founding a
Shakespeare Society	ORGANIZATION	on the pretext that after the war a new art will be needed !

		I took the liberty of saying that it would be better for French modern authors and the living ones , too , to give their pieces ; and I also took the liberty of saying that it was only possible , for several reasons , to give adaptations of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, which disfigured his work .

		I further - more ventured to declare that he was more enjoyable in the reading than on the stage .

		Nor can the European neutral nations wholly escape the contagion .

		Their citizens are all , one by one , `` taking sides . ''

		One of the last lectures delivered in
Switzerland	LOCATION	by the lamented
Verhaeren	PERSON	was that given in
October	DATE	at
Berne	LOCATION	, on `` La Jeune Belgique Litteraire , '' and not the least notable feature of the evening was the presence in a con - spicuous seat , of
Carl Spitteler	PERSON	, the leading poet of German
Switzerland	LOCATION	, who early in the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 11 war came out squarely against Prussianized
Germany	LOCATION	.

		His open adhesion to the cause of the Allies has been , of course , warmly received in
France	LOCATION	.

		M. Spitteler has just sent me a pamphlet , `` Unser Schweizer Standpunkt '' -LRB-
Zurich	LOCATION	:
Rascher	PERSON	, 1 fr . -RRB-

		, which contains a speech delivered in the
December	DATE	following ' the outbreak of the war , where we see the beginning of this evolution .

		Neutral opinion will be still more tried when the time comes for making peace , and it will be found that one of the chief bones of contention in the congress will be the
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	PERSON	question .

		Many books have been , and are being , written on the subject , and among them two or three have lately come to my attention in a particular way .

		Senator
Georges Clemenceau	PERSON	sends me `` La
France	LOCATION	devant 1 ` Allemagne '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Payot , 5 frs . -RRB-

		, a volume of the former Prime Min - ister 's speeches and newspaper articles , espe - cially the latter , all bearing on Franco-Ger - man relations during the past ten years .

		Besides showing in a convincing way how little
France	LOCATION	wanted war with
Germany	LOCATION	, but how much she expected it , or , to put it another way , how much this astute statesman expected it , this able book contains several notable pages throwing light on the French point of view and the French mind concerning this burning
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	problem .

		The same thing is true of `` A Travers la
France	LOCATION	en Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Fischbacher	PERSON	, 1 fr . -RRB-

		, by
M. Benjamin Vallotton	PERSON	, the well - known Swiss man of letters , now busy on relief work , he tells me .

		At the close of this book , which is written in a fine style and is instructive at the same time , is a long chapter on
Alsace	LOCATION	, full of new ideas and suggestions , the conclusion being that the country should be returned to
France	LOCATION	.

		This chapter is really the basis of
M. Vallotton	PERSON	's charming serial , `` On Changerait plutot le
Coeur de Place	ORGANIZATION	, '' this title alone tells the whole story , which ends in the number of the `` Revue des Deux Mondes '' for
December 1	DATE	, and which presents , this time in the guise of fiction , the point of view of
France	LOCATION	, as I well know it , as well as that of a large portion of the inhabitants of
Alsace	LOCATION	, according to
M. Vallotton	PERSON	.

		What this point of view is , comes out in this rather strange and amusing reflection put into the mouth of one of the characters of the tale : `` Saint
Peter	PERSON	gives some men two hearts and other men two stomachs .

		The first is the case with the Alsatians , one heart for
Alsace	LOCATION	and one for
France	LOCATION	.

		The others , with no heart and two stomachs , are sent over the Rhine . ''

		mother 's well-known pseudonym , who died to
France	LOCATION	, is the final conclusion of one of the ablest presentations I have seen of who is responsible for the present war `` La Respon - sibilite de la Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Bloud & Gay	ORGANIZATION	, 60 centimes -RRB- , by Senator
Tommaso Tittoni	PERSON	, who has recently retired from the Italian embassy at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He is a diplomat , a politi - cian , and a journalist , one of the most prac - tical , clear-headed public men in
Europe	LOCATION	at this time , as you quickly discover in even the briefest conversation with him ; and ` here is what he says in this instructive little collec - tion of his speeches made during the present crisis : `` All the nationalities who have endured the agony of foreign domination now await the hour of liberation , whose first strokes have already sounded . ''

		This same determined spirit is strongly presented in
Paul Margueritte	PERSON	's latest novel , `` L'Embusque '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Flammarion , 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , a severe arraignment of French `` slackers , '' who , I am happy to say , are the grand exception in
France	LOCATION	.

		In sending me his book , the author writes : `` After over two years of war and so many heroic examples , there are strapping fellows who , like Panurge , are ` very much afraid of blows . '

		But the energetic action of the new government is bringing them down to a minimum . ''

		But let me close with a paragraph quite free from the clash of arms .

		In the `` Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	'' of
September 1	DATE	, appears an article entitled `` Souvenirs of Nohant , '' by
Aurore Sand	PERSON	, the granddaughter of the great French novelist personal recollections of the famous old home in
Berry	LOCATION	.

		She informs me that she has quite a budget of unpublished material of her grandmother `` letters on literature and life , fragments of a diary , articles on ideas and politics , etc. '' The last time I met
Aurore Lauth	PERSON	this is her married name , her husband being a talented French artist and an Alsatian , living at ease in a spacious
Paris	LOCATION	hotel we sat at table also with her sister , Mme.
Gabrielle Palazzi	PERSON	Sand , both sisters , have always religiously preserved their mother 's well-known pseudonym , who died a few years ago .

		Then George Sand 's pub - lisher , who used to drive sharp bargains with rising young authors
Renan	PERSON	was also one of his victims in this respect would not permit Aurore to dispose of these papers at her will .

		But expiring copyright or greater generosity on the part of the successors in the house , now seem to have removed these diffi - culties , and the orphaned waifs of George Sand 's brain are at present offered to him who will buy them .

STANTON	PERSON	.


December 30 , 1916	DATE	.

		12 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	CASUAL COMMENT .

		MUTATIONS OF POPULAR TASTE IN EPHEMERAL LITERATURE are lightly touched upon by the veteran journalist and dramatic critic , Mr.
H. G. Hibbert	PERSON	, in his `` Fifty Years of a Londoner 's Life , '' one of the most entertain - ing books of its kind that the present season has produced .

		He informs us , after `` a few fascinated hours spent with the Press Direct - ory , '' that `` upward of fifty periodical pub - lications have quietly slipped away during the past eighteen months . ''

		What the war has had to do with most of these disappear - ances is obvious .

		Somewhat more surprising is the following : `` It is conceivable that many of the newspaper proprietors who bowed to the pressure of the war accepted their fate gladly .

		For the percentage of newspapers that show a handsome profit - is very small ; of newspapers that just pay , modest in its proportions ; and of newspapers that steadily deplete the banking accounts of their infat - uated owners , immense .

		Millions must have sunk in the wreckage of journalism .

		As I write , an historic newspaper is in the market once more .

		It has steadily lost twelve thou - sand pounds a year these many years .

		I wonder if it has ever paid . ''

		Another class of literature that suffers the mutations of fortune is the popular `` library '' or series , often devoted to fiction , but not seldom inclu - sive of more serious works also .

		The writer mentions the once well-known ``
Morley	PERSON	's Universal Library , '' forerunner of `` Every - man 's Library , '' and he asks whether the `` Cottage Library '' still exists .

		Here in
America	LOCATION	we long had our `` Franklin Square Library , '' and perhaps should still have it if it had chosen a more attractive shape and better print .

		In the matter of popular series , how pleasant our memories of the `` Leisure Hour Series '' and the `` No Name Series '' !

		Why ca n't these good things go on forever ?

		A COSTLY BIT OP REALISM was that little courtroom scene in Mr.
George Bronson	PERSON	-
Howard	PERSON	's novel , `` God 's Man , '' which fur - nished material for a libel suit that has resulted in favor of the plaintiff , Magistrate
Corrigan	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, to the extent of
$ 35,000	MONEY	in damages .

		Of course an appeal has been made , and the probabilities are that the publishers , whose protestations of innocence there is no reason to question , will at least escape the payment of so excessive a sum .

		Amid the pitfalls lying in wait for even the wariest publisher , this liability of inadver - tently hurting the feelings of some wholly unknown person in the millions of possible readers is not the least formidable .

		So small a thing as a fictitious name , chosen at random , may cause woe unutterable to both author and publisher , as has been proved more than once .

		In this instance the real name was disguised , and the author , through absence in
California	LOCATION	, escaped legal summons ; but the unfortunate firm that issued the book is sternly reminded by the court that a publisher is responsible for his wares , whether they be fiction or phil - osophy or ichthyology or hermeneutics , and that if the alleged reference to
Magistrate Corrigan	ORGANIZATION	is recognizable by sensible persons acquainted with that gentleman , the party whose imprint appears on the title-page must bear the brunt of the aforesaid magistrate 's displeasure .

		Such is the law .

		Fiat justitia , mat coelum .

		THE SPECIALTY BOOKSHOP makes its appear - ance , very naturally , in an age of specializa - tion .

		Bookselling has of course always tended more or less to some degree of specialization in the kind of literature handled , but it remained for the twentieth century to bring forth in well-developed form the woman 's bookshop and the juvenile bookshop .

		At the corner of
Lexington Avenue	LOCATION	and 52d Street ,
New York	LOCATION	, there has been opened , under the direction of the publishing department of the
National Board	ORGANIZATION	of the
Y. W. C. A.	PERSON	, a shop planned by women , stocked with books for women , and run by a woman ,
Miss G. L. Esten	PERSON	.

		The enterprise is partly an outgrowth of the mail-order business in books that
the Association	ORGANIZATION	has long conducted , using the `` Association Monthly '' as a medium of pub - licity and sending out book-exhibits to Asso - ciation conferences throughout the country .

		But it is hoped that the shop will attract much local custom in addition to its more wide-spread and scattered patronage .

		A few weeks before this undertaking was started there was opened in
Boston	LOCATION	, at 264 Boylston Street , by the Women 's Educational and
Industrial Union	ORGANIZATION	, a bookshop for children from the picture-book age to serious-minded adolescence .

		In connection with its regular business the shop will conduct three series of six story-hours each for three classes of chil - dren , from five to seven years of age , between seven and ten , and from ten to fif - teen .

		Tickets for each course are offered at five dollars , and the story-telling will begin
January 16	DATE	.

		Four story-hours for adults are also planned .

		The inference is that these will be rather for instruction in story-telling than for amusement .

		The juvenile bookshop is not exactly a new thing in the book business , as
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 13 a glance at the preface of the
Boston	LOCATION	book - shop 's interesting catalogue will show .

		But it is safe to say that no earlier attempt to cap - ture the juvenile trade can be compared with the present in skilful planning and breadth of scope .

		Miss
Caroline M. Hewins	PERSON	, librarian at
Hartford	LOCATION	, writes the aforementioned preface , and the catalogue may be had for
ten cents	MONEY	.

		MAGAZINES MADE TO SELL evoke some deserved reprobation from the
Pratt Institute Free Library	ORGANIZATION	, which says , in its current record of annual achievement : `` No closer scrutiny is exercised in the selection of books to be incorporated into the
Library	ORGANIZATION	's collec - tion for the preservation of its character , than is given to the choice of periodicals that shall make our Beading Room a resort both delightful and improving for those who come to a library for introduction to current magazine literature .

		It is a sad commentary on the times that so often American period - icals do not hesitate to forsake the reputations and traditions that have been synonymous with their titles , to yield easily to deprecia - tion literary , artistic , and ethical , and to sacrifice their standing with those who would be their friends , in order to pursue the ignis fatuus reputation of the ` best seller . ' '

		Limitations of space forbid further verbatim reproduction of the writer 's wealth of phrase .

		Suffice it to say that regret is expressed at the unworthy pursuit of `` news-stand notoriety '' on the part of periodicals that ought to know better , and that there is so much ignoble striv - ing for `` snappy '' stories , `` racy '' or `` spicy '' humor , and `` compromising '' plots .

		The dig - nity of the reading room at the
Pratt Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute Library is maintained at the cost of frequent expurgations of the periodical-list .

		Unluckily the average buyer is less scrupu - lous ... THE VOCABULARY OF CHILDHOOD offers one of the most interesting fields for philological research .

		As DIAL readers already know , Professor
Thomas Percival Beyer	PERSON	has made a study of his own little boy 's increasing com - mand of English from earliest infancy .

		The results of observations covering the child 's first two years were published in `` The Edu - cational Review , '' and were also circulated separately .

		These results were epitomized and commented on in these columns at the time of publication .

		Now there comes a fur - ther report from Professor
Beyer	PERSON	, who has noted the words acquired by his son in his third year .

		To the 771 words of the earlier report are added
1297	DATE	of subsequent acquisi - tion ; so that the three-year-old boy was found to be master of
2068	DATE	`` verbal symbols . ''

		But thirteen of these are discarded as belonging 1 to `` the defunct language of infancy , '' leaving a net total of
2055	DATE	.

		This is surely a large vocabulary for so young a child , and the natural inference is that
Baby Beyer	PERSON	is some - thing of a prodigy , though his father protests to the contrary as any modest and sensible father ought to .

		Among the words gained in the third year , attention is arrested by terms like the following : astray , christened , dental dope , electricity , embroider , kewpie -LRB- what - ever it may mean -RRB- , mathematics , mother-in - law , pardon , parents , refrigerator , uncom - fortable , and -LRB- last but not least -RRB- vocabulary .

		Certainly the fact of the father 's being a college professor with an interest in his boy 's `` vocabulary '' must count for something in the daily accessions to that vocabulary .

		NORWICH 'S HISTORIC LIBRARY is preparing to celebrate an anniversary of some impor - tance , and its librarian , Mr.
George A. Stephen	PERSON	, is writing an account of the insti - tution of which he is the head .

		`` Three Cen - turies of a City Library '' will be its title from which it now becomes plain that Nor - wich ,
England	LOCATION	, rather than
Norwich	LOCATION	, Con - necticut , is here referred to .

		It was as early as
1608	DATE	that this old town established what might be called a public library , however unworthy of the name according to present standards .

		At any rate , it was one of the earliest towns to make any sort of provision for readers , and it was the very first to adopt the Public Library Act of
1850	DATE	.

		Next
March	DATE	it is to celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the opening of the
Norwich Public Library	ORGANIZATION	the free library in its modern form .

		And thus we have still another item of interest to associate with the birthplace of
James	PERSON	and
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	and the town enriched also with certain memories of a very different sort of genius ,
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	.

		AN AMUSING INSTANCE OF METATHESIS is cited anew in one of the books of the season .

		As a rule , this form of play upon words , whether intentional or inadvertent , ranks but little higher than the pun .

		Self-respect for - bids unrestrained mirth at the anecdote , old enough by this time , of the indignant church - goer who , finding his accustomed place filled by a stranger , thus remonstrated with him : `` Sir , are you aware that you are occupewing my pie ? ''

		With greater heartiness we may enjoy the story related by Mr.
T. H. S. Escott	PERSON	in his `` Great Victorians . ''

		The sixth son of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	, a barrister of ready wit and 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	well versed in his father 's writings , once found himself pitted against a legal opponent named
Willis	PERSON	, who irritated him and the court by indulgence in a repeated and appar - ently preventable little cough .

		At last Mr.
Dickens	PERSON	's patience became exhausted and he quietly remarked : `` An illustrious relative of mine has immortalized the words , ` Barkis is willing ' ; perhaps I may be allowed in present circumstances to say , `
Willis	PERSON	is barking . ' ''

		Old as this story is , it ought to bear repeating as perhaps the neatest instance on record of what , for lack of a better name , we may call by the learned term of the grammarians , metathesis .

		ONE WAY TO MOVE A LIBRARY from an old to a new building comes to public notice in connection with the opening of the lately - completed library building at
West Spring	LOCATION	- field ,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		The method commends itself both on the score of economy and as a means of swelling the yearly circulation statistics .

		A few days before the opening occurred , and before the old library was closed to visitors and given over to the force of movers , priv - ileges to card-holders were extended so as to allow the drawing of any desired number of volumes , these volumes to be returned in due order to the new building .

		How many availed themselves of this enlarged license , or how many books were thus moved without cost to the community , has not been reported ; but given a proper public spirit combined with a love of books and reading , the money-saving result in any such instance ought to be appreciable .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		WARNING THE AMATEUR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		If the American market for old-world art col - lections is a fair gauge , neither the high cost of the necessaries of life , nor this country 's contribu - tions for the relief of war victims abroad , have noticeably weakened the long purses of the
United States	LOCATION	, as yet .

		Large foreign loans and the expense of our own modest armaments may accomplish the feat hereafter .

		In the meantime , if you are a Missourian , come to
New York	LOCATION	and watch the way money passes from hand to hand at a good metro - politan art sale .

		Pricing ermines and sables at Altaian 's , or a little venture in diamonds at
Tiffany	ORGANIZATION	's , will open your prairie-bred eyes no wider .

		The
American Art Association	ORGANIZATION	's disposal of two rich cabinets of old Italian art of every kind , for Professor
Volpi	PERSON	of
Florence	LOCATION	, just before Thanks - giving , was altogether the best public art sale I have witnessed in many months .

		Seven daytime sessions and one evening rally in the pleasant ball - room of the Plaza Hotel were needed to scatter the twelve hundred and odd numbers of his two astonishingly fine and varied collections from the
Villa Pia	ORGANIZATION	and the
Palazzo Davanzati	ORGANIZATION	.

		The eight sessions collectively yielded very close to a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		The Italian government is understood to have accorded an export license for the removal of so large a group of old-time treasures , in one body , partly on account of the passive state of the domestic market at this time , and more particularly in view of its late owner 's provision for the early transfer of the Palazzo Davanzati itself to the nation .

		The other material , added to that from the
Davanzati	PERSON	house at
Florence	LOCATION	, composed the current stock of Professor
Volpi	PERSON	's commercial establishment .

		The city of
Florence	LOCATION	much regrets to see the historic mansion which
Volpi	PERSON	's good judgment and enterprise but lately rescued from its long dis - figurement and oblivion , by a masterly restoration of the building to its antique physiognomy from cellar to roof , denuded once more of its appropriate furnishings .

		Since the Tuscan capital stands in singular need of a public garde-meuble , I dare to hope the municipality will try to restock the stripped halls and chambers with another revival of a foretime patrician interior .

		The Sangiorgios of
Rome	LOCATION	, the redoubtable
Wertheimer	PERSON	, or our late Mr.
Altman	PERSON	could not have bettered
Volpi	PERSON	's han - dling of the problem .

		To judge it very soberly , however , his installa - tion resembled some of our own neo-colonial interiors by pushing the art cabinet features too far .

		The passionate pilgrim to
Italy	LOCATION	would rather see the Palazzo Davanzati fitted out so that the
Davanzatis	PERSON	might recognize it .

		Prosperous and well-bred burgesses of the Renaissance town , as those people were for many generations , I fail to visualize their actual living rooms hung with fifty paintings by renowned Italian masters and Netherlanders , which span the centuries from `` Giotto -LRB- School of -RRB- '' and
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	to the Vene - tians of
Galuppi	ORGANIZATION	's age , like wooden beads on a score-wire .

		Who could resist the colorful precision of a `` Game of Football '' attributed to
Bronzino	ORGANIZATION	, or two exquisitely paint-spotty , small studies of young male and female heads by
Tiepolo	ORGANIZATION	, if he owned a historic house in
Florence	LOCATION	to display them in ?

		Other classes from the two collections showed a similar redundancy of number , variety , and high quality , which compels equal scantness of printed reference .

		One hundred and sixty-eight numbers , comprising carved ivories , classical and Italian old bronzes , wood , stucco , and terra-cotta sculp - tures , and decorated Italian maiolicas , fetched roughly one hundred and
eighty-six thousand dollars	MONEY	on the first afternoon .

		Antonio
Rizzo	PERSON	's painted wooden statue of
St. Sebastian	ORGANIZATION	glared by its absence , owing to some hitch in conveying it ashore ; but there were other magnets a-plenty .

		Accustomed as I am to the often exaggerated timidities of European connoisseurs and buyers , I can not help admiring the boyish zeal and cour - age of
New York	LOCATION	's four hundred , or four thou -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 15 sand , as I watch them at art auctions .

		There are no refusals .

		Certainly a more close-fisted public , or one of greater shyness on the delicate problem of authenticity , might have given a less joyous welcome to so many unweathered and unblemished , polychrome busts and stucco reliefs attributed to the best schools and periods of Florentine sculp - ture .

		A supposed Italian authority 's printed asser - tion about one strange treasure astray in good company , that `` its originality transcends every artistic tradition , and its beauty has never been exceeded , '' was apparently accepted at face value in
Volpi	LOCATION	's sale catalogue .

		It compassed the flota - tion of an alleged bronze portrait figurine of the Greek poetess Sappho .

		Of genuine bronze , nicely oxidized , and fairly agreeable to look at , the statuette in question most unquestionably was , albeit not of IV century B. C. workmanship , or a true likeness of
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, or Greek .

		So far as it recalled any school , it was that of the
XIX	ORGANIZATION	century French clock decorators .

		Same stage costume a I ` antique ; same lank Empire body and shoulders supporting a tiny head dolled up d la grecque ; same blocky-hem draperies ; same old frontal pyramid by way of academic composition .

		This manifestly unantique creation found an eager taker at the modest figure of
$ 15,000	MONEY	.

		THE ARTIST AS SUPERMAN THE CREATIVE WILL : Studies in the Philosophy and the Syntax of Esthetics .

		By
Willard Hunt	PERSON	- ington
Wright	PERSON	.

		-LRB-

		The aesthetic of mass , which has been variously developed by
Guyau	LOCATION	,
Hildebrandt	PERSON	,
Lipps	PERSON	, and
Berenson	PERSON	, receives its most effect - ive literary presentation in this new book .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	reduces the matter to 251 num - bered paragraphs , which are often brief and aphoristic , and more rarely assume the form of a short essay .

		His style has pulse and drive enough to carry along a good deal that is crabbed in vocabulary .

		He is always honest and clear , and but seldom careless .

		His robust intellectualism deserves admiration , however much his particular theories may provoke dissent .

		To read him is to sharpen one 's own thinking .

		Physiology is the basis of this aesthetic .

		`` Art , in all of its manifestations , is , in its final analysis , an interpretation of the laws of bodily rhythm and movement . ''

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	gets over the difficulty of discriminat - ing ordinary expression from artistic expres - sion , by declaring that the difference is merely one of organization and completeness .

		All expression grows out of a combination of will , intellect , and emotion .

		`` In aesthetic expres - sion , however , each of these three elements plays an equal part : there is a coordination and balance of all the functions of mentation .

		The theme is chosen by the emotion ; the intellect determines the rhythm or construc - tion , and the will supplies the power of organization . ''

		It is this active complicity of all our processes of thinking that makes the experience of art more complete and satisfy - ing than the experience of nature .

		Art is merely the creation of form .

		`` Colors either advance or retreat from the eye ; and notes either advance or retreat from the ear .

		At once there is the implica - tion of a spatial dimension which is a quality of form . ''

		Smell and touch , considered alone , have no aesthetic value , lacking spatial impli - cation ; hence they gain aesthetic quality only through association with pleasures of sound and hearing .

		All art is sharply divided into an inferior feminine sort , of which
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's `` Spring '' is a capital example , which is grounded and completed in emotion and realized in two di - mensions only ; and a superior masculine art , with
Michelangelo	PERSON	as its type , in which the emotion has been fully transmuted into form - ing mind and creative will : such masculine art is actively tri-dimensional .

		The kind of form in which the will to create deals is not 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	`` objective or quantitative '' the form of things we know in ordinary life but sub - jective .

		It is symbol and expression of the mental complex of creation .

		There is that form which has no counterpart in actual life .

		It is without measurable dimensions , its size being relative to the other forms about it .

		It does not represent any specific object with which we are familiar ; we simply feel its tactility qual - itatively .

		All great works of art contain this type of form , whether it is presented abstractly or through recognizable phenomena ; in the latter case the objects cease to exist as objects , and create in us an emotion of form as in contradistinction to a recognition of form .

		Later Mr.
Wright	PERSON	says : `` The Artist visual - izes nature 's forces and the effects of these forces , and then translates them , dynamically organized , into concrete expression . ''

		This is , I hope , a fair , if necessarily succinct state - ment of the essentials of Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's aes - thetic .

		I can not within the allotted space argue each point .

		Instead I shall only try to indicate what points seem especially con - testable .

		One may admit that art often has spatial implications , but Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's axiom that two sounds or two colors will produce an inferential space needs proving .

		Color is the great indicator of space in all usual observa - tion , but only because of prior experiment with the muscular sense .

		It is precisely this cooperation of the muscular sense which vitiates all the so-called color scales .

		They apply mostly to the one-eyed .

		If colors actively and inherently came and went , no - body would dare walk on that troubled sea which would be an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	rug .

		With Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's belief that the highest artistic use of color is to express form and spatiality , there need be no quarrel .

		As for space as inferential in music , it seems to be so only through such associative processes as Mr.
Wright	PERSON	elsewhere sets down as crass sentimen - talisms .

		When he writes of music `` the sound engtflfs one almost like streams of water , '' he is describing something quite different from an impression of abstract space or form .

		At the outset Mr.
Wright	PERSON	describes aesthetic expression as growing out of an equal balance of emotion , intellect , and will .

		Let us assume that he rather means a just balance , and this is implied in his depreciation of an art infe - rior and feminine because emotionalized .

		It is hard to square this view with his later description of an art which , though beginning in emotion , transmutes it all into intellect and will .

		The process is conceived and spoken of as a progressive deduction .

		When the artist has no longer any need of the emotion , he deducts it , or it simply drops out of itself .

		Similarly all the recognizable aspects of every real work of art must be deducted .

		They rest upon simple association , which has no aesthetic value , indeed is anti-aesthetic , producing only those lower pleasures so dear to the devotees of merely feminine art .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's war on the poor old associa - tions is unrelenting to Schrecklichkeit : Forms must be put together in such a manner that their appearance or effect will function abstractly and produce in the spectator or auditor an aesthetic experience unrelated to those associative processes which the objects , as objects , might call up .

		This form must even be sufficiently moving to over com ft namely , to make nugatory the effects which a recog - nition of subject-matter would ordinarily give birth to .

		While by taking thought we may dissemble our love for the associations , it is practically difficult to kick them down stairs .

		Hence Mr.
Wright	PERSON	counsels the artist to employ no recognizable forms .

		Paint something which never has had and never will have any asso - ciative range whatsoever .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's aesthetic rests on two ungrounded assumptions : first , there is a sub - jective sense of form , mass , and space apart from any recognizable objects in nature ; second , although objects are recognizable in a work of art , all the associations which such objects usually evoke are nugatory and `` to be deducted . ''

		Any complete examination of these two major propositions is impossible within my assigned limits .

		It is enough to say that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	nowhere proves his postulates .

		Fur - thermore , since our sense of space is gained through experience with objects , and in no other way , the probability is that what is called a subjective sense of form is impossible except through present or past experience of recognizable things .

		We know form only through forms or what we think and remem - ber about them .

		In short , the alleged abstract , subjective experience of form looks delu - sional .

		There may well be certain peculiar ecstasies which figuratively are called percep - tions of subjective form , but the figure is arbitrary and the words misused .

		If we know `` form '' only as in some fashion predicated upon actual forms in nature , then every such experience inevitably carries its associative fringe .

		To say that the associa - tions usually evoked by the object have become `` nugatory , '' merely means that they have been limited by conscious inhibition .

		Our minds remain our minds , and there is no mental act entirely devoid of associations .

		This is true of the artist and of the person perceiving the work of art .

		All aesthetic implies that the mental-emotional mass
1917	DATE	-RSB- 17 behind the work is quite accurately commu - nicated to him who enjoys the work .

		John La Farge called this the `` artistic transac - tion . ''

		If this communication is non-existent or faulty , sesthetics has no matter of discourse .

		If the artistic transaction is valid , then what - ever mattered to the artist in creating the work of art matters to us who enjoy it .

		And nothing is more certain than that all these literary-humanistic in a word , associative values have mattered deeply to great artists .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's groundwork is a rather crass romantic individualism .

		He imagines a creative art in vacuo , by an anti-social super - man .

		Art , as Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	remarked , `` hap - pens '' ; there are no artistic periods or peoples .

		The mystical art of creation strikes as capriciously as the thunderbolt .

		One does not have to be a fanatical democrat to see that the color of their times has mattered so much to very great artists that their work assumes a most representative character .

		Let us take
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	,
Titian	ORGANIZATION	,
Rubens	PERSON	.

		Is such tinge of the times `` nugatory '' ?

		Can we , with Mr.
Wright	PERSON	, `` deduct '' it ?

		The chief originality of this book lies in the well maintained running analogy between painting , sculpture , music , and literature .

		Here Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's great reading and gener - ally sound taste appear to advantage .

		But the analogy of literature with the other arts is rather ingenious than persuasive .

		In particular , it is only by evasion that literature with its inevitable ballast of associations and recognizabilities remains an art at all .

		At best it ought to be a `` feminine '' art .

		As a general view of the arts , Mr.
Wright	PERSON	offers a cyclic theory .

		Art passes through sheer emotionalism , to analysis ; culminates in synthesis , which is followed by exhaustion .

		All the possibilities of sculpture were exhausted by
Michelangelo	LOCATION	; hence it lingers as a moribund and superfluous art .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	does not draw the kindred conclusion that since the theoretical basis of painting has been ascertained by the Synchromists , it too is beginning to die .

		Apparently the cycle is indefinitely repeated , after the Platonic dogma ; we are doomed to revert to an emo - tionalism of which only such sub-artistic activities as the dance are the fitting expres - sion .

		I marvel that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	did not note the synchronism of the perfection of painting and the tango craze .

		It looks like cycles over - lapping at the edges .

		I suppose the unsteadiness of the impres - sion Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's argument makes , is due to the fact that he has built up upon a flimsy foundation a well-ordered and over-elaborate structure .

		He is at all points very far from life , of which art is after all an expression , and his miraculously poised card house does not look habitable .

		In building it , however , he has displayed rare ingenuity .

		It will fall , for the foundation is soft ; meanwhile we humble fabricators in concrete and recog - nizable form may gain pleasure and benefit from inspecting Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's eminently sub - jective pagoda .

		OUR ARCHITECTURE AN OPTIMISTIC VIEW .

		THE ENJOYMENT OP ARCHITECTURE .

		By
Talbot Faulkner Hamlin	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The literature of architecture is singularly inadequate and meagre : her precocious chil - dren succeed in getting themselves far more written about and admired than the mother of the arts .

		For this reason , if for no other , we should welcome Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	's volume .

		`` It fills a long-felt want . ''

		As regards architec - ture there is a hiatus in the culture even of cultivated persons , and this lack Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	's book essays to supply : it is intended to inter - est and instruct the layman in the essentials of architecture so that he may reap that higher form of assthetic enjoyment which comes from the exercise of the faculty of discrimination .

		Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	, though a young man , is well equipped for his task : he has studied , he has travelled , he has practised , and as the son of the distinguished professor of architecture of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, from his earliest infancy he has seen , we may suppose , `` the wheels go round . ''

		His book is written con amore , it is full of the fine enthusiasm of youth without the rawness of youth .

		It is not dry , or dusty , or pedantic ; there is no parade of that technical knowledge which is one of the indespensable equipments for the writing of a book of this kind .

		His first chapter , `` The Appeal of Architec - ture , '' strikes the keynote of enjoyment , thus placing the reader in a properly receptive state of mind .

		His second chapter , `` Laws of Form In Architecture , '' is an admirable and clear statement of those fundamental verities which are often either bungled or ignored , but upon which all sound architectural criticism needs must rest .

		Then come two indispen - sable chapters on materials and structure , fol -
18	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	lowed logically by a full consideration of decoration and ornament .

		The penultimate chapter is on planning , and the book appro - priately ends by bringing clearly before the reader the relation of architecture to life what the author calls its '' social value . ''

		Here is much admirable material , well arranged , interestingly , easily , and at times even charmingly presented .

		If there is now and then an overemphasis 011 the obvious , if the psychological and philosophical aspects of the architectural art are given scant attention , it makes doubtless for the comfort , and there - fore for the enjoyment , of the average lay reader , to whose intelligence the book is frankly fitted and in the main addressed .

		It justifies its title and accomplishes its aim : the reader should rise from its perusal better equipped for the enjoyment of an art which , more than any other , offers itself for such enjoyment wherever man has acted upon his material environment .

		It is pleasant to be able to accord to Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	's book so much of praise ; but it is the function of criticism to act as a corrective to the personal view and bias of an author , to defend the reader against it , though it mean only opposing one personal view and bias to another .

		It is a sad thing to say , and the reader may infer from it , as regards the critic , what he pleases , but the great defect of Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	's attitude to American architec - ture is his incorrigible optimism .

		This is betrayed by his fondness for such an appall - ing word as `` worth-whileness . ''

		He affirms the `` worth-whileness '' of many things in our architectural environment which are not worth while , or which have ceased to be worth while .

		Optimism , except that of the prophet cherishing a hope which he may never live to realize , and Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	is not such a prophet , is always dangerous , and it is particularly dangerous in this case , because it delays the day when that order of pharisaical architecture which this book encourages us to admire will not be tolerated .

		If Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	had confined himself to the discussion of European architecture , he would have escaped these strictures , for in dealing with that he is at all times competent and correct ; but in reading the confused scroll of our
America	LOCATION	he is lacking in vision .

		Except for an occasional reference , one might think , in reading this book , that our modern method of steel construction had never been invented , or that its only legitimate function was to form a scaffolding on which to stretch the architectural stage scenery of bygone ages and distant climes .

		Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	affirms that to build in this style or in that is a legitimate thing for us to do .

		More than any other country in the world to-day , the
United States	LOCATION	is heir to all styles , and all cul - tures , and just as Greek philosophy and Eoman Law and Feudalism and Eenaissance , individualism , and the rationalism of the eighteenth century have all contributed to our institutions so our architecture must needs be based on the architecture that all these different peoples have developed .

		Of the vast incongruity , the illogicality of nine-tenths of what we essay , he is himself unconscious , or his optimism covers it up for fear that it might act as a deterrent to `` enjoyment . ''

		He nowhere squarely states this fundamental , necessary fact that it is the duty and privilege of this age , as of every age , to develop an architectural language eloquent of it , one capable of expressing its unique spirit in some new , yet natural , way .

		Instead of developing this language , we are saying in various vernaculars things that are not true .

		It is right that Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	should praise the beauty of our sky-piercing cities , with their crowns of light and banners of steam .

		They are beautiful , but it is the beauty of unconscious power , not the conscious beauty of art .

		One should not pluck the fillet from labor to place it on the undeserving brow of the muse who is still asleep .

		The translation of power into beauty has with us but just begun .

		Nearly all our loveliness is borrowed loveliness : this fact Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	fails to make sufficiently plain .

		It should be made clear , for example , that the beauty of the concourse of the
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania Terminal , `` a thoughtful and imagin - ative design which makes this interior instinct with noble inspiration , '' is the beauty of Imperial
Rome	LOCATION	and in no wise expresses the spirit of modern
America	LOCATION	; and that in this building convenience has been so sac - rificed to grandiloquence that to the bewild - ered traveller it is a veritable temple of fatigue ; to the stockholders , a white elephant .

		It should be made clear that the `` thoughtful simplicity '' and `` fine repose '' of the
Boston Pujblic Library	ORGANIZATION	are qualities from the Library of Ste.
Genevieve	PERSON	, and the
Malatestan Temple	ORGANIZATION	, and that in this building , again , the fun - damental principles of library planning have been violated for the sake of the interior quadrangle , with its massive walls , inspired by the Canceller ia palace .

		The reader should be instructed that the Metropolitan Tower is but a later and larger growth of the Venetian campanile
San Marco	LOCATION	,
1917	DATE	THE DIAL 19 and not left to believe -LRB- by lumping the two together -RRB- that it is in the same class with the
Woolworth	ORGANIZATION	Building tower , which is , if you please , `` instinct with noble inspiration '' despite its pseudo-Gothic detail .

		Like most optimists , Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	mani - fests the stand-pat psychology .

		According to him the architectural chariot must advance always along the well-worn roads , bounded by the ancient scenery .

		In his discussion of Classic mouldings , he says , `` All we can do is to study and re-study , to refine and re-refine the elements left us by the past . ''

		What a dusty answer is this to the eager and adven - turous spirit !

		How different from
Michel	PERSON	- angelo 's inspired apostrophe to Brunelleschi : '' Like you I will not build , better than you I can not ! ''

		Like the
Agatha of Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's play , Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	`` loves sunsets . ''

		Of sun - rise he has little to say .

		He is fond of `` small panes '' and open timber roof - trusses ; he is overanxious about the contour of his mouldings and the projection of his cornices , and underconcerned with the need , in our northern cities , of all the daylight and sun - light we can possibly get .

		We are led to understand that he views with alarm vast areas of glass .

		He seems incapable of vision - ing the beauty of buildings which shall be , instead of pepperboxes , bubbles of iridescent light against the sky and this is what we are coming to .

		Already , in
Germany	LOCATION	, a glass has been invented which shuts out the heat rays , while admitting the light .

		Of course , if he were to subject our archi - tecture to that searching analysis which he studiously avoids , Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	might have to change his title to `` The Dis-enjoyment of Architecture . ''

		But until we stop all this `` digging in the boneyard , '' how are we to learn the art of creation , how are we to express ourselves in any but an unnatural and affected way ?

		When things have come to a certain pass the anarchist is perhaps a better citizen than the conservative , the pessimist than the optimist .

		Our present duty is to break up the old thought-forms with the dynamic force of a fresh idealism , and thus liberate the life stream as dynamite breaks up the ice of a frozen river .

		This is , of course , not the matter to which Mr.
Hamlin	PERSON	addresses himself , nor that for which he is constitution - ally qualified , and it is therefore hardly fair to take him so severely to task ; but he has brought it on himself , in a way , his book is so tremendously good that one can not help wishing it were tremendously better .

		RECONSTRUCTION OF A MASTER .

		JACOPO
CARUCCI	PERSON	DA PONTORMO : His LIFE AND WORK .

		By
Frederick Mortimer Clapp	PERSON	: with Foreword by
Frank J. Mather	PERSON	, Jr. -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 7.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		In these days , the student of History of Art is appalled at the paucity of adequate books on his subject in the English language works which , on the one hand , show scholar - ship , sound , accurate , and orderly , and on the other , infuse such scholarship with enough enthusiasm , sympathy , and warmth of aes - thetic appreciation to appeal both to the con - noisseur and to the layman .

		Such a work , however , has just been published by the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	under the
Henry Weldon Barnes Memorial Publication Fund	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not only does the volume reach this standard of excellence in general but it reconstructs for us one of the almost unknown Italian masters of the sixteenth century .

		At the beginning of the decline of Italian painting , which started in even during the lifetime of
Michelangelo	LOCATION	, there were a few artists who still retained enough of the great Florentine traditions to be able to produce , in spite of the overwhelming might of that great master , some works of real aesthetic worth .

		Such a one was
Jacopo Carucci	PERSON	da
Pontormo	ORGANIZATION	.

		Born in
1494	DATE	, early left an orphan , the sensitive precocious boy was apprenticed at an unusually early age to
Albertinelli	LOCATION	; but without aid , driven on by his wayward , rest - less nature , always searching for novelty , he passed rapidly under the tutelage of
Piero di Cosimo	ORGANIZATION	,
Leonardo	LOCATION	, and
Andrea del Sarto	PERSON	, the influence of all of whom is apparent in his early religious paintings , but particularly that of
Andrea	LOCATION	.

		The drawings of this period , however , reflect another influence , which moved him even more profoundly , that of Michelangelo .

		Yet his treatment of form was not merely imitative ; its purpose was to satisfy
Pontormo	ORGANIZATION	's greatest gift the decora - tive instinct .

		The opportunity for free self - expression came with the commission for decorations in the villa of the Medici at Poggio a Cajano , and the lunette in the
Great Hall	LOCATION	there stands as one of the fine mural decorations of the Renaissance , a composition full of novelty , freshness , delicacy , and win - someness , thoroughly Quattrocentist in feel - ing
Pontormo	ORGANIZATION	's decorative masterpiece .

		At this point , not content with success but ardent to solve other problems , and in order to escape the tyranny which the work of
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	was then exercising over Flor - ence ,
Pontormo	ORGANIZATION	swung over to an alien influence , actuated not so much by his whim - 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	sical nature , as impelled by an innate under - standing ; and spread upon the convent walls at Certosa frescoes of the Passion which show that his style had been quite revolutionized by the art of Diirer .

		This modification of his natural evolution was brief , however , and left no permanent traces .

		With his usual nimble - ness , he swung back to Italian tradition in the altar-pieces of his middle period .

		But the tremendous power of the
Michel	PERSON	- angelesque type and pose was something against which the impressionable
Jacopo	PERSON	now seemed unable to struggle , though he had an intimate acquaintance with and a more profound understanding of that master than any other contemporary .

		Yet struggle through he did ; and his last phase shows him not an empty imitator of the level of Bronzino and
Bandinelli	PERSON	but one who was still searching for his ideal , and to whom the canon of
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	had become `` the crude material of a new form of decoration . ''

		Hence , in the
San Lorenzo	LOCATION	frescoes ,
Pontormo	PERSON	was not an incomprehensible failure , as
Vasari	PERSON	would have us believe , but one of the `` earliest and most gifted forerunners '' of the younger generation of modern painters , `` who have broken with a paralyzing conservatism . ''

		For , realizing that the Florentines had con - quered all their problems connected with the figure arts ,
Pontormo	ORGANIZATION	revolted against the formalism that had resulted from this con - quest , and aimed to produce simple and majestic patterns , works of emotional design destined to stir our sensations of form rather than our intelligence .

		In apparently perfect solitude , for eleven years he labored on these frescoes and left them , at his death in
1557	DATE	.

		to be completed by
Bronzino	ORGANIZATION	.

		In one other phase of pictorial art ,
Pon	PERSON	- tormo proved himself a real master por - traiture ; and such works as the `` Cosimo il Vecchio , '' in the
Uffizi	LOCATION	, the `` Portrait of a Youth , '' in
Lucca	LOCATION	, and the `` Young Woman , '' at
Frankfort	LOCATION	, not only show a catholic ability in character interpretation but indicate the source of our general tradition of form , for `` it was
Jacopo	PERSON	who first transformed por - traiture by seeing it in terms of
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	's heroic vision and it was
Jacopo	PERSON	who , in recording the appearance of his sitters , first sought to combine a massive imaginative sim - plicity and dignity of presentation with an intangible evocation of individual character . ''

		A hitherto unpublished diary of Pon - tormo , extending over a period of nearly three years , gives us laconically a vivid pic - ture of this humble , whimsical Italian crafts - man of the Cinquecento solitary , frugal , hard-working , with a few simple pleasures , a small circle of friends who , withal , were denied admittance at times by finding drawn up above their reach the ladder which served as the only entrance to the workshop of the little home .

		Such is Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	's reconstruction of this almost unknown personality , which is per - suasively told rather than pedantically forced .

		Yet , notwithstanding his ingenious and log - ical interpretation of
Pontormo	ORGANIZATION	's last phase , many students of art history , with the reviewer , will take issue with the author and cling to the opinion that
Jacopo	PERSON	, in this last period , sank to the hollow imitation of
Michel	PERSON	- angelo and that , too , the Michelangelo who was on the downward path from his zenith , and will feel that the eighteenth century not inappropriately buried the
San Lorenzo	LOCATION	fres - coes under a coat of whitewash .

		For while we grant that they reveal an amazing knowl - edge of anatomy and an ideal of pattern-like composition , yet their ill proportions , exag - gerations , and writhings so contort the representative element that the resultant feel - ing of distaste militates against any ideal Pontormo may have had for the significant expression of emotional design .

		One feels that on this point the author 's enthusiasm for his subject has blurred his perspective ; or else , granting that the excellent quality of these frescoes is clear in his own mind , he does not convincingly enough prove their worth against the adverse criticism of cen - turies .

		The catalogue raisonne of the authentic works , as important as the text itself , with almost unparalleled completeness , gives in the case of each picture a detailed description , a critical account of the history , the date , preparatory drawings , reproductions of all kinds , and bibliography .

		Then follow cat - alogues of attributed and lost works .

		Between the text and this group of catalogues are inserted the hundred and fifty-three illustra - tions , taken mostly from the writer 's own photographs and arranged in chronological order , so that a perusal of these alone affords the reader a survey of the development of the artist , which is further aided by the large number of drawings included .

		For these show not only the genesis and growth of such important works as the lunette at Poggio but fill in the gaps caused by lost works .

		This unusual placing of the illustrative material greatly facilitates the use of both the text and the catalogue .

		The appendixes include a fuller statement of
Pontormo	ORGANIZATION	's apprenticeship , thirty-six docu - ments relative to his life , many of which are published for the first time , together with a
1917	DATE	THE DIAL 21 group of sonnets written on his death and a copy of the diary , with a complete reconstruc - tion and analysis .

		No bibliography is attached , as nothing of any import has been written on this painter except Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's essay in the `` Drawings of the Florentine Painters , '' brief statements by
Carlo Gamba	PERSON	in the Pontormo folio of the `` Disegni della Galleria degli Uffizi , '' and the author 's pre - vious work , `` Dessins de Pontormo . ''

		A careful reading of the monograph sends one involuntarily back to an expression of the author in the Preface , `` the ideal of abso - lute completeness '' ; and that is the feeling which Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	's book inspires , a complete - ness ` that is not merely erudite and weighty with fact but that indicates , together with its convincing scholarship , a poised enthusiasm .

		Narrative and criticism , as Mr.
Mather	PERSON	has pointed out , have been carried along together , and while the exposition is logical , it has left the final verdict to the reader .

		The lover of the Italian Renaissance rejoices to have one more master restored from the rubbish heap to a complete personality and becomes aware , thereby , of greater signifi - cance in the works universally accorded a high place among masterpieces , such as the lunette at Poggio and some of the portraits , however much he may differ as to the aesthetic value of other works and on the final question as to whether Pontormo was a genius or just missed that mark .

		We can but wish that the press could add more volumes of such genuine worth to our literature on the history of art .

		The essays themselves are quite as readable as the author 's previous book , `` Music After the Great War , '' and present many stimulating suggestions for those who are interested in the modern tendencies of so fluid an art as music .

		On the other hand , the book may distress those who cling to the illusion that their little segment of experience compre - hends the whole history of music , or who are too indolent to listen receptively to music which is pushing beyond the old confines of the art .

		In the main , Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	simply ignores those who forget that music has always been evolutionary .

		He accepts musical empiricism as he accepts night and day .

		He is more concerned with what music is going to be than with what it has been .

		For this reason the first essay , which gives the book its title , is the least important .

		It consists of a series of anecdotes of musicians who have publicly exhibited what , by implica - tion , are bad manners .

		Now , if any violation of the conventions is indictable as bad man - ners , then perhaps these indictments can be sustained .

		But if the manner of the man is the outward expression of his per - sonal reaction to a situation , then , atrocious as may be the reaction , his manners are good when they truly express his feelings .

		One should weigh the man 's soul before pass - ing on his manners .

		If it be charged that I am too serious about this , and that these anecdotes are provided for entertainment only , then I question the ethics of asking us j to laugh at the soprano who recoiled from the I suggestion of eating roast pork before a per - formance of `` Parsifal , '' or at
Paderewski	ORGANIZATION	because he could not tolerate disorder in his audience while he was playing , or at the French gallery-gods who stopped a concert until the soloist was made to realize that aesthetically he should sing the '' Evening Star Song '' before `` Wotan 's Farewell , '' instead of after .

		The world needs more sensitive feeling of this kind , and it can not be encouraged by ridicule .

		In justice I must say that many of the author 's anecdotes are genuinely amusing ; but his selection is not always discriminating .

		It might have been more logical to follow the first essay with the third , ``
Spain	LOCATION	and Music , '' in order to group together those that are reminiscent , as distinguished from the speculative .

		This is really an important chapter .

		Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	has done a service to the literature of music in preparing the best description of Spanish music that I have been able to find in English .

		He has collated a great deal of valuable information about Spanish opera , religious music , dance music , folk-songs , the zarzuela -LRB- described as the mother of the French opera bouffe -RRB- , and the national composers .

		The description of Span - ish dance music and dances , is exceedingly interesting as well as enlightening , and the whole chapter has a distinct value in acquaint - ing the reader with the musical progress of a musical people whose records are nowhere adequately presented in English .

		While it is impossible justly to sum up this chapter in the present limits , the promise is warrant -
09	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	able that it contains much of interest that will be quite new to most readers .

		In discussing `` Music for the Movies '' the author comes nearer to the general tone of the book .

		He points out that essential as musical accompaniment is to a moving-picture per - formance , apparently no important composer has been asked to write music for the films .

		But the author thinks that new forms will have to be devised .

		In the absence of pre - arranged scores , pianists and orchestra leaders must do the best they can in selecting music fitted to the pictures exhibited .

		This is less difficult for the versatile solo pianist , who by skilful extemporizing can get grace - fully out of the middle of one composition into another when the action changes on the screen , and who `` may vary the tune by sit - ting on the piano or by upsetting a chair '' when the hero falls into the water .

		But an orchestra , being more immobile , has its own troubles in both suiting and timing its music to the scene .

		Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	predicts that before long some enterprising director will engage an enterprising musician to compose music for a picture .

		The thought excites his irrepressible humor , and he proceeds in this fashion : Put
Igor Strawinsky	PERSON	, or some other modern genius , to work on this problem and see what happens !

		The musician of the future should revel in the opportunity the moving-picture gives him to create a new form .

		This form differs from that of the incidental music for a play in that the flow of tone may be continuous and because one never needs to soften the accom - paniment so that the voices may be heard ; it differs from the music for a ballet in that the scene shifts constantly , and consequently the time-signatures and the mood and the key must be constantly shifting .

		The swift flash from scene to scene , the `` cut-back , '' the necessary rapidity of the action , all are adapted to inspire the futurist composer to brilliant effort ; a tinkle of this and a smash of that , without `` work - ing-out '' or development ; illustration , comment , piquant or serious , that 's what the new film music should be .

		The ultimate moving-picture score will be something more than sentimental accompaniment .

		The question , `` Shall We
Eealize Wagner	PERSON	's Ideals ? ''

		leads Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	to suggest that while , in his judgment ,
Wagner	PERSON	's music is growing a bit old-fashioned , he could hold his place for many decades if justice were done his music dramas in their presentation .

		In his characteristic manner he ridicules the obsolete scenery and inadequate mechanical devices that have done service , lo , these many years in AVagnerian productions , not only in
America	LOCATION	but in
Europe	LOCATION	as well .

		He would commission a new producer an
Adolphe Appia	PERSON	, a
Gordon Craig	PERSON	, a Stanislawsky , or a
Roerich	LOCATION	to present Wagnerian music drama in a modern way , using a modern stage set - ting , modern lighting and color effects , and a modern handling of mechanical problems in short , to bring to the task all the resources which
Hiram Kelly Moderwell	PERSON	has described in `` The Theatre of Today '' as the aims and results of the artists who are working in the theatre .

		He argues the futility of clinging slavishly to the ``
Bayreuth	LOCATION	traditions , '' assert - ing that
Wagner	PERSON	was more concerned with his ideals than with their practical solution .

		There has never been a production of the `` Ring , '' he says , which has in any sense real - ized its true possibilities , the ideal of
Wagner	PERSON	.

		In `` The Bridge Burners '' Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	draws an interesting comparison between the development of music and painting , by which he shows that the evolution of programme j music leads to the attempt to paint feeling I rather than to photograph an object .

		Per - haps it is because the critics fail to grasp the significance of this that they entirely miss the composer 's intention , as when so able a critic as
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Sun '' says of the futurists or post-impressionists in music , `` they are tone colorists , and that is all . ''

		Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	really conies to the kernel of the matter when he refers to routine , or cliche , in music .

		Each new musical giant has desired to express himself without resort - ing to the formulas of his predecessors .

		Under the inviting title , `` A New Principle in Music , '' Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	contrasts the effects of
Strawinsky	ORGANIZATION	's music with that of other composers .

		In `` Petrouchka ''
Straw	ORGANIZATION	- insky abandoned the academic ideas of `` bal - ance of tone '' and experimented with `` pure tone , '' in the same sense that a painter speaks of pure color .

		In `` The Nightingale '' he makes little attempt at representation , striving instead to give the feeling of the bird 's song .

		He is continent in his use of sound and in the mystery and esotericism of his effect .

		In his search for `` pure tone '' he frequently uses only one of each kind of instrument at a time , , and sometimes only a few instruments in all .

		He is said to have attained an indescribable beauty of color in applying this principle of chamber music to larger forms .

		In his new - est work , `` The Village Wedding , '' he uses an orchestra of forty-five men , each a virtuoso , , no two of whom play the same instrument , except that there are two violins ; of these , however , one consistently bows while the other plays only pizzicato .

		Another innovation in `` The Village Wedding , '' following an idea of
Diaghileff	ORGANIZATION	's , is that the roles of the opera are sung by artists who sit still , literally a part of the scenery , while the figures of the ballet enact them .

		Some have predicted that the future of opera lies in this direction , and there - are many evidences of a tendency toward a.
1917	DATE	THE DIAL 23 closer relation between dancing and the higher forms of music .

		In the final essay , on
Leo Ornstein	PERSON	, Mr.
Van Vechten	PERSON	gives an illuminating sketch of this new and interesting figure in music , who , the author shows , possesses something of a dual personality .

		This is true in his music , some of which he signs `` Vannin , '' and true also in his playing .

		We learn that
Ornstein	PERSON	believes there is an underlying basis of theory for his music which will sometime be formulated , though he does not intend to formulate it .

		He believes , with
Busoni	PERSON	and
Schoenberg	PERSON	, that there are no discords , only chords and chords '' millions '' of combinations of notes that have not yet been devised .

		He promises , when he feels that the existing enharmonic scale is limiting him , to write in quarter tones .

		The voice and the violin are already prepared to perform such music , and new instruments can be created to meet the new need .

		The piano is held responsible for the rigidity of the present scale .


Ornstein	PERSON	, like
Strawinsky	PERSON	, tries to express feeling in his music , rather than to imitate sounds or objects .

		`` His music is a modern expression , untraditional , and full of a strange seething emotion ; no calculation here .

		And like the best painting and litera - ture of the epoch it vibrates with the unrest of the period which produced the great war . ''

		It is impossible to test the theories and sug - gestions in these essays by any chemistry or mechanics .

		Their soundness or unsoundness can only be eventually a matter of history .

		But the essayist has his eyes turned in a promising direction , and his views will meet the approval of many close students of modern

		APPRECIATIONS OF POETRY .

$ 3.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Sophisticated readers to whom the written works of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's lifetime were a stimulus and an illumination may conceivably put down this report of the author 's classroom lectures with a sense of disappointment .

		The lectures undoubtedly have their value ; but that value is for a group of persons different from those who were most keenly delighted by
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's main writings .

		The young student of poetry or the foreigner making his first attempt to approach English literature may find in this book a rare and precious aid ; the mature and experienced mind , however , will be likely to regard the volume as rather com - monplace and simple fare .

		As a pedagogical curiosity , it must be admitted that the book has its interest .

		Hearn , the preface tells us , lectured without notes , but very slowly , choosing simple words and constructions , in order to make the for - eign language as easy as possible to his Japanese students ; and some of the students managed to take down many lectures word for word , compiling thus a record from which this volume could be shaped .

		So here we have what is presumably a fairly accurate report of those things that
Hearn	PERSON	thought it advis - able and possible to say to the Oriental mind about English poetry .

		And it is hard to escape the conviction that
Hearn	PERSON	was a good teacher , and that he found a way of giving to his pupils a fuller and richer account of English poetry than most men would have dared to undertake .

		Where so appallingly much was unknown to the minds of his audience , he courageously went forward into thickets of tangled allusion and association , and worked out for them what must have been a distinctly illuminating interpretation .

		We might count ourselves very fortunate indeed if some Japanese would give us an interpre - tation of his nation 's poetry that was half as successful .

		We can not judge of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's tastes and interests by the mere subjects of these lec - tures , for admittedly the accidents of pres - ervation or loss , as the case might be , govern the selection here presented .

		Tennyson ,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Morris	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, and
Kingsley	PERSON	are among the poets to whom he devotes rather elaborate studies ; evidently they are from a course that cov - ered only the latter part of the nineteenth century .

		And if one feels inclined at times to quarrel with the indiscriminate praise which
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	heaps upon one and all of these , one must recall that this is far more an attempt to arouse the interest of students than to analyze the claims of artists .

		Yet comprehensible and forgivable as this fact is , it still further increases the disappointment of the reader who had here looked for penetrat - ing and brilliant discrimination .

		As a literary critic ,
Hearn	PERSON	here shows him - self to be more sympathetic and conventional than brilliant .

		Really original and profound criticism , criticism that throws a light not thrown before , is not to be found here .

		And the style , naturally enough when one con - siders how the book was composed and recorded , is quite lacking in the carefully cal - culated charm with which
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's written work has made us familiar .

		In spite , there - fore , of the many occasional felicities of inter - pretation that are to be found in the book , 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	it leaves in one 's mind the impression of a piece of schoolroom drill ; and it is not with entire happiness that one contemplates this example of the way in which a very subtle artist , when forced to earn his bread by means of a trade , went about the laborious business .

		These lectures , faithfully and admirably adapted to the purposes for which they were composed , seem a little out of place on one 's shelves beside `` Out of the East '' and `` Glean - ings from Buddha Fields . ''

		The book is a hard one from which to quote ; but here is a passage that is perhaps as detachable and as interesting as any , and more philosophical than most .

		Hearn is lec - turing `` On Love in English Poetry . ''

		Consider the place and the meaning of love in any human life .

		It is essentially a period of idealism , of imagining better things and conditions than are possible in this world .

		For everybody who has been in love has imagined something higher than the possible and the present .

		Any idealism is a proper subject for art .

		It is not the same in the case of realism .

		Grant that all this passion , imagination , and fine sentiment is based upon a very simple animal impulse .

		That does not make the least difference in the value of the highest results of that passion .

		We might say the very same thing about any human emotion ; every emotion can be evolutionary traced back to simple and selfish impulses shared by man with the lower animals .

		But because an apple or a pear tree happens to have its roots in the ground , does that mean that its fruits are not beautiful and wholesome ?

		Most assuredly we must not judge the fruit of the tree from the unseen roots ; but what about turning up the ground to look at the roots ?

		What becomes of the beauty of the tree when you do that ?

		The realist at least the French realist likes to do that .

		He likes to bring back the attention of the reader to the lowest rather than to the highest , to that which should be kept hidden , for the very same reason that the roots of a tree should be kept underground if the tree is to live .

		The time of illusion , then , is the beautiful moment of passion ; it represents the artistic zone in which the poet or romance writer ought to be free to do the very best he can .

		He may go beyond that zone ; but then he has only two directions in which he can travel .

		Above it there is religion , and an artist may , like
Dante	PERSON	, succeed in transforming love into a sentiment of religious ecstasy .

		But upward there is no other way to go .

		Downward the artist may travel until he finds himself in hell .

		Between the zone of idealism and the brutality of realism there are no doubt many gradations .

		I am only indicating what I think to be an absolute truth , that in treating of love the literary master should keep to the period of illusion , and that to go below it is a dangerous undertaking .

		This passage is an unusual one in the book ; few others deal with such general principles .

		It shows , however , how conventional
Hearn	PERSON	's literary theories were ; and it also suggests how well he might be able to make them clear to alien minds .

		THE JARVE8 COLLECTION .

		A DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE OF THE PICTURES IN THE JARVES COLLECTION BELONGING TO YALE UNIVERSITY .

		By
Osvald Siren	PERSON	, Professor of the History of Art ,
University of Stockholm	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 7.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The Jarves Collection , composed chiefly of paintings by the Italian `` Primitives , '' and for more than forty-five years the property of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, has had a more interest - ing history than any other great collection in this country , unless perhaps it be that of the drawings by old masters belonging to
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	, in
Brunswick	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	.

		This collection , formed by the son of Governor
Bowdoin	PERSON	, was , on his death , valued by the appraisers of his estate at
$ 7.75	MONEY	, though it contains three authenticated Rembrandts and is , as a whole , second only to the
Morgan Collection	ORGANIZATION	in the Metropolitan Museum ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		The Jarves Collection , brought to the
United States	LOCATION	in
1860	DATE	as a semi-speculative venture , was never subjected to any such entirely fantastic undervaluation .

		Indeed , considerable attention was paid to it at the time in the public press .

		But many years passed before the collection was appreciated at anything like its real worth , and during the decade when it vainly sought a per - manent and collective resting-place , it steadily shrank in size , like the Sibylline Books .

		It is to be wished that Dr.
Siren	PERSON	, in his monumen - tal `` Catalogue of the Jarves Collection , '' appropriately published last autumn by the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	, and under the auspices of the
Yale Art School	ORGANIZATION	, had given the story of this wandering and this shrinkage a little more in detail from the wealth of existing contemporary documents .

		He does not even give the full name of
J. Jackson Jarves	PERSON	, the original collector , nor does he allude to the fact that the majority of the pictures at one time or another withdrawn from the collec - tion , and including some of its finest numbers , are to-day to be found in the
Holden	PERSON	collec - tion at
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	a collection which is thus complementary in a very important sense to the one under discussion .

		The Jarves pictures were first exhibited in the so-called `` Institute of Fine Arts , '' or the
Derby Gallery	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		At this time the catalogue , prepared by Mr.
Jarves	PERSON	who , how - ever , buttressed his own personal opinions by the judgments of the best European experts of the period , contained 145 numbers .

		Three years later the pictures were shown in the rooms of the
New York Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		By this time the number was reduced to 134 , and `` this restriction of the collection went on
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 25 still more rapidly during the following years so that fifteen more pictures were taken out before the collection was deposited in
1867	DATE	in the
Art School of Yale University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The remaining 119 pictures were finally put up at public sale on
November 9 , 1871	DATE	.

		`` The only bid was made by the
Yale Corporation	ORGANIZATION	, which acquired the collection for the exceedingly moderate sum of
$ 22,000	MONEY	,
$ 20,000	MONEY	of which had already been paid to Mr.
Jarves	PERSON	some years previously as a loan upon the paintings .

		Mr.
Jarves	PERSON	had good reason to feel disap - pointed , '' adds Dr.
Siren	PERSON	, `` at the lack of interest shown by the American public in the masterpieces which the experts of that time had told him should be worth
$ 100,000	MONEY	. ''

		Since then the pictures have been regularly exhibited in the gallery of the
Yale Art School	ORGANIZATION	where , however , they have remained almost entirely overlooked by students and the general public alike ; so that when atten - tion again gradually began to be directed to them about ten years ago , the news of the existence of a collection so rich in the very class of pictures rare elsewhere in
America	LOCATION	, yet eagerly sought for by American collectors abroad , came almost with the shock of a fresh discovery .

		As has been said , the first catalogue of the Jarves Collection was prepared by Mr.
Jarves	PERSON	himself , who also was responsible for the second catalogue , for the
New York Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	exhibition .

		In
1868	DATE	a `` Manual of the Jarves Collection of Early Italian Paintings , '' by
Russell Sturgis , Jr.	PERSON	, was published by
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		This `` Manual , '' which is mainly a mere abbreviated compilation of Jarves 's original catalogue , containing the same names , descriptions , and documents as the first one , though in a less complete form , has remained the only catalogue available in the
Yale Art School	LOCATION	, where it is still on sale .

		Dr. Siren remarks : It would be unfair to blame Jarves for shortcom - ings in regard to attributions which are no worse than those given in the catalogues of European galleries of that time .

		It is less his fault than the fault of the general standards and methods of art criticism of the middle of the XIX century that he freely mixes Florentine and Sienese schools , that he sees
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	's hand in
Taddeo Gaddi	PERSON	's work , or
Simone Martini	PERSON	's in
Orcagna	LOCATION	's , and so on , or worst of all that he presents a fabrication of the
XIX	ORGANIZATION	century as a masterpiece by the youthful Eaphael .

		Such mistakes are only too common in the art literature of the time , and most of the authorities quoted by Jarves seem to have shared them with him .

		These `` general standards and methods '' of European art criticism , which Jarves accepted without question , have , however , long since been fundamentally reformed and revised .

		In recent years particularly , the art or discipline of modern scientific attribution , fathered by
Morelli	PERSON	and facilitated by photography , which makes all the masterpieces of all the galleries immediately available for purposes of study and comparison , has advanced by immense strides , and the shortcomings of the
Jarves	PERSON	-
Sturgis	PERSON	`` Manual '' have long since become only too painfully apparent .

		The first critical account of the Jarves pic - tures by a modern art critic , was an article by
William Rankin	PERSON	in the `` American Journal of Archaeology , '' for
April , 1895	DATE	, though
Crowe	PERSON	and Cavalcaselle had already men - tioned two of the Jarves pictures in the first edition of their `` History . ''

		Since then Mr.
Bernhard Berenson	PERSON	has increasingly included pictures from the Jarves Collection in his lists of the works of Italian painters of the XV and
XVI	ORGANIZATION	centuries ; while various other writers , including Mr.
F. M. Perkins	PERSON	, Pro- fessor
F. J. Mather	PERSON	, Jr. , Professor Ch .

		Hiilsen , and Professor
Schrubring	PERSON	-LRB- author of a recently published and authoritative work on Italian Cassoni -RRB- , have described various de - partments of the collection and suggested numerous new attributions .

		Dr.
Siren	PERSON	himself , before the appearance of the present compre - hensive catalogue of the collection , contributed several short articles on the trecento pictures in the Jarves Collection to the `` Burlington Magazine '' -LRB-
1908	DATE	-RRB- and `` Art in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
1914	DATE	-RRB- ; the contents of these papers reappear in somewhat modified form in the present vol - ume , where it has been the author 's `` endeavor to note as completely as possible at the end of the discussion of each painting the literature relating to it . ''

		As the purpose of the catalogue was to provide not only a gallery guide but a manual for students , Dr.
Siren	PERSON	has in some cases -LRB- especially where he is dealing with little - known early painters -RRB- added rather long his - torical notes , which certainly add to the gen - eral interest of the work , although they have helped to make it rather bulky for its pri - mary object .

		It may also be said that his very full descriptions of many of the pictures are at times rather unnecessarily extended by the inclusion of somewhat superfluous informa - tion concerning familiar mythological sub - jects , as in the case of `` Actaeon and the Hounds '' -LRB- No. 48 -RRB- , a cassone front by
Jacopo del Sellajo	PERSON	, where it is stated that `` Actaeon was a famous huntsman , son of Aristaeus and 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	Autonoe , daughter of Cadmus . ''

		Still , these are but minor details in a work notable for the skill with which its broadly conceived plan is consistently carried out .

		The principle of arrangement adopted is , in the first place , chronological , in the second place , according to schools .

		`` This seemed to me most suitable , '' comments Dr.
Siren	PERSON	, '' because the main part of the collection con - sists of Italian pictures from the XIII to the
XVI	ORGANIZATION	centuries .

		The division into chapters corresponding to the different centuries seemed natural because the early Tuscan paintings which form the nucleus of the col - lection are more closely allied to each other than the early and late paintings of any one local school . ''

		Inside the broad chronological divisions the local schools are , however , kept as distinct as possible .

		A concluding chapter deals with `` Non-Italian Schools , '' a division being made between the `` Italo-Byzantine Schools '' and the `` Dutch and Flemish Schools . ''

		A final entry disposes summarily of the claims of the pseudo-Raphael under the rubric of `` Unknown Painter , about the middle of the XIX century . ''

		This is not the place to enter upon any general description of the Jarves Collection or to give a detailed account of the catalogue itself , interesting as it would be to take up one by one the various attributions , compar - ing them with the old Jarves ascriptions , as well as with those of more recent critics and historians .

		All things considered , it is remarkable that Dr.
Siren	PERSON	finds himself so often in agreement with the early attribu - tions , especially as he frequently departs from the findings of contemporary confreres who employ similar methods a divergence which makes it clear that the modern art of scientific attribution has still a considerable distance to go before it can be regarded in any real sense as an `` exact science . ''

		Dr.
Siren	PERSON	is far from presenting any such presumptuous claim , and shows signal modesty in presenting his own views .

		Where there remains the least doubt , or possibility of a doubt , as to his conclusions , he carefully sums up the evidence and leaves the final judgment to the student , who is invited to examine all the documents for himself as in the case of the rare and elu - sive
Ambrogio di Baldese	ORGANIZATION	, a Florentine artist of the
Gerini	PERSON	bottega , to whom Dr.
Siren	PERSON	attributes a `` Triptych Eepresenting the Madonna with Four Saints '' -LRB- No. 22 -RRB- , assigned by Jarves to an `` Unknown Painter of the Sienese School . ''

		On the whole , the
Jarves Collection	ORGANIZATION	would seem to have gained quite as much as it has lost by the rigid analysis to which Dr.
Siren	PERSON	has subjected it , though in this connection it would have been interesting and valuable to have from the cataloguer 's hand a final appraisal of the entire collection .

		It is true that the
Raphael	PERSON	has been placed hors de com - bat , that a `` Head of the Dead Christ '' -LRB- No .

		114 -RRB- , formerly attributed to Diirer , has been taken from that artist and assigned to the Flemish painter
Marinus van Roymerswaele	PERSON	, and that an appreciable number of paintings have been switched from men of first-rate importance to secondary or tertiary followers .

		But , on the other hand , there have been dis - tinct gains , as in the assignment of the three little pictures which comprise No. 1 in the collection , and which Jarves attributed fan - tastically to an `` Unknown Painter of the XI century '' there was no religious art worthy of the name in
Italy	LOCATION	at that early era to
Bonaventura Berlinghieri	LOCATION	.

		Berlinghieri is , as Dr.
Siren	PERSON	says , '' one of the great precursors of Giotto . ''

		It would not be fair to compare the painter of the Jarves picture with later artists , like
Cimabue	ORGANIZATION	and
Donatello	PERSON	, who have all the advantage of more devel - oped means of expression , but he may be ranked with them as one of the great imaginative masters .

		There is a deep agitating feeling in his conception of the Passion ; Christ is an intensely suffering human being ... There are not many pictures of this early epoch which stand on a level with this one in regard to decorative and emotional qualities .

		Dr.
Siren	PERSON	discusses at length the great painting by
Pollajuolo	PERSON	, representing the `` Rape of Deinira '' -LRB- No. 42 -RRB- .

		This remains one of the most important pieces of the col - lection , though Dr.
Siren	PERSON	is of the opinion that the figures of Deinira and of Nessus , whose evident inferiority to that of Hercules `` can - not be explained by the subsequent restora - tions of the picture , '' are the work , not of Antonio , but of his younger brother Piero .

		Antonio was , however , responsible for the whole composition .

		The pictures of the Jarves Collection were carefully cleaned in the
summer of 1915	DATE	by a competent restorer .

		Rehung now in their new arrangement in the gallery of the
Yale Art School	ORGANIZATION	, with Dr.
Siren	PERSON	's masterly cat - alogue as a guide to the student , they will no doubt attract an increasing number of visitors to
New Haven	LOCATION	, which must henceforth take rank as one of the art capitals of
America	LOCATION	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 27 A PAINTER OF THE FOREST .

		ALEXANDER
WYANT	PERSON	.

		By
Eliot Clark	PERSON	.

		Illus - trated .

		Frederic Fairchild Sherman ;
$ 12.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's book is the latest of a series that has now become well and favorably known to those interested in American landscape paint - ing .

		Like most of the earlier volumes in the series , it presents a painter 's views of a painter .

		Professor
Mather	PERSON	's book on
Homer Martin	PERSON	was , of course , the work of a critic and a student ; but the other volumes in the series have been by painters .

		They have been appreciations , to use a some - what hackneyed term in the sense in which
Walter Pater	PERSON	brought it into use .

		For that reason the books have an especial value for the student and lover of pictures .

		They are beautifully printed and illustrated , and they present an especial view .

		This latest volume , like the others in the series , is well worth having .

		I have before had opportunity in THE DIAL to point out reasons why those who are plan - ning the series should try to do even more than they do ; and in spite of my ill success in the past , it seems worth while to say the same thing briefly once more .

		It seems to me almost obvious that such beautiful mono - graphs ought to have some of the apparatus that would be of value to the student of American painting , as well as the artistic appreciation that would perhaps satisfy the painter or amateur .

		If nothing more , it would certainly be useful to have in such a volume a list of the pictures of
Wyant	PERSON	, with the dates of their execution .

		Of course such a list is not necessary to the appreciation of `` Wyant or anybody else ; but Mr.
Clark	PERSON	appar - ently and naturally has a clear idea of the general development of Wy ant 's art and of the place in that development of one or another picture .

		It is only asking him to give the reader the means that he has himself col - lected , at least to some degree .

		The utmost vagueness prevails in this matter , not only in regard to
Wyant	LOCATION	, but with many others of our earlier landscape painters .

		It would seem clear that if students do not know just what a man painted , they can not know his place in the history of art .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's book , like the others in the series , not only does not have any list of the pictures of its subject , but it does not give the dates of the works which it does reproduce .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	usually speaks of pic - tures with especial reference to the period in which they were painted .

		Yet the details noted with each painting rarely give the date or the period .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	notes where and how the picture is signed , a matter which seems almost invariable , and which can usually be seen by looking at the painting itself ; but he does not give the date unless it is on the picture .

		As the reproductions are not arranged in any obvious order , and are sometimes referred to in the text and some - times not , they are useful chiefly for that direct appreciation of the beautiful which is so necessary and so delightful , but not -LRB- even in Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's view -RRB- absolutely sufficing .

		Besides direct appreciation of a beautiful picture , the student wants to know its place in the life of the painter , that he may form some idea -LRB- as Mr.
Clark	PERSON	does -RRB- of the growth and development of the painter 's art ; and for that one would desire either a dated list of the pictures of one 's painter , or at least that the pictures reproduced should be chosen and arranged to illustrate the development the writer has in mind .

		All of which is rather negative criticism , as well as something for which Mr.
Clark	PERSON	him - self is not responsible .

		It is the plan of the series not to give scholarly apparatus , but to give instead artistic appreciation .

		I do not see that the two are incompatible , but perhaps they are .

		Perhaps Mr.
Clark	PERSON	would not be able to give the names and dates and so on that I should like to study over .

		I am quite sure that I should not be able to give the kind of appreciation of
Wyant	PERSON	-LRB- or anyone else -RRB- that he can .

		And that , after all , is one of the most important things in art of any kind .

		To know what the artist aims , tries , longs to do , that is at the bottom of a real enjoyment of what he does do .

		And few persons can appreciate what a painter tries to do better than a painter ; he is likely to have something in common that will enable him to appreciate .

		Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	, in writing of
George Inness	PERSON	, had the advantage of personal acquaintance .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	could hardly have known
Wyant	PERSON	personally , save perhaps as a boy ; but he is himself a landscape painter of a time not so long after
Wyant	PERSON	, and naturally he is well acquainted with the work and the traditions of the earlier man .

		However that may be , Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's is the first attempt that I know of at a careful study of
Wyant	ORGANIZATION	's art .

		Wyant is not so distinctive a painter as
George Inness	PERSON	, on the one hand , or
Homer Martin	PERSON	on the other , with both of whom he is generally named in the develop - ment of American art .

		Most large galleries have some of his pictures , though not always his most characteristic , if one may judge from Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's selections , which are usually from pictures in private galleries .

		Still ,
Wyant	PERSON	does not make so striking an impression on 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	people as do a good many other painters of more definite characteristics .

		It is all the more useful , therefore , that we should have the impression of one who has been really impressed .

		Before he seeks to give a special apprecia - tion , Mr.
Clark	PERSON	views the whole career of
Wyant	LOCATION	, particularly in its historical relation .

		He sees in his earlier paintings the influence of the early American landscapists , particu - larly
Durand	PERSON	, and something of the German painters then popular , as well as something of a quality that seems his own .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	has some good remarks on the landscape of that earlier time : The pencil and the brush were for the German painters and their American followers during the first part of the nineteenth century what the camera is to the modern tourist .

		They were essentially topo - graphical draughtsmen , bringing home records of for - eign lands and unusual scenes to satisfy the interest of the curious .

		Their aim being essentially to inform and instruct , their work is purely illustrative .

		Wyant lost little time in following vague and uncertain ideas and theories , but was content to apply himself in the given manner .

		This was in a certain sense painting over drawing , and it is only in understanding this method that we will get a clear idea of these early pictures and understand their deficiency as well as their significance .

		Such painting gave a good deal , but it lacked more ; it gave form and detail , but it lacked light and atmosphere .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	thinks that in spite of local subject and super - ficial representation it was not essentially American in character .

		It seems to me , how - ever , that notwithstanding its foreign influ - ence it had a good deal that was characteristic of the time .

		It was at once large and grandiose , small and petty ; and really those were com - mon characteristics of that
America	LOCATION	of the middle of the century which was
Wyant	PERSON	's influence in his earlier years .

		Later on , like all other landscape painters of his day ,
Wyant	PERSON	became interested in the Barbizon painters .

		In
1880	DATE	these were domi - nant men ; some , though , escaped their influ - ence .

		But in the next ten years of his life ,
Wyant	PERSON	learned more directly from nature than from anything in anybody else .

		Those were his Adirondack years and the years he passed in the
Catskills	LOCATION	.

		Of this period Mr.
Clark	PERSON	does most to give us the spirit and the sentiment .

		He makes an excellent remark about the difference between the earlier
Wyant	PERSON	and the later : Had
Wyant	PERSON	not become ill , but returned strength - ened and invigorated from his early Western adven - ture , we might have had many interesting records , topographically correct , of the wonders of Western scenery .

		He would not only have been the rival of
Bierstadt	PERSON	and Church for popular applause and appre - ciation , but would have added a more sensitive and truthful account of the country which he observed .

		It is not that sort of thing that we get in the later
Wyant	PERSON	.

		In the later French land - scape
Wyant	PERSON	saw the possibility of giving not merely the forms and figures of nature but his own impression and appreciation .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	is very interesting in his presenta - tion of the technical means whereby
Wyant	PERSON	found it possible to express the things he wished to express .

		He began by reducing the angle of vision , and so enabled himself to get a single impression ; and as he became more and more intimate with the Adirondack woods , these impressions became more and more personal and beautiful .

		There is an attractive picture of Wy ant 's in the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	, `` The Flume on the Opalescent Eiver , '' a beautiful rendering of a beautiful and striking place .

		But a place needed not to be so particularly striking in its form as the Flume on the Opalescent .

		So simple a subject as the `` Old Clearing , '' in the Metropolitan , reproduced by Mr.
Clark	PERSON	, gives us the real thing just as well , indeed better , because our mind is not distracted by consid - ering the forms and details which had been so fascinating in the earlier art .

		Wyant 's impressionism was not mere vagueness .

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	shows how carefully in his later years he studied all kinds of natural objects , rocks , trees , brooks , and so on , and how excellent he became as a draughtsman , so that -LRB- though in later years he had to work with his left hand -RRB- he could use the forms of nature to express his own ideas of rhythm , balance , and harmony .

		There never , I believe , has been an exhibition devoted to presenting an adequate idea of the whole work of this painter ; but there are sev - eral places where one may obtain a good idea of his work .

		In the Metropolitan Museum are seven of his pictures ; with two exceptions these are not dated , but at least they are hung near together , and they are so different in period and character that with Mr.
Clark	PERSON	's help one may form from them an excellent idea of the painter .

		There are also a number at the Corcoran and
National	ORGANIZATION	galleries in
Washington	LOCATION	, though , as I remember , not so many .

		It would be a delightful occupation for the picture lover to settle and clarify his ideas about a painter concerning whom most people are a little vague .

		Wyant is commonly mentioned with
George Inness	PERSON	and
Homer Martin	PERSON	.

		He will rarely be thought equal to either in that vague element which we name `` greatness , '' but he will be found by many to have a personal charm equal to either .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 29 BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		FRENCH ETCHERS OF THE SECOND EMPIRE .

		By
William Aspenwall Bradley	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Here is a book full of entertaining estimates of interesting personalities and sketches of the rela - tion between the etchers and the literary men of the period .

		All the foremost writers of this time , especially the poets , evinced the greatest interest in the revival of etching as a creative medium , and so we read of
Baudelaire	LOCATION	's friendship for the immortal Meryon , of the etchings made by
Victor Hugo	PERSON	as the result of his association with
Maxime Lalanne	PERSON	, and of the Goncourts , who learned to etch from the great Bracquemond himself and who numbered in their immediate circle the greatest etchers of the day .

		A chapter is devoted to the artists of
France	LOCATION	during the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	, and the
Commune	ORGANIZATION	, a chapter which current events endow with immediate significance .

		It brings us to a realization that the artists of to-day are only repeating the sacrifices made by their brothers of
1871	DATE	, and many of us may share the mood of Goncourt at the funeral of Regnault : `` We lament above the body of this talented youth , the burial of
France	LOCATION	.

		It is horrible , this equality before the brutal death dealt by rifle or cannon , which strikes genius or imbecility , , the precious life like that which is without worth . ''

		The chapter on the Goncourts and their circle is perhaps the most engaging , but it contains little that is new .

		The most significant pages are certainly those devoted to Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	's estimates of
Corot	LOCATION	as a lith - ographer and
Lalanne	PERSON	as an etcher .

		We are greatly indebted for this illuminating analysis of the work of the most essentially French of painter - etchers ,
Maxime Lalanne	PERSON	, an artist praised too extravagantly perhaps by his contemporaries , but whom later critics are wont to praise too little .

		What Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	has to say of the
Corot	LOCATION	lith - ographs is of great value and draws attention to a less familiar but very important phase of this painter 's genius .

		The entire book has distinction , that of literary style and selection , and we hope that the author may soon devote a similar volume to the best etchers working to-day , bringing to an appreciation of their achievement his clarity of style and accuracy of judgment .

		THE RUSSIAN SCHOOL OP PAINTING .

		By
Alexandre Benois	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Abraham Yarmolinsky	PERSON	.

		Introduction by
Christian Brinton	PERSON	.

		Knopf ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		We have learned to look to
Russia	LOCATION	for much of originality and inspiration of late , particularly since the arrival of the Russian Ballet .

		Con - sequently it is with no little disappointment that we discover , through this excellent volume , how barren is the Russian school of painting .

		As the author admits , in an essentially fair critical survey of Russian painting of the western type ,
Russia	LOCATION	has not achieved in painting the distinction which places her so well forward in music , literature , and decoration .

		In this realm of art she is still imitative , and but little of that Slavonic note which so splendidly individualizes her accomplish - ments in other fields is apparent .


M. Benois	PERSON	is well suited for the difficult task in hand , for as one-time director of the
Ballet Russe	ORGANIZATION	, as co-author of `` Le Pavillion d'Annide '' and `` Petrouchka '' and a painter himself , we may be certain that he has found everything of significance which this rather barren field offers .

		This volume fills a need in the study of contemporary art , and the author 's method of historical criticism is so happily com - bined with a keen feeling for the subtleties of social influence that , in place of an academic record , he has given us a work which not only illuminates the subject but throws many interest - ing sidelights upon the Russian character as well .

		It is not out of place here to mention the excep - tionally beautiful letterpress and the quality of the thirty-two plates , many of which are in color .

		The volume might well be studied by other pub - lishers , for Mr.
Knopf	PERSON	has displayed an originality and independence in its manufacture comparable only with the better decorative tendencies of cer - tain
Continental	ORGANIZATION	publishers .

		NOLLEKENS AND His TIMES .

		By
John Thomas Smith	PERSON	.

		Edited and Annotated by
Wilfred Whitten	PERSON	.

		In Two Volumes .

		Lane ;
$ 7.50	MONEY	.


John Thomas Smith	PERSON	, sometime Keeper of the Prints and Drawings in the British Museum , was an early realist who relied on malice to point his pen , and was well inspired in his trust .

		His master
Nollekens	PERSON	had so deft a hand at the `` busto '' that even Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	admitted he could `` chop out a head with anyone '' ; but the pupil saw no reason for confining himself to heads and he has given us a full-length statue of his benefactor , in which not a fold or wrinkle of the moral nature is omitted and in which due prominence is accorded to the original 's feet of clay .


Joseph Nollekens	PERSON	was what cynics are given to calling `` very human '' our universal meannesses reached in him the pitch of caricature .

		If he lives for us to-day , it is not because he modeled portrait busts of
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	,
George III	PERSON	,
Pitt	PERSON	,
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, and the ever-imposing Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, and mingled on rather doubtful terms in the greatest society , but because an incomparable gossip was by taking notes , a gossip so happily trivial-minded that he found nothing unworthy of record .

		Thus it is that we are privileged to look on while the eminent sculptor , with a thrift that will be sympathetically regarded to-day , ordered the coals to be delivered early so that he might reckon the bags and lock them in his wine-cellar before departing for his labors .

		Nollekens and his wife count the cheese parings and the candle ends in our presence , and by a miracle of nursing contrive to make a pair of moulds last a twelvemonth .

		Nollekens , however , was not a sufficiently large peg on which to hang the mass of anecdote , gossip , and observation that our author had crowded into his head in the course of an industrious career .

		Nollekens is but the center of the book .

		Round him is grouped a most impressive society .

		We have intimate glimpses or anecdotes of
Gainsborough	LOCATION	,
Garrick	PERSON	,
Hogarth	PERSON	, 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 11	DATE	Benjamin West , Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, and many more .

		Smith had , of course , a keen technical interest in the method of his artist friends , and he mingles descriptions of their habits of work with critical judgments and moral reflections in the freest manner .

		Since he was at least as much interested in personal details as he was in art and used the same informal style to describe both , he has left us a vivid picture of an interesting age .

		Nollekens and his friends have long been known to connoisseurs of art and literature .

		It is to introduce them to a wider circle of readers that the present handsome edition has been issued , an edition copiously illustrated with rare drawings of old
London	LOCATION	and with reproductions of water - colors and engravings of worthies of the period .

		VANISHED TOWERS AND CHIMES OP FLANDERS .

		By
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	.

		Penn Pub - lishing
Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		This volume will appeal chiefly to those to whom its subject is already familiar through travel , and to them it will come in the nature of a poignant souvenir .

		Its tone is rather that of the genial traveller returned than of the student .

		Its sprink - lings of history are pleasantly interspersed with personal reminiscence and anecdote , and the two hundred pages will offer congenial browsing grounds for those who have known , or would know , the beauty of this land , now vanished before the vandalism of invaders .

		Each of the cities and towns described ,
Malines	LOCATION	,
Dixmude	LOCATION	,
Ypres	LOCATION	, Nieu - port ,
Louvain	LOCATION	,
Courtrai	LOCATION	, has staged such brutal tragedies of late that it will be difficult to dismiss the anger inspired by their desecration ; but to those who are able to forget and forgive , this volume with its many charming pictures will be welcome .

		THE ART OF LOOKING AT PICTURES .

		By
Carl H. P. Thurston	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Over a hundred painters find space in the pages of this attractive , convenient , and genuinely useful little volume .

		Its sub-title is `` An Introduction to the Old Masters , '' but it ranges over all the national schools from
Cimabue	ORGANIZATION	to
Whistler	LOCATION	, con - sidered in alphabetical order , with thirty-two illus - trations .

		The author 's method is to give , first , about one page of concise and specific directions as to what should be looked for in the works of the individual artist as a whole ; second , a brief biography ; third , a number of quotations from the best critics ; fourth , a brief note regarding the best examples of the artist 's work and their location .

		Both the manner of these `` Directions for Look - ing '' and their value are very well illustrated by part of the page on Perugino : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- Note the smaUness of the mouth and eyes , the narrowness of the nose at the tip , and the perfect oval of the face .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Feel the delicacy with which the fingers rest on whatever they come in contact with .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Notice the long , undulating sweep of
Perugino	ORGANIZATION	's landscapes ; study the other long , gently curving lines till you feel the particular quality of their curvature .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- Note how little ornament he uses , and how naturally and simply he allows the dra - peries to hang .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Realize the physical quies - cence and passivity of his people , and the silence which surrounds them ... -LRB- 7 -RRB- Feel the clear , infinite depths of atmosphere in which these people are immersed ... etc. '' What we have here is in reality a precipitate of appreciation applicable to any picture of the celebrated Umbrian .

		There follow the essentials of
Perugino	ORGANIZATION	's life and envi - ronment , and quotations from
J. A. Symonds	PERSON	,
Vernon Lee	PERSON	, and the Blashfields .

		Mr.
Thurston	PERSON	's book will be liked , not only by those for whom it is expressly intended , namely , those who feel unable to appreciate the Old Masters without aid , and perhaps even doubt their importance in these days of the New , but by the more initiate who enjoy having their impressions renewed and deepened .

		It is a book to be used above all in the gallery , but it may also be used to advantage with colored prints and photographs , or simply with the images that hang on the wall of the picture-lover 's mem - ory .

		Instructors and students in formal courses in the history and appreciation of art should consider whether it might not serve among textbooks .

		A HISTORY OF ORNAMENT ANCIENT AND ME - DIEVAL .

		By
A. D. F. Hamlin	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The present volume at last makes accessible to American and English readers a comprehensive study of the art of architectural ornament , and of ornament in general as applied to art works of lesser size .

		It brings the study up to the
Renais	PERSON	- sance , whose styles , together with the modern , will form the content of a second volume which it is to be hoped will appear without delay .

		This first vol - ume , however , is complete in itself .

		It contains 19 chapters , beginning with primitive and savage ornament and ending with Gothic , 406 clearly printed octavo pages , and 400 illustrations , includ - ing 23 plates , seven of which are in color .

		At the chapter-ends are well-chosen lists of `` Books Rec - ommended '' for the use of the special reader .

		Professor
Hamlin	PERSON	, who occupies the chair of the
History of Architecture	ORGANIZATION	in
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, will receive thanks for a much desired and valuable service from instructors and students of architec - ture as a profession , from college lecturers and students who deal with it as a means to general culture , and from travellers and others who have a general interest in architecture .

		Hitherto , for anything like systematic treatment of the subject , we have had to rely upon scattered special articles and chapters in books , or upon works in foreign tongues , or upon more or less unmanageable works in English , none of which has afforded the concise , orderly , comprehensive , and beautifully illustrated treatment found in this volume .

		The general reader who wishes to look upon building with intelligent eyes will be glad of the opportunity to possess the means of cultivation the book affords ; and every library management should place it within the reach of its clientele as a means of stim - ulating appreciation of an art which is always before the public eye , on which the public money is spent more lavishly than upon any other art , and of whose identity as an art the great majority of the citizenship are singularly unappreciative .


1917	DATE	-RCB- THE DIAL 31 FOR BIBLIOPHILES .

		The Editors will be pleased to answer inquiries or to render to readers such services as are possible .

		The Pilgrims of
Plymouth	LOCATION	, always objects of interest in our history , are enjoying a renewal and - accentuation of that interest as the time draws near for celebrating the three hundredth anniver - sary of their landing .

Richard de Bury	PERSON	in his `` Philobiblon , '' is still timely .

		`` The Library Mis - cellany '' of Baroda -LRB- in

		For wars , being without the control of reason , make a wild assault on everything they come across , and lacking the check of reason they push on without discretion or distinction to destroy the vessels of reason . ''

		In the fourteenth century , as also before and since , it was lamented that `` so many thou - sands of innocents , in whose mouth was no guile , '' had been `` turned into stinking ashes '' by incend - iary hands .

		The
Riccardi Press	ORGANIZATION	, which confesses itself to be no press , but merely a name on the title-page of books printed for the

1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 33 completeness , as this set is believed to be not a leaf missing no one can tell .

		Curious details are still communicated by the
Virginia	LOCATION	assistant librarian , Mr.
Earl G. Swem	PERSON	.

		Different styles of binding mark the several political periods covered by the set .

		The first section -LRB- 1789-1800 -RRB- belonged originally to a nobleman of the ancien regime , who indignantly stopped his subscription with the rise of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second section -LRB- 1800-1814 -RRB- belonged to no less a personage than
Louis Philippe	PERSON	, whose private libraries were sold after his flight in
1830	DATE	.

		The period of the
Restoration	ORGANIZATION	covers a third section , which was owned by the above-mentioned nobleman , his subscription having been resumed after the usurper 's fall .

		The remain - ing volumes have also an interesting history , which can not be given here .

		Mr.
William Wilberforce Man	PERSON	, a
New York	LOCATION	attorney resident in
Paris	LOCATION	from
1848	DATE	to
1855	DATE	, made this notable collection of French newspapers , which now finds a fitting abode in the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		High prices for Americana have prevailed both last season and thus far in the present season .

		A recent sale of 193 lots at
Scott & O'Shaughnessy	ORGANIZATION	's in
New York	LOCATION	brought a total return of
$ 16,370.25	MONEY	, or nearly
$ 85	MONEY	per lot .

		Judge
Samuel Sewall	PERSON	's copy of the
Connecticut	LOCATION	Laws elicited the highest bid ,
$ 1600	MONEY	; Benjamin Lay 's rare treatise on sla - very , printed by
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, was sold for
$ 910	MONEY	; the autograph manuscript of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's first published poem , a short piece of twelve lines on `` The Taking of
Quebec	LOCATION	, and Death of General
Wolfe	PERSON	, '' brought
$ 1520	MONEY	, or
$ 126.66	MONEY	for each line , or , in still other terms ,
$ 16.17	MONEY	for each word .

		The unique `` Pilgrim 's Progress '' of
1681	DATE	Mr.
George D. Smith	PERSON	thought well worth
$ 1360	MONEY	, and Washing - ton 's invoice of his investments in
United States	LOCATION	securities changed hands for a consideration of
$ 825	MONEY	.

		Early Western history also evoked brisk bidding .

		Evidently the distracting events of the past two years have not diverted the collector of Americana from his favorite pursuit .

		The strain of war upon private libraries of Eng - land shows itself both in our imports of rare works that have been parted with for good American money , and in the announcements of auction sales in
London	LOCATION	.

		At
Sotheby	ORGANIZATION	's there are passing under the hammer such delectable rarities as the works of La Fontaine in seventy volumes , 1784-9 , bound in morocco by a book-binder of the period ; the 1755-9 edition of the Fables ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ``
King Lear	PERSON	, ''
1608	DATE	; two copies of the
Second Folio of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and one of the
Fourth Folio	ORGANIZATION	; divers
Bronte	PERSON	books , manuscripts , and letters ;
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's `` Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers '' ; treas - ures from the Halliwell-Phillips library ;
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	productions , some of these being presenta - tion copies from
William Morris	PERSON	; and two copies of the
Kilmarnock Burns	PERSON	, one of them in excellent condition and with some of its leaves unopened .

		Many of these and other like literary rarities will doubtless eventually find their way to our shores .

		It may seem hard that rich American collectors should thus profit by the distress of fellow-book - men across the ocean ; but it would be harder still for the pecuniarily embarrassed sellers if there were no well-to-do American buyers .

		On
December 30	DATE	,
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	celebrated his fifty-first birthday .

		With him , as with so many other English authors , the last year has been one devoted almost entirely to thoughts of the war and services to his country .

		Perhaps the most notable of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's writings in the last year is his series of papers describing the great
Jutland	LOCATION	sea battle which were of interest to Americans for their vivid pictures of the English navy in action .

		Besides the newspaper articles and a few poems he has written two short war books .

		One , ``
France	LOCATION	at War , on the Frontier of Civilization '' is an interpretation of the spirit of
France	LOCATION	and a state - ment to the English of their debt to the French Republic .

		The other book , `` The Fringes of the Fleet '' is a description of the `` mosquito '' or auxiliary fleet of small vessels which serve the dreadnaughts in so many ways .

		Three volumes of literary studies by Mr.

Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, which appeared ten years ago .


Browning	PERSON	and not
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	is to Mr.
Quayle	PERSON	the poet 's poet .


Don Quixote	PERSON	and
John Halifax	PERSON	and Caponsacchi , with divers other male characters familiar to readers of romance and poetry , form his motley company of gentlemen in fiction ; and in truth they are a goodly company , though Miss Mulock 's hero is rather too ostentatiously and self-con - sciously everything that is upright and honorable .

		The
Lowell	PERSON	book gives whole pages to extracts from that poet ; but it has also some heartily appreciative comment .

		Mr.
Quayle	PERSON	has a vigorous style , and he evidently knows what he likes .

		Rupert Hughes thus expresses his views as to why so many Americans are disposed to speak disparagingly of American literature : `` When as a boy in
Missouri	LOCATION	and
Iowa	LOCATION	, I used to be invited to eat at another boy 's house occasionally , I noticed a delightful flavor about the alien food that was lacking at home .

		As a matter of fact our own food was equally good and probably bet - ter ; at least , the boys from other homes eating at mine said so .

		Later I realized that , next to hunger , there is no better sauce than novelty .

		I was crediting other folks ' food with virtues it did not possess ; bringing to it what I did not find in it .

		People who read books are subject to this same palatial fallacy .

		Fed up on American life and its representation in fiction , they take up an English or a Russian novel and are greatly excited .

		They wonder why American fiction lacks the brilliance and profundity of foreign fiction .

		They write doleful essays explaining the reasons .

		The usual explanation , repeated till it nauseates with its parrot-squawks , is that Americans write in haste and for money .

		This was said of authors before
America	LOCATION	was discovered and is as true of one country as of another . ''

		This book might have been called `` The Eomance of the Ring '' as all of importance in regard to the sentimental , the religious , the mystic significance of finger rings from the early mythological rings to that embodiment of the skill of the modern gold - smith and jeweler , the little circlet which today , and every day , the lady receives from her lover is treated by Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	in a romantic and fascinating manner .

		Rings of famous men and women of past days , and the profuse lore concerning the luck or ill luck which go with certain stones or forms of circlets are two of the many interesting features .

		Others are the rings of savage peoples , the mechanism of modern manufacture , the history of ecclesiastical rings , and a full list of mottoes used in the old days upon betrothal and wedding rings .

		As a reference work its authoritative and exhaustive information makes it very valuable .

		77 AN ANNOUNCEMENT .

		In announcing Mr.
George Bernard Donlin	PERSON	as Editor the publisher takes occasion to make the following statement of the principles which will inspire the policy of THE DIAL : The original DIAL , with
Emerson	PERSON	among its contributors , reflected the best American radicalism of its day a radicalism long since absorbed into a respectable tradition .

		It was founded to express `` freer views than the con - servative journals are ready to welcome . ''

		When the present DIAL appeared , in
1880	DATE	, the editor said : `` THE DIAL has no desire to be classed with the destructive school of crit - icism . ''

		The announcement with which it began life was brief and modest ; but the service it was able to render under the wise guidance of the late
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	and his son , Mr.
Waldo E. Browne	PERSON	, is a part of the literary history of
America	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL , under its present management , will endeavor to carry on a fruitful tradition .

		It will try to meet the challenge of the new time by reflecting and interpreting its spirit a spirit freely experimental , skeptical of inherited values , ready to examine old dogmas and to submit afresh its sanctions to the test of experience .

		If criticism is peculiarly needed , it is because criticism , with its sharply intellectual values , its free curiosity , and its necessary concreteness , can share almost equally with creative writing the privilege , of revealing us to ourselves .

		And in a democ - racy such as ours no task is more worth while .

		THE DIAL hopes to bring to this task a sympathy without which understanding is impossible .

		It will address itself to all who find in books an enhancement and an inter - pretation of life .

		It will try to interest those who care for ideas and believe that in the free and vigorous circulation of opinion lies our best hope for the future .

		If we drop the schoolmaster 's birch , we are in no danger of being overwhelmed by insur - gent temperaments .

		Those who are familiar with current American criticism of the more serious kind will hardly need to be told that lawlessness is not the critic 's vice .

		The danger , indeed , lies all the other way .

		The 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	danger is that criticism , which strikes such deep roots in the past , may become a morbid growth , nourishing a few mouldy leaves on a monstrous underground network of memories , timidities , and conformities .

		We recognize no gap between the past and the present , and feel no divided allegiance .

		But in its task of orientation , a critical journal can , we feel , serve its purpose best by indicating drifts and tendencies , and by seeking just values of living men or suggesting -LRB- where so difficult a thing is possible -RRB- new valuations of the dead , rather than by repeating the familiar estimates of the textbook .

		Finally , THE DIAL wishes to announce that it is committed to no propaganda , is support - ing no cliques , schools , or movements .

		It will be free to say what it pleases , and it hopes to encourage talent of whatever sort by helping to create a community in which talent will feel more at home and in which it may be sure at least of the reward of intelligent apprecia - tion .

		POETRY AS A SPOKEN ART .

		To speak of poetry as a `` spoken art , '' may seem in this age of printing a misnomer ; and it is just because of such a point of view that the essential kinship of poetry and music is so often lost sight of .

		The `` beat '' of poetry , its musical quality , is exactly that which differentiates it from prose , and it is this musical quality which bears in it the stress of emotion without which no true poetry can exist .

		Prose itself when it is fused with emo - tion becomes rhythmic , which rhythm in turn heightens the emotional effect .

		The great orators of all time have been great because of their power to achieve this effect .

		Poetry and oratorical prose have this in common , that they are both intended primarily to be heard , not seen .

		We moderns read so much more than we listen , that perhaps it is no wonder if we get into the habit of using our minds more than our ears , where literature is concerned , with the result that our imaginative , mental ear becomes absolutely atrophied .

		What I mean by our imaginative , mental ear is this : Most of us possess quite a handsome degree of visual imagination .

		In reading a book , we visualize its scenes .

		If we are reading about an orchard with an old stone seat set in an angle under blossoming boughs , we see the orchard , and the seat , with a good deal of distinctness , before us .

		Of course , the degree to which we see it depends upon how highly developed our imaginative power is .

		But I have never met anyone so devoid of all such power as not to visualize to some extent the scenes of the story he was reading .

		Now here is a curious thing : In the case of the average person , auditory imagination is not nearly so well developed as visual .

		Why this should be , I do not know .

		Possibly it is the writer 's fault , or rather misfortune ; it may be easier to convey the impression of a sight than of a sound .

		Whatever the cause may be that we do not hear things off paper as well as we see them , the fact , I believe , is indisputable .

		No art has suffered so much from printing as has .

		poetry .

		Our cheap processes of color reproduction do not really reproduce the pic - ture whose name they bear , they are merely so many shorthand notes upon it .

		If we have seen the picture , they serve to remind us of it ; if we have not , they give us a kind of pass - port introduction to it when we meet it .

		They in no way attempt to replace the original picture , that exists apart from them , and no one would think of studying art by these reproductions alone .

		In the case of photo - graphs , we have a still more restricted form of memoranda .

		For in photography , colors can only be given as light and shade .

		Photo - graphs of paintings are more satisfactory than color reproductions , because the imagination has more scope and does its .

		work infinitely better than any mechanical color process can do .

		But take the case of poetry .

		Here we have no galleries of original pieces to which the art-hungry can turn .

		The reproduction , the printed book , is the only tangible substance which poetry has .

		If photography and color - printing are the conventionalized symbols of pictures , how much slighter , less adequate , are the conventionalized symbols of poetry .

		Printed words , of no beauty in themselves , of no value except to rouse the imagination and cause it to function .

		Again , take the case of music .

		Here we have a condition almost exactly similar to that of poetry , except for one thing .

		Printed notes are no more beautiful than printed words , but here comes in the one saving fact , nobody -LRB- except highly trained musicians -RRB- expects to read music , everybody is desirous of , insists upon , hearing it .

		Poetry is as much an art to be heard as is music , if we could only get people to under - stand the fact .

		To read it off the printed pages without pronouncing it is to get only a portion of its beauty , and yet it is just this that most people do .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 47 Of course , the reason here is very simple .


Wordsworth	PERSON	's `` Ode to Immortality '' is manu - factured with the very same tools we employ when we order the dinner .

		The tools in both cases are words .

		Everybody uses words , and uses them all the time .

		The most uneducated peasant talks .

		Words are the birthright of humanity .

		To be dumb is to be deformed .

		Using the common implements of all the world , poetry is treated with a cavalier ease which music escapes .

		A long and special training is required to learn and understand music .

		The layman does not carry a musical score home in his pocket to read in the
evening	TIME	.

		If he wants to hear Debussy 's '' Li ` Apres-midi d'un Faune , '' for instance , he goes to a concert , where an orchestra of care - fully trained musicians interprets it for him .

		Poetry will come into its Paradise when carefully trained speakers make a business of interpreting it to the world .

		And poetry needs such interpretation , for I suppose it is only one reader out of a hundred -LRB- and I think that percentage is rather high than otherwise -RRB- who can possibly get all the beauty out of a poem .

		Everyone knows that poetry existed before printing , and I imagine there is no doubt that it existed before writing , although , of course , that can not be proved .

		Even so recently as the Middle Ages , troubadours went from castle to castle chanting their poems to delighted listeners .

		For people listened then , partly because they could not read , and also because , even if they could , there were so few books .

		With the rise of printing , with the advent of a reading populace , poetry ceased to be chanted , ceased to be read aloud at all for the most part ; and the poet has suffered as a composer would suffer whose works were doomed to be rendered by no finer instrument than an accordion .

		Shakespeare is the greatest English poet who has ever existed , and doubtless he would have been considered so under all circum - stances .

		But
Shakespeare	PERSON	has certainly en - joyed one inestimable advantage over all purely lyric poets he has been acted for three hundred years , and that means that he has been spoken .

		People have heard his poetry rendered by men and women of extraordinary genius , who have spent their lives in studying it .

		The world has been forced to receive his poetry , the whole of his poetry , all its beauty of sound and content .

		There has been no excuse for misunderstand - ing him , and he has not been misunderstood , j To hear a man like Forbes-Robertson speak Hamlet 's words is like hearing
Kreisler	PERSON	play
Bach	PERSON	, an experience never to be forgotten .

		It is because we so seldom hear poetry adequately rendered that the art has for so long lapsed in popular favor .

		For years only those people trained to receive it as audible impression through the sense of sight have been able thoroughly to comprehend it .

		The few people who attempt to read it aloud are handicapped by the realization of the unusual quality of their task , and lose their sense of proportion and simplicity in the welter of artistic theories of expression which have gradually come into being .

		Let us examine a few of these theories , and see in what way they have hampered the enjoyment of poetry , and its simple , straightforward appeal .

		I remember once hearing Sir
Johnston	PERSON	Forbes-Robertson say that there was a good tradition of acting , and a poor tradition , and that because the latter existed was no reason to decry the former .

		That is as true of the reading of poetry aloud as of acting .

		But the trouble is that the good tradition is only one , and there are ninety and nine poor traditions to balance it .

		At least , actors have some training , but with poetry readers , if they have any , it is invariably one of the ninety and nine .

		I. suppose that is because there is a good deal of extraneous technique about acting which can be taught , whereas the read - ing of poetry is a very subtle thing and almost incommunicable .

		Tell a person to put feeling into his voice , and behold , he puts in sentimentality .

		Tell him to vary his voice with the different speakers , and he gives you a ventriloquistic effect which is horrible .

		The truth is , it is a question of the inch on the end of a man 's nose .

		The slightest inflection awry and the whole effect is spoilt .

		Speaking lines in a modern play is a com - paratively easy thing , reading poetry is quite different .

		In a play , one can rely to a certain extent upon acting , and upon one 's fellow actors .

		In reading , one is all alone , and one must not act .

		I do not mean that one should not read with expression .

		I mean that it is more dangerous to overdo dramatic expres - sion than to underdo it .

		Reading is not acting , and the point can not be too strongly insisted upon .

		The pitfall of all elocution-taught readers is that they fail to see this distinction .

		Great actresses like
Sara Bernhardt	PERSON	or
Duse	PERSON	do not make this mistake , it is the little people who are not sure of their power of creating an effect by an in - flection who fall into the error .

		Again , the reader must not be confused with the impersonator .

		Impersonators act out their parts , although they are all alone upon the stage .

		They are approaching the 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	brains of their audiences from the same stand - point as the actor .

		They are acting in fact .

		This point is the crux of the situation .

		In a play , the audience is intended to see the march of events with its physical eyes .

		It is , as it were , looking through a window at an actual scene .

		It must be made to feel the reality of what is before it .

		Even in mystical plays like
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's `` Peleas and Melisande , '' the audience must have the sense of actuality .

		Dream world though it be , it is for the moment real .

		In reading , the impression to be made upon an audience is achieved by quite other means .

		Here the audience must see nothing with its eyes which detracts from its mental vision .

		It must be made to imagine so vividly that it forgets the reader in the thing read .

		The dramatic quality of the piece must be given just in so far as it stimulates imagination , but never so far as to call attention to the reader as an actual personality .

		I have said that there is a good tradition of speaking poetry , and ninety and nine bad traditions .

		Let us consider for a moment the bad traditions .

		-LRB- I shall take the word `` read - ing '' to imply the pronouncing of poetry aloud , whether it be done in character on the stage , or in propria persona from the plat - form . -RRB-

		The first bad tradition is the mispronounc - ing of words .

		This starts from a misconcep - tion of the laws of English prosody , and a desire to heighten the poetical effect by some elegance other than those the author thought fit to insert .

		The word most mispronounced in the whole vocabulary , by poetry readers and singers alike , is `` wind . ''

		Unless the reader or singer is very well educated indeed , so well educated that he or she knows enough to be quite simple and natural , that unhappy word changes at once to `` winde . ''

		Why ?

		What is the reason for the change ?

		The reason , in the case of nine readers out of ten , is merely that they have been taught to do it .

		But the reason which has actuated those teachers who have thought about the matter at all and not , them - selves , repeated , parrot-like , from some earlier master , is based upon ignorance of the rules under which English poetry is written .

		Why was `` wind '' ever pronounced `` winde '' in poetry , for it never is , and never was , in prose ?

		Can not we imagine the reason ?

		Not a bad reason when one is in ignorance of any prosodaic laws .

		It was because poets insisted upon rhyming it with `` find , '' and `` bind , '' and other words where the `` i '' was obviously long .

		To pronounce it with a long `` i '' saved the rhyming sound , thought these wiseacres , and that this pronunciation took all the windy connotations away from the word was to them of minor importance .

		Elocution teachers are seldom concerned with le mot juste ; `` winde '' sounded like a perfect rhyme , `` wind '' did not , so `` winde '' it had to be .

		But the good old English prosody which served
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	PERSON	so excellently well , had one life-saving rule .

		It was that words spelt the same and pro- nounced differently , rhymed ; as did also words pronounced the same and spelt differ - ently .

		For instance , `` plough '' rhymed with `` cow , '' an obvious chime , as we have recog - nized by spelling `` bough '' with an `` ow '' instead of the old `` ough '' ; also `` peak '' rhymed with `` break , '' and `` push '' with `` rush , '' and `` deaf '' with `` sheaf . ''

		All these non-chiming rhymes we have kept , probably because of the difficulty of changing them to fit .

		For we all balk at the `` pake '' of a mountain , or at a brook `` rooshing '' down a hill , and few of us can `` puush '' ourselves to make such radical changes .

		It is true that in old times `` deaf '' was universally pronounced `` deef , '' but good use has altered it to `` deaf '' without altering its co-rhymes , and he would be a bold man who should dare to speak of a `` sheff '' of wheat for any reason whatso - ever .

		In recent years , a group of poetasters has arisen that declares these near-rhymes to be an offense to the ear , and proudly eschews them .

		A reform which would command more sympathy had these precious gentlemen pro- duced a single masterpiece to substantiate it .

		They have not ; and the reason is not far to seek .

		The old , great masters knew their job , and knew it superlatively well .

		They realized that the English language suffers from a paucity of rhymes .

		A certain elasticity was necessary if thought was to be adequately clothed in metre and rhyme .

		Being artists , not pedants , they found this elasticity , as I have shown .

		Now we understand how `` wind '' came to be tortured into `` winde , '' and can see why the latter is never under any circumstances to be employed .

		An important rule for the reading of poetry is never to mispronounce words .

		Give them the sound they have in everyday speech , and let the blunder of a false rhyme , if there be one , rest on the author .

		Another of the bad traditions insists that poetry should be read as if it were prose .

		That is , that the reader should follow the punctuation marks and not the swing of the metre .

		This arose as a protest to the equally bad tradition which dropped the voice at the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 49 end of each line , regardless of the sense .

		Of course , monotony was the result of this latter practice .

		The sense of the poem was lost , while the rhythm was exaggerated out of all proportion .

		People have often taken issue with the proposition that poetry should not be read as if it were prose .

		People who have not grasped the meaning , that is .

		`` But , '' they say , `` surely you do n't like to have poetry read in a sing-song manner . ''

		Assuredly , I do not ; and yet I say , unhesitatingly , that if one must choose between these two bad tradi - tions , I prefer to have the rhythm over - accented than to have it lost sight of alto - gether .

		As a matter of fact , neither extreme is necessary .

		The good tradition , as is the way with good traditions , seeks the happy mean .

		Blank verse is a long , stately metre com - posed of simple , dignified feet .

		It is rare to find a blank verse poem in which the rhythms should be more than faintly indicated .

		But there are other metres in which the effect is entirely lost unless the rhythm is brought out so strongly as to become almost a lilt .

		We must suppose that the poet knew what he was about when he chose one metre rather than another .

		It is an impertinence to obscure his rhythm , and not give it its full value .

		But , it may be asked , how is one to know when a rhythm is to be merely indicated , and when it is to be actively stressed ?

		I can only reply that much experience is required to know this .

		But experience is a sure guide .

		Knowledge of an author 's methods , sympathy with the aim of the poem , a realization that certain metres require certain renderings , all these things tell the reader what he should do .

		In the last analysis , it is common sense , and nowhere is common sense more needed than in the reading of poetry .

		Take the case of vers libre .

		For that to be misunderstood is both strange and unfor - tunate , since it owes its inception to no per - sonal idiosyncrasy , but has been slowly evolved from existing laws .

		This is so little comprehended that hysterical people are con - stantly asking what it is , and whether it is prose or poetry , and is it destined entirely to supersede metrical verse .

		To answer these questions categorically , let us begin with the last .

		Art has fashions ; or if you prefer the term as more dignified , it is subject to the law of evolution .

		Differences are constantly being evolved ; some are real changes , some only samenesses with a twist to them .

		Art , like life , has a queer way of revolving upon itself .

		Personally I feel that vers libre and metrical verse can exist side by side as cheerfully as do blank verse and quatrains .

		But this will not happen until people realize that vers libre is a prosodaic form , and not an invitation to loose all the seven devils upon the reading public .

		The second question , whether vers libre is poetry or prose , can be treated quite sum - marily .

		It is assuredly poetry .

		That it may dispense with rhyme , and must dispense with metre , does not affect its substance in the least .

		For no matter with what it dispenses , it retains that essential to all poetry : Rhythm .

		Where stanzas are printed in an even pat - I tern of metrical lines , some sense of rhythm ; can be gained by the eye .

		Where they are not , as in vers libre , the reading aloud be - i comes an absolute condition of comprehension .

		; If the modern movement in poetry could be : defined in a sentence , the truest thing which could be said of it , and which would include I all its variations , would be that it is a move - I ment to restore the audible quality to poetry , ; to insist upon it as a spoken art .

		AMY
LOWELL	LOCATION	.

		JACK
LONDON	LOCATION	AS
TITAN	ORGANIZATION	.

		They tell us that
Xanthippe	PERSON	, the very firm wife of
Socrates	LOCATION	, could never understand the reason for her husband 's fame in
Athens	LOCATION	.

		At home he was sufficiently meek and domestic , and his patented method for getting the better of an argument did n't work there .

		He received scant honor in his own household .

		After all , he was only a husband , and there were a great many husbands .

		In the same way ,
Jack London	PERSON	, who is rejected by the literary elite in his own country , has been hailed as a mighty prophet in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		A few years ago a Russian critic said , `` Nowadays , all the adult population of
Russia	LOCATION	is reading
Jack London	PERSON	. ''

		And lectures were given on his works , articles written ; his complete works were issued by two publishing houses , and many other translations appeared .


Jack London	PERSON	became the vogue in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is interesting to notice that all this hap - pened in those agitated days when the Russian intellectuals were being aroused to a strange fervor by
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	, the exponent of individual - ism , of the strong man whose life might be consumed in the performance of one heroic and mighty deed , but the deed would be done .

		And the intellectuals began to wor - ship action , power , personality , that compel - ling force of character which projects ideas and thoughts into the outer reality of deeds .

		Jack
London	LOCATION	's heroes were men of this type .

		They had a virile and unquenchable thirst for 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	adventure ; they were big , fresh , and invent - ive creatures of a New World of action and enterprise ; they were fascinating vikings to the fervent , hectic , impractical intellectuals of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		One of the first in
Russia	LOCATION	to hail
Jack London	PERSON	as a writer of unusual talent was
Leonid Andreyev	PERSON	, the well-known dramatist and author of short-stories .

		He calls
Jack London	PERSON	the representative of the Anglo-Saxon race , the strong manly race , `` the race of doers . ''

		He finds in the American author a talent and will directed toward the affirmation of life :
London	LOCATION	has a glorious place among the strong ones .

		His talent is organic , like good blood , fresh and strong .

		His inventiveness is rich , his experience - enormous and personal , like that of Kipling or
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	... You read him , and it is as though you leave some narrow lane and find yourself amid the broad expanse of the sea , breathe in salt air , and you feel your muscles growing stronger , and hear the imperious call of an ever primitive life to work and struggle ... The enemy of impotence and decrepitude , of fruitless lamentation and pity , under the sour mask of which is hidden an absence of will to live and struggle ,
Jack London	PERSON	calmly buries the dead , making straight the road for the living , that is why his funerals are as gay as a wedding .

		He is of the race of men who subject chaos to will , and turn outcries into songs .

		On the other hand , a Russian critic ,
K. Chukovsky	PERSON	, holds that
London	LOCATION	has been greatly overrated .

		He passes a delightful judgment on the American writer , calling him `` A Yankee , a salesman in a derby , playing Zarathustra or
Byron	PERSON	, and dealing in oceans , tempests ,
Lucifers	LOCATION	, prairies .

		Working for the firm of
` Struggle and Elemental Powers	ORGANIZATION	' he forces upon us all kinds of shop-worn stuff which has been lying about on the European market since the days of Chateaubriand . ''

		But
Kuprin	PERSON	, a great novelist and realist , in his `` Note on
Jack London	PERSON	, '' ranks the Amer - ican with Kipling , finds him an original and highly talented writer , whose chief qualities are simplicity , clarity , untamed force of poetic conception , and manly beauty of style .

		In the same strain , an eminent Russian critic ,
Kranichfeld	PERSON	, accounts for the Russian delight in
Jack London	LOCATION	by the quality of his art , `` the living nerve of which is the pathos of struggling . ''

		Kranichfeld contrasts
London	LOCATION	's vigorous art with the moody , despairing spirit of modern Russian litera - ture .

		But the Russian critics are united in the belief that all the distinctive qualities of
London	LOCATION	's art and style are truly American .

		According to Chukovsky he is `` the poet of the fist , '' and another Russian ,
Volsky	PERSON	, writes : `` Dark , devious passion is the business of old
Europe	LOCATION	; the American is enamored of force .

		Primitive love , primitive hate , stub - born will , the storming of life , inability to generalize and a distrust of generalization such is
Jack London	PERSON	, for such is
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Praise so bewildering and unwarranted will scarcely disturb even those Americans who remember our strange neglect of
Poe	PERSON	during the days when
Europe	LOCATION	was crowning him true poet .

		Yet how can one be reconciled to the preposterous mating of
Jack London	PERSON	,
Kipling	LOCATION	, and
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	?

		We must remember that this is not the personal judgment of one eminent Russian .

		As we have seen ,
Kuprin	PERSON	, who , next to
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	, is the greatest of the liv - ing writers of
Russia	LOCATION	, couples
London	LOCATION	with Kipling in the calm , assured manner of one saying the most natural thing in the world .

		I have heard Russians group
Jack London	PERSON	with Kipling -LRB- and
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	-RRB- so many times , that I have almost recovered from the first bewilderment occasioned by the comparison .

		But this verdict of fairly representative Rus - sian critics is more than an entertaining side - light on foreign opinion of American litera - ture .

		It means that when a critic crosses the boundary and carries with him his native standards , he will inevitably go astray .

		But it means , too , that if we can learn to know foreign standards of critical measurement , our reward will be not only a deeper insight into the alien literature , but also an `` illum - inated '' desire for more patient and earnest searching of our own .

		In the case of Russian criticism it is neces - sary to remember that , since the days of the critics
Chernuishevski	PERSON	,
Pisarev	PERSON	, and
Bielinski	PERSON	, the test of a work of art has been : `` Does it explain life ?

		does it pass an opinion on life the life of our own day ? ''

		^ Esthetic qual - ities verbal magic , artistic shaping , inevit - ableness of form , purgation of superfluities are to the Russian intellectuals merely extraneous , secondary , and of very little moment .

		Pisarev expresses the idea with impatient and quite uncritical dogmatism : `` A poet must be either a Titan who shakes to the very foundation mountains of evil , or else a worm crawling in the dust .

		There is nothing between except clowns to amuse fools . ''

		So that the Russian looks to literature for social programmes ; for solutions to the `` accursed problems of life . ''

		In such a work as
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	's `` The Jungle , '' the Russian intellec - tual hails an attempt to shake `` to the very foundation mountains of evil . ''

		He is stirred by its tremendous earnestness , by its brave attack on something evil in the `` existing order , '' an outspoken attack , mind you , not a guarded one !

		It is a protest , a manifesto , a `` social document . ''

		It must be discussed , it is a great work of art .

		With the same
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 51 uncritical naivete the intelligentsia couple
Jack London	PERSON	with
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both , say the Russians , are valiant explorers on the illimit - able plain of life one in
India	LOCATION	, the other in
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		Both are creators of manly men , powerful in action and the storming of obstacles .

		And just as
Artsibashev	LOCATION	, brooding , diseased , robbed of strength and vitality , por - trays the passionate , self-centred , `` superbly sexed '' man , so the Russian intellectuals pay homage to a masculine effrontery , a stern assertiveness , which they lack and most long for .

		And strong desire is never critical ; its eyes are lacking in discernment .

		There is something pathetic in the `` realism '' of the Russian intellectuals , in their renun - ciation of beauty , shapeliness , and idealization because of the grim resolve never to cease combating ugliness , distortion , and evil , until these shall be no more .

		But more tragic is that strange twist in their `` idealism '' which makes them identify life with visible action and outer victory , with the superman , brief master of all but himself .

		They have not fathomed the full meaning of
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	's words : `` All of a man 's life may be consumed in the doing of one deed , but that deed must be beautiful , splendid , free . ''

		Perhaps the Rus - sian intellectuals of to-day and not they alone have yet to learn that for the finding of such deeds men will need a balance and sanity , an inner health and nobility for which the hurried superman of action has no time to wait .


L. S. FRIEDLAND	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A MARTYRDOM SO APPALLING as that COn - fessed by Mr.
Edward J. O'Brien	PERSON	in the ``
Boston	LOCATION	Transcript '' is surely a phenomenon worth attending to .

		During the last year , he read some twenty-seven hundred short-stories , an average of about seven and a half a day , making no allowance for
Sundays	DATE	or holi - days .

		For sheer tenacity and pluck his record is probably unequalled , and it would be im - possible to over-estimate the altruism that prompts him to breast this flood of words annually in order to chart for us the obscure drifts and currents of magazine literature .

		He offers us , as usual , his selected list of fifty - two stories , the `` best , '' set off with one star , two stars , or three stars , according to quality .

		Captious persons may object to hav - ing literature graded after the summary fashion of a brandy , or protest that works ought not to be crowned by so private an academy ; but these are old-fashioned preju - dices that can not be allowed to block an obvious gain in efficiency .

		We know that standardization has greatly facilitated the production of the short-story .

		Why should it not do as much for criticism ?

		PROFESSOR
BARRETT	PERSON	WENDELL 'S RETIREMENT '' from service as professor of English at Har - vard comes as a surprise to those who still remember , as if it were yesterday , his assump - tion of the duties he has for thirty-six years so creditably fulfilled .

		It was in
1880	DATE	that he was appointed instructor in English , being then but three years out of college ; eight years later he became assistant professor , and in
1898	DATE	professor .

		Upon the successive classes that have listened to his teachings he has left impressions of a fine literary taste , an original and often whimsically humorous manner of imparting his knowledge and delivering his opinions , a thorough command of his subject , and , not least of all , a notable personality .

		Outside the classroom his work in literature has borne fruit in more than a dozen books , beginning with two good novels , and innum - erable contributions to periodicals .

		A partial list of titles may be of interest here : `` The Duchess Emilia , '' `` Rankell 's Remains , '' `` Cot - ton Mather , the Puritan Priest , '' `` English Composition , '' `` Stelligeri , and Other Essays Concerning America , '' ``
William Shake	PERSON	- speare , '' `` A Literary History of
America	LOCATION	, '' `` Raleigh in
Guiana	LOCATION	, '' `` Rosamond , '' `` A Christmas Masque , '' `` The Temper of the Sev - enteenth Century in English Literature , '' `` The Privileged Classes . ''

		Professor
Wendell	PERSON	was
Clark Lecturer	PERSON	at
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cam	PERSON	- bridge
University	ORGANIZATION	, in
1902-3	DATE	, and lectured at the Sorbonne and other French universities in
1904-5	DATE	.

		His occasional contributions to THE DIAL have helped , as they will still con - tinue to help , to make him no stranger to its readers .

		He is made professor emeritus upon , his relinquishment of his present chair .

		FOR AMERICAN RHODES SCHOLARS and others interested in the things of the intellect there is published quarterly , at
Menasha	LOCATION	, Wis - consin , a magazine entitled `` The American ' Oxonian , '' being `` the official magazine of the
Alumni Association of American Rhodes Scholars	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It prints a yearly address list of our Rhodes graduates , and by means of perti - nent editorials and special articles seeks to - make itself interesting and useful to them and to other educated readers .

		Not far from four hundred names appear in its address list of this year , with ninety-eight `` old Oxonians - 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	not Rhodes scholars '' resident in this country .

		A ta ` ste of its quality may be had in a brief extract from an article by its editor , Professor
Frank Aydelotte	PERSON	, on `` Militarism and Fear . ''

		Deprecating any outcome of the war that should amount to a glorification of military might , he says : `` As the Preparedness move - ment gains momentum in this country we need to look to it that we know where we are going to stop .

		Not that a few regiments and ships will do us any harm : they will not un - less they make us forget that we can only have peace in this world on the basis of friendship , and that when nations begin to prepare against each other friendship evaporates . ''

		That
Menasha	LOCATION	, in what would have been called , not so very long ago , the wilds of Wis - consin , should be the home of so high-class a publication as `` The American Oxonian '' par - takes of the startling to such a degree that one looks twice at the title-page to make sure of having made no mistake .

		CULTURE BY CORRESPONDENCE is winning increased favor .

		Not only do the activities of the privately managed correspondence schools multiply from year to year , but also the col - leges and universities are looking kindly upon the system and beginning to adopt it .

		The
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	has for several years offered correspondence courses , and now a great eastern university -LRB-
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is about to extend still further its university exten - sion work by bestowing some of its benefits upon persons unable to attend lectures or join classes in the classroom .

		Dr.
James E. Egbert	PERSON	, director of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	's extension courses , has for some time been striving to add the correspondence system to this depart - ment , and now seems likely to succeed .

		One pleasing feature of instruction by letter is that it is more likely to devote itself to lan - guage and literature and similar studies of the old-time sort than to electricity and plumbing and bridge-building and kindred utilitarian courses of the more modern era .

		TO THE CREDIT OP THE DAILY THEME , which has brought considerable discredit upon itself for its inadequacy as a means to a desirable end , a writer in `` The Century '' records a pleasing incident .

		This form of undergradu - ate torture -LRB- the daily theme -RRB- , invented , it is said , by a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professor , and now applied by nearly every college instructor in English from
Bowdoin	LOCATION	to
Leland Stanford	LOCATION	, gave to the late
Jean Webster	PERSON	-LRB- later Mrs.
McKinney	PERSON	-RRB- `` her first real opportunity to develop her natural gifts , and in recognition of them the young freshman was appointed local corre - spondent to a
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	paper . ''

		But she came near losing her job by developing a nose for news of more than doubtful authenticity .

		When upon one occasion a noted astronomer paid a visit to
Vassar	LOCATION	, the young reporter accepted as gospel a fanciful tale told her concerning this eminent scientist by a fun - loving junior with a heart not free from guile .

		A notable stir was created by the appearance of the fabrication in print ; but
Jean Webster	PERSON	mastered her mortification and , on the princi - ple that men may rise on stepping-stones of their dead selves to higher things , turned the incident to account in a short-story that won acceptance with the editor of a monthly mag - azine .

		This led to other similar ventures , and the permanent result in book form , which marked the end of her senior year , was the volume entitled `` When Patty Went to Col - lege , '' which her friendly but not over - grammatical biographer pronounces `` the best volume of undergraduate stories that have emanated from a woman 's college . ''

		And so , if the first round in this too-short ladder of fame was the daily theme , let not its virtues be too hastily decried .

		JAPANESE INFLUENCE ON WESTERN CULTURE , though never likely to equal Western influ - ence on Japanese culture , promises to be something less superficial than mere varnish or japan , one might say .

		An alphabet not greatly in excess of our own in number of characters was a few years ago devised for the writing and printing of Japanese ; and though its adoption may be slower than even the gradual acceptance of the Roman alphabet in
Germany	LOCATION	, yet it must greatly facilitate the learning of the language on the part of for - eigners .

		Last
September	DATE
Columbia Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity introduced the study of Japanese under Mr.
S. Tominas	PERSON	, and another class for begin - ners will be started in
February	DATE	.

		The sum - mer session will also have its elementary course in that language .

		The Japanese Soci - ety , founded ten years ago to promote `` friendly relations between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, '' and also to diffuse a better knowledge of the
Island Kingdom	LOCATION	, has now a membership of about one thousand , mostly Americans , with a waiting list of more than thirty applicants .

		Its `` Bulletin '' of Decem - ber 30 announces that `` the
Washington	LOCATION	Square Players are presenting at the Comedy Theatre in
New York City	LOCATION	one of
Japan	LOCATION	's most interesting old tragedies , ` Bushido . '

		It is evident that great care has been taken in
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 53 the way of authentic and accurate detail of production , and the acting is dignified and in entire keeping with the spirit of the drama . ''

		Significant in its way is the fact that there are now more than two thousand Japanese living in
New York City	LOCATION	, and in the colleges of that city alone are about one hundred and fifty Japanese students .

		HOPEFUL SIGNS IN THE BOOK-TRADE are the more welcome at this time because of the con - siderable number of signs of an opposite character in other walks of life .

		`` The Pub - lishers ' Weekly , '' while acknowledging that since the war began the producers of reading matter have reposed on no bed of roses , is glad to record that `` by the end of
1915	DATE	busi - ness had entirely regained its wind after the war scare of 1914-15 , and in
1916	DATE	a prosper - ous
spring	DATE	was succeeded by an unusually strong
summer	DATE	, followed in turn by one of the best holiday seasons in several years . ''

		No publishing house failed in the year just closed , and a good half-dozen promising new firms started in the business , with a number of less conspicuous ventures to swell the list .

		Better quarters were opened and new branches estab - lished here and there as ocular evidences of prosperity .

		Fifty-five new bookshops , a nota - ble increase , opened their doors .

		Bookshops conducted by women sprang into being in many places , as the Woman 's Book Shop in
New York	LOCATION	, the Gardenside Shop and the Book Shop for Boys and Girls in
Boston	LOCATION	, and the Hampshire Book Shop in
Northampton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		There was also an increasing tendency toward cooperation in the book-trade , as evidenced by a number of new state booksellers ' associa - tions .

		The
American Booksellers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, by choosing a middle-western city for its annual convention , gave impetus to this move - ment , especially in
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, and
Kansas	LOCATION	, where state organizations were effected , while
New Jersey	LOCATION	took similar action in the
East	LOCATION	.

		The outlook for literature on its business side , as also from a less commercial standpoint , is encouraging rather than the reverse as the year opens .

		THE TIMID BROWSER , whether in book-store or public library , is he who abruptly ceases his browsing and takes flight at the first sign of approach , with commercial or professional intent , on the part of book-seller or librarian .

		Many a succulent literary pasture has been vacated incontinently because of such ill - considered advances , whereas if the browser had been suffered to continue his browsings unnoticed , results profitable to all concerned might have ensued .

		There is a certain seller of books in
Portland	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, who evidently understands the psychology of the browser .

		A card in his show-window reads in the manner following -LRB- as we find it printed , with appro - priate comment , in the ``
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin '' -RRB- : `` Spend a minute or an hour or as long as you like , browsing among the books .

		A little while spent in our book department each day will go far toward familiarizing you with the many important new books of each season .

		It is considered quite proper at
Gill	ORGANIZATION	's to look without buying , and if you use the ` phone , it is safe to buy at
Gill	PERSON	's without looking . ''

		But in
Germany	LOCATION	they have carried still further the art of pleasing the browser .

		Packages of books , presumably suited to the taste of a certain bookishly inclined person -LRB- who at the same time may be considered a possible buyer -RRB- , are left at his door for leis - urely examination , with only the vaguest moral obligation on his part to do more than browse among the volumes thus submitted .

		THE HIGH COST OF RARE BOOKS more than keeps pace with the high cost of living .

		The good old days when even the out-at-elbows prowler among musty bookstalls could pick up a priceless treasure -LRB- for a shilling or two -RRB- and become a collector in a small way , will never come again .

		In the history of the world 's highest-priced printed book , the
Gutenberg Bible	ORGANIZATION	now in the library of Mr.
Henry E. Huntington	PERSON	, may be seen a striking instance of the late rapid increase in the market value of rare old books .

		In the eighteenth century this handsome volume , printed on vellum , belonged to one
Otto H. von Nostitz	PERSON	, who is said to have acquired it from a library in
Mainz	LOCATION	.

		From him it passed into the possession of a Mr.
Horn	PERSON	, and is next heard of as sold in
1825	DATE	by the
London	LOCATION	book - sellers ,
Messrs. Nicol	PERSON	, to a dealer named Arch , who in turn sold it to
Henry Perkins	PERSON	, a wealthy brewer , for a sum equivalent in our money to
$ 2520	MONEY	.

		Nearly half a century later , or in
1873	DATE	, it was bought at the
Perkins	PERSON	sale by
Ellis	PERSON	, the book-dealer , for
Lord Ashburn	PERSON	- ham ; at the
Ashburnham	LOCATION	sale in
1897	DATE	it went to
Bernard Quaritch	PERSON	for
$ 20,000	MONEY	.

		Quaritch passed it on to
Eobert Hoe	ORGANIZATION	, and at the recent Hoe sale it was bought by Mr.
George D. Smith	PERSON	for Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	at
$ 50,000	MONEY	.

		Thus in less than a century the book gained twentyfold in value , and in the
last sixteen years	DATE	of its commercial history it advanced
150 per cent	MONEY	.

		I wish to send you a word of thanks for the article in THE DIAL for
December	DATE	28th , by Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	, entitled `` Seeing It Through . ''

		This is sound and solid stuff , so sound and so solid that I am surprised that Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	wrote it and that THE DIAL printed it !

		JOHN COTTON DANA .


Newark	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
January 6 , 1917	DATE	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is the presence in the world of so many indif - ferent souls , worthy neither of salvation nor dam - nation , that brings about such events in literature as the appearance of
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's latest novel `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Sees It Through , '' and Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	's brilliant and gripping estimate of that novel .

		Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	reveals himself , in his review , as of those fervid souls who take their literature as seriously as they take their religion ; and , so inspired , he proceeds gallantly to take a fine fall out of the philosophy of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		Taking literature seri - ously is a sad malady , particularly when it comes to philosophy in a novel by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		What is the
Wells	LOCATION	philosophy ?

		Does anybody know ?

		Does Mr.
Wells	PERSON	know ?

		The most luminous view of the
Wells	LOCATION	philosophy is that it is an individual philosophy in process of evolution ; this , interest - ing as it is , may mean anything or nothing to the world 's development .

		Has Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	, hith - erto , been reading the novels of
H. G. Wells	PERSON	on his knees , as fanatics read the Bible ?

		Mr.
Britling	PERSON	may or may not be Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		That is immaterial .

		The too hastily written novel , `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Sees It Through , '' having been pub - lished , is to be judged apart from any idiosyncrasy of its author , if judged fairly .

		Then , too , this book is interesting for more than its philosophy : it is interesting for its wealth of compassion , its fight between bruised pride and reason .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is an artist and his Mr.
Britling	PERSON	the creation of an artist , a very consistent creation .

		That the dogs of war should have bayed Mr.
Britling	PERSON	away from his map-drawing to his troubled conception of God for consolation and sustenance , when he conceived the little gods of his materialistic philosophy to be crashing and crumbling , is entirely within the limits of a realistic philosophy of life as it must be lived , and of human experience .

		I should like to remind Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	that the Man of
Nazareth	LOCATION	is still dynamic .

		Mr.
Britling	PERSON	see his way through to a Finite God , complains Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	, conveying the idea that Mr.
Britling	PERSON	sees his way through not at all .

		What manner of God a Finite God may be , passes conception .

		Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	makes a mess of defining the Infinite as does Mr.
Britling	PERSON	, as must every mortal constrained to see through a glass darkly .

		`` And , '' affirms Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	, registering the gravity which
Wells	PERSON	's latest book creates , `` the number of Americans who , under the spell of the book , will see , like a burst of light before their eyes , how impossible it was for Mr.
Britling	PERSON	or any American spectator to come to any other consola - tion this will be the index of what the war is doing to our education , of how it is setting back our struggle after a modern and realistic philos - ophy of life . ''

		Let Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	not be troubled .

		It is only the occasional American reader who takes his litera - ture seriously .

		Fortunately , perhaps .

		Where the philosophic Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has one reader , authors devoid of philosophy have hundreds .

		American devourers of fiction , even the meaty stuff of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, would have been just as well satisfied , just as much entertained , had Mr.
Britling	PERSON	returned to what Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	affirms to be the one hope left him map-drawing .

		The solvents of forgetful - ness and lust for the next `` new thing '' may be taken into account .

		The gravity of the situation created by `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Sees It Through '' is little more serious than that of `` Bealby , '' which upset the gravity of joyous thousands .


HARRY B. KENNON	PERSON	.


Evanston	LOCATION	, 111. ,
January 14 , 1917	DATE	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I suppose Mr.
Randolph Bourne	PERSON	considers him - self one of that group of detached critics , who , by sheer intellectual superiority , rises above the muddy thinking of the naive reader , and who , therefore , has a responsibility to guide him , the reader , to unemotionalized , objective conclusions concerning a book .

		If Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	is a detached thinker , I can see no evidence of this beatific state of mind in his review of
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Sees It Through '' in the issue for
December 28th	DATE	.

		His statement , `` There is still a possibility that Mr.
Britling	PERSON	may not be Mr.
Wells	PERSON	himself but rather a mere ironic portrait of the very modern Briton bouleverse by the personal thrust of the war .

		If this is so , the ` seeing it through ' to an end which materializes only in a
Finite God	ORGANIZATION	is a touch of Wellsian humor too deeply ironic '' is as thorough a piece of subjective crit - icism as I have ever found .

		It is noteworthy that Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	quotes no single passage from the novel to support his statement that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's mood is ironic .

		I wonder if he can find just one .

		The whole review is
Bourne	LOCATION	not
Wells	LOCATION	.

		I suppose , though , that to set forth one 's own ideas at the expense of the author is the function of the critic .

		Unfortunately I prefer a novelist interpreted not distorted .

		Of course , Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	's purpose is sound .

		He is afraid that , under Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's dangerous leader - ship , Americans will slip back into the unfounded , gratifying faith that
Wells	PERSON	's God Himself , and not men themselves , will bring this evolving world to a happy consummation .

		To be sure , such a faith numbs the will , leads people into pantheistic sen - sualism , and will drive the new republic , for which Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	is striving , on the rocks .

		But even so , is Mr.
Bourne	PERSON	justified in misinterpreting
Wells	PERSON	's honest religious fervor , to make his point ?


M. H. HEDGES	PERSON	.


Beloit	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
January 5 , 1917	DATE	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 55 PUBLISHERS AND , WRITERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I hope you will publish more articles by
John L. Hervey	PERSON	as sound in reasoning and as frank in statement as that contained in your issue of
Novem	DATE	- ber 2nd .

		Few publishers truly interested in the development of literature are likely to differ with Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's conclusions .

		An additional reason for the falling off of interest in the work of
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	might , however , be presented .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	early fell into the hands of the liter - ary agent and apparently left to the literary agent the task of attending to his relations with pub - lishers .

		That is doubtless why his original pub - lishers to quote Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	`` long since yielded him to a rival and that rival to another and his successive books show an increasing variety of imprints . ''

		Actual knowledge of the way the business affairs of other distinguished authors have been handled and some bits of definite information impel me to believe that , after Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's first success , demands in connection with the publica - tion of his later books were such that his original publishers could not profitably accept them , and so one after another publisher has been induced to contract for later books in the hope that his early success might be duplicated , but in most cases finding their hopes shattered and the pub - lisher a gainer only in experience .

		The commercial loss by such procedure will be evident to anyone acquainted with book publishing conditions in
America	LOCATION	, but there is still another loss to the author , the value of which can not be so definitely estimated .

		In spite of all assertions to the contrary , the leading American publishers have a real interest in the development of literature and an especial pride in selling books of true literary value .

		Given a chance to advise , these publishers will in nine cases out of ten urge an author in the direc - tion of his best artistic development rather than in the direction that is opposed to such develop - ment but possibly more promising in the matter of sales .

		I have had no connection with the house most closely associated with Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's best work except that of friendly competition with esteemed rivals , but I have good reason to believe that had Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	or any author ambitious for the best literary fame worked with those pub - lishers , seeking their help and advice in any moment of indecision , he would have received wise guidance that might have affected for the better the work that Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	finds so inferior .

		Turn to the
Stevenson	PERSON	`` Letters '' for corroboration of this belief .

		It might not be worth while to call attention to this matter were it not that many of our most promising young American writers are in the same zone of danger .

		They are seeking the advice of the commercial literary agent rather than of the publisher , who , while not insensible to commer - cial considerations , still has always in mind the importance of maintaining a literary reputation if there is any reputation to maintain .

		Pub - lishers are commercial .

		They must be .

		But if authors who have talent give their publishers a chance , the advice tendered will , in a vast major - ity of cases , be advice that takes into account an entire literary career and not simply the sale of a single book or the books of a short period .


HONORE WILLSIE	PERSON	.


New Tork City	LOCATION	,
January 10 , 1917	DATE	.

		MAURICE
HEWLETT	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The Decline and Fall of
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	, pro- claimed by Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	in your issue of
November 2 , 1916	DATE	, should not go unchallenged .

		I am sufficiently interested to utter my word of defence .

		To readers who love nature , strength , courage , or love itself ; who rejoice in vivid description and romance by a writer who has supreme control over language , the work of
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	will ever be inspiring .

		Beauty , romance , tales of chivalry , unsurpassed nature descriptions , the weaving of rare old tapestries with words , make Hewlett great .

		A man capable of creating
Hewlett	PERSON	's produc - tions should not be contrasted with the latest best - seller by
McCutcheon	PERSON	.

		The man who wrote '' Open Country , '' `` Half Way House , '' `` Rest Harrow , '' ``
Richard Yea-and-Nay	PERSON	, '' `` Forest Lovers , '' and even `` The Song of Renny '' which Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	scorned , has not fallen .

		Inquiry at one library , where little but fiction is drawn , revealed the fact that several sets of
Hewlett	PERSON	had been worn out , and that he was still in great demand .

		No writer has fallen while his best work is being read .

		It is true that
Hewlett	PERSON	's later works have n't the strength and verve of his earlier successes , but it would be possible to say with insistence and force that they represent a change of vision , sub - stance , and method , merely .

		56 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	A MAZY PROPHET .

		SUSPENDED JUDGMENTS .

		By
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
G. Arnold Shaw	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	is a successful lec - turer ; he is a very successful lecturer , I am told .

		Of late , he has taken to writing books ; and so , I suppose , he is also a successful author .

		Now , no one can be a successful lec - turer and author without having people believing in him ; also , it may not be said of anyone that he is entirely without merit so long as there is a person who believes in him .

		Many people believe in Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	.

		I recently met a woman , a college woman , who said to me -LRB- she did not really ask it , for she did not wait for a reply -RRB- : `` Have you ever heard
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	, the great lecturer ?

		Do n't you just love him !

		His leaning over , the force behind him I was fascinated by him ! ''

		It is one of the tenets of my religion that it is worth while to try to get some people to change their minds : that their minds can be changed ; and that I may be able to change them .

		I state this , and at this time , so as to save others from making the discovery later that I am a biased critic .

		Yes , I am preju - diced .

		I have a strong interest in a particu - lar kind of truth the truth as I see it .

		Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	has named his latest volume `` Suspended Judgments . ''

		That is a daring confession from the author of `` One Hundred Best Books , '' etc. , etc. .

		Un - less it is only a slip `` the psychopathology of everyday life . ''

		It must be that it is only a slip .

		Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	the successful lec - turer and author knows better than to make a public confession of the fact that he talks and writes of things about which he can not make up his mind .

		The good women who crowd to hear Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	and who buy his books come there and buy his books because he talks and writes as one who knows the good from bad , knows it as soon as he meets with it , knows it every time without fail ; they come there and they buy his books because of their belief that he tells them what is good and what is bad , so that they may make his opinions their opinions and not have to be worried by uncertainties .

		Let Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	once admit that there are things that he does not know , let him once confess that he writes books about things of which he is unable to make up his mind , or let him even give the good women ground for suspecting that he is in doubt about anything , and where would they be ?

		Why go to listen to him ?

		They would fly to someone who knows .

		And where would Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	be ?

		The public that attends Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	's lectures and buys his books wants not arguments nor reasons .

		It cares not for Hon - esty or Truth .

		It wants judgments .

		It wants to be told how to act and how to make ready for action .

		It wants no doubts , honest or dis - honest , but leadership .

		It cares nothing for any man 's speculations .

		It demands to be shown how .

		And in that it is like the great mass everywhere .

		That is why all religions that throw the mass back upon itself , whether these religions call themselves anarchism , so - cialism , rationalism , agnosticism , or suspended judgmentism , will always fail .

		The great mass must have a leader ; it wants to be saved .

		The success of the Teutonic allies in the pres - ent war is in a large measure due to the fact that they have among them the great mass anxious to be led , particularly so in a time of crisis , and they have among them the
Prus	PERSON	- sians with their passion for leading .

		`` I have called the book ` Suspended Judg - ments , ' '' Mr.
Powys	PERSON	has informed his pub - lisher -LRB- in the strictest confidence , no doubt , though the publisher gives the secret away on the jacket -RRB- , `` I have called the book ` Sus - pended Judgments ' because while one lives , one grows , and while one grows , one waits and expects . ''

		It is perhaps not worth while to point out that it is not strictly accurate to say that `` while one lives , one grows . ''

		But it may be worth while to call attention to the fact that it is not true that `` while one grows , one waits and expects . ''

		While one grows , one acts or prepares for action .

		If Mr.
Powys	PERSON	doubts this , let him put his theory to the test .

		I do not ask of him that he test his theory while crossing State Street at Madison Street .

		That would be paying too high a price for the the - ory .

		Let him try it out before getting out of bed , any day .

		I am quite willing to abide by the result .

		I have ventured the suggestion that the naming of the present volume `` Suspended Judgments '' was due to a slip .

		There is also another theory .

		Some years ago , I attended one of Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's lectures ; and , falling into an old habit of mine , I began to take notes .

		It was two or three minutes before I saw that Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's statements did not look nearly so impressive as they sounded .

		But it was fully half an hour before I made a real discovery .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 57 During some pause , I began to read what I had written down , and found , to my astonish - ment , that Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's statements cancelled themselves out .

		Each of Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's vehe - ment assertions , sooner or later , was cancelled by another equally vehement but contrary assertion .

		At the end of the lecture I had nothing left .

		The first thing that occurred to me was that it was due to some quirk or crotchet in Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's make-up .

		But I soon gave that up for a better explanation .

		It was part of a deliberate policy .

		It was part of a policy to give everybody what he wants .

		Unless we wish to ascribe the violent con - tradictions of the present volume to some quirk or crotchet in Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's make-up , we must conclude that they , too , are due to pol - icy .

		In no other way can these contradictions be accounted for .

		There is not a single state - ment of value in the volume that is not con - tradicted at some other point in the volume with equal vehemence .

		We are told that A is the greatest man that ever lived , and a little later we are informed that , since we are all friends and the truth must be made known , I must confess that he is as dull as an ethical culture lecture .

		Or the other way round , for the sake of freshness and variety : B bores me to distraction , end a little later , he is as startling as a bolt from the blue , as invigo - rating as the ozone-laden air .

		Let me quote some examples .

		The following is from his i > ssay on Voltaire : `` Except for ` Candide ' and a few excerpts from the ` Philosophical Dictionary , ' I must confess that I have no wish ever to turn another page of Voltaire .

		It is simply incred - ible to me that human beings possessed of the same senses as ours could find satisfaction for their imagination in the stern moralizing , stilted sentiment , superficial wit , and tire - some persiflage of that queer generation . ''

		-LRB- p. 64 . -RRB-

		Then follows this on page 67 : `` How admirable it is to come back to the spirit and temper of Voltaire from the fussy self-love and neurotic introspection of our modern egoists . ''

		And this from his essay on Byron : `` I can not imagine a more exciting experi - ence than a sudden discovery at this present hour , with a mind quite free and fresh to its resounding grandeur , of that poem , in the Hebrew Melodies , about Sennacherib . ''

		` And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea , When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep
Galilee	LOCATION	. ' ''

		-LRB- pp. 283-284 . -RRB-

		-LRB- Let us not envy him his taste . -RRB-

		And he follows it with this : '' He is the poet for the people who feel the magic of music and of imagination , without being able to lay their finger on the more recondite nuances of ` creative work , ' without so much as ever having heard of ` imagism . ' ''

		By `` music '' Mr.
Powys	PERSON	always understands lyrics ; he never suspects the possible exist - ence of non-lyric music .

		His reference to `` creative work '' and to `` imagism '' is meant to be ironical while at the same time being complimentary to his audience , which is un - able to lay its `` finger on the more recondite nuances . ''

		At any rate , it is evident that at this point Mr.
Powys	PERSON	, to quote him , '' ' is some poet . ''

		3 But note what follows : I shall `` never again , -LSB- his italics -RSB- not even for the space of a quarter of an hour , not even as a psychological experiment , turn over the pages of
Byron	PERSON	's Poetical Works ! ''

		-LRB- p. 306 . -RRB-

		There are times when he is for and against at once , but I shall not take the space to quote those .

		As good an example as any , perhaps , of the way he gives his readers a jumble of ideas , leaving them to make what they can of it , is the following from his first essay on `` The Art of Discrimination . ''

		Just here lies the point of separation between the poetic and the artistic temper .

		The artist or the art - critic , discriminating still even among the raw mate - rials of human creation , derives an elaborate and subtile delight from the suggestiveness of their colours , their odours , and their fabrics conscious all the while of wonderous and visionary evocations , wherein they take their place .

		The poetic temper , on the other hand , lets itself go with more passive receptivity ; and permits the form - less , wordless brooding of the vast earthpower to work its magic upon it , in its own place and season .

		Not , however , in any destruction of any defining and registering functions of the intellect does this take place .

		Even in the vaguest obsessions of the poetical mind the intellect is present , watching , noting , weighing , and , if you will , discriminating .

		For , after all , poetry , though completely different in its methods , its aims , and its effects from the other arts , is itself the greatest of all the arts and must be profoundly aware , just as they are aware , of the actual sense-impressions which produce the inspiration , -LRB- pp. 8-9 . -RRB-

		As you see , the poet is and is not an artist , and yet Mr.
Powys	PERSON	has to confess that the poet is the greatest of all the artists .

		The dif - ference between the poet and the artist is that the artist is rational and discriminating where the poet is only emotional ; at the same time , the poet 's intellect and reason are always present at the moment of creation , `` watching , noting , weighing , and , if you will , discriminating . ''

		Make what you will of it !

		It would never do to close this review with - out some reference to Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's outlook 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	upon life .

		In one form and another , Mr.
Powys	PERSON	repeatedly expresses his horror of life .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	may be of the opinion that he is exalting the robust conscience when he tells us that the world is a vile cage and when he praises the men who behaved like caged animals .

		I shall only quote one sentence in which he praises
Pascal	PERSON	for being thoroughly disillusioned about life .

		`` He -LSB-
Pascal	PERSON	-RSB- tore himself clear of every - thing ; so as to envisage the universe in its unmitigated horror , so as to look the empti - ness of space straight between its ghastly lid - less eyes . ''

		-LRB- pp. 52-53 . -RRB-

		What Mr.
Powys	PERSON	can neither see nor under - stand is that the universe is a work of art , that it is an individual , a personal creation .

		He never understood , never could understand , and so it were useless to try to make him understand what
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	meant when he said , `` You had better keep yourself clean , for you are the window through which you see the world . ''

		ISRAEL
SOLON	ORGANIZATION	.

		A PHILOSOPHER 'S VALEDICTORY .

		THE HOPE OF THE GREAT COMMUNITY .

		By
Josiah Eoyce	PERSON	, late
Alford Professor of Natural Eeligion	ORGANIZATION	,
Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity	ORGANIZATION	at
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Macinillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		In less than four months the
Department of Philosophy of Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	has lost Professor
Josiah Eoyce	PERSON	and Professor
Hugo Munsterberg	PERSON	.

		Metaphysician and
Psychol	PERSON	- ogist we called them before the war : pro- Ally and pro-German we have learned since to call them .

		It was to be expected that
Munsterberg	PERSON	should write and preach on behalf of his Fatherland , for in spite of a long residence in
America	LOCATION	he never altered his German citizenship , and he conceived it to be his duty , just as he had once thought it his privilege , to teach Americans to understand
Deutsch	PERSON	- tum .


Munsterberg	PERSON	's course was expected , then , but
Royce	PERSON	's was a surprise .

		A mild , and as many thought , a misty thinker , bur - dened with what his friend and philosophical opponent
William James	PERSON	ridiculed the machinery of the Absolute ; a dry lecturer with a thin voice , always remote , often a bit fantastic , he suddenly in the last year of his life flamed out as a mighty orator , a counsellor to action , and `` every inch a man . ''

		This little book is the written record of that change in Professor
Royce	PERSON	or was it a change , I wonder ?

		Perhaps we had better say the apparent change wrought in him by the sinking of the `` Lusitania . ''

		Friends have told me how he wandered about
Cambridge	LOCATION	, his eyes fixed on the pavement , his lips work - ing savagely ; how he could not begin the most casual conversation without switching it to the one awful subject of the torpedoed vessel ; and how at last he went into
Boston	LOCATION	and delivered a great and terrible oration , such as Pericles might have delivered at the clay-pits , over
America	LOCATION	's dead .

		No friend of Professor
Royce	PERSON	's can regret this change , this flowering of a man 's inner life into sudden , magnificent speech and action , and no reader of `` The Hope of the Great Community '' will lay the book down without a keen sense of gratitude and a clearer understanding of what Professor
Royce	PERSON	called , not
America	LOCATION	's rights , but
America	LOCATION	's duty in the war .

		The book contains other utterances besides the
Boston	LOCATION	speech .

		It contains a curious identification of
Pauline Christianity	PERSON	with our common dream of a World Community ; it contains a fascinating chapter on the `` Pos - sibility of
International Insurance	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which Professor
Royce	PERSON	speaks not on behalf of polit - ical counter-irritants against war , such as the League to Enforce Peace , but for an economic internationalism based on a system of life and fire insurance for nations instead of individuals ; the life insured being national life , and the menacing fire being war .

		There is mordant humor in this valedictory volume , as when the author wrote in regard to
Austria	LOCATION	's reply to one of the numerous American notes .

		It `` was precisely in the spirit of
Cain	PERSON	's reply when he was challenged from overhead regarding the results of his late unpleasantness with his brother Abel .

		For
Cain	PERSON	, while his brother 's blood was cry - ing from the ground , received a somewhat stern diplomatic communication from a moral power , demanding : ` Where is thy brother ? '

		And
Cain	PERSON	in substance begged to acknowledge the esteemed favor of this communication from on high , and seems at first to have taken a certain stilles Vergnilgen in begging to rep - resent first that , so far as he knew , he was not his brother 's keeper ; while , for the rest , he desired most respectfully , and in the friendliest spirit , to inquire what law of God or man he was supposed to have broken . ''

		The book is small , but it is the summing up of a great soul a life touched by a flame not unlike that which fell upon
Saul	PERSON	when he went up to
Damascus	LOCATION	.

		But Professor
Royce	PERSON	was a twentieth-century and thoroughly American
Saul	PERSON	, and a
Saul	PERSON	with a sense of humor as well as a moral sense .

		EDWARD EYRE HUNT .

		1917 THE DIAL 59 THE JUSTIFICATION OF HISTORY .

		THE PURPOSE OF HISTORY .

		By
F. J. E. Wood	PERSON	- bridge .

		-LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		A book from Professor
Woodbridge	PERSON	is something of an event in philosophical litera - ture .

		Few men have made so high a reputa - tion on so relatively small a literary output .

		It is evident that he does not find the business of composition in any sense an easy matter .

		But while nothing that he writes makes easy reading , nothing that he writes fails to make fruitful thinking .

		He never discusses until he has understood ; he never touches until he is able to enlighten .

		His work is packed with profound and suggestive thought .

		It is always eminently sane and clear-headed and purpo - sive .

		It is refreshingly free from the irritat - ing -LRB- and usually unnecessary -RRB- technicalities which so often make the literature of Amer - ican philosophy unreadable .

		He has per - formed a valuable service in the publication of this important little volume .

		The purpose of history is a problem which has long puzzled as it has long enlightened the words are synonymous thinkers .

		To Polybius it was the great storehouse of polit - ical examples .

		To that most brilliant of polit - ical knaves ,
Lord Bolingbroke	PERSON	, it was philosophy teaching by examples .

		Carlyle would have made it a `` universal divine scrip - ture '' to enforce the necessity of aristocracy .

		Treitschke used it as a weapon in the service of a political creed .

		Sir
John Seeley	PERSON	taught a fascinated generation of
Cambridge	LOCATION	students that it is the master-key to the great problems that oppress our time .

		Tot homines quot sententiae ; the grain of truth in each is dis - tressingly apparent .

		But we need something more than the eclectic dogmatism upon which these views are mainly founded .

		History in this pragmatic age must justify itself to its audience .

		The gentler crafts of letters are in grave danger of contemptuous banishment at a time when all study is undergoing the process of organization .

		Even the novel and the poem have become a department of polit - ical instruction and social evidence ; and the novels of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	no less than the poetry -LRB- God forgive me ! -RRB-

		of Mr.
Masters	PERSON	will prob - ably figure in the innumerable doctorate theses of the next half-century , so that a call to a new analysis of motives and of value comes at a moment when the world is eminently in the mood to consider reconstruc - tions .

		The main thesis of Professor
Woodbridge	PERSON	's book is to insist upon the pluralism of history .

		We are watching no vast drama of which the plot is single .

		We can disentangle no definite purpose , no obvious end .

		Whatever design the drama may reveal is the work of its actors , and we put on one side all question of author - ship .

		This banishment of the theological interpretation of history is a useful thing .

		It makes possible the immediate admission that the motives of human action are so infinitely various as to make illegitimate an insistence upon exclusive themes .

		Those who write a Prussian history , for example , which does no more than urge the effort of her kings from Reformation-times to save the German nation , commit themselves at the outset to psycholog - ical misunderstanding .

		We can rule out phil - osophically
Masson	PERSON	's view of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, on the one hand , and
Taine	PERSON	's ghastly picture on the other .

		Our historical paint-box will cease to limit itself to black and white ; it will discover , not for the first time , the historical signifi - cance of the spectroscope .

		We shall insist , in fact , upon the humanity of men .

		It is prob - able that thereby we shall write the truer history .

		Not less important is Professor Wood - bridge 's insistence upon history as a career in time .

		We too often tend , as he points out , to think of time in terms of space and thus to make too easily our lineal bisections .

		The problem is , in fact , less simple .

		Each age has a different experience , and it is inevitable that its accumulation should mirror that lesson within itself .

		It is too late for us , as Sir
W. S. Gilbert	PERSON	genially remarked , to be early English .

		What we write of the French Revolution is bound to be a different history from that of
Louis Blanc	PERSON	or even of
M. Aulard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The real past and the historical past are two very different things ; and however near we may approach to the first , it is in terms of the second that we shall interpret it .

		For when we seek to unlock the meaning of an event , we can not but bring to the process the added results of time .

		What it was , the bare record may state ; but for the mere chronicler of events we shall have no especial respect .

		The important thing is the judg - ment we pronounce , the conclusions we deduce , and to their making time brings inevitably its changing deposit , so that the Greeks for us are a different people from what they were for the citizens of republican
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The Zeitgeist enters into the picture and colors it .

		We may indeed get ever nearer to the actual record of things .

		The sciences auxiliary to history have in the last century very largely re-created our materials .

		Semitic history , for instance , is not what it 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	was when
Wellhausen	PERSON	and
Eobertson Smith	ORGANIZATION	began their incomparable researches .

		Pal - grave wrote of a
Normandy	LOCATION	which has been since remade by the scholarship and patience of Powicke and
Haskins	PERSON	.

		Between the Eng - lish law of
Beeves	LOCATION	and that of
Frederic Mait	PERSON	- land there lies a gap which even time can hardly bridge : so that if history is what has happened , the record of human progress , we must not fail to remember that the past , in a real sense , is forever changing because to - morrow the burden of to-day will change its j perspective .

		But Professor
Woodbridge	PERSON	rightly points out that the pluralism of history in no sense implies its discontinuity .

		We can never make temporal distinctions that are not artificial .

		Its chain of causation is in an ultimate sense unified .

		The nineteenth century has been largely spent in the discovery of historical kinships .

		Ours is the age in which evolution has become the guiding principle of scientific investigation .

		We can not , says Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- bridge finely , look modern life in the face and expect to know it .

		What we are , we are because our ancestors have been .

		Nothing can be rightly understood save in the perspective of development .

		And the value of this unity lies in the basis it affords for prospective spec - ulation .

		The student who has pondered over the character of Greek democracy is the more fitted , if he be intelligent , to deal with its more modern forms .

		The life of Cleon may illustrate the life of Mr.
Lloyd-George	PERSON	; and the Englishman who has been obsessed by Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's eloquence will perhaps find the secret of certain unconscious irritations when he considers the excessive morality of the elder Cato .

		History , moreover , as Mr.
Delisle Burns	PERSON	has recently and very suggest - ively demonstrated , is a stimulus to idealism ; for when the last cynicisms have been uttered , it is surely undeniable that each age has been largely guided in its attitude by a conception of a good higher than that which it then enjoyed .

		Even in our own time of gloom that underlying optimism finds its aspiring speculations .

		Above all , history is the great justification of intelligence .

		It is , as Mr.
Woodbridge	PERSON	eloquently remarks , an `` illustration of rational living . ''

		It recalls us from a world where Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	would have us eat caviare on impulse to one in which many of us may remember that our digestions are unsuited to the consumption of caviare .

		There is no remedy for our ills save thought .

		Emo - tion is of value only in so far as it is the servant of intelligence .

		We refuse , then , to be mastered by tradition ; we seek continually our emancipation .

		We know , it may be , but a fragment of existence , but in this knowledge we find the secret of a richer and more splen - did life .

		That , after all , is the supreme justification that thought can offer .


HAROLD J. LA	PERSON	SKI .

		THE ZIONIST HOPE .

		ZIONISM AND THE JEWISH FUTURE .

		By various writers .

		Edited by
H. Sacher	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The ravages which the war in
Europe	LOCATION	has brought to
Belgium	LOCATION	are hardly a circumstance to the horror which the war has brought to the Jewry of eastern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The Pale and
Galicia	LOCATION	, like
Belgium	LOCATION	, have been the theatre of the great conflict , and from the beginning their Jewish population has not only been terrorized by the soldiery of both sides but has been expropriated and pauperized also , until now it is dying of disease and starva - tion by thousands .

		Relief can be brought to it only with difficulty , and the problems of relief are only the beginnings of problems of Jewish life which must come after the war .

		These problems are continuous with the whole complex of problems that have gone throughout modern history under the rubric of `` The Jewish Question . ''

		The present book is one of the contributions to a cherished solution of that question .

		Its editor is a distinguished British journalist ; among the contributors to its pages are civil servants of the British government , Jewish religious leaders , and American college professors .

		It points out that , in Dr.
Weizmann	PERSON	's words , `` the problem is essentially that of fitting into the modern world a national group which has survived from ancient times without the ordinary attributes of nationhood . ''

		It traces , in Mr.
Sacher	PERSON	's survey of a century of Jewish history , the attempts of the Jews to solve that problem ; in Mr.
Hyamson	PERSON	's discussion of anti-Semitism , the clerical and political response of the
Gentile	PERSON	environment to these attempts ; and in subsequent essays , the rise of the Zionist movement , first as a rejoinder to anti-Semitism , and then as a constructive programme of democracy , social justice , and international service .

		The Zionist movement aims to establish in Palestine a legally assured and publicly secured home for the Jewish people .

		It turns into a practical social endeavor what had been , from the time of the first exile to the present day , a pious hope for Messianic deliverance among the great mass of the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 61 Jewish people .

		The feeling for Palestine among the Jews has been so intense that they have undergone every hardship and con - demned themselves to any degree of suffering rather than forgo the programme of re-set - tlement in that land .

		In the
year 1903	DATE	, when the British government made the
Zionist Congress	ORGANIZATION	the generous offer of
Uganda	LOCATION	, it was the representatives of the Russian and Roumanian Jews , who , although they had apparently the most to gain by accepting it , rejected the offer completely and finally .

		They had been setting up small colonies in Palestine from the
year 1882	DATE	on .

		The colon - ists had faced all sorts of hardships , natural and social , springing from conditions of the soil and the enmities of the Arab and Bedouin population , from ignorance of the art and science of agriculture , from disease , and all sorts of other causes .

		They had conquered these hardships to such a degree that their work won the earnest sympathy and generous cooperation of the
Parisian Rothschild	ORGANIZATION	.

		The colonies at that time , however , were private enterprises animated by no great social ideal .

		In them the individual Jew found his freedom and his happiness .

		After the reactive phase of the Zionist movement had given way to the constructive phase , however , a new attitude and a new programme defined themselves , both in colonization and in outlook .

		As Mr.
Norman Bentwich	PERSON	writes in his essay on the future of Palestine :
Herzl	ORGANIZATION	conceived Palestine alike as the Jewish coun - try and as the ideal community .

		It was the old - new-land in which the spiritual heritage of the past should be combined with the social dreams of the present by the people whose history embraces almost the whole of civilization .

		The houses were to be more beautiful than those of European towns , the villages and cities better planned , universal education , coopera - tive enterprises , and other devices of the Socialist state for the happiness of the mass would have their place side by side with Hebraic institutions making for equality .

		The year of release and the jubilee should be revived and become the basis of a happier social order than that which had grown up in
Europe	LOCATION	.


Henry George	PERSON	, shortly before
Herzl	ORGANIZATION	wrote , had found in the Mosaic legislation , the model of the ideal social system , standing not for the protection of property so much as for the protection of humanity .

		When the people from whom have sprung the fathers of modern socialism have the opportunity to work out their political institutions on their own lines , they should avoid the economic evils that beset young political communities and provide for mankind the example of harmonious society .

		Zionist colonization has aimed to put much of this programme into practical operation .

		It has increased tremendously the economic value of Palestine .

		By the institution of the
National Fund	ORGANIZATION	, the function of which is to ouy land which is to be the inalienable pos - session of the Jewish people , and by the use of that land for cooperative colonization , schools , and so on , the Zionists have begun to carry out successfully a programme of social justice .

		The Hebrew language has become the language of the daily life and has been expressed in a varied scientific and belle - tristic literature .

		Zionists contend that the Jewish people , equally with all the other peoples of the earth , have a right to free expression of their collective genius in the common life of mankind .

		They declare that whatever service the Jewish people can render mankind , can be rendered only through this freedom .

		The basis of the Zionist programme is a vision of international comity , of the team-play of the nations of the earth , in which each , by the perfection of its own qualities , renders the greatest possible service to all .

		Attention has been so insistently drawn , in the
United States	LOCATION	, to the physical energies released by the war and the material resources revealed , that far too little consideration is given to a less spectacular but equally important set of energies and resources .

		They are the mental energies and the spiritual resources which march with equal stride , and with them the
United States	ORGANIZATION	will have to com - pete , not in the stupid struggle for trade but in the inspiriting rivalry of thought .

		It is too early to write in full the history of thought in
England	LOCATION	since the war , but its main charac - teristics are already visible , its chief currents can be traced , and in its literature its signif - icance is apparent .

		The things which impress one most on com - ing into contact with the thought of
England	LOCATION	are its steadiness and its intensity , its loyalty and its strength , the confidence and conscious - ness of its direction , and the hardy and adventurous spirit in which it deals with realities .

		A review such as this would have to trespass into the domain of sociology were all the sources of this character to be traced ; but it must be said that the foundation of every virtue which thought possesses in modern
England	LOCATION	is the power which comes from knowledge .

		There is a solidity of learn - ing which differs widely from documented research ; and there is a vigorous habit of 62 THE DIAL thinking both in the production of literature and -LRB- to a lesser extent -RRB- in its reception .

		Obviously , the two chief directions of this active force must be winning the war and winning the reconstruction .

		Behind each has grown a tributary of less immediate force , a new interpretation of history and a new foundation for peace .

		All these have already their literatures .

		It has been the misfortune of the last to be obscure and even to be con - fused with the pacifist literature with which it has nothing to do .

		I have called it a new literature of peace because I believe that it makes ultimately for peace , and because , in the pressing agony of the present , one clings with desperation to every faint hope , to every distant promise , as an assurance of sanity .

		But the title does violence to the cardinal principle of these books .

		Their object is not the understanding of peace but the understanding of war .

		They lead not necessarily to peace but to justice and freedom , even at the cost of the world entrenched .

		They are confessedly ineffectual in ending this war ; they may be terribly effective in bringing on the next one if tyranny and injustice are the result of this .

		Their great purpose is to make the future condition of the world , be it peace or war , honestly democratic .

		The novelty of their method is that they offer democracy no con - trol but that which it may win for itself by study and by thought .

		Many of the books in this new literature have been issued by or under the segis of the
Council for Study of International Relations	ORGANIZATION	, an organization of which
Viscount Bryce	PERSON	is the head .

		Unlike the Union for Democratic Con - trol it has no programme and its aim is expressed in its title .

		Conscious of the gap which existed between the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	and the people in
August , 1914	DATE	, the
Council	ORGANIZATION	hopes `` to help British citizens to think clearly on these themes , so that the labours of statesmen for the establishment of a happier condition of things shall have the encouragement and support of an enlightened public opinion . ''

		It is , in a sense , an extension of the process of `` going to the country , '' a familiar expedient of British politics , and one which , curiously enough , has been tried not without success by President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		It is important to note that he too took the question of peace and war before the citizens , for their encour - agement and support .

		The first effort is to bring home the signif - icance of citizenship , particularly in the British Empire ; the last is to suggest a basis for peace in which the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	and the rest of the world could agree .

		Between lie virtually all the questions of the war , nationalism and the rights of small nations , internationalism and international finance , the relations between civilized and backward peoples , democracy and foreign policy , and the future of the super-state , or league of nations .

		Some of these subjects are highly involved , yet it is notable that nearly all the books issued in the past two years dealing with them are addressed to the lay reader in the confident assumption that books which are worth reading at this time are worthy of study as well .

		`` The War and Democracy , '' first issued in
1914	DATE	and since in seven successive reprints , and `` An Introduction to the Study of Inter - national Relations , '' are the two works which in form and content demand first attention .

		That the former , issued in the first heat of battle , should bear so few signs of small hate , should be so restrained and yet so just , is more than a tribute to its authors .

		For the book was written for and dedicated to the `` Workers ' Educational Association '' ; it was , moreover , widely read outside that interesting organization .

		So the sobriety and the thought - fulness of the readers is to be commended , no less than the honesty of the authors .

		Of these the name of
Alfred E. Zimmern	PERSON	will be best known to Americans , as the author of `` The Greek Commonwealth . ''

		He contributes besides the introduction an acute analysis of
Germany	LOCATION	, and an article on '' German Culture and the British Commonwealth '' which con - ceals , under a simple manner , a profound indictment of German culture and education , and which deals as pitilessly with the Ger - man theory of nationality as it does with the loose ideals of inter-state powers .

		The latter point Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	has taken up in more detail in his criticism of the
League of Peace	ORGANIZATION	, which forms part of a stimulating essay on `` Nationality and Government '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Sherratt & Hughes	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The other articles in the book deal with the growth of the national idea in
Europe	LOCATION	, with various countries engaged in the war , with the issues involved , with foreign policy , and with certain social and economic aspects of the war .

		The book is almost ele - mentary ; each essay is an introduction to a wide field of thought and literature .

		But the introduction itself is clear and comprehensive and fair .

		The other contributors are
R. W. Seton	PERSON	-
Watson	PERSON	, now editing `` The
New Europe	LOCATION	, '' a weekly which is chiefly devoted to foreign politics ;
Arthur Greenwood	PERSON	, secre - tary of the
Council for Study of International Relations	ORGANIZATION	, and
J. Dover Wilson	PERSON	, late lecturer at
the University of Helsingfors	ORGANIZATION	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 63 In the time which passed between the first publication of this book and the appearance of `` An Introduction to the Study of Inter - national Relations , '' the direction of thought had changed , and we pass from an inter - pretation of the war , its causes and effects , to a study of the basis of peace .

		The quality of the two books is the same ; Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	writes in both ;
P. H. Kerr	PERSON	, editor of the `` Round Table , '' represents the powerful
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	groups as Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	does in the former volume ; and there are essays on the history of war and peace in the past century , on international law , and on the causes and consequences of modern wars .

		The key to the book is to be found in Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's calm statement that `` the goal of political endeavour is freedom . ''

		It is only here that the revolutionary quality of that apparently obvious claim can be realized .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	it is a platitude ; here it is a truth to be fought for against those who believe that the goal of all endeavor is peace .

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	is certain that peace is the means to the great end which is human liberty ; he is equally certain that liberty can be attained only through corporate action .

		But he does not admit that peace is itself an end , or the final desirable thing in human life .

		The trail of
Mazzini	PERSON	is over him as it seems to be over most of the men and women who write with inspiration of the future .

		Mr.
Kerr	PERSON	's interpretation of imperialism is equally fresh and , to those who believe that the history of the British Empire is one purely of aggression and exploitation , it must be something of a shock .

		Essentially the theory is that imperialism is the only way to save a backward people from the aggression of individuals representing a higher stage of civilization .

		In its whole development this idea is a notable contribution for which the whole Round Table seems to be responsible .

		Although it is a defence of imperialism , it is not a defence of exploitation at least in the hands of its present authors .

		The question of backward nations leads to the whole study of nationalism and interna - tionalism , on which the mere bibliography is already great . ''

		The rights of small nations , '' according to Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	's famous declara - tion , must be vindicated in this war , but most of the work published on the question is as dynamite placed under that rock of faith .

		Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	, in the essay already referred to , finds nationality an arbitrary and insecure foundation upon which statehood or govern - ment can be based ; Professor
Ramsay Muir	PERSON	, in his `` Nationalism and Internationalism '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	: Constable -RRB- , while not so severe , drives hard against the perversion of nation - alism called `` racialism , '' as expounded by
H. H. Chamberlain	PERSON	, and seeing in
Germany	LOCATION	and her allies the last forces arrayed against both nationalism and a true internationalism , properly calls this war the culmination of modern history .

		His book is the first reading of modern history as the record of national aspirations , and it is a prophecy of the turn - ing of those aspirations , when satisfied , to the wider field of internationalism .

		Neither he nor Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	believes that a league of nations -LRB- more properly called an
Inter-State Government	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- can be based on a true interna - tionalism at present ; both are critical of the proposals because of the surrender of liberties which they involve ; both look forward only to the growth of a spirit of common interest and common consent between nations as the basis for international law .

		Again , freedom and knowledge must precede a lasting or desirable peace .

		The book , `` Toward a Lasting Settlement , '' links up with the preceding because it believes that the only secure international relations are those founded upon the consent not only of governments but of peoples .

		Mr.
Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	is an enthusiast for international - ism , believes that it is the cause of democracy and of civilization .

		Where Professor
Muir	PERSON	sees national aspirations as the causes of the nineteenth century 's wars Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	sees only desire for territory .

		The same volume , however , contains the necessary corrective in an admirable essay by
Charles Roden Buxton	PERSON	on `` Nationality . ''

		Mr.
Brailsford	PERSON	discusses `` The Organization of Peace '' with no exces - sive trust in mechanism , but with hope that the mechanical scheme would last long enough for a moral force to grow up .

		The most complete , favorable criticism of the inter - state idea is to be found in
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	's `` Toward International Government '' -LRB- origi - nally brought out under the direction of the
Union of Democratic Control	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Finally , there is a series of pamphlets pub - lished by the
Council for Study of Interna	ORGANIZATION	- tional Relations -LRB- The C S I R , 1 General Buildings ,
Westminster	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		These pamphlets are intended as aids to study for members of the Adults Study groups , the miners ' associations , the Workers ' Educa - tional Association , and many other groups organized in recent years for the study of domestic problems , now thrown , almost vio - lently , into a study of the world .

		The schemes of study are simple but provocative .

		Ques - tions are thrown out : `` What would have been the probable course of events if Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	64 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	had been President of the
United States	LOCATION	in
1914	DATE	? ''

		or `` How high do you rate the advan - tages of peace ?

		Higher than the satisfaction of aspirations for national independence ? ''

		A series of pamphlets does exist for giving information concerning the countries at war , and it is to be extended , I believe , to neutral countries .

		It is almost needless to say that far from being friendless in
England	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	possesses here a tremendous potential friendship , which is discernible in almost all the literature of peace .

		The importance of these books is not in the theories they uphold , nor even in the interpretation of history , past and present and future , which they develop .

		It lies in the habit of study and the habit of thinking which they assume and require .

		To this con - sequence of the war , the fresher vitality of thought and its sole devotion to the problems of the commonwealth ,
America	LOCATION	is , at least , not indifferent .

		The stimulus which has driven mathematicians and miners , dilettanti and soldiers and theorists , to think of the state and for the state , will not be ended with the war .

		It has had profound effects already and there is no reason to question its future .

		Of the books mentioned that of Professor
Muir	PERSON	alone is written well enough to be per - manent in literature ; it is at once a piece of propaganda and a serious work of history .

		But there is not a word in the whole collection which is not tellingly written .

		Sobriety and sincerity and a vast amount of hard , clear thinking have already done something to redeem the world from intolerable wars .

		RECONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM .

		VENETIAN PAINTING IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	: The
Fifteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Bernard Berenson	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Frederic Fair	ORGANIZATION	child
Sherman	LOCATION	;
$ 4	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Gathered and amplified into a book , Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's conclusions , known to us through his serial studies in `` Art in
America	LOCATION	, '' have gained in persuasion and consequence .

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	, finding an adequately representa - tive sequence of Venetian paintings * in our collections , has grouped them historically ; and adopting the discursive method of his avowed master
Morelli	PERSON	, he has made them the pretext for discussion of almost all problems incident to their study .

		Far from merely being a commentary running with an interest - * It may be interesting to note that the bulk of Venetian pictures has gravitated to
New York	LOCATION	-LRB- 31 -RRB- ,
Baltimore	LOCATION	-LRB- 28 -RRB- ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-LRB- 25 -RRB- , and
Boston	LOCATION	-LRB- 15 -RRB- .

		ing and important series of pictures , the book results in one of the most significant works of reconstructive criticism that have appeared in recent years on the subject of Italian paint - ing .

		It teems with incidental criticism , aes - thetic evaluations , and valuable hints of attribution , with all the secondary questions that irritate one 's periods of patient and intensely critical study .

		As one might expect , the central figure in the book is
Giovanni Bellini	PERSON	, and the central problem , his chronology .

		Though much that is original , illuminating , and indeed inval - uable is said about Cima ,
Carpaccio	LOCATION	, Mon - tagna , and the hosts that make a pale circle about him , what eminently interests Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	is to adduce their work wherever possible for the establishment of
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	's chronology and his artistic personality .

		The 263 pages of text are abundantly illustrated with one hundred and ten reproductions and provided with two tables and two indexes .

		The first two chapters are by way of a histor - ical introduction .

		The first reviews Gio - vanni 's artistic antecedents in
Venice	LOCATION	, and the lingering of the older tradition within Venetian painting , that of the Muranese ; the second deals with the only material foreign influence -LRB- excepting
Mantegna	PERSON	's -RRB- , from be - yond
Florence	LOCATION	, in the person of Antonello .

		We encounter at the beginning of our sur - vey a signed triptych by
Caterino	PERSON	-LRB- active from 1362 -RRB- , the earliest Venetian painter of any importance , in the
Walters	PERSON	collection ,
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		We pass on through such a ghastly and interesting performance as the Giambono at the Metropolitan Museum to an important work of the early Muranese school , by the two severe , collaborating craftsmen ,
Giovanni d'Alemagna	ORGANIZATION	and
Antonio Vivarini	PERSON	.

		After examining some rather indifferent school pic - tures , we are introduced to a series of works of rare quality by two of the most charming masters of decorative design .

		We begin with Mr.
Platt	PERSON	's Virgin , by
Bartolomeo Vivarini	PERSON	, a work produced in all the reserved yet ecstatic freshness of creative youth ; then come Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	's `` Epiphany , '' by
Bartolomeo	PERSON	, of crisp and dainty handi - work ; a grave and beautiful Virgin by the same hand , from the late
Theodore Davis	PERSON	collection , now hanging in the Metropolitan Museum ; and a number of Crivellis , of which Mr.
Lehman	PERSON	's is the most distinguished bit of decoration , Mrs.
Gardner	PERSON	's , a diminutive fairyland version of the
Romance of St. George	ORGANIZATION	in exquisite pattern .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 65 The chapter closes with the examination of an austere St.
Jerome	PERSON	, belonging to Mr.
Augustus Healy	PERSON	of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, which Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	attributes hesitatingly to
Jacopo Bellini	PERSON	.

		The next chapter starts out with a brief discussion of two portraits , one grave , one gay , both ingenious syntheses of individ - uality , by the mighty
Antonello da Messina	PERSON	, whose greatness , as indeed we emphatically feel in looking at these , '' consisted in present - ing objects more directly , more penetratingly , more connectedly and more completely than ' we could see them for ourselves . ''

		Of what immediately follows , the most interesting are the profound and intimate appreciation of Mr.
Frick	PERSON	's Provencal Pieta , which had been going under
Antonello	PERSON	's 1 name , and the identification 2 of the hand of a Palermitan follower of Antonello in the `` St. Rosalie '' of the
Walters	PERSON	collection and a Virgin in the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		This brings both author and reader to the desired haven : the great Venetian of the fif - teenth century , and to the crux of his early chronology , which Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	in some of the shrewdest reckoning fundamentally rev - olutionizes .

		He launches daringly into heter - odoxy by announcing in his heading a 1 new theory of
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	's development , and by pushing Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's Virgin , which has hitherto gone unchallenged as the earliest of his youthful works , two decades up the cen - tury .

		The careful demonstration which follows centres in a significant similarity between the
Holy Child	ORGANIZATION	in this picture and the little boy who nestles against his mother 's knee in the `` Circumcision '' of
Mantegna	PERSON	's triptych at the
Uffizzi	LOCATION	.

		This figure was taken over without material changes ; only , in our picture , the Child has been reversed and the arrangement of the extremities made to chime with the whole system of design .

		But the `` peevish squirm , '' easily explained in
Mantegna	PERSON	's picture , can be accounted for in Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	only on the assumption that the Christ was copied from
Mantegna	PERSON	's boy .

		Now , as all the respected authorities are , on internal and external evidence , agreed that
Mantegna	PERSON	's Uffizzi trip - tych was painted in
1464	DATE	, we must regard the date as a chronological boundary before which the
Johnson	PERSON	picture , for the reasons indicated , could by no means have been painted .

		Having fixed
1464	DATE	as the earliest possible date for the painting of the
Johnson Madonna	ORGANIZATION	, 1 This attribution was first corrected by
Hulin	PERSON	, in `` Cat - alogue Critique '' of
Bruges Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	,
1902	DATE	.

		2 Published first in Gazette des Beaux Arts ,
March 1913	DATE	.

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	finds reasons , in its structural and stylistic resemblances to works executed by
Bellini	PERSON	and his assistants between
1469	DATE	and
1476	DATE	, for dating it `` scarcely earlier than
1470	DATE	. ''

		With the securing of this date , the works stylistically associated with it are sub - jected to the same fate , which means that what was formerly dated between
1450	DATE	and
1455	DATE	has now to be put
fifteen years later	DATE	.

		To account for the vacuum he has created in
Giovanni	LOCATION	's early artistic activity , Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	argues ingeniously that all of
Bellini	PERSON	's extant works that may `` plausibly be placed before
1470	DATE	could easily have been painted after
1465	DATE	, and in point of style they resemble each other sufficiently to admit of being thus crowded together . ''

		Even if some of the panels are of earlier origin `` they are at once too few ... and too close to each other to be , if spread over so long a time , more than a confession of slow and feeble develop - ment . ''

		And Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	finds it easier in view of
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	's rate of advance later in his career `` to believe that not many years elapsed between any of the paintings of this , than to assume that
Giovanni Bellini	PERSON	was something of a dullard in his early life . ''

		There seems to be some explanation for this delayed development in the fact that Gio - vanni like his brother
Gentile	PERSON	continued as assistant to his father until past his thir - tieth year .

		This inference is conventionally made from the joint signature of
Jacopo Bellini	PERSON	and his two sons , on the lost altar - piece painted for the Gattamelata chapel ,
Padua	LOCATION	, in
1460	DATE	.

		Moreover ,
Gentile	ORGANIZATION	's first dated work -LRB-
1465	DATE	-RRB- betrays a hand unaccus - tomed before then to work in total indepen - dence .

		It was apparently the father , too , who , responsible for the retarded evolution of his sons , prevented Giovanni from following the inflexible manner of
Mantegna	PERSON	, his brother-in - law since
1453	DATE	.

		The
Johnson Madonna	PERSON	is one of the first works in which Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	sees the emancipated Giovanni imitate his relative .

		As that influence has hitherto been supposed to have palpably begun in
Giovanni	LOCATION	's forma - tive period , it is another matter requiring revision ; and in this connection one comes to wonder how Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	would dismiss the accepted explanation of the affinities between
Mantegna	PERSON	's `` Agony '' -LRB- 1459 -RRB- and
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	's representation of the same subject , hanging together in the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		With the pretty
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	belonging to Mr.
Platt	PERSON	we enter into a period of greater crea - tive expansion ; and the air about our ears has 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	cooled .

		The stately beauty of the
Davis	PERSON	,
Johnson	PERSON	, and Lehman Virgins , certainly the finest of
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	's first-known works , is fol - lowed by pictures Madonnas , all but one peopled by a richer humanity , and of a more vitally informing yet caressing chiaroscuro .

		None pass in date beyond
1488	DATE	, and the reason may be that there is but a handful of works by
Bellini	PERSON	, painted in the
last three decades	DATE	of his life , that has come down to us .

		They are each of a unique interest , some of a unique beauty .

		The
Huntington Madonna	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- very soon after
1480	DATE	-RRB- is but a reversed var - iant of
Mantegna	PERSON	's
Bergamo Virgin	LOCATION	and the `` latest work of Giambellino in which unmis - takeable and even striking evidence of Man - tegna 's influence is to be discovered '' ; Mr.
Salomon	PERSON	's , painted after
1485	DATE	, is sensitive with a touch of mysticism .

		There is a deep note of solemn almost petulant exaltation in Mr.
Willys	PERSON	's
Madonna	LOCATION	, who is wrapped in the shadow and atmosphere of the Frari trip - tych .

		This is the latest
Bellini	PERSON	in
America	LOCATION	.

		The chapter closes with the sublime St.
Francis	PERSON	belonging to Mr.
Frick	PERSON	.

		There is an amplitude and sweep in this composition such as we find in other of
Bellini	PERSON	's works of a pro- founder and more possessing beauty .

		But , rather than the humble voice of God 's trouba - dour , we fancy we hear the ringing of the rhetoric of a Hebrew prophet addressing him - self to the Unseen .

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	rescues this picture from its former attribution to
Basaiti	LOCATION	and plausibly claims it for
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	in the period of his
Naples	LOCATION	`` Transfiguration . ''

		As it was still unfinished in
1525	DATE	, Mr.
Beren	PERSON	- son , basing his suggestion on the appearance of the trees in the middle distance , supposes it was directly afterward completed by
Girolamo da Santacroce	PERSON	.

		The remaining three chapters are devoted to scrupulously differentiated heads : chapter IV , the `` Pictures from the Studio of Gio - vanni
Bellini	PERSON	, and Contemporary Copies '' ; chapter V , `` The Contemporaries of Giovanni Bellini '' ; chapter VI , ``
Giovanni Bellini	PERSON	's Pupils and Followers . ''

		In this section Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	has carefully separated works of artists or groups according to their artistic relation to
Giovanni	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though they are dealt with as artistic entities , it is this relation that is of primary interest , because , wherever found , it is made to yield another ray of light that may help to illuminate our still frag - mentary knowledge of the master or his fol - lowing .

		Guided by a fund of slowly synthesized observation and study Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	all but evokes for us the shapes or contours or design of some lost masterpiece by ingenious infer - ential reconstruction , from scattered scraps or from studio pictures .

		The
Fogg	ORGANIZATION	and
Layard Virgins	ORGANIZATION	, the Pourtales , `` Sacra Conversa - zione , '' in the Morgan collection , the `` Christ at
Emmaus	LOCATION	'' belonging to Mr.
Walters	PERSON	, are interesting mainly in so far as they furnish us with clues as to the nature of the originals by
Bellini	PERSON	.

		We are grateful to find some attribution put right , some wrong reckoning corrected , some tangles unravelled ; not because there is any absolute finality about Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's judgments , but because they are all suggestive and because in making them he has indicated the right direction in art-criticism .

		The number of Cimas in American collec - tions has furnished Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	with occa - sion for a fine appreciation , and an excellent outline of his evolution .

		His
Bellinesque Virgin	PERSON	in the
Detroit	LOCATION	Museum , the
Tuck Madonna	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1495 -RRB- with its crystalline atmos - phere , reminiscent , I venture to suggest , of
Bellini	PERSON	's `` Virgin with Cherubs '' -LRB- 1485 -RRB- ; Mr.
Blumenthal	PERSON	's lunette ; Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	's `` Sacra Conversazione '' ; Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's pagan-spir - ited Bacchus series , measure the scope and limitation of
Cima	ORGANIZATION	's invention .

		Indeed I do not think a more suggestive discussion of Cima could well be found .

		We are glad to find so much about Mon - tagna ,
Carpaccio	LOCATION	,
Basaiti	LOCATION	,
Catena	ORGANIZATION	, and to fol - low our critic when he pleads for
Gentile Bellini	PERSON	as
Carpaccio	ORGANIZATION	's master against the claim for the anaemic
Lazzaro Bastiani	PERSON	.

		But for the absence of examples of such sustained mastery as those discussed in the chapter on
Giovanni Bellini	PERSON	, the parts that follow are as full of eminently interesting criticism , which , if personal , is the synthetic act of accumulated aesthetic emotions .

		It would be easy , and petty , to carp at a kind of criticism at once so daring and dogmatic .

		Its '' differences are perhaps differences of method .

		We shall find , naturally , also a tone of controversy , and now and again the irritation of expected disagree - ment .

		Yet , the stern , concentrated and advanced scholarship of Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	has supplied students with a book of Venetian painting unique among its kind .

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's contingent promise of a book on
Bellini	PERSON	makes the student dream of a painter with his lost works reconstructed for us , all marshalled before us in their place , and the artistic personality thus evoked , standing up finally over against us like a living thing .

		This new inter - est in foreign drama has of course been greatly heightened by the war .

		It is pleasant to believe that war itself may help to scatter the seeds of better understanding and peace .

		Surely the knowledge of other nations ' peculiarities and points of view should serve as a foundation for firmer international friendship .

		Here is an invasion which makes for intelligent sympathy and good will .

		One test of an author 's greatness is the question , `` Can he conquer a foreign public through translation ? ''

		Under the best of cir - cumstances , there are barriers to be sur - mounted ; when a skilful translator has removed the obstacle of language , the more difficult barriers of divergent beliefs , customs , and traditions still separate the writer from his new public .

		To pass these bounds the force of genius is generally required ; and even genius , when it is narrowly national , is sometimes unsuccessful in the attempt .

		For us the important questions about all these plays are : `` How far do they succeed in mak - ing us forget differences in point of view and background ?

		How far do they make us understand the characters as human beings and sympathize with them ? ''

		By this test primarily I shall try to judge the plays .

		It may be objected that the reader should act - ively cooperate with the author , and endeavor to meet him halfway .

		But reasonable as this sounds , it may easily be pressed too far .

		If we are constantly occupied in the effort to imagine ourselves Spaniards or Icelanders , we can not enjoy the play .

		All that can fairly be expected of us is to try at the outset to lay aside our prejudices and read with an open mind .

		If then the play does not reach us , it is for us a failure .

		`` The Pine-Tree '' is `` adapted '' from the Japanese of
Takeda Izumo	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1688-1756 -RRB- .

		It is preceded by an informal essay on the Japanese theatre which occupies somewhat more than half of the slender volume .

		This is well written and interesting ; I can not judge of its accuracy .

		`` Japanese plays , '' Mr.
Marcus	PERSON	tells us , `` have generally from twelve to twenty acts , and their performance takes a whole day . ''

		`` The Pine-Tree '' is a single act -LRB- often presented by itself -RRB- of one of these long tragedies , which , we are told , is `` prob - ably the most extolled of all Japanese dramas . ''

		Its theme is the heroic sacrifice by a nobleman and his wife of their own son to save the son of their dead feudal lord .

		Here at once we encounter one of the barriers I just referred to ; in its very theme the play is repugnant to our
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	notions of ethics .

		Deliberately
Matsuo	PERSON	and his wife leave their son to certain death , because this is the only way to preserve the life to which their house owes allegiance .

		Yet the genius of the Japanese dramatist triumphs over this extraordinary handicap .

		He has conceived the central situation with such vividness and power , he has shown us the passion of loyalty with such reality , that we accept for the moment the Japanese ethical doctrine , alien as it is to our own .

		In the tragic emotions of pity and terror we willingly forget our dis - belief in his stern code .

		He has done more ; he has overcome the disadvantage of an unsatisfactory translation .

		Mr.
Marcus	PERSON	's rendering is sincere and sympathetic , but he can not write good English verse .

		His awk - ward lines have nothing of the delicacy and little of the reticence and suggestiveness which , as scholars assure us , are characteristic of Japanese poetry .

		To do it justice in Eng - lish , `` The Pine-Tree '' needs a translator who 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	can write in the style of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's superb Japanese drama , `` The Faithful . ''

		Standing as they do somewhat apart from the main European currents , the two Icelandic plays may properly be discussed by them - selves .

		The author ,
Johann Sigurjonsson	PERSON	, is introduced to the American public by the
American-Scandinavian Foundation	ORGANIZATION	as a representative of the renaissance of Icelandic literature .

		Though these plays were pro- duced ipt
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, and though one of them was originally written in Danish , they are thoroughly Icelandic in setting and spirit .

		The stronger and later one , `` Eyvind of the Hills , '' is based on a romantic story of an eighteenth century outlaw who , having wear - ied of the loneliness of his mountain retreat , descends to the valleys and under an assumed name takes service as a farm hand .

		His mistress
Halla	ORGANIZATION	, a well-to-do widow , falls in love with him ; and rejecting the advances of Bjorn the bailiff , who has discovered that the supposed farm hand is the notorious outlaw , she flees to the mountains with her lover .

		She bears him two children , whom , rather than allow them to be captured by
Bjorn	PERSON	, she sac - rifices .

		At last
Eyvind	ORGANIZATION	and
Halla	ORGANIZATION	, hunted to the high mountains , shut up in a cabin by a great storm , and suffering the pangs of starva - tion , reproach each other for their love .

		Eyvind is determined to risk his life in the search for food ;
Halla	ORGANIZATION	can not endure her memories alone .

		At last Eyvind promises to remain and die with her ; but while he is fetching firewood , she rushes out to die alone in the snow .

		The play is essentially a story in dramatic form ; it has no thesis , and inter - esting as some of the characters are , our attention is centred mainly upon the extraor - dinary situations in which they are placed .

		In style it presents a strange union of realism with romance ; along with the poetry of the love scenes and the descriptions of the moun - tain fastnesses , we find the homely language and everyday details of farm life .


Halla	ORGANIZATION	's sacrifice of her children is likely to cost her much of the reader 's sympathy , and would ruin the play on our stage .

		The second piece , `` The Hraun Farm , '' is a modern story of pastoral Icelandic life ; it has charm , but lacks the force and daring of `` Eyvind of the Hills . ''

		Both plays are notable for their spontaneity and freshness ; the strong clear wind of the north blows through them .

		They deserve a wide reading in Mrs.
Schanche	PERSON	's excellent translation .

		The unwearying Mr.
Barrett H. Clark	PERSON	con - tinues to make good translations of French plays .

		For
Samuel French	PERSON	's series of `` The World 's Best Plays '' he has translated Gol - doni 's `` Le Bourru Bienf aisant , '' and -LRB- with
Hilmar Baukhage	PERSON	-RRB-
Pailleron	PERSON	's `` Le Monde ou 1 ` on s ` ennuie . ''

		This inexpensive series of well chosen and well translated plays should be a boon to amateurs .

		The Goldoni play -LRB- called in the translation `` The Beneficent Bear '' -RRB- is a comedy in the Moliere tradition without
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's brilliance .

		`` The Art of Being Bored , '' first produced in
1881	DATE	, is a good instance of the nineteenth century French play skilfully built around one strong scene .

		It is written solely to amuse , and its popularity on the stage attests its success in that purpose .

		A more important service has been rendered by Mr.
Clark	PERSON	in his translation of four plays by
Augier	PERSON	.

		The first three of these , `` Le Mariage d'Olympe , '' `` Le Gendre de
M. Poirier	PERSON	, '' and `` Les Fourchambault , '' are here for the first time made available in English .

		All of these are important plays , and it is worth a good deal to have them accessible in a satisfactory translation .

		`` Le Mariage d'Olympe '' -LRB- 1854 -RRB- is a forerunner of the modern thesis play .

		It was evidently intended as an exposure of the cheap sen - timentality of
Dumas	PERSON	's `` La Dame aux Camelias '' -LRB- known on the English-speaking stage as `` Camille '' -RRB- .

		As a companion piece to
Dumas	PERSON	's glorified harlot , who `` has loved much , therefore much shall be forgiven her , ''
Augier	PERSON	draws a picture of the real adven - turess who succeeds in marrying into a noble family and whose intention to make capital out of their name is defeated by the proud old father .

		Not many better plays with a thesis have been written since ;
Augier	PERSON	was too good an artist to allow his moral to spoil his story .

		`` Monsieur
Poirier	PERSON	's Son-in-Law '' is so well known through its popularity as a reading text for French classes that it need not here be described ; I may merely observe that it is perhaps the best modern French comedy in the Moliere tradition .

		`` The House of Four - chambault '' is
Augier	PERSON	's last play .

		If it lacks the brilliance and comic force of `` Monsieur
Poirier	PERSON	's Son-in-Law 1 , '' its view of life is kindlier , and its characters are drawn more sympathetically .

		The fourth play in the vol - ume , `` The Post-Script , '' is a lively and charm - ing little one-act piece , based on feminine inconsistency .

		This play , an excellent one for amateurs who can act , is also published separately in French 's `` The World 's Best Plays . ''

		Mr.
Clark	PERSON	has also translated two French plays for tKe Drama League Series ,
Loy	PERSON	- son 's `` The Apostle '' and De
Curel	ORGANIZATION	's `` A False Saint . ''

		Since we have to consider also two other plays in this series , it will not be out of place to venture two or three general com -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 69 meats .

		It is no secret that the eaterprise has beea somethiag of a disappoiatmeat .

		la Sep - tember the chairmaa of the committee haviag the series ia charge made a report oa the sale of volumes .

		Out of fifteea plays issued up to that time , oaly five or six had paid expeases , aad oaly two or three had yielded a very small profit .

		What are the reasoas ?

		The demaad for plays ia priat is large ; every importaat publisher aow has his list .

		This series is backed by aa orgaaizatioa haviag 80,000 members , presumably iaterested ia drama .

		Oae reasoa for the small sales , I thiak , is the cheap aad shoddy biadiag of the volumes , which makes them a poor iavestmeat for libraries .

		After a few readiags the biad - iag literally disiategrates aad the covers come off .

		It would be better either to raise the price aad put oa a substaatial cloth biadiag , or lower it aad issue the plays ia paper covers .

		Aaother reasoa is to be fouad ia the choice of plays .

		There is ao use ia tryiag to force dowa the throat of the public what the public doesa ' t waat .

		It is impossible to imagiae a large aumber of Americaas beiag keealy iaterested ia three of the four plays uader coasideratioa .

		For my part , so far as these plays aad some others issued by the League are coaceraed , I thiak the public is right .

		Not oae of these plays is really of iateraa - tioaal importaace ; aot oae of them has the interest , for example , of the best work of
Augier	PERSON	.

		They all , of course , have merit ; but ia oaly oae of them does the author succeed in surmouatiag the barrier I have referred to , of differeat aatioaal traditioas aad beliefs .

		In the iatroductioa to `` The Apostle , '' Pro- fessor
Baker	PERSON	asks whether it is possible to read a certaia sceae dry-eyed .

		I owa that I fiad it impossible to read the sceae ia aay other way .

		`` The Apostle '' is a good play , but it is a play dealiag with French politics , about the last thing ia which the average American reader caa be iaduced to take aay iaterest .

		Both `` The Apostle '' aad `` A False Saiat '' are iateasely aad rather aarrowly Freach .

		A brief resume of the plot of the latter will illustrate the poiat .

		The heroiae ,
Julie	PERSON	, having been disappointed ia love , attempts to murder
Jeaaae	PERSON	, her successful rival , aad after failiag aad beiag forgivea , betakes herself to a coaveat .

		Eighteea years later
Jeanne	PERSON	's husband dies , and
Julie	PERSON	leaves the convent , chiefly to find out whether
Henri	PERSON	showed before his death any signs of remem - bering his former love for her .

		She learns that
Jeaaae	PERSON	has told him of the attempted murder , aad beads her eaergies to reveage .

		Jeaaae 's daughter is eagaged to a youag teacher , aad
Julie	PERSON	's veageaace takes the form of tryiag to break off the affair .

		She gaias an iaflueace over the girl aad iaduces her to reject her lover because he has kept mistresses .

		This , which to aa Americaa reader appears a tolerably good reasoa for breakiag aa eagage - meat , is of course ao reasoa at all ia
France	LOCATION	.

		Julie herself does not regard it as a good reason ; she is consciously playing on the innocence and simplicity of the young girl with the purpose of ruining her happiness .

		The lover 's view of the case is evidently the author 's : `` You ask me whether it 's true that I have had mistresses ?

		Yes ,
Madam	LOCATION	, several .

		What of it ?

		.

		.

		Do you imagiae for an iastaat that there is a single man unless he 's not well who when he marries is all you blame me for not being ? ''

		If we accept the French point of view ia these matters , it is impossible to feel the least sympathy for
Julie	PERSON	, who is merely a spiteful vixea ; aad she is the ceatral character ia the play .

		But perhaps the worst choice in this group of
Drama League Plays	ORGANIZATION	was that of
Max Halbe	PERSON	's `` Youth . ''

		Professor
Lewisoha	PERSON	ia his iatroductioa compares the play with `` Romeo aad Juliet , '' aad adds , `` I am not sure that
Halbe	PERSON	does not move us more deeply and more humanly . ''

		This is the very ecstasy of non - sense .

		If Halbe does move us more deeply , the worse for us as critics !

		`` Youth '' is a rather nauseous mixture of German sentimen - tality and naturalism , dealing with an affair of puppy love .

		The boy has no wish to marry the girl , but they philander until their pas - sions get the better of them .

		Sometimes , as at the conclusion , the play becomes uninten - tionally comic .

		The half-witted brother of the heroine , who shows more intelligence than anyone else in the play , tries to shoot
Hans	PERSON	, the hero , but the heroine throws herself between , and falls .

		Hans -LRB- with a terrible scream -RRB- .

		G one !

		-LRB- Flings himself upon her , convulsively sobbing . -RRB-

		A much better play is Hirschf eld 's `` The Mothers , '' also translated by Professor
Lew	PERSON	- isohn .

		This is a careful and sympathetic study of the life of the middle and lower classes in
Berlin	LOCATION	.


Eobert Frey	PERSON	, the son of a well-to-do family , has fallen in love with a working girl , and quarrelled about her with his parents .

		The quarrel has resulted in an open break , and in his going to live with
Marie	PERSON	.

		After his father 's death his sister writes to him , and though he still loves
Marie	PERSON	, he longs for the freedom and opportunities which a reconciliation will give him .

		The play tells the story of his struggle and final yield - iag to the call of opportuaity aad family ties , aad of
Marie	PERSON	's reauaciatioa of him for his advaatage .

		Siace she is pregaaat aad desper - 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	ately poor , this renunciation is not without its heroism .

		The scene between the two girls -LRB-
Marie	PERSON	and
Robert	PERSON	's sister -RRB- is excellent , and the play as a whole has a sanity and restraint entirely lacking in `` Youth . ''

		Of the four
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	plays , this would , I am sure , make the widest appeal to American readers .

		It is not , perhaps , a better play than `` The Apostle , '' but it is freer from handicaps .

		Not all these books are first books , although they happen to be the first things by their writers that I have seen .

		Madame Dragoumis , at least , has written other books .

		I believe , however , - that each book is a first novel , and whether it be or not , each is a definite step in a direction in which the author will undoubt - edly go farther .

		Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	is going to write more about
Ledgar Dunstan	PERSON	; it will be worth reading and probably better than the present book , for the material will be better -LRB- if one can guess at it -RRB- , and the writer 's ability to handle what he has in mind will probably increase .

		Madame Dragoumis will write better books than this , for she evidently has an unusual power of construction which ought to increase with exercise .

		It may be doubted whether Miss
Keith	PERSON	will ever write anything better than some parts of this book , but in regard to such matters it is foolish to prophesy .

		`` A Man of
Athens	LOCATION	'' is spoken of by the publishers as though its chief interest lay in a presentation of `` the highest political and diplomatic circles of
Athens	LOCATION	'' and in its illum - ination of `` much that has been obscure in the part
Greece	LOCATION	is playing in the war . ''

		It would certainly be a mistake to try to minimize any excellence that may lie in a book , even with the idea of making clear something that seems better .

		But I fear that anyone will be disap - pointed who expects to find in Madame Dragoumis a Greek Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		Very little of this novel has any connection at all with the highest political and diplomatic circles of
Athens	LOCATION	.

		Some of the characters do have some connection with those circles , but when they appear in the story -LRB- except for trifling exceptions -RRB- , they lay aside their diplo - matic or political character .

		There is some political and diplomatic talk , but no more than there would be in any social circle at the time of a political crisis .

		Perhaps the book does throw a flood of light on the obscure part which
Greece	LOCATION	has been playing in the war ; I know so little about
Greece	LOCATION	at the present day and her recent position that anything about it would throw a flood of light as far as I am concerned , but I can not imagine that a person with any real knowledge of current facts - would be much illuminated by what is no doubt a true rendering of popular sentiment in
Greece	LOCATION	before the war of
1912	DATE	.

		It does
Madame Dragoumis	ORGANIZATION	a poor service to suggest that the value of her book depends - upon any such matters as these , for it dis - tracts attention from something much more interesting , to the novel reader at least .

		I should not myself wish to lay much stress - upon her power to suggest a social atmos - phere and a kind of life that must be of interest to many people , and especially to those who by sympathy or education or both feel that
Greece	LOCATION	has a very special place in the world .

		As I read the book , its chief interest lies in its very able handling of a perennial subject the love of two people separated by social distinctions .

		Madame Dragoumis 's view of these two people aristocrats respectively by intellect and by descent is really fine .

		A civilization that not only allows such a union but , by its most deeply felt traditions , approves and is satisfied is a fine civilization ; and
Madame Dragoumis	PERSON	's presentation of the Athenian world is quite worthy , of her sub - ject .

		Nor is her presentation of the other view , in the person of
Michael Douka	PERSON	, in the least inferior ; it is , indeed , one of the best things in the book .

		Douka is himself through - out , and his appearance at the end is con - ceived with a thorough appreciation not only of his personality but of its value in life .

		In what , it would seem , must have been her leading aim , the author has been most success - ful : her chief figures are perfectly clear and true , and her chief situations will be deeply and surely felt .

		And this is a matter so important in novel reading and writing that it is really enough to say of a book .

		It should be added , however , that
Madame Dragoumis	PERSON	, who has the one real essential for the novel writer , lacks some useful accompaniments .

		The first half of the book seems to me to drag , to be heavy .

		This is the case with some very fine novels , but I do not see that it is neces - sary here .


Madame Dragoumis	ORGANIZATION	has very considerable powers of construction and of character drawing , powers not common nowa - days ; I presume she will acquire what everybody else seems to have , equal power in
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 71 the direction of fascinating narration a power which her publishers seem to think she has in great measure already .

		In `` The Rise of Ledgar Dunstan '' Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	has the idea of presenting , perhaps in a trilogy -LRB- although only a second volume is directly indicated -RRB- , the life of a man of the day .

		Were this idea a stranger in the literary world , one would welcome it , at least long enough to live with it for a while and see what it was worth .

		As the idea is by no means a stranger , one may treat it more critically .

		One may even pay no attention to it at all .

		There are not a few such biographies nowadays , and a reader with only the ordinary amount of spare time may think he has done enough when he has read `` The New Macchiavelli , '' the Clayhanger books , or ''
Jean-Christophe	PERSON	, '' according to his liking for one volume , three volumes , or ten .

		On the other hand , if one enjoys such books one will find plenty of amusement in comparing
Ledgar Dunstan	PERSON	's career not only with the books mentioned but with the lives of
Jacob Stahl	PERSON	,
Michael Fane	PERSON	,
Philip Carey	PERSON	, or such American worthies as
Frank Cowperwood	PERSON	, and in considering which has managed to get the most fun out of modern conditions or which is the most typical modern man .

		My own view is that `` The Rise of Ledgar Dunstan '' provides a good deal of material for the student of social conditions and not much for the lover of novel reading .

		The idea of writing a book that shall give a vivid synthesis of modern conditions is , in Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	's hands , not unlike the idea of his own Miss Pace .

		`` I 've no end of ideas , '' she says .

		`` The worst of it is , so few of them will work out . ''

		Ledgar himself thought that the `` working out '' was the difficult thing .

		Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	has not succeeded very well .

		In his book there is a letter written by a great literary agent to the author of a first novel .

		I do not know whether it agrees with what Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	thinks people ought to say of a book .

		But it criticizes the characters as being stiff , too much given to talk , and imitated from
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		As these are exactly the things that might be said of his own work , it may be that Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	has a very clear notion of his failings .

		The letter , however , goes on to say that the author has caught the atmos - phere and that he has a very pretty pen where scenery is concerned , which is not so much to the point here .

		If these are the things that literary agents and publishers look out for , there must be something else in Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	's book which attracted attention .

		What probably did attract attention , and may attract more , is that we have here another example of the `` literature of revolt , '' in which , however , the author wrestles with the question of religion in a constructive or positive way .

		There are a dozen novelists nowadays who offer their negative criticism of religious people and ideas to one who has anything positive to say on the subject .

		Even people who have such positive ideas as Mrs.
Corra Harris	PERSON	offered in `` A Circuit-Rider 's Widow '' give them very little chance in the flood of unflattering and often observant criticism of the futility of religion in the external life of to-day , and almost no one gives any conception at all of the part that religion plays in the private life of a great many people .

		From the fiction of our day one would almost imagine that there was no religion worth mentioning in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, in `` The World Set Free , '' said that novel writers felt that reli - gion was the privilege of the pulpit , but in `` Mr.
Britling	PERSON	'' he has done something to controvert that position .

		Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	is very like others in his negative criticism ; his presentation of external religion in Eng - land is as deplorable as that of his colleagues .

		But he also presents the unaccustomed idea that there really is something in Christianity if people would only find it .

		Just what they may find is not made plain here it will probably appear more clearly in the second or third volume of the trilogy ; or perhaps in the satiric afterpiece which by rights should follow the three serious books .

		Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	does not give a very good notion of Anti-Christ or of Christ himself , but in this very vagueness he is truer to life than if he conceived his ideas with crystal clarity .

		Truth to life is not his chief aim , but he achieves it in this respect .

		Miss
Katherine Keith	PERSON	has something of the same idea as Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	.

		He wished to present the life of a young Englishman of our time .

		Miss
Keith	PERSON	s book `` reveals the development of an American girl of to-day . ''

		But whereas Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	preferred to tell the story of his man , and thereby wrestled with an extraordinarily difficult problem ,
Miss Keith	PERSON	thought it enough to choose `` signi - ficant incident and episode '' and omitted any attempt at a story which should be complete .

		It may be easier to make a personal revelation -LRB- if this be one -RRB- than to imagine the lives and actions of dozens of people and present them in such a way as to make the right impres - 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	sion .

		But there is probably little question of easy or hard in the mind of the person who can do either of these things .

		Miss
Keith	PERSON	did what she chose to do and did it well .

		I am moving on toward old age now , and when it comes to many current modes of thought and life , I am a good deal of a dodo - bird .

		That is probably why I can not imag - ine that Miss
Keith	PERSON	's young woman is in any sense a typical American girl of the present day .

		Nobody that I know of says that she is ; the publishers say that the book `` reveals the development of an American girl of to-day . ''

		An American girl
Marian Crosby	PERSON	may be , but I fancy or fear that there are few like her .

		American girls may be thought to be direct , sincere , unconventional , able to deal with reality , desirous of the best , as well as fresh , eager , impulsive , sensitive to all sorts of impressions .

		Some of them are , perhaps more in
Chicago	LOCATION	than elsewhere , though I doubt it .

		But few are as direct , sincere , and unconventional as
Marian Crosby	PERSON	.

		She liked a young man in her class at college and asked him to come and see her at her home .

		He did so , and , having waited on the steps for a while , became vexed and walked away .

		Marian saw him from the window , ran .

		down the street after him , and brought him back .

		This was a very sensible thing to do , but not a usual one .

		Whether many American girls would do such things , I can not say ; it may be that the event rep - resents a sort of ideal among the girls of our day .

		Whether it be a sketch of a typical life or not , `` The Girl '' does give a very vivid picture of a certain life .


Marian Crosby	PERSON	grew up playing with boys , reading all sorts of books , imagining long , continued romances , speculat - ing on the great mysteries of religion or sex , coming into contact with the great incon - sistencies of life , carrying on the strange ceremonial mysteries of childhood , doing extravagant , out-of-the-way things , loving this or that in nature .

		We get a definite impression of her .

		Later , the effort becomes more diffused ; there is the sugestion of a story .

		But the impression of the earlier part is so definitely made that it remains in mind much as the author must have wished .

		It is a very interesting book .

		People perhaps will like to discuss its social significance , as I have done .

		But it is chiefly worth while as a very definite rendering of an interesting con - ception , rather a rare thing in art .

		THE ADVANCE OF THE ENGLISH NOVEL .

		By
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Here we have an engagingly written sketch of English fiction , with particular emphasis upon the recent aspects .

		There is happiness of phrase in abundance , as in the reference to the `` verbose reticence '' of
Henry James	PERSON	and in the statement regarding Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	-LRB- Professor
Phelps	PERSON	's special bugaboo -RRB- that her `` so-called novels have sunk under an accumulation of excess baggage . ''

		Some - times this felicity of phrase is used to advantage in driving home a really good point , as in the fol - lowing deprecation of the outcry that American novelists shall depict sexual passion with more frankness : `` Indecency is not necessarily sincer - ity ... Changing the trumps will not help us nearly so much as more skill in playing the game . ''

		Moreover the judgments on contemporary novelists are less laudatory than in much of the `` criticism '' of our time .

		But when it is said that Professor
Phelps	PERSON	is an unusually successful popularizer , all has been said .

		A college lower classman or the jaded lay reader will find this volume genuinely stimulating ; the judicious must grieve , however , at its slapdash definitions , its airy ipse dixits , and its naive assumption that chronology in fiction or any - thing else is synonymous with advance .

		When Pro- fessor
Phelps	ORGANIZATION	tells us , for instance , that in the portrayal of a perfectly natural woman the sense of humor is not necessary , the saying seems plausible until we remember Mrs.
Poyser	PERSON	.

		And when he assures us : `` It seems to me pedantic to prefer
Scott	PERSON	to
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The latter beat the former at his own game , '' we can only feel that he has rushed in where angels fear to tread particularly if they must tread the pathway to any such conclusion as this .

		The collection of poems by
Emile Cammaerts	PERSON	are all patriotic , picturing now the busy joyous life of the people before the war , now the devasta - tion wrought by the conflict or the calm heroism of soldiers and peasants under the ordeal .

		The first group is characterized by the extreme sim - plicity noted in the previous volume of Cammaerts ; in the second , more imaginative , the reader 's atten - tion is constantly arrested by striking figures .

		Thus the tribute to the English aviator , Lieutenant Warneford , closes with these lines : Quel est 1 ` homme , qui , pour une plus noble cause , Fit un plus noble effort , Et sut jamais se forger une telle apoth6ose Sur 1 ` enclume meme de la mort ?

		A mystery play entitled `` The Three Kings '' fol - lows the poems .

		There are really four kings God and
Albert	PERSON	, Satan and the
Kaiser	PERSON	but
Albert	PERSON	appears only for a moment to hurl bold defiance in the teeth of his enemy exulting in blood
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 73 and destruction .

		`` Where is thy army ? ''

		demands the haughty conqueror .

		Partout Oft 1 ` on respecte le bien d'autrui , Et la parole donnee , Ou 1 ` on dSteste la tyrannic Oft 1 ` on ch6rit la libertfi Mon armee C'est 1 ` humanitfi !

		And at the end Satan carries off his own in the good old style , mocking his eleventh hour repent - ance : `` L'enfer rougira d'une si pietre conquete . ''

		It almost seems as if the poet had foreseen the present peace movement .


Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	's `` Heures Claires , '' the first of the trilogy of love poems addressed to his wife , is translated by
Charles Murphy	PERSON	under the title `` The Sunlit Hours . ''

		Here the fiery poet who caught his pound - ing rhythm from the anvil of modern industry speaks in gentlest accents of gratitude and rever - ence to the woman whose love had come to save him from the turmoil of his own nature : My heart was eaten by corroding rust That preyed upon my strength , Defiled my trust ; I was weary , I was old with long mistrust , I sickened of the roadway 's empty length .

		When thy feet wandered into my life 's way They brought a joy so exquisite to me That , trembling and in tears , I can but stay To worship silently .

		The scene is a garden which serves at once to shut out the stormy passions of the world and to invite nature as a symbol and sharer of the poet 's joy .

		Here as always he would be at one with the universe .

		O the splendour of our joy , for we Live doubly , in ourselves , and day 's high ecstasy .

		The reader regrets that the French is not printed with the translation .

		Even though Mme.
Cam	PERSON	- maerts 's version in a sort of rhythmic prose adds little to the value of her husband 's poems for those who can follow the original , all must be grate - ful to her for attempting only to interpret , not to supplant him .

		PROSE EDDA .

		Translated by Dr.
A. G. Brodeur	PERSON	.

		American Scandinavian Foundation ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Even in these days of the study of comparative literature ,
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, mediaeval and modern , is still deplorably far from us .

		Except in the eyes of a handful of specialists ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	alone keeps the northern peninsula on the literary map .

		But sev - eral agencies are working in this country to break up this ignorance , and chief among these is the
American Scandinavian Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		This society , besides publishing a very attractive bi-monthly , `` The American Scandinavian Review , '' is launch - ing a significant series of Scandinavian classics in translation .

		Now comes the latest volume , the first complete English version of the two translatable parts of the Icelandic `` Prose Edda . ''

		Dr.
Bro	PERSON	- deur , it seems to us , preserves the flavor of the vigorous , picturesque original very well .

		This book should open to many people the doors of the splendid prose of Icelandic narrative and the fascinating fragments of `` The Poesy of Skalds . ''

		PERSONALITY IN GERMAN LITERATURE BEFORE LUTHER .

		By
Kuno Francke	PERSON	.


Harvard Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity Press ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Professor
Kuno Francke	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	disagrees radically with
Burckhardt	PERSON	and other authorities on the Renaissance who have asserted that there is an absence of individuality in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		`` Man , ''
Burckhardt	PERSON	has alleged of that period , `` was conscious of himself only as a member of a race , people , class , family or corporation only through some general category . ''

		In opposition to this view , Professor
Francke	PERSON	has traced the expres - sion of personality in early German literature , in a short and very readable study .

		He finds in the mediaeval poet
Walther	PERSON	von der Vogelweide a gen - uine forerunner of humanism , and in his contem - porary Wolfram a noble searcher after the ideal .

		Cultivation of the inner self was carried on by Master
Eckhardt	PERSON	and the other German mystics of the fourteenth century .

		Even the anonymous folksong and religious drama are full of personal touches which relieve their universal character .

		The climax of this individualistic culture was reached in the humanistic movement of the early sixteenth century where its greatest exponents are
Erasmus	ORGANIZATION	and
Hutten	PERSON	.

		Professor
Francke	PERSON	closes with the hope that , just as
Germany	LOCATION	triumphed spiritually over the disasters of the Thirty Years ' War and of the Napoleonic invasion , so she may emerge from the present war , whatever the mili - tary result is to be , with a new and enriched spir - itual culture .

		THE PRACTICAL BOOK or EARLY AMERICAN ARTS AND CRAFTS .

		By
H. D. Eberlein	PERSON	and
Abbot McClure	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 6	MONEY	.

		Collectors and students are here offered a manual of much interest and value .

		Its scope includes silver , pewter , and other metalwork , glass , needle - work , lace and weaving , illumination , carving , dec - orative painting , and certain classes of pottery .

		Much of the material has earlier appeared in periodicals , but there are considerable additions , especially the descriptions of characteristic types and processes and the chronological lists of crafts - men , which are such `` practical '' features of the book .

		The individual chapters are based in many instances on specialized works by the leaders in the study of Colonial art , such as Mr.
R. T. Haines Halsey	PERSON	for silver , and Mr.
Edwin Atlee Barber	PERSON	for ceramics .

		The authors , however , have not failed to add new material , and the attempt at a com - prehensive treatment of Colonial handicraft is itself novel .

		In the discussion of some crafts there is an effort to distinguish the periods of their development notably in the chapter on silver , with its useful `` chronological key to silver con - tours . ''

		As the division into periods in each craft is , largely independent of the division in others , as well as of European tendencies , much revision and coordination are necessary .

		Doubtless it is still too early in the study of the subject for any - one to avoid certain inadequacies .

		Great regions of the country are still unexplored by collectors .

		The objects preserved require still more intensive study before local peculiarities and stages of 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
January 25	DATE	development can be closely determined .

		In the meantime , this book , with its clear description of some of the most important classes of objects , and its numerous well-selected illustrations , will be an excellent general guide .

		NATIONALIZING
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		By
Edward A. Steiner	PERSON	.

		Revell ;
$ 1	MONEY	.


Edward A. Steiner	PERSON	, once an immigrant from
Austria	LOCATION	, now Chautauqua lecturer and professor at
Grinnell College	ORGANIZATION	, is known to many a reader by his long series of short books dealing with current American questions .

		After camping `` On the Trail of the Immigrant , '' and `` Introducing the
American Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, '' he has now turned his attention to `` Nationalizing America . ''

		His latest book con - sists chiefly of the preserved form of recent Chautauqua lectures .

		Professor
Steiner	PERSON	avoids arguments and eschews statistics .

		He generalizes about American life and purposes along the broad - est lines and in the most assimilative phrases ; if anything more is wanted these sociological hors - d'oeuvres are not the thing .

		But they make easy reading , and they must have made still easier lectures .

		THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY .

		By
Casimir Stryienski	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The translation of
M. Funck-Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's `` National History of
France	LOCATION	'' is progressing rapidly .

		The general plan of the work has already been indicated in THE DIAL .

		The new volume begins with the Regency of
Phillipe d'Orleans	PERSON	and ends with the eve of the Revolution .

		Its most attractive feature is the portraits of great person - ages at court .

		Particularly striking is that of the unhappy queen of Louis XV ,
Marie Leszczyn	PERSON	- ska , whose character is lovingly portrayed by her countryman .

		The author has made this rather dismal period of French history so interesting that any adverse criticism seems ungrateful ; and yet , on second reading , we ask ourselves whether the fascinating portraits of the great political actors are not too detailed for the proportions of the volume .

		The foreign and domestic policies of
France	LOCATION	, with their results , are recapitulated rapidly sometimes too rapidly to be entirely clear to the uninitiated reader to whom the series is addressed .

		Again , we are not sufficiently kept in touch with the social milieu outside the court .

		We hear little of the people , save an occasional anecdote or snatch of some lampoon , inspired by unpopular measures .

		We seriously miss sufficient recognition of the part played by men of letters in preparing the cataclysm that was to come .

		The brief chapter at the end given to science and literature seems rather per - functory .

		We remember with regret the masterly chapters in the Lavisse `` History '' dealing with these subjects and their influence .

		Such a loss is ill compensated by anecdotes , however amusing or characteristic .

		NOTES AND NEWS .

		Mr.
George Bernard Donlin	PERSON	who with this issue assumes the editorship of THE DIAL was educated at
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has been a contributor to various American journals and for several years was an editorial writer on the ``
Chicago Record Herald	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		An interesting and valuable work has grown up in
Boston	LOCATION	which deserves cooperation or imitation in other cities for the supply of information needed in so many exigencies of literary , artistic , and business activities .

		An organized system of replies , rapid and thorough , to such a wide variety of inquiries is a new element in efficiency .

		It is an `` Information Clearing House '' which has on its lists the names of persons who are able to answer certain classes of questions , and which can always put the inquirer in touch with someone who is likely to know the answer .

		Sometimes the reply may be made instantly when the question comes within the fund of ready information that the
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	staff possesses ; sometimes , a national authority is at the other end of a telephone line , and in a few minutes the reply is made direct .

		Then again a little research may be necessary , but this is done quickly also .

		Its growing stock-in - trade of `` where to look , '' based upon several years ' experience , is astonishing and the range of ques - tions received and answered -LRB- and of course held private -RRB- is stated by the registrar to be extra - ordinary and interesting .

		The philosophy of the undertaking lies in its creation of the habit of coordinating books with men .

		The business man is trained to ask his fellow business man in getting light upon questions , the scholar is in the habit of consulting books , but this
Clearing House	ORGANIZATION	com - bines the two , using men and books equally as sources of information .

		NOTES FOR BIBLIOPHILES .

		The Editors will be pleased to answer inquiries or to render to readers such services as are possible .

		Mr.
Gabriel Weis	PERSON	, of 489
Fifth Ave.	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, has acquired a scrapbook of 150 Thackeray auto - graphs made up by
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	in
1864	DATE	, one year after his friend 's death .

		FitzGerald presented the collection to
Thackeray	PERSON	's daughter , now Lady
Anne Ritchie	PERSON	, its late owner , and Mr.
Weis	PERSON	is prepared to dispose of the collection in his turn to a buyer offering a reasonable guarantee against its being dispersed .

		Many items in it remain unpublished , although Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	per - mitted some of her father 's amusing letters and verses to
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	to be privately printed with an introduction by herself , in
1916	DATE	.


John Adams	PERSON	's books , after lying neglected for nearly seventy years after the death of their owner , wore acquired by the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	in
1894	DATE	and rescued from decay .

		Brought from
Quincy	LOCATION	to
Boston	LOCATION	, they have never been properly catalogued as a separate collection ; but before many weeks have passed there will be issued by the library now owning them a printed catalogue of this valuable lot of Americana and other volumes .

		It is thought to be the largest early American col - lection of books in existence , with one exception , and that is the library of Colonel
William Byrd	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Inscriptions and notes in
Adams	ORGANIZATION	's own hand add to the value of many of the volumes .

		A copy of
John Marshall	PERSON	's biography of Wash - ington is one of the more precious treasures of the collection ; it is in five volumes and is inscribed k '' the author to
John Adams	PERSON	.

		The catalogue now about to be issued will be bibliographically and historically noteworthy .

		The
Halsey	PERSON	collection of old prints , numbering more than ten thousand pieces and famous on two continents , is in process of dispersion at the
Ander	PERSON	- son Galleries , the sale of Part IV .

		-LRB- English stip - ple engravings of the eighteenth century -RRB- being now in progress .

		Still to come are the sales of etchings by old and modern masters , and English , French , and German portraits of the seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth centuries .

		The preced - ing sales disposed of Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	's Americana , including naval prints and views of
New York	LOCATION	; also his sporting prints , his French engravings of the eighteenth century , and his
Napoleonana	PERSON	, engravings of the French Revolution , and litho - graphs .

		Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	has won recognition on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	as one of the world 's greatest print-collectors , and he is spoken of as the last of the famous group of amateurs including
Firmin Didot	PERSON	, the Goncourt brothers ,
Dutuit	LOCATION	,
Valentin	PERSON	,
Gerbeau	PERSON	, and their like .

		Consequently the sale of his accumulated treasures is an event of impor - tance .

		A book once owned by Lord
Bacon	PERSON	, once kept on his library shelves , and bearing the marks of his own hand in its many marginal notes , is said to be on the point of making its public appear - ance in some
New York	LOCATION	auction room , to pass thence into the hands of some collector with a long purse .

		This precious volume , in binding of
Bacon	LOCATION	's time and bearing his mark , a dove , stamped on the cover , is a copy of `` The Bookes of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	. ''

		It was recently brought to Mr.
John Howell	PERSON	, the
San Francisco	LOCATION	dealer in rare books , by a resident of
San Jose	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	.

		On the fly-leaf is written the name , `` William Con - stable , '' which helps to trace its original ownership , since it is known that
Bacon	LOCATION	, by a clause in his will , left his books `` to my brother Constable . ''

		In strict accuracy , of course , he should have written `` brother-in-law , '' the real relationship of this Con - stable , who lived at
Perth	LOCATION	, from whence , be it noted , came the San Jose family in whose posses - sion the book has been for many generations .

		Though the Baconian fever is not just now at its hottest , the book can not fail to elicit some brisk bidding and to bring a handsome price .

1499	DATE	, by over one hundred and fifty superb wood - cuts which some critics have ascribed to
Mantegna	PERSON	, others to one of the Bellinis , and others still to
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	or even to

		The lover and the lady of

		No finer book was ever issued from the Aldine press .

		Another handsome first edition of

		The significance of any crisis which may arise in human affairs lies in the attitude of mind with which individuals or nations meet that test .

		If the crisis which confronts the
United States	LOCATION	as this issue of THE DIAL goes to press can quicken our national conscious - ness and so sharpen our sense of values that we can face realities unflinchingly and drop the fatuous self-deception which has threat - ened to corrode our spirit , we , as a nation , shall have gained something worth even the cost in human life which may result .

		To hold convictions for which we are unwilling to pay the supreme price is a greater calamity than physical suffering or sacrifice .

		Believing this , and absolutely supporting the President in the stand which he has now taken , THE DIAL will strive in the presence of whatever confusions may arise in the immediate future to maintain a clear vision , seeking to discern the shaping of those forces and convictions which make for a freer and nobler society .

		THE DIAL will continue to devote itself chiefly to the field of literature but it will also publish from time to time articles and discus - sions inspired more directly by the trend of events

		It is only fitting that cultivated Americans should , at last , wake up to the existence of 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
February	DATE	8 Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	's genius , for there are ties of blood affinity between them ,
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	,
Irish	LOCATION	, and American blood mixing in his veins , and one side of his family issuing from an old stock of pioneers whose descendants are to-day a flourishing clan in the
States	LOCATION	.

		Since his books and not his personal life are the public 's concern , one need only add that Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	was reared on an estate near
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	, that he passed his youth and early manhood in the Argentine and contigu - ous South American states , and that he has made
England	LOCATION	his home for over thirty years .

		It was his romantic environment as a child on the pampas that determined his vision and nurtured his delight in the wild life of nature .

		It was from this same environment that he acquired the most intimate knowledge of the kingdom of bird , beast , and reptile and of their habits and ways of life .

		It hap - pened that the effect of a serious illness in youth turned Mr : Hudson from a life of action to observation and contemplation of nature , and while he studied , as a spectator , her myriad activities , his dormant artistic and poetic faculties were stimulated and deepened .

		We know that late in life
Darwin	PERSON	lamented that his own artistic faculties , and his pleasure in works of the creative imagina - tion had become atrophied by his detailed scientific researches .

		Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	's nature books are certainly the best examples we have in literature of the enrichment of the field of a naturalist 's vision by the collaboration of his artistic and poetic insight .

		While the romances are , so to say , the poetic quintessence of
Hudson	LOCATION	's genius , it is not easy to define the looser , more diversified charm of his Nature books .

		Here , the blend of the most varied qualities , a spirit strong and virile yet exquisitely tender in feeling , intense susceptibility to all forms and shades of natural beauty , perfect sympathy with the spirit of living creatures , a delightful caprice , and an intimate familiarity with all aspects of the countryside , all combine in a melange of little scenes and episodes , of observations and reflections , to form a most natural pat - tern .

		Where Hudson is superior to his Eng - lish rivals , such as
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, is in the way he weaves his frankly human interests in the characters and life of countrymen he meets into the texture of his nature study .

		His wide range of emotional mood , his pas - sion for every form of bird life -LRB- he is the poet of the birds -RRB- , his hatred of materialism , of human callousness and stupidity , his artis - tic pleasure in everything characteristic blend into so natural a whole that no books could be less `` bookish '' or more refreshing than his .

		His supreme naturalness springs from his unself consciousness , his candor and direct - ness , his human flexibility , his freshness of feeling .

		So the subject of nature in his writings never appears cold , or arid , or aloof from our sympathies .

		As I have written else - where , the charm and the real force of Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	's outlook lie in his refusal to sepa - rate man 's real life from nature 's life .

		He reveals to us more than any other writer man 's true spiritual relation to the vast world of created , sentient things in earth and sky , that free life of wild nature whose beauty can not yet content our souls but we must harass , mutilate , and exterminate them , or catalogue scientifically and collect them .

		His nature books contain hundreds of pas - sages in which man 's life is presented to us as a beautiful thing when seen as a part of nature , with all its strong ties , visible and invisible , to the earth that sustains and nur - tures him , and to the firmament in which he draws his breath .

		It has been reserved for `` modern thought '' temporarily intoxicated by its hasty draught of `` scientific discover - ies '' to fail where no age ever failed before to lay stress upon man 's spiritual depend - ence on the world of nature round him .

		The great minds , the great poets , philosophers and religious teachers of all ages , from Homer to
Virgil	LOCATION	, from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	, from the Hebrew prophets downwards have never shared in the materialistic trick of the modern vision , of seeing men out of per - spective .

		But , owing to science 's materialis - tic discoveries obscuring our field of spiritual vision , nearly every writer , to-day , is trying to see into nature 's life apart from the medium of human emotion , and in vacuo , as it were .

		Though the gain of this method to physical science may be great , it is Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	's distinction to reassert that the supreme inexhaustible field that lies before man , lies outside his utilitarian interests , lies in his own spiritual absorption in the vast drama of nature 's myriad activities .

		The work of field naturalists of rank calls , indeed , for the exercise of a multiplicity of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 85 gifts .

		If we think of
Gilbert White	PERSON	,
Waterton	LOCATION	,
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, or of Belt
Bates	PERSON	and
Wallace	PERSON	, or of
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Burroughs	LOCATION	,
Bradford Torrey	ORGANIZATION	, we see that the tempera - ment of each observer face to face with wild nature is , so to say , a set of tools peculiar to himself with which he explores `` the com - plex system of things we call nature . ''

		In a passage , practically unknown , I have exam - ined why it is that the trained observer who is rich in feeling , penetrates into vast regions of nature 's life necessarily debarred to the `` impassive '' observers who occupy themselves with `` facts '' and `` laws , '' so I summarize it here : `` A page from Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	's last book , ` Hampshire Days , ' will best illustrate the degree to which his subtle artistic method of interpreting ` scientific facts ' throws open new avenues in approaching nature 's life : '' THE CUCKOO FOUNDLING .

		The end of the little history the fate of the ejected nestling and the attitude of the parent robins remains to be told .

		When the young cuckoo throws out the nestlings from nests in trees , hedges , bushes , and reeds , the victims , as a rule , fall some distance to the ground , or in the water , and are no more seen by the old birds .

		Here , the young robin , when ejected , fell a distance of but five or six inches , and rested on a broad , bright green leaf , where it was an exceedingly conspicuous object ; and when the mother robin was on the nest and at this stage she was on it a greater part of the time warming that black-skinned , toad-like , spurious babe of hers , her bright intelligent eyes were looking full at the other one , just beneath her , which she had grown in her body , and had hatched with her warmth , and was her very own .

		I watched her for hours ; watched her when warming the cuckoo , when she left the nest , and when she returned with food , and warmed it again , and never once did she pay the least atten - tion to the outcast lying so close to her .

		There , on its green leaf , it remained , growing colder by degrees , hour by hour , motionless , except when it lifted its head as if to receive food , then dropped it again , and when at intervals , it twitched its body , as if try - ing to move .

		During the evening these slight motions ceased , though that feeblest flame of life was not yet extinguished ; but in the morning it was dead and cold and stiff ; and just above it , her bright eyes on it , the mother robin sat on the nest as before , warming her cuckoo .

		How amazing and almost incredible it seems that a being such as a robin , intelligent above most birds , as we are .

		apt to think , should prove in this instance to be a mere automaton !

		The case would , I think , have been different if the ejected one had made a sound , since there is nothing which more excites the parent bird , or which is more instantly responded to than the cry of hunger or distress of the young .

		But at this early stage the nestling is voiceless another point in favour of the parasite .

		The sight of its young , we see , slowly and dumbly dying , touches no chord in the parent ; there is , in fact , no recogni - tion ; once out of the nest it is no more than a col - oured leaf , or bird-shaped pebble , or fragment of clay .

		It happened that my young fellow-watchers , see - ing that the ejected robin if left there would inevit - ably perish , proposed to take it in to feed and rear it to save it , as they said ; but I advised them not to attempt such a thing , but rather to spare the bird .

		To spare it the misery they would inflict on it by attempting to fill its parents ' place ... It would perhaps have a wholesome effect on their young minds and save them from grieving overmuch at the death of a newly hatched robin , if they would con - sider this fact of the pain that is and must be ... When
summer	DATE	came round again they would find no more birds than they had now .

		And so it would be in all places ; all that incalculable increase would have perished .

		Many millions would be de - voured by rapacious birds and beasts ; millions more would perish of hunger and cold ; millions of migrants would fall by the way , some in the sea , and some on the land ; those that returned from distant regions would be but a remnant .

		It is not only that this inconceivable amount of bird-life must be destroyed each year , but we can not suppose that death is not a painful process .

		In a vast majority of cases , whether the bird slowly perishes of hunger and weakness , or is pursued and captured by birds and beasts of prey , or is driven by cold adverse winds and storms into the waves , the pain , the agony , must be great .

		The least painful death is undoubtedly that of the bird , that , weakened by want of susten - ance , dies by night of cold in severe weather .

		It is indeed most like the death of the nestling , but a few hours out of the shell , which has been thrown out of the nest , and which soon grows cold and dozes its feeble , unconscious life away ... This descriptive analysis of bird-life is sat - urated with human feeling .

		But do we lose or gain knowledge thereby ?

		Does it not carry us from low to higher ranges of comprehen - sion ?

		Let us suppose that it were para - phrased in `` impassive , '' scientific language , and its artistic and poetic shades of feeling were expunged .

		In that case the bald facts recounted would remain as a groundwork , but the very spirit of life in the thing seen would be altered , our insight and compre - hension would be indefinitely lessened .

		So the `` impassive '' scientists themselves are in a dilemma .

		We can not actually comprehend nature 's life without being emotionally affected by it , that is , our comprehension is largely the emotion it excites in us .

		So , face to face with nature 's wild life , `` scientific observation '' must be supplemented and inspired by artistic and poetic methods of divination .

		To comprehend sentient life we must employ all the old emotional tools of the human mind , all those shades of aesthetic sensibility and of human imagination by which the great artists and poets seize and apprehend the character of life .

		The scien - tists are in their element in investigating the working of physical laws , in determining the properties or the functions of living organ - isms , but a knowledge of these laws no more 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
February	DATE	qualifies them to apprehend the character , nature , or spirit of the life of nature 's wild creatures under the open sky than a perfect knowledge of anatomy can make a man a Praxiteles .

		And wild nature 's life being a natural drama of instinct , an unceasing play of hun - ger , love , battle , courtship , fear , parental emotion , vanity , and most of all , perhaps , pure enjoyment of physical powers , it is obvi - ous that every man who is irresponsive in his feelings or possessed of a dull artistic imag - ination , or weak aesthetic sensibilities , must remain practically aloof from wild nature , and its infinte feast of characteristic displays .

		He will not see or feel what is going on in forest and meadow , and so , remaining blind to the whole force and spirit of nature , he will not be able to pronounce on its life !

		One can not of course hope to communicate anything of the charm of
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's nature books by these generalizations .

		For the finest , closest , most sympathetic study ever made of the life of the old-fashioned English country - man the reader should turn to `` A
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	's Life , '' while `` Nature in Downland '' will give him a more variegated picture of the wild charm and human interest of the region of the
Sussex South Downs	LOCATION	than is presented even by
Gilbert White	PERSON	or Jefferies . ''

		Hamp - shire Days , '' similarly , does for the New For - est what `` The Land 's End '' does for Corn - wall .

		Happy is the American reader who acquiring these and `` Afoot in
England	LOCATION	'' for less than half the price of a suit of clothes can enter into free communion with the mag - ical , antique beauty of the wild life of Eng - land 's unspoiled hills and woods and mead - ows and moors and coast .

		It is distressing to have to set down , here , that so far as this critic 's experience goes , not one in a hundred readers really cares for work of fine creative imagination and rare spiritual beauty .

		The tale most poignant in its tragic beauty in the English language is , I hold , `` El Ombu . ''

		I thought so fifteen years ago when , as reader to a certain Lon - don publisher , I found and read the MS. : but our public does not love tales that dis - turb its complacency , and its reception , when published in `` The Greenback Library , '' was lukewarm .

		`` Green Mansions , '' issued in
1904	DATE	, secured a select , enthusiastic audience , as did the reprint of `` A Purple Land '' in the same year .

		But the three romances remained caviare to the larger audience that was then beginning to take note of Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	and Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		It is characteristic of the public that when it flocks to drink at the fashionable literary wells , whether it be of
Stevenson	PERSON	in this decade , or Kipling or
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	in that , it will not turn its head to look at exquisite springs lying a little way off the track . '

		One hears that .

		America is in the act , to-day , of `` discovering '' Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	, whose books have , with few excep - tions , been `` placed '' with American publish - ers for over twenty years !

		It seems a little odd that no American critic should have pro- claimed their merits before Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's lead , but perhaps his voice has been lost amid the cries of the market place ?

		Let us hope the critics will discriminate between the three masterpieces named above and a fourth romance , `` A Crystal Age , '' which is conspic - uously inferior .

		Not that this latter story is - not ingenious and original , and founded on a picturesque idea , but it has the central defect inherent in such Utopias , which are always builded of bricks hastily baked and of literary timber insufficiently seasoned .

		Human nature is too elastic and too infinitely various to be compressed for long , if at all , into such a framework as the
House Beau	ORGANIZATION	- tiful and the Maternal Shrine provide .

		It is , at back , the social model of the Beehive with the solitary Queen mother enthroned in its centre that Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	has adopted in an arbitrary and vivid fashion .

		`` A Crystal Age '' was not a little inspired by
William Morris	PERSON	's aesthetic-socialistic movement of the period , with the beautiful mediaeval trap - pings dear to the Morris-Burne-Joiies school of art .

		The author was here engaged in an idea antithetic to his passion for nature untamed , free , ever changing , with her myriad forms of sentient life , challenging man 's transitory achievements .

		But we need not labor to assail the
House Beautiful	ORGANIZATION	: it has already passed into the limbo of all such imaginary systems .

		How far superior to `` A Crystal Age '' in character and art are the romances `` The Purple Land , '' `` Green Man - sions , '' and the four short stories in `` El Ombu '' !

		The latter
spring	DATE	from native roots thrust - ing deep in the Spanish-American soil .

		Only a writer who had been born and bred in
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 87 the atmosphere of the pampas could have reflected with such crystalline simplicity the passion , the grave melancholy , and the dig - nified grace of this Spanish-American people .

		The title story , `` El Ombu , '' with old
Nican	PERSON	- dro 's lament over the ruined house , where
Donata and Valerio	PERSON	,
Monica	PERSON	and
Bruno	PERSON	in turn know the sorrow that is heavier than death , is a model of restrained pathos .

		And with what sureness does
Hudson	PERSON	sway our hearts and command pity for even the tyrant Santos who waits in exile vainly for pardon for his crime , while his house ,
El Ombu	LOCATION	, is falling to ruin .

		It is a story of bloodshed , of the sacrifice of sweet and humble natures to the demon of war , and -LRB- God knows ! -RRB-

		it is the sad epitome that millions of European ' mourners to-day are sealing with their tears .

		The infinite depths of woe that the human heart can suffer , the triumph of the proud and wicked man over the good , this is graved with strokes , exquisitely strong and tender in scenes of strange fascination .

		Unique in atmosphere also are the three other stories in the volume , the `` Story of a Piebald Horse , '' `` Niuo Diablo , '' ``
Marta Eiquelme	PERSON	'' three masterpieces of narrative which mirror the landscape , the conditions of Gaucho life and the heart of the people .

		In point of spir - itual flavor as well as of simplicity and breadth of style they stand by themselves in modern literature .

		Hudson 's underlying note , deep passion melting into deep tender - ness and mournful poignancy , is seen no less clearly in `` Green Mansions , '' a forest romance of the virgin regions lying beyond the upper
Orinoco	LOCATION	.

		The American reader by now should know the story how the hero ,
Abel	PERSON	, a gold-seeker , dwelling with a taciturn and crafty tribe of Indians , discovers Eima , the beautiful , wild child , the last member of a vanished high-caste native race ; how he loves her and shares her life with the old trapper ,
Nuflo	PERSON	, till at last she meets a cruel death at the hands of the savage Euni and his tribe .

		`` The romantic framework and plot , '' as I have said elsewhere , `` are of importance only as being the artistic medium by which the author finds free utterance for those ethereally floating , mysterious sensa - tions that the hero 's heart and senses receive and absorb in contact with the wild life of the forest .

		In Abel 's tender passion for the exquisite , capriciously sensitive Eima ,
Hud	ORGANIZATION	- son has mingled his own most intimate and abiding joy in nature 's everlasting beauty .

		In
Eima	LOCATION	's senselessly brutal death he has bodied forth humanity 's shuddering terror at nature 's dark woof of evil .

		An exquisite strain of man 's spiritual perception of nature 's glory gives place in Abel 's mind , on
Eima	ORGANIZATION	's death , to an animal ferocity of rage and to a moral insanity .

		In his furious revolt against life he draws
Euni	ORGANIZATION	's hereditary foes to slaughter him and all his tribe .

		With the most penetrating skill the author draws out all the intricate skein of human passion , from the shrinking innocence of
Eima	ORGANIZATION	's love to
Abel	PERSON	's blood-lust of revenge , and illustrates each feeling in turn by fleeting , glancing visions of the unhuman life of nature in the pathless forest , a drama ever passing before
Abel	PERSON	's watching eyes . ''

		The romance embod - ies , in fact , a profound spiritual analysis of the tragedy innate in the very structure of life , in the fibres of intellectual being .

		But the tragedy of `` Green Mansions '' is relieved by the play of fancy , of light and shade in the varied descriptions , and also by the passages of irony put into the mouth of old Nuflo , and addressed to the Creator .

		I could wish for space , to discuss the orig - inal qualities of the no less remarkable romance `` The Purple Land , '' a book which , in its variegated charm , in its gay and seduc - tively soft love episodes , in its intimate pic - tures of family life in the
Banda Oriental	LOCATION	, in its scenes of battle , in its careless easy grace of manner and address , reveals the sunny freedom of the author 's youth .

		But I have already , I fear , taken up too much of THE DIAL 'S space , and for this I apologize .

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Professor
Albert Schinz	PERSON	, head of the French department of
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	, sends me a pamphlet entitled `` The Eenewal of French Thought on the Eve of the War , '' the gist of which is found in the phrases : All at once , with practical unanimity , a whole gen - eration , all that is young and strong and hopeful , rushes with enthusiasm into the new path , the traditional Catholicism of
France	LOCATION	... the ortho - dox Catholicism of the priest , the Catholicism of the repenting sinner , the Catholicism of the
France	LOCATION	which had been honored by the title of `` Eldest Daughter of the Church . ''

		88 -LSB-
February 8	DATE	In the same post which brought me Pro- fessor
Schinz	PERSON	's pamphlet came a package of books freshly printed at
Paris	LOCATION	under the aus - pices of the
Comite Catholique de Propagande Franchise	ORGANIZATION	a 1 ` Etranger , in which I found `` La Guerre Allemande et le Catholicisme '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Bloud & Gay , 2 frs .

		40 -RRB- and `` L'Alle - magne et les Allies devant la Conscience Chretienne '' -LRB- same publisher , 3 frs .

		60 -RRB- .

		Facing the title-page of both these books is a list of names composing the
Comite Catho	ORGANIZATION	- lique , made up of a dozen cardinals and Catholic bishops , followed by the names of some thirty laymen , most of them distin - guished Frenchmen but all of them out of joint with the Republic , who at heart would prefer to see the present regime supplanted , if it were possible , by a monarchy of some sort .

		If you examine the contents of these volumes , you will find them full of noble patriotism and deep love of
France	LOCATION	, but you will discover almost no reference to the political life of the country , to the men who are ruling the nation , no mention of the Republic or of republicanism .

		If it were not for the `` union sacree , '' such volumes as these would have much to say about these men and these institutions , but in a spirit of attack and revilement .

		The hidden hatred is not dead .

		To-day you can not frequent a French military hospital and talk with certain of the wounded , especially with some of the officers , without perceiving that this old malice is not even slumbering .

		The explanation of this unfortunate situation is to be found in the fact that the French Catholic church got on the wrong side of the struggle , which was long and uncertain , for the foundation of the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	, and there it has ever since been and there it will be when the present conflict with
Germany	LOCATION	is ended .

		Even the most superficial student of French affairs , if he tries to see things as they really are and not as his preconceived religious desires would have them , will find that the ancient fight in
France	LOCATION	between ultramontanism and mon - archy on the one hand and the spirit and beliefs of the French Revolution on the other , is as full of life and fire as ever ; and there can be no doubt on which side the final victory will be .

		In fact , it is practically won already .

		Let me assure Professor
Schinz	PERSON	that nobody in
France	LOCATION	with his eyes and mind open would agree with him when he says that `` all that is young and strong and hopeful is rushing with enthusiasm into the traditional
Catho	PERSON	- licism . ''

		Far from it .

		If we .

		turn to `` La Guerre Actuelle '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Payot , 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , by Professor Aulard , who fills with distinction at the Sorbonne the chair of the French Revolution , we find full con - firmation of what I have just said .

		Notwith - standing the restraint imposed by the `` union sacree , '' we notice such passages as this : The religious question divides and impassions Frenchmen the most .

		By this I do not mean that the French like to descant on transubstantiation , the trinity , and the Sacred Heart .

		We care nothing about dogmas .

		It would provoke a smile if anybody in a conversation among friends should show an interest in these things ... Almost all the leaders of the Catholic church in
France	LOCATION	are conservative in politics and socialism .

		A Catholic republican is an exception .

		The Catholic church in
France	LOCATION	is the bond which binds together all the reactionary parties .

		One of the results of this divorcing of the Catholic church and the Republic has been that , as the Radical Republican party grew until it dominated
France	LOCATION	, there was an increasing demand that the young priesthood be treated in military matters just like the laic youth ; and this was done .

		So in the present war we see in the French army , and in the French army alone among all the bellig - erents , priests and abbes charging , shooting , and bayoneting just like the ordinary poilu , and in every hospital you meet the wounded or sick ecclesiastic .

		This side of the contest is attracting more and more attention from the general French public ; and the publishers , who are a good barometer in these things , are issuing a larger and larger number of books treating of it .

		In fact , oddly enough , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, naturally proud of its brave soldier - priests , seems , in its enthusiasm , almost to approve of this forced violation on their part of the teachings of Christ .

		I shall touch on two or three of these books .

		`` Moine et Soldat '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Galbada , 50 centimes -RRB- , with a preface by
M. Henry Cochin	PERSON	, gives a series of letters written from the front by a young abbe ,
Sergeant Aime Berthomier	PERSON	, who was in the thickest of the fight in
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	, from the opening of the war until he met his death most gallantly in
August 1915	DATE	.

		These simple , pious letters , which show how this young priest had entered thoroughly , but against his will , into the new life so different from his chosen one , prepare the reader for a really remarkable book , which presents the priest on the firing-line in a most original and entertaining manner .

		`` Les Soutanes sous la Mitraille '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Gautier	PERSON	, 1 fr .

		25 -RRB- , by Abbe
Rene Gaell	PERSON	, a priest attached to a military hospital as an orderly , has gone through over fifty editions and richly deserves its success .

		Abbe
Duroy	PERSON	, a friend of the author , is a stretcher-bearer at the front , who sends him letters from time to time telling him what he and the other ecclesiastics are doing in the trenches and during the attacks .

		Both men write well , THE DIAL 89 especially Abbe
Gaell	PERSON	, who has a real gift for descriptive narration and often presents scenes with an effect worthy of a Maupassant , and , Abbe though he be , these scenes from the rough life of the common soldier are not always free from those propos gaulois which sometimes shock .

		English and Americans in
Maupassant	LOCATION	.

		The only thing to criticize about this exceptional book is the bad paper on which it is printed .

		Of course , it is not only the Catholic ecclesiastics whom the laws of
France	LOCATION	call to the colors ; the same is true of those of all other denominations .

		Protestants , Jews , and Mohammedans are nobly and bravely doing their part , as any military hospital will show .

		But I have not chanced on a book which brings out this fact so well as does that of Abbe
Gaell	PERSON	for the Catholics .

		However , the `` Memoire de
Roger Allier	PERSON	, '' privately printed by the stricken family of this rare young man , whom I saw develop from boyhood to the
spring	DATE	of manhood , largely meets the case .

		His father , Professor
Raoul Allier	PERSON	, is , as I pointed out in THE DIAL a year ago , a dis - tinguished Protestant clergyman and learned teacher in the
Paris	LOCATION	Theological Seminary ; and , though this , his eldest son , born in
1890	DATE	and killed in the first month of the war under most atrocious circumstances , was destined for civil pursuits , he was a most active mem - ber of the Protestant church , as is revealed in many passages of these letters .

		But the book is interesting from several other points of view .

		It offers , almost in his own words , the history of the young life of a French boy of the best type , from his birth to the age of twenty-four , and possesses a charm and a value quite its own .

		It brings out painfully , too , the fearful loss that
Europe	LOCATION	is now under - going in the holocaust of the elite of its youth , and it also largely explains why
France	LOCATION	has been making such a magnificent exhibi - tion at the front .

		There are not in the trenches many French young men of the exceptional parts of
Roger Allier	PERSON	, but there are some , and it is this superior group which gives the tone to the whole army .

		The elevated quality of
Roger Allier	PERSON	's mind comes out in one of his letters written from
Scotland	LOCATION	when he was a boy of sixteen ; he tells his mother that he is `` enjoying immensely '' Dr.
Francis G. Peabody	PERSON	's `` Afternoons in the
College Chapel	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The last message received from him , two days before his death , was a post card with these words traced on it : `` All goes well '' ; and yet his real physical condi - tion at the moment when he wrote these cheer - ing words to his anxious parents is thus given in his general 's dispatches : `` Though gravely wounded in both legs , Second Lieutenant Allier continued to encourage his men with the most remarkable energy . ''

		The little introduction to `` Moine et Soldat '' mentioned a moment ago , represents but a small part of
M. Henry Cochin	ORGANIZATION	's literary activity during the past few months .

		We have , for instance , his `` Discours '' -LRB- Nogent - le-Rotrou : Daupeley-Gouverneur , 25 cen - times -RRB- , or speech delivered before the French Historical Society , of which he was president , at its last annual meeting .

		It is a curious contribution to war literature .

		M.
Cochin	LOCATION	is an authority in
France	LOCATION	on the
Italy	LOCATION	of the Middle Ages , and in this speech he tells what the Italians of that time thought of the Ger - mans .

		The picture is not a pleasant one ; the whole thing seems to be summed up in the term tedeschi lurchi , on the etymology and signification of the last word of which phrase ,
M. Cochin	ORGANIZATION	dwells at considerable length .

		All of which offers another example I have given several in this correspondence from month to month - of the extreme bitterness against
Germany	LOCATION	which this war has engen - dered in the scholarly elite of
France	LOCATION	, where perhaps never in the whole history of the country has the feeling been so intense .

		It may be well to keep this fact in mind in any study of the present political situation in
Europe	LOCATION	, as it is pretty sure to have a strong and perhaps decisive influence on the future peace negotiations .

		Even M.
Cochin	LOCATION	's new edition of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's `` Vita Nova '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Champion , 4 frs . -RRB-

		has not escaped this war scourge , though affected in quite another way .

		It was being printed when the storm burst and a few copies had been actually distributed .

		But the mobiliza - tion suspended the work of printers and binders , and it was only recently that the volume was really published .

		The second part of the introduction should be read in order to grasp the value of this translation and to learn the careful labor that has been bestowed upon it .

		Further details concerning the pub - lication of this admirable volume are given in this extract from a letter which I have received from the author :
Abbeville	LOCATION	, where was the printing-office , was invaded during the German onrush towards
Paris	LOCATION	, and
M. Edouard Champion	ORGANIZATION	, the well-known and learned publisher , was called to the front as captain , where he was wounded and decorated ; and it was from the trenches that he sent the order to print the book .

		Professor
Vittorio Cian	PERSON	, of the
University of Turin	ORGANIZATION	, presenting the volume to the readers of one of the leading Italian newspapers , gives his article this suggestive title : `` Latin Serenity , '' and informs me in support of this assertion of our seren - ity in the midst of the storm , that , while my book was coming out in
Paris	LOCATION	, a new volume in the grand 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 8	DATE	edition of the `` Works of Goldoni '' was appearing at
Venice	LOCATION	.

		And in this same connection , I may add that at Vicence , an Italian city not less exposed to the enemy than is
Venice	LOCATION	, has just been brought out another volume of the great collection of Vicentian Documents ; all of which goes to prove that the scholars of
France	LOCATION	as well as those of
Italy	LOCATION	con - tinue to work on in calmness and with resolution .

		Of course important labors in the fields of history , philology and archaeology have received a serious set - back from the war , if for no other reason than because all of our young scholars are in the army , where many have been killed or wounded .

		Our dis - tinguished savant , Mgr .

		Duchesne , director of our
Archseological School	ORGANIZATION	at
Eome	ORGANIZATION	, replied to a journal - ist who asked him the other day if it would not be better to spare these precious lives : `` You may say what you like , but you would never get any of our young archaeologists to become ` slackers . ' ''

		So there are left in our great special schools only the weak and deformed , as , for instance , at the
School of Charters	ORGANIZATION	, where are to-day but thirteen students instead of 80 as is the case in normal times .

		All who can work are doing so , and all of us old men are also busy in our way .

		We hold that our first duty towards our country is to prepare a fine morrow when the day .

		of victory comes , by keeping up the intellectual and scholarly side of life .

		Hence it is that our learned bodies , as , for example , the French Historical Society , the French Antiquarian Society , the
Paris	LOCATION	Historical Society , etc. , continue to issue their publications .

		Also the learned reviews , like the `` Revue Historique , '' the '' Bibliotheque de 1 ` Ecole des Chartes , '' etc. , appear regularly .

		Still another pamphlet by
M. Henry Cochin	ORGANIZATION	calls for a word , `` L'CEuvre des Eglises Devastees , '' which explains the interesting work of a society that bears the same name as the title of this pamphlet and that seeks the restoration of the ruined chapels and churches in the war zone as the Germans retire .

		M.
Cochin	LOCATION	mentions two women Mile .

		Desval - lieres and Mile .

		Eeyre who have shown remarkable talent in the decorative art side of the society 's labor , another example of what I have touched upon more than once in this correspondence , namely , how much this war has done to advance the activities of women .

		In case any Americans may wish to aid this society in its work , its office , where copies of M.
Cochin	LOCATION	's pamphlet may be had , is 3 rue Oudinot ,
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The
Comite Catholique	ORGANIZATION	, already mentioned , has issued several illustrated publications , which show by their pictures and explain by their texts the extent and character of the destruction of church property which
M. Cochin	ORGANIZATION	's society would repair .

		These books , which are published by
Bloud	ORGANIZATION	and Gay ,
Paris	LOCATION	, are : `` La Guerre Allemande et le Catholi - cisme , '' two albums -LRB- 1 fr .

		20 each -RRB- , edited by Mgr .


Alfred Baudrillart	PERSON	, rector of the Cath - olic Institute of
Paris	LOCATION	; `` La Lourdes du Nord , '' -LRB- 1 fr . -RRB-

		, by
Rene le Cholleux	PERSON	, being the account of the destruction of
Notre Dame de Brebieres	ORGANIZATION	, a modern church in the little city of
Albert	LOCATION	,
Picardy	LOCATION	; `` Arras sous les Obus , '' -LRB- 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , by Abbe
Foulon	PERSON	, with a preface by the Bishop of
Arras	LOCATION	, containing one hundred varied illustrations showing how terribly this fine old city of
Artois	PERSON	has suf - fered ; and lastly , a collection of a dozen illustrated post cards -LRB- 1 f r. -RRB- , depicting many of the scenes of ruin given in the books just mentioned .

January 26 , 1917	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE DIAL prints on another page the reply of Dr.
William E. Dodd	PERSON	, professor of Amer - ican History at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, to an attack made upon him in the editorial columns of ``
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly , '' apropos of his review of a historical work published by
P. F. Collier & Son	ORGANIZATION	.

		In charging Professor
Dodd	PERSON	with advocating that history `` should be a pamphlet , sparing the truth where it is inconvenient for the pamphleteer , '' the editorial writer lays his finger on the very fault against which Professor
Dodd	PERSON	protested in his review of `` Patriots and Statesmen . ''

		The whole point of Professor
Dodd	PERSON	's argu - ment was that the authors of that work had spared the truth where it was convenient for their purpose .

		After realizing that the editor - ial writer is incapable of understanding Eng - lish , one is not surprised to learn that he has never heard of Professor
Dodd	PERSON	or the group of realistic writers who are trying to substi - tute an intelligible reading of American his - tory for the pious imposture on which he was brought up .

		If proof were required of the great need for the service which Professor
Dodd	PERSON	and his colleagues are rendering , it could be found in the survival of the sort of mind that is seized with hysteria when it discovers , in a book review , that the Fathers were not pure idealists , bent on establishing democracy at any cost , but men with humanly mixed motives not above considering the ef - fects of constitution making on their pocket - books .

		The rewriting of American history in the light of what we now know about the complex play of economic and social motives is certainly one of the most important tasks to which sincere and able men , eager to substi - tute thought for emotionalism in our national life , can address themselves .

		As editor of the `` Riverside History of the United States ' '' and author of a number of books on American historv , which the editorial writer can find
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 91 listed in `` Who 's Who '' if he has 110 more exhaustive reference works at hand , Pro- fessor
Dodd	PERSON	's contribution has been distin - guished .

		That ` he should be subjected to the attacks of bigotry and ignorance is , unhap - pily , the penalty he has to pay for defending unpopular truth .

		NATIONAL SERVICE IN ITS EFFECTS ON LITER - ATURE is a matter of present concern to both writers and publishers in
England	LOCATION	.

		One publisher , quoted by the
London	LOCATION	correspond - ent of the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' expresses in frank and cheerful terms his uncertainty as to what is to become of him and his prosper - ous business in the near future .

		`` I do n't know how this
National Service	ORGANIZATION	development is going to affect things , '' he confesses .

		`` We have difficulties enough with the labor short - age already .

		But now , at all events , printers , binders , publishers , and the rest of us , can patch up our broken staffs with men over military age , and if these are to be taken away the production of books will become a really tough proposition .

		I am not much beyond fifty and may be called upon myself . ''

		But he hastens to add that he is not `` grous - ing '' about it .

		`` I 'm game to do what 's nec - essary and chance it .

		It 's easy enough to say you wo n't have a patched-up peace and will never allow the Germans to impose their own terms upon us so long as you are sitting com - fortably at home and somebody else is doing all the fighting and suffering all the incon - venience of the war for you .

		This
National Service	ORGANIZATION	stunt is going to prove how much we mean of that and whether we mean it enough to be ready to do our share towards winning the peace we want .

		If I have to go it will hit me pretty hard , but it has hit plenty of others before me .

		What 's good enough for the rest of the nation is good enough for me .

		So I 'm not worrying .

		Drop in a few weeks later and I may be able to tell you then what I shall be doing next
spring	DATE	.

		I may be busy with potatoes and turnips then instead of books .

		We shall see . ''

		Certainly there is good as well as evil in the grim necessity that is making impossible for so many the comfort - able continuance of their safe and sheltered lives and the uninterrupted enjoyment of their regular incomes .

		TYPOGRAPHICAL TRICKSINESS has been a commonplace ever since -LRB- and probably also before -RRB- the `` wicked Bible '' of
1631	DATE	enjoined upon mankind a most shocking positive com - mand instead of a very salutary prohibition .

		Then there was the `` vinegar Bible '' of
1717	DATE	, which excited amusement by its heading to the twentieth chapter of Luke : `` Parable of the Vinegar '' a sour memory to the unlucky printer , though no such fine was imposed upon him as upon his earlier fellow-crafts - man for the omission of `` not . ''

		That little slip is said to have cost the one responsible for it three hundred pounds .

		It must have been a kinsman of his that was responsible for `` sin on more , '' instead of `` sin no more , '' in the first English Bible printed in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Harry Lyman Koopman	PERSON	, in his recent volume , `` The Booklover and His Books , '' quotes some amusing examples of typograph - ical perversity .

		General Pillow on his return from
Mexico	LOCATION	was hailed by a
Southern	ORGANIZATION	editor in grandiloquent language as the `` battle - scarred veteran , '' to which the hero took exception and demanded an apology .

		The editor proceeded to retract the epithet on the following day , but in his printed apology the comparatively inoffensive adjective reap - peared , to his horror , as `` bottle-scarred . ''

		Perhaps the most diabolical achievement credited to the imp of the types is that which made a
Vermont	LOCATION	newspaper announce , in an obituary notice of a man who had originally come from
Hull	PERSON	, in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, that `` the body was taken to Hell , where the rest of the family are buried . ''

		THOUGH WORK IN LOCAL HISTORY has made great progress in this country within recent years , still much , very much , remains to be done in order to bring this department of knowledge up to the level which it attained long ago in the older nations of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
James Truslow Adams	PERSON	, who resides in one of the oldest towns of
Long Island	LOCATION	, offers , in `` Memorials of Old
Bridgehampton	LOCATION	, '' a pri - vately printed volume which is just out , a good example of how this local history work should be done .

		`` It has meant a deal of labor , '' he says , referring to this book , in a private letter , `` but it is one of those things which are worth doing once . ''

		In his preface , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	further says : '' In a local history , the details are usually of more interest than the general narration '' ; so we are not aston - ished that he has succeeded in packing into his pages much curious and little-known information often of more general interest than he seems to imagine .

		Thus , most of us will be surprised to learn that there were thirteen distinct Indian tribes on this one island which is only about a hundred miles long ; that the towns were settled not from the Mother Country but from colonies already placed in the New ; that the churches in 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 8	DATE	those early days , in the nation which later took the lead in the complete separation of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, were `` town churches , i. e. , civil government churches '' ; that whaling , `` which was one of the chief industries of
Long Island	LOCATION	, was tremendously checked by the gold rush to
California	LOCATION	in
1849	DATE	, '' and that the `` Cadmus , '' which brought
Lafayette	LOCATION	to
America	LOCATION	in
1824	DATE	, was one of those many Sag Harbor whalers which later `` went round the Horn '' seeking
Eldorado	LOCATION	.

		Here and there an amusing note is mingled with this more seri - ous information , as in the epitaphs an odd place to look for fun which Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has copied from some of the crumbling tomb - stones in the town cemetery .

		These two , for instance : Cook is no more , his soul has took its flight From sin and darkness to celestial light .

		See blooming
Williams	ORGANIZATION	in the clay cold tomb .

		BROKEN RHYTHM AND FAULTY RHYME , in verse manifestly intended to be the very - opposite of `` free , '' may offend more than the utmost freedom of professedly free verse .

		To the four magazines now striving to advance the cause of poetry in this country there has very recently been added a fifth , `` The Ajax , '' edited and published by Mr.
C. Victor Stahl	PERSON	at
Alton	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		Its `` policy and purpose , '' as editorially announced , `` will be to publish each month as much good verse and literary comment as is possible under mechanical lim - itations , and to combat the encroachment of free verse , which threatens to destroy the very life and being of poetic art in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		It lays emphasis on `` the fundamental prin - ciples or elements of art , which are concep - tion and execution . ''

		It quotes Mr.
Max Eastman	PERSON	's censure of `` free '' verse as `` lazy '' verse .

		It holds up to derision a specimen of free verse from `` Poetry . ''

		Thus > the reader of `` Ajax '' is led to look for something approaching formal perfection in the verse accepted and printed by Mr.
Stahl	PERSON	.

		But dis - appointment lies in wait on the very first page , where an unsigned poem of twenty lines -LRB- is it from the editor 's pen ? -RRB-

		violates the rules of both rhyme and rhythm .

		It is entitled `` The Poet 's Invocation , '' and begins thus : Lo !

		multifold dreamers and schemers are we , Building huge castles of things that ought to be , Out of sheer nothing grand fabrics we make ,
Clad	PERSON	in the fire of frenzy in dreams unawake .

		And now , just as we seem , with some diffi - culty and considerable jolting , to have got the beat , to have settled into the canter of this
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	, suddenly there comes a change and the trisyllabic feet , four to the line , give place to the dissyllabic feet , five to the line .

		Pres - ently , too , we meet our old acquaintance ,
Attila	LOCATION	, disguised by a false accent unless we prefer a painfully limping line and before long our ear for rhyme is jarred by the following : We tread the gardens of Semiramis , We weave the Trojan legends while ye list .

		This may recall to some the nursery jingle beginning :
Elizabeth	LOCATION	,
Lizzie	PERSON	,
Betsy	PERSON	, and
Bess Went	PERSON	to the woods to find a bird 's nest .

		WHERE THE WRITTEN WORD is APPRECIATED , just now , is made plain by a short communi - cation from Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	to an admirer of his poetry who had written to express his admiration .

		The poet says , in a letter from the trenches in northern
France	LOCATION	: `` The best service you could do me would be to write to me from time to time .

		My address will be :
John Masefield	PERSON	, 2nd Lieutenant '' and then follow certain cabalistic symbols , `` 1 -LRB- d -RRB- G.H.Q. B.E.F. , '' with ``
France	LOCATION	'' at the end .

		`` Believe me , '' the writer adds , `` I shall always be glad to hear from you . ''

		No doubt a friendly and sympathetic word , bringing a whiff of the outside world to the entrenched fighter , whether he be poet or mechanic or farmer , is always welcome , even from an utter stranger .

		In fact , certain appeals for reading matter for the front lay emphasis on the eagerness with which a direct and personal word is read , in contrast with the less keen interest felt in the impersonal book or mag - azine .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		PARTISAN ^ READING OP HISTORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The Editor of ``
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly '' takes particu - lar offence at my review of `` Patriots and States - men , '' which appeared in a recent number of THE DIAL .

		Aside from the personal disparagement , which really has nothing to do with the matter , I should like to say a few words .

		In the first place ,
P. F. Collier & Son	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of the book which I was compelled to review somewhat disparagingly .

		It is not custom - ary for publishers to reply to adverse reviews of their books .

		I have never known a good house to take the position of publisher and critic at the same time .

		The angry retort , therefore , of the Editor of ``
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly '' is the reply of one crying his wares in the market place , and not the opinion of the judge and critic .

		`` Patriots and Statesmen '' is a work in five vol - umes , which seeks , among other things , to capitalize the words of
Washington	LOCATION	, when he was worried
1917	DATE	-RSB- 93 and embarrassed with great difficulties , on the subject of the militia .

		He said a great deal during the long years of the Revolution which any parti - san of universal military service may now quote .

		That a partisan use was made of the opportunity is shown by the fact that
Washington	LOCATION	's words of praise for the militia , which were spoken later , and when he was himself , are all omitted from this book .

		This is the method of the militarist group in
Washington	LOCATION	, who are now putting out literature by the ton .

		In General
Upton	PERSON	's so-called `` Military Policy of the
United States	LOCATION	'' this mis - representation of
Washington	LOCATION	is carried to the limit .

		Mr.
F. L. Huidekoper	PERSON	and
General Wood	ORGANIZATION	commit the same offence in aggravated form .

		And the
American Security League	ORGANIZATION	carries all this misinformation to teachers of history , begging them to use it to influence the minds of the boys and girls in our schools .

		When the review of `` Patriots and Statesmen '' was under preparation , I was impressed with a feeling that
Collier	PERSON	& Son were also endeavoring to support a partisan view ; but I was not sure of it , and hence the fear was expressed that such a purpose was behind their series of pretty books .

		Since writing the review I have received proof in written form that at least one party to the publication is `` hand and glove '' with the above - mentioned militarist group .

		Second .

		The review called attention to the one - sided treatment of the Constitutional Convention of
1787	DATE	, and now I am taken to task for supposed ignorance by one who seems to know nothing of the writings of
John B. McMaster	PERSON	,
Frederic J. Turner	PERSON	, and C. A. Beard ; and not to be known to the Editor of ``
Collier	PERSON	's '' is not to be known at all .

		An ex-president of the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, who is within easy reach of ``
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly , '' once said to a group of scholars whose names would have no significance to the Editor that the Fathers had shrewdly put across the con - stitution against the wishes of nearly two-thirds of the people .

		Whether this remark be correct or not , it is certainly a fact that a majority of the people opposed the adoption of the instrument , and that the proponents of the measure resorted to tricks that would have done credit to the Hon - orable
William Barnes	PERSON	himself .

		Now , a scholar who knows the facts may not so much as refer to them in a review of a one-sided book without being decried as unhistorical .

		That was the Treitschke method .

		A thing is true simply be - cause some hyperpatriotic journalist thinks it true .

		It would probably give the Editor of `` Collier 's '' a patriotic fit if he were to read
McMaster	PERSON	and
Stone	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and the Federal Constitu - tion , '' or Mr.
C. A. Beard	PERSON	's `` Economic Interpre - tation of the Constitution . ''

		Reading `` Patriots and Statesmen '' is much better ; the book gives only one side of the story .

		Finally , not to know more of
Webster	PERSON	than the aforesaid Editor seems to know is pathetic .

		Here again I might call to witness some of the first historians of the country , but their names would be utterly unfamiliar and I desist .

		Why set a supposedly old man upon a course of high school training ?

		It is better to live and die patriotic , especially if patriotism pays .

		I will , however , set down a few well-known facts which it might be well for people to recall when they put out new books on American history :
Webster	PERSON	went to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	a sectionalist , seeking sectional benefits ; and every important vote he cast in that body for the fifteen years preceding the great debate in
1830	DATE	was given for sectional purposes .

		The Union was to him a good thing , to be sure ; but what won his vote was the interests of his
New England	LOCATION	constituents .


Hayne	PERSON	and
Calhoun	PERSON	were in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as nationalists ; they were scouted in their state for being nationalists .

		Their aim in bringing on Nullification was to pre - vent secession , not to hasten it .

		It had been the whole southern programme to be nationalist ; their interests lay that way and they were themselves generally in control , which is always a mighty stimulant to nationalism .

		Thus
New England	LOCATION	and the South opposed each other till
1825	DATE	.

		Meanwhile Henry Clay had been in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for fifteen years as an avowed westerner , a bitter opponent of
New England	LOCATION	and a candidate for the presidency representing the
West	LOCATION	.

		But sud - denly
Jackson	PERSON	loomed up , stole the hearts of most westerners and became a candidate for the presi - dency .

		To beat
Jackson	PERSON	, Clay and
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	made a combination of
New England	LOCATION	, parts of the
Middle States	LOCATION	, and Clay 's following in the
West	LOCATION	.

		This succeeded for the moment , but it was so unpopular that it ruined both Clay and
Adams	PERSON	as future presidential aspirants .

		When
Jackson	PERSON	finally won , it was by a combina - tion of the South and the West , of
Jackson	LOCATION	,
Cass	PERSON	,
Benton	LOCATION	,
Poindexter	PERSON	-LRB- of
Mississippi	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Crawford	PERSON	-LRB- of
Georgia	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Calhoun	PERSON	,
Hayne	PERSON	, and the
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	politicians .

		This combination embittered
Webster	PERSON	and the
New Englanders	LOCATION	in just the same way that the recent combination of South and West embitters the people who live along the eastern shores of the
Hudson River	LOCATION	.

		The one thing the West of
1830	DATE	demanded above everything else was free homesteads `` free lands , '' as
Benton	LOCATION	put it .

		To prevent the realization of that end ,
Foot of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	offered a bill which proposed to close all land-offices and stop the sale of public lands .

		And , of course , no lands were to be given away .

		The bill tried the southern leaders sorely , for they opposed free lands ; but they had agreed to help the West win its great objective on condition that the West aid them in defeating the protective tariff .

		Hayne spoke against Foot 's scheme , thus keeping faith with
Benton	PERSON	, who was the father of most western land measures .

		Benton was satisfied .

		The South and West would go on together , defeat the Foot bill , and then reduce the tariff .

		It was at this time that
Webster	PERSON	, a recent con - vert to the protective tariff -LRB- his constituents having changed their position to his great embarrassment -RRB- , rose to attack
Hayne	PERSON	.

		His object was to break the southern-western alliance ; and to do so , he talked
Union and Nation	ORGANIZATION	the West being more Unionist and nationalist than the South , and far more Unionist and nationalist than
New England	LOCATION	94 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 8	DATE	or
Webster	PERSON	had ever been .

		He `` rang the changes '' on nationalism till
South Carolina	LOCATION	nationalists were afraid he might break their combination .

		And it was on this nationalist theory that
Jackson	PERSON	acted a little later when he called a halt in South Car - olina , although he closed his eyes at the same time to Nullification in
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		But the great problem then before
Webster	PERSON	was the land question , and the land question spelled ruin for
New England	LOCATION	, whose population was running off to the West in preference to staying at home and working in factories from `` sun to sun '' for
seventy-five cents	MONEY	a day .

		Now this important subject the Editor of ``
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly '' treats as a real estate matter .

		Real estate !

		It was the growth of the West which
Webster	PERSON	feared ; and the continued combination of South and West would not only ruin
New England	LOCATION	politically , it would break down the tariff as well .

		If `` Patriots and Statesmen '' had given
Benton	PERSON	's speech on the public land question and Foot 's resolutions against selling any more land , and then added
Webster	PERSON	's and
Hayne	PERSON	's orations , the reader would have got some inkling of `` what it was all about . ''

		That is just what was not desired .

		Perhaps those who got up this work did not know the literature of the subject , just as the Editor of `` Collier 's '' seems to be wholly innocent of real information about the whole matter .

		As a reviewer of books in the field of history , I shall continue gently , on occasion , to call attention to matters of this kind , hoping , however , that I may escape burning at the stake at the hands of `` patriots and statesmen '' who live in
New York	LOCATION	.

		MR.
JOHN COWPER	PERSON	POWYS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In a recent number of THE DIAL , Mr.
Israel Solon	PERSON	reviews Mr.
John Cowper Powys	PERSON	's latest book , `` Suspended Judgments , '' in the most .

		unwar - ranted and unjust manner possible .

		Indeed , the Avhole article is a deliberate misinterpretation and i ` alse presentation of facts as they stand written .

		To begin with Mr.
Solon	PERSON	's first quotation : '' Except for ` Candide ' and a few excerpts from the ` Philosophical Dictionary , ' I must confess I have no wish to turn over another page of Voltaire .

		It is simply incredible to me that human beings possessed of the same senses as ours could find satisfaction in the sterile moralising , stilted sentiment , superficial wit and tiresome persiflage of that generation . ''

		As it is quoted there , this opinion of Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's lends itself admirably to Mr.
Solon	PERSON	's purpose ; if , however , Mr.
Solon	PERSON	had taken the trouble to read a little further , he would have seen the fol - lowing significant sentence : `` I suppose they did n't really .

		I suppose they used to go off on the sly and read Rabelais and Villon . ''

		That this omission alters the entire meaning of the criticism made by Mr.
Powys	PERSON	is evident to a man of no huge intellect .

		I , therefore , conclude that the omission was a wilful one .

		As a contradiction to this statement , Mr.
Solon	PERSON	quotes : `` How admirable to turn back to
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	after the fussy self-love and neurotic introspection of our modern intellectuals . ''

		Mr.
Solon	PERSON	evidently misunderstood the meaning of the words `` turn back . ''

		The author implies that , after a dose of our moderns , there is no greater joy than coming back to those loved pages of `` Can - dide '' and the `` Philosophical Dictionary . ''

		The second example your critic gives is too flagrantly erroneous to bear quotation .

		It will suffice to say that Mr.
Powys	PERSON	states that he will never turn over the pages of
Byron	PERSON	's `` Poetical Works '' ; but here is what Mr.
Solon	PERSON	for his lion plaisir misinterprets he can imagine what would be the sensations experienced by a mind quite new and fresh to the `` resounding grandeur '' of
Byron	PERSON	, at the sudden discovery of the `` Hebrew Melodies . ''

		And finally , in Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's declaration of his doctrine , your contributor has erred either as blunderingly or as intentionally as before .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	simply says that the poetic tempera - ment is not the same as that of the artist , although it partakes unconsciously of certain of the artist 's qualities .

		Poetry is then the greatest of all arts , and the poet is the greatest of all artists because the art in poetry is unconscious .

		Yes , the intellect is there , watching , registering , what you will but the artist has not at the time the knowledge thereof .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's meaning is as clear as day - light to any but the most biased and clouded of intellects .

		I do not know Mr.
Powys	PERSON	personally ; this letter is the protest of a reader of `` Suspended Judg - ments , '' who has the interests of intelligent and thorough criticism at heart .

		Granted that at times Mr.
Powys	PERSON	is hysterical , we owe him none the less a great and lasting debt .

		The Protestant Puritan - ism and Philistinism rampant among us in Amer - ica have never found a more fearless and eloquent enemy than Mr.
Powys	PERSON	.

		Besides , had Mr.
Solon	PERSON	studied literature extensively , he would know that genius and charlatanism are very closely related .

		No man has stood up for culture and beauty and intelligent criticism more than Mr.
Powys	PERSON	; it is unfortunate that he should be subjected to the sort of criticism he received at Mr.
Solon	PERSON	's hands .

		I am not one of the many hysterical bluestock - ings that Mr.
Powys	PERSON	has in his following ; I pride myself upon appreciation of good criticism .

		That is why Mr.
Solon	PERSON	's article was to me so inexpressibly boring , futile , and tedious .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 95 - THE GOOD OLD WAYS . ''

		PENCRAFT .

		By
William Watson	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Whenever an author writes about style his own style is likely to suffer from Pater down , or from
Raleigh	LOCATION	up .

		And whenever he puts a large apparatus in motion to work off a few small grudges the literary sky becomes clouded indeed .

		Thus it is with
William Watson	PERSON	in `` Pencraft , '' a set piece which goes off with a little too much of hitch , sputter , and smoke .

		But before dwelling on the hand that launched its thousand squibs , let us attend to the construction of the fire - work itself .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	chooses to distribute literature among three categories , which he calls the cantative , the scriptive , and the loquitive .

		The first of these he declines as above his powers it is too mysterious and transcend - ental .

		The third he banishes as beneath them - it is too chatty and informal .

		The second the scriptive he handles as if it were dominantly a matter of poetry , almost giving prose composition the go-by .

		His book thus comes near to being but one particular man 's `` shop '' and a somewhat disgruntled man , at that .

		By its very subtitle it is `` a plea for the older ways '' ; and by constant implica - tion , and even by direct assertion , his face is dead set against the new and the free .

		However , within such narrowed bounds , Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, despite certain infirmities of temper and certain shortcomings of expres - sion , is well worth attending to .

		The '' scrip - tive '' the consciously written is made to take in most of both
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, and it gives a welcome to rhetoric as well as to poetry .

		Though Mr.
Padraic Colum	PERSON	has lately been at pains to explain the difference between poetry and oratory , the first aim - ing at intensity and the second at exaltation , the latter being `` heard '' and the former '' overheard , '' Mr.
Watson	PERSON	indulges no dis - position to second these labors .

		Mr.
Colum	PERSON	would classify Pope and
Byron	PERSON	among the orators .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, declining to define the exact bounds of poetry and rhetoric -LRB- the life-breath of oratory -RRB- , would find room for both of them among the poets , to say nothing of the major prophets and the `` royal psalm - odist ''
David	PERSON	, all of whom bring the two arts into close association .

		The men against whom he turns a stony face are
Blake	PERSON	, with his `` glorified nursery babble , '' and
Browning	PERSON	, whose `` Andrea del Sarto '' countenances such stultifications and infantilities : A rose-grower does not send to a rose-show a poor starved imperfect rose , a pathetic piece of arrested development , and expect it to carry off the prizes because it was grown in an unfavourable soil and climate and is a horticultural triumph relatively to those adverse conditions .

		The rose is judged with sole regard to its absolutely accomplished beauty as a rose ... By the like criteria must a poet 's final place be fixed ; and tried by these tests , which seem to me the eternal ones , I find
Blake	PERSON	wanting , while Pope emerges from the ordeal , not indeed a poet of very deep tones or very wide gamut , but an almost miraculous performer upon a rigorously limited instrument , which obeys him with infallible precision , and seems delighted to be his slave .

		Thus Mr.
Watson	PERSON	takes his stand for the `` well-made '' poem , which occupies a satis - factory middle ground between what he calls the `` overmade '' and the `` undermade . ''

		Among the `` overmade '' poets he puts Ros - setti , and perhaps would include
Swinburne	PERSON	, if that gaseous artist could be given sufficient solidity to hold a hard-and-fast verdict .

		Among Americans of the same general class he names
Poe	PERSON	and , a fortiori ,
Chivers	PERSON	.

		Among the `` undermade '' he places , conspicuously ,
Byron	PERSON	; among poets specifically American .

		Lowell and
Bryant	PERSON	.

		The ideal poem is one that is `` made enough '' one which `` owes its authentic excellence in great measure ... to a moral root and basis the wholly hon - ourable passion of the workman for levying upon his own spirit the utmost toil it can bear without impoverishment , and for doing as well as nature and circumstance permit him whatsoever thing he strives to do at all . ''

		For `` art is not morals , in which the will may sometimes count for more than the deed ... Nor is it religion , in which even ' faith with - out works may perhaps be allowed some meas - ure of spiritual efficacy .

		Works impassioned by faith , irradiated by truth , but above all , consummated by power , are its only stepping - stones to salvation . ''

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	thus ranges himself among the conservatives .

		He wants the good old approved craftsmanship , and the established and consecrated morality ; he desires no spiritual adventurings into the limbo of the `` violent and erratic . ''

		He is naturally severe on current American verse : `` when it was more English in texture and mode than it is at present its level of performance was incom - parably higher . ''

		Recent changes have `` cer - tainly coincided with a marked decline in literary prestige and power . ''

		The taste satis - fied by our `` homegrown verse '' is `` not severe . ''

		The best characteristic of this verse in `` an uncouth sincerity . ''

		What there is of `` abler , choicer , more distinguished work '' is apt to be `` less ingenuous . ''

		It is sad to see an elderly man vanishing into the penumbra of unhappiness .

		America 's most vigorous school of verse is likely , for 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 8	DATE	some years at least , to block out its poetics in rather rough-hewn fashion and to defer for a while the application of conscious finish .

		At some stage of that process a happy blend of strength and polish may be attained .

		Then imitative procedure and academic finish will again supervene .

		Then Rough Vigor will once more come to the poet 's `` salvation . ''

		Thus the pendulum swings : from the over - socialized -LRB- or classic -RRB- to the over-individual - ized -LRB- or romantic -RRB- , and back , and forth , and back again : a law -LRB- both literary and social -RRB- the workings of which should have come , by this time , to be pretty well understood .

		It seems not unlikely that in the literature of this war the future historian will find a tragic euthanasia .

		It pours forth with an abundance which shows no sign of cessation .

		M. Hovelaque restates its philosophic basis not , indeed , with either profundity or com - pleteness , but with a clarity that is not with - out its charm .

		Professor
Burgess	PERSON	pursues his role of indignant dissatisfaction with the American attitude ; and he continues to make havoc of history and public right that he may somehow construct a case .


M. Cheradame	PERSON	has written a forcible study of the broad outlines of the German plan of conquest , which is useful for its vigorous handling of the geographical issues involved .

		Professor
Platt	PERSON	's little volume is one of the typical reveries this war seems destined to produce without number ; it is as true as it is obvious , and so obvious , for the most part , as to be hardly worthy of publication .

		M. Madelin gives us some interesting documents taken from German soldiers who fought at
Verdun	LOCATION	which throw a vivid light on the objective of that tremendous failure .


M. Pinon	PERSON	has writ - ten with biting irony of the Armenian mas - sacres .

		Mr.
Beck	PERSON	proceeds in characteristic swashbuckling style to display his jovial and boisterous faculty of whole-hearted hate and uncritical admiration .

		The volume on
Poland	LOCATION	is a brilliant statement not merely of national achievement but of the main issues involved in what is , in some sort , the most tragical of historic destinies .

		Mr.
Macdonald	PERSON	states simply and clearly the principles which should underlie the European reconstruction .

		Sir
Thomas Holdich	PERSON	's volume derives a special value not only from the fact that he is the foremost practical authority upon his subject , but also because it brings home to us , in real - istic fashion , the task which will face those who refashion the map of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		His book is easily the best discussion of its subject that exists in the English language .

		I can only hope that in a second edition it will be given the illustrative maps it so badly needs .

		What all these books make tragically clear is the simple and vital fact that it is against a philosophy that the allied powers are con - tending .

		Each age and each people seems guided in its destinies by a conception of some good superior to that which it has achieved .

		What is the ideal which has actuated Ger - many in the last half-century ?

		Her phil - osophers significantly ceased to proclaim the inviolability of law .

		They no longer taught us that personality , whether human or national , is of itself worthy of respect .

		They did not insist on the worth of human fellow - ship .

		They did not emphasize the part that cooperation may play in the conquest of pain .

		Not that the
Germany	LOCATION	of the nineteenth cen - tury ceased to employ a categorical impera - tive .

		On the contrary , tutored by
Fichte	ORGANIZATION	and
Hegel	PERSON	, it did not shrink from proclaiming that the national soul must be true to herself .

		JLt insisted on her pursuit of all that might add to the richness of her experience .

		It de - manded her right to that material permanence of form in which alone the spirit can ade - quately flourish .

		It etherealized the prin - ciples of
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, and erected them into an ethical system .

		Hegel gave to them a philosophic , and Treitschke a quasi-historical , justification .

		That they might prosper and grow strong , they were nourished by
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck on blood and iron .

		But the appetite grows by that on which it feeds .

		Strength turned to domination ; the giant sought abroad for his victims .

		Exulting in his
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 97 capacity for achievement , he called for sac - rifice to his lust for power .

		Slowly and cau - tiously and of set purpose he fashioned the weapons of his desire .

		Science and art and education became the handmaidens of his theories .

		They were bent to the service of his will .

		He felt within himself the quality of leadership which demands conquest that his strength may not waste nor grow old with the lapse of time .

		His ambition was fostered by the prospect of an easy victory .

		His bow was the bow of
Ulysses	LOCATION	, which none save he could bend .

		Nor did he fail to clothe his pur - pose in the specious phrases of moral endeavor .

		He was , so he told himself , the minister of civilization .

		There was no science in which his subjects did not labor to mag - nificent achievement .

		Music no less than com - merce , art , the drama , theology all these they had made their own .

		Mystically , per - haps , yet none the less certainly , the giant felt the call to action .

		A world that he did not dominate was a mean and ignoble thing .

		A world which thought differently from him - self was on the road that led to political and philosophic damnation .

		He must save it from itself , that the greatness of his
Weltanschau	PERSON	- ung might be made manifest .

		It was , of course , a stupid world .

		It would not sur - render its right to think and to hope in its old and fitful fashion .

		It rioted in an anti- quated individualism .

		It was torn by meagre scruples .

		It aimed at preventing that which was destined to save it .

		By war alone could it be made to perceive its errors .

		Terrible , indeed , it was that such a medicine should be the path of tutorship .

		But the world is a blind world ; and only the roar of cannon can shock it into sight .

		It was a world that seemed consciously to have erected barriers in the road of German achievement .

		Slowly , indeed , but with a grim certainty it was fastening upon the necks of men the ideal of public right .

		Slowly , again , but with an equal certainty it was compelling men to recognize the sanctity of international obligation .

		In
Belgium	LOCATION	and in
Switzerland	LOCATION	it had created buffer states for no other pur - pose than to make difficult the ideas underly - ing the ambition of German development .

		It was a world preaching almost with the fulness of genuine conviction the right of any nation , however small or feeble , to work out in its own way whatever destiny it could accom - plish .

		It was a world which seemed unwilling to recognize the priority of German achieve - ment .

		It spoke of what
France	LOCATION	had done ,
England	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, in the record of human prog - ress .

		Wherever
Germany	LOCATION	turned , foes seemed to confront her .

		The giant could not under - stand that the rattling of his scabbard pro- duced no trembling .

		He was compelled to don his armor lest the virtues of which he was the appointed guardian might come to be branded as sin .

		That which he desired , he knew it was his mission to take .

		Once suc - cess had proclaimed his virtues , he knew that a world which frowned now at his swash - buckling would crown his brows with the laurel of a merited homage .

		He would teach them the manliness of a savagery which phil - osophy had erected into a system .

		He would fling the defiance of conscious supremacy in the face of pigmies who had slept and played while he toiled and grew weary in the prep - aration for this hour .

		He would bestride
Europe	LOCATION	like a colossus ; and when victory came , he would proclaim the splendor of hard - ness in the ruthless vigor of his conquest .

		So did ideal right take might unto itself , in order that it might cease to be merely ideal .

		Never in the whole proeess of history has a nation so consciously wedded itself to the lust for power .

		Weltmacht oder
Niedergang	ORGANIZATION	has been an ambition written into the prac - tical terms of territorial acquisition .

		But what
Germany	LOCATION	failed tragically to understand is the hold that freedom has taken upon the heart of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		There is no compensation for servitude .

		Efficiency , order , comfort these are no more than instruments to be handled when the spiritual penumbra of life has been given the substance of attainment .

		The gifts
Germany	LOCATION	could bring were great gifts ; but to accept them upon her terms was to choose stagnation and sloth .

		Her veins might thrill with the ardor of her national - ism ; but the blood of
Europe	LOCATION	must not be tapped that she might assist in the swelling .

		To a belief in the philosophy of anasmia , in fact , she could not persuade her neighbors .

		And where she had failed to convince , she drew her sword that she might slay .

		As she had calculated , she found a
Europe	LOCATION	that was hardly prepared for her onslaught .

		As she had calculated , her legions could hack their way to the very gate of their destined heaven .

		But yet that
Europe	LOCATION	which she had deemed old and tired awoke to the fresh buoyancy of youth when it found that it was fighting once more the ancient battle of liberty .

		The war became a crusade ; and the young men died gladly that they might become the trustees of a later freedom .

		And the more desperate became the issue , the more sternly , even the more proudly , did they advance to the conflict .

		The philosophy which was to proclaim its strength began to vaunt itself on its meekness .

		The eagle which was 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 8	DATE	to peck at the liver of
Promethean Europe	LOCATION	turned to batten on a starved but courageous
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Nowhere has been more clearly envisaged the error of German statecraft than in its occupation of
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		It admitted its wrong and made a virtue of its treason .

		For the public opinion of humanity it seemed to care nothing .

		Of a whole country it made a desert that it might proclaim the
Pax Germanica	LOCATION	.

		History records no annals more terrible than the German treatment of
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		It was consciously planned and consciously executed .

		There is no crime of which the most diseased imagination can conceive , of which the con - querors were not guilty .

		They murdered men and women and children with a deliberate and ruthless impartiality .

		They laid waste with a brutal joy in desolation to which the annals of modern civilization bear no parallel .

		They exacted tribute with an insolent cruelty which , to the last day of German history , will be remembered with shame .

		They vaunted proudly of their achievement before a people whose only sin had been that they cherished their honor and their public virtue .

		They attempted the calculated destruction of a national existence .

		They forced the sons of their enemy to fight against their fatherland .

		They made outrage a daily necessity , and of mercy the rarest of luxuries .

		That
Belgium	LOCATION	was writing with her blood and tears the epitaph of this philosophy ,
Germany	LOCATION	seems in no wise to have understood .

		That her brutal severity must be the measure of her condem - nation seems never to have penetrated into her consciousness .

		Yet nations , like men .

		are pursued by those Furies who , in the process of time , compel the soul to attempt its sorrowful purgation .

		In a real sense it is by
Belgium	LOCATION	that
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean liberty has been saved ; and there is some - thing of supreme irony in this contrast of the protagonists in those early days of that mighty drama .

		In the new
Europe	LOCATION	that is dawning it is no less certain that the glory of
Belgium	LOCATION	will be remembered than that , for
Germany	LOCATION	's own sake , the occasion of reparation will be offered .

		The forces of liberty have main - tained an unbroken front in this contest .

		The effort has been long and it has been difficult ; but in the mind of man there has been vivid memory of the splendor of the goal .

		The page that is now being written in the history of human freedom is fundamental in its impor - tance and its uniqueness .

		The youth of
Europe	LOCATION	have sacrificed spontaneously their manhood that in their death the ideal of right may conquer .

		The free-will offerings of free peoples have been a buckler and sword to humanity .

		The principles that have been sus - tained are those upon which the happiness of men most greatly depends .

		That they have been maintained with such passion and such determination is surely the proof of their necessity in a world which cares most deeply for the richness of a free inheritance .

Paul Claudel	PERSON	's `` The Tidings Brought to Mary '' is not a `` mystery '' in the old sense , that is , a play based upon a Bible story , and the appropriateness of the sub-title is not quite clear .

		It is probably meant to suggest that the tone of the play is mystically religious , and that the central event is a miracle wrought by goodness .

		Imagine a
Maeterlinck	ORGANIZATION	symbolical play dealing with country folk of the middle ages , and written -LRB- or at least translated -RRB- in a sort of refined Whitmanesque style , and you will have a fairly good notion of
Claudel	PERSON	's `` mystery . ''

		Whatever be the merits of free verse , most of its champions would concede , I think , that it is not a good medium for drama ; it is essentially and primarily lyrical .

		`` The Tidings Brought to Mary '' contains some lyric verse good of its kind , but as a play it is a failure .

		The char - acters are not clearly conceived or firmly drawn ; they are merely the mouthpieces of
M. Claudel	PERSON	's vague mysticism .

		The plot is only a thread to string the speeches on .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 99 It is instructive to compare this rhapsodical expression of mood with a really great play on a religious subject
Verhaeren	PERSON	's `` The Cloister . ''


Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	, whose recent death is perhaps the greatest loss which litera - ture has sustained during the past year , is just beginning to be known as he deserves to be in
America	LOCATION	.

		Besides this play , two vol - umes of his poems and a very good study by
Stefan Zweig	PERSON	are available in translation .

		He ought to be as widely known as
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, to whom he is in some ways a most refreshing - contrast .

		In `` The Cloister '' we find a well - developed plot , which holds our close atten - tion to the end ; strong characters sharply distinguished ; and a poetic style brilliant , eloquent , and tellingly compact .

		Instead of romantic obscurantism , as in
Maeterlinck	PERSON	or
Claudel	PERSON	, we find the passionate mysticism of genuine religion in the burning words of Dom Balthazar : He is most God , when comprehended least .

		* * * # God is more high than human sages dream ; He is too vast , too deep , too infinite For man to sound His depth , or scale His height ; And only in some ecstasy apart Of loving sacrifice and joy supreme A Saint has , once or twice , attained His neart !

		And we find beside it , sharply contrasted with it , two other types of religion ; the gentle otherworldliness of Dom Mark , and the intel - leetualized creed of Dom
Thomas	PERSON	,
Balthazar	PERSON	's enemy and rival for the Priorship .

		Speaking of Bonaventura and St.
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	,
Thomas	PERSON	exclaims : Yet these were saints , no less than those you claim .

		Saints !

		on whose brows the apostolic flame Shone like a sword of God with ray serene ; Their hearts in darkling thought had caught the keen Essential spark , from which the soul takes fire ; Their faith took reason for a cloth of gold , And broidered there great lilies fair , Doctrines sxiblime and bold , Leaving to feebler hearts the dull desire Of customary prayer .

		Balthazar is a nobleman who , in his wild youth having quarrelled with his father and slain him , has become a monk .

		Remorse for his crime tortures him and at the same time intensifies his religious ardor .

		At last it drives him to public confession , and gives to his acute and strong-willed rival Thomas the certainty of triumph .

		The play is remarkable in that the list of characters includes not a single woman ; but the love motive is not needed or missed in a story which pictures so powerfully the great passions of remorse , ambition , and spiritual aspiration .

		As the quotations will indicate , the translation by Mr.
Osman Edwards	PERSON	reads like original Eng - lish poetry , and poetry of no mean rank .

		Two one-act pieces by the Austrian poet
Hugo von Hofmannsthal	PERSON	have appeared in
Badger	LOCATION	's `` Contemporary Dramatists Series . ''

		As drama , neither of them is important .

		Hofmannsthal is a lyric poet who has chosen to use the dramatic form .

		His ideal of drama may be described in his own words : `` We want no invention of narrative , but the reproduction of emotions ... not amusement , but im - pression .

		- '
Browning	PERSON	's `` In a
Balcony	LOCATION	, '' which he did not call a play , is far more dramatic than either of these poems ; but nowadays anything in dialogue will pass as drama .

		`` Death and the Fool '' is a sort of morality on the text , `` Let us experience life keenly , for to-morrow we die . ''

		It is prac - tically destitute of dramatic interest .

		`` Madonna Diaiiora '' represents a y \ > ung wife surprised by her husband while waiting for her lover .

		Its poetic merit is considerable , and consummate acting might make it effective on the stage .

		`` Death and the Fool '' is ren - dered into passable English verse ; `` Madonna Dianora '' into verse at times very good .

		A fourth volume has appeared in Scribner ' a collected edition of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's plays ; need - less to say , the translation by Mr.
Edwin Bjorkman	PERSON	is admirable .

		The first two plays - in the group , `` The Bridal Crown '' and `` The Spook Sonata , '' illustrate the more fanciful side of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's genius .

		`` The Bridal Crown '' is full of Swedish folk-lore ; among its persons are apparitions and mythical figures like the Neck -LRB- the Teutonic Neckan -RRB- .

		The play is a tragedy of peasant life against a background of folk-lore .

		`` The Spook Sonata '' is an extravaganza of pessimism ; it has the vividness of a nightmare . ''

		The First Warning '' is a rather sardonic but not ill - tempered one-act comedy , in which a wife through jealousy rediscovers her love of her husband .

		``
Gustavus Vasa	PERSON	, '' the strongest play in the volume , is a historical drama of extraordinary quality .

		Perhaps the nearest analogue in English is
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's `` Caesar and Cleopatra . ''

		Like the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	play , `` Gustavus Vasa '' is thoroughly modern in tone ; much of the dialogue might occur in a play of con - temporary life .

		Thus Prince
Eric	PERSON	, summoned by his father from the tavern where he sits with a boon companion , says to his brother , the messenger : `` Be quick and brief ,
Jons	PERSON	, or sit down and use a beaker as punctuation mark .

		The sum of it is , the old man wants me to come home and go to bed .

		Reply : the
Heir Apparent	ORGANIZATION	decides for himself when he is to sleep . ''

		There is something to be said for this method of writing historical plays ; at least it is alive .

		A large number of characters are drawn with remarkable vigor and reality .

		100 -LSB-
February 8	DATE	The handling of plot is unusual ; the king does not appear till Act III , and the first two acts are concerned with his enemies ; the reader thus has to transfer his sympathies in the middle of the play .

		At the end the king is saved by the unexpected help of the party whose leaders he has executed ; and for this there is no preparation .

		In spite of these perversities of technique , the play holds the close attention of the reader , and has been very popular on the stage .

		Genius like
Strind	PERSON	- berg 's must pay the penalties of waywardness , but it is not bankrupted by the payment .

		The philosophy of the plays may be suggested by a quotation from `` The Spook Sonata '' : `` They say that Jesus Christ descended into hell .

		It refers merely to his wanderings on this earth his descent into that madhouse , that jail , that morgue , the earth . ''

		Yet
Strindberg	LOCATION	's pessimism is partly redeemed by a sort of bitter common sense , and is tempered by an ironic humor which recalls
Heine	PERSON	's , though it is heavier and less delicate .

		Uniform in binding with the
Strindberg	LOCATION	series is Scribner 's edition of the plays of Tchekoff , of which the second volume is before us .

		It contains two long plays , `` Three Sisters '' and `` The Cherry Orchard , '' * and six short ones .

		Of the longer plays the chief characteristics are that nothing happens in them , and that the characters are exasperat - ingly dull .

		The praise that has been lavished by English-speaking critics on `` The Cherry Orchard '' is , one is tempted to believe , pure affectation .

		If a duller play has been pro- duced by anybody , I have been fortunate enough to miss it ; unless , indeed , '' The Three Sisters '' should be pronounced duller .

		The latter is described by the translator as fol - lows : `` The three sisters have only one desire in the world , to go to
Moscow	LOCATION	and live there .

		There is no reason on earth , economic , sen - timental , or other , why they should not pack their bags and take the next train to
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		But they will not do it .

		They can not do it . ''

		And they do not do it .

		This is the whole story .

		The one-act pieces are farcical comedies , a good deal more readable than the long plays .

		In general character they recall the more farcical of the Irish one-act plays , such as
Seumas O'Brien	PERSON	's , and some of Lady
Greg	PERSON	- ory 's .

		The best ones are `` The Proposal '' and `` The Bear . ''

		Artzibashef 's `` War '' furnishes an inter - esting example of the sobering effect of the war upon a literary extremist .

		It is amusing to see the author of `` Sanine '' turning out a play which almost any serious-minded and conventional young dramatist might have written .

		The sorrows of war are brought home to a Russian family by the loss of a son and the crippling of a son-in-law .

		I can - not refrain from quoting a stage direction which seems to describe and typify a good deal of Russian drama : `` All get up and make hurried motions , not knowing what to do . ''

		D'Annunzio 's `` The Honeysuckle '' is a tragedy with a modern setting , on the theme of the `` Electra '' a daughter 's vengeance on the murderer of her father , who has mar - ried her mother .

		The author attempts to add something to the horror of the theme by making the JEgisthus -LRB-
Pierre Dagon	PERSON	-RRB- also the seducer of his stepson 's wife -LRB- Helissent -RRB- .

		The main action deals with the struggle between
Pierre Dagon	PERSON	and Helissent on one side , and
Aude	PERSON	, an Electra all nerves , on the other .

		The appeal of the play , indeed , is to the nerves rather than to the mind or spirit ; and to make this appeal more effective , the author has resorted to the dangerous device of putting his exposition almost at the end .

		We do not know until the last act just what is the cause of
Aude	PERSON	's high-wrought nervous condition ; the dramatist exerts considerable ingenuity to keep her from telling us in the course of the dialogue .

		By keeping the hor - ror veiled , he wishes to heighten our sense of it ; but in fact he merely makes us skeptical of its existence , and annoyed at being asked to accept a neurasthenic patient as a heroine .

		Over this as over so much of
D'Annunzio	PERSON	's work , there gleams a phosphorescent light of decay .

		It is pleasant to end with the discussion of a more robust piece of work .

		Perhaps the best play about Shakespeare ever written , certainly the best I know , is `` A New Drama , '' by the great playwright of nineteenth century
Spain	LOCATION	,
Tamayo	PERSON	y. Baus .

		It is true that this is a rather
Latin Shakespeare	PERSON	, somewhat more rhetorical and demonstrative than an English Shakespeare would be ; nevertheless , he is a noble figure , giving an impression of great reserve power under perfect control .

		The other leading characters are actors in Shakes - peare 's company .

		Yorick , the great comedian , has an adopted son ,
Edmund	PERSON	, who has fallen in love with Yorick s young wife ,
Alice	PERSON	.

		In playing the parts of Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, they have acknowledged their love to each other ; but they have struggled against it , and it has remained innocent .

		Only Shakespeare and
Walton	PERSON	, the tragedian , are aware of the situ - ation ; but
Walton	PERSON	, an embittered cynic , puts the worst construction upon it .

		The plot is remarkable for the skilful use of the `` play within the play . ''

		Yorick has persuaded
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL Shakespeare to give him the leading role -LRB- the jealous husband -RRB- in a new drama by a young author .

		The situation of the husband in the play is Yorick 's own ; the parts of the young wife and her lover are to be played by
Alice	PERSON	and
Edmund	PERSON	.


Walton	PERSON	, who is professionally jealous of
Yorick	ORGANIZATION	and has expected the lead - ing role for himself , manages on the first night to confirm Yorick 's already roused sus - picions ; and the stage tragedy merges into the real one .


Walton	PERSON	, who has violated his promise to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, pays the penalty with his life .

		Shakespeare 's final speech , explain - ing to the audience the interruption in the `` new drama , '' is superb in its irony .

		The translation is by Dr.
J. D. Fitz-Gerald	PERSON	and the late Professor
T. H. Guild	PERSON	of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Illinois	LOCATION	, whose untimely death was a serious loss to the cause of American drama .

		It is a pity that the play could not have been published under a more attractive English title , and that the cover gives it rather the appearance of a learned work .

		It well deserves to be popular wherever
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is known and loved .

		THE FEMINISM OF
MR. GEORGE	PERSON	.

		THE INTELLIGENCE OF WOMAN .

		By
W. L. George	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Mr.
George	PERSON	's study of the feminine mind wears an air of careful documentation : it fairly bristles with the numbered `` case . ''

		He clearly wishes you to understand that it is not the casual production of a novelist who sweeps up the chips of his workshop and hands them on for what they may be worth .

		Nothing could more convincingly show the triumph of the scientific spirit in our time ; for Mr.
George	PERSON	is a man of letters , and men of letters from
Solomon	LOCATION	to
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	have ranged in that field with a quite exhilarating ir resp onsibility .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	is himself a feminist of the thoroughgoing sort , sympathetic with change , and absolutely unwilling to erect a priori barriers to the expansion at which the woman movement aims .

		You see at once that he is prepared for a great many things , including the abolition of marriage in favor of free unions on the basis of a new idealism , so that the violent ferment he sees everywhere at work leaves him quite unterrified .

		In grant - ing woman a free hand to make what she will of herself , he stops just short of being ready to sacrifice her essential charm -LRB- for man -RRB- , but , as Faguet pointed out long ago , there is a dash of the
Don Juan	PERSON	in the most advanced men with which women will still have to reckon .

		So long as he is sketching a programme for the advance , Mr.
George	PERSON	's ink flows very smoothly ; it is when he attacks the realistic problem of fitting his numbered cases into the pattern of the future that serious difficulties arise .

		There is a note of hesitation .

		If Mr.
George	PERSON	's mind is free from confusion , he has not convinced us of the fact .

		We observe that he is a partisan who insists on acclimatizing sickening doubts .

		I daresay that many fem - inists will feel that , in his description of woman , checked by scrupulous references to
Hie	PERSON	numbered cases , he has been guilty of something very like treason .

		He appears to be rather giving the cause away , and dashing cold water on passionate hopes .

		He doubts whether any woman has ever been an `` intel - lectual . ''

		Woman 's sense of logic is so private as to baffle the crisper male intelligence .

		It accommodates itself to passions , prejudices , and longings , and has no erectness in the face of the unpleasant .

		Woman lacks the power of concentration ; having never really come to grips with general ideas , she is incapable of understanding , or manipulating them .

		In a word , her view of things is the eccentric view of those who have indulged themselves in the luxury of living too intensely and exclusively in their own lives , and have never imagina - tively insinuated themselves into the texture of other people 's moods .

		It has to be called an inadequate view because it is emotional , irresponsible , anti-social .

		Of course , it is dangerous also .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	here devotes a great deal of space to showing how shocking to the disciplined male is woman 's reckless habit of generalization ; and it is in laboring this point that he illustrates , unhappily for himself , the contrast .

		Let us glance at a few of his own generalizations .

		Man , we learn , is `` conventional because he respects conven - tion ; woman because she is afraid of what may happen if she does not obey convention . ''

		`` She is infinitely more rebellious than man , and where she has the power she inflames the world in protest . ''

		`` I incline to believe that woman is firstly animal , secondly , intellec - tual ; while man appears to be occasionally animal and primarily intellectual . ''

		The innocence that would permit a man to write that last sentence is one of the traits that probably endear Mr.
George	PERSON	to his friends .

		It is irresistibly quaint .

		Naturally , a mollifying gesture is needed at this point , and Mr.
George	PERSON	produces one .

		If woman is what she is , who is to blame but man ?

		Man has wanted to be flattered , lied to , 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 8	DATE	deceived , cajoled , admired for virtues he does n't possess and feared for a savagery of which he is usually incapable ; in order to enjoy the wiles of the courtesan , he has been willing enough to forgo the help of a work - ing partner .

		It is his own frivolity that has involved us in evasions and taboos and false delicacies innumerable .

		If women are a little casual in business and a little reckless in expenditure , it is because they have been thrust back from affairs and not encouraged to take them with the proper seriousness .

		Inexperience and a bad social heritage , result - ing in a slave morality , have really to be blamed for many ineptitudes and insufficien - cies , which we need not in the least suppose to be permanent .

		The door is thus left open .

		Nora now has the world for her playground , and we may expect her to learn the rules of the game .

		It is perfectly easy to convey a false impres - sion of Mr.
George	PERSON	's aim by tracing the devel - opment of his ideas in the present book .

		One may seem to convict him of a lack of sym - pathy .

		He has meant to be helpful and encouraging ; there can be no doubt of that .

		If he has not everywhere escaped being inept , it is the fault rather of emphasis than inten - tion .

		A reconciling gesture always excites suspicion .

		It is likely to conceal a hint of the patronizing .

		There is no denying , at least , that Mr.
George	PERSON	has made it exceedingly easy for men to be feminists .

		By his formula they are permitted to retain all the conscious pride of intellectual superiority , and to add to that pride the perilous self-approval of those who waive the privileges of the superior .

		If he looks a bit complacent , it is because his novel - ist 's imagination has failed to warn him against an uncongenial role .

		In juggling with ideas he is a little inexpert .

		If the final impression his book leaves on the mind is one of futility , it is because he has insisted on dragging in the idle old controversy over superiority , and laying the stress there .

		And it seems impossible for a great many men , once they get on that subject , not to lug in
Plato	LOCATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and clothe themselves foolishly and fallaciously with some of the borrowed glory .

		But it is only a way of obscuring the issue and rousing needless bit - terness .

		Let the average citizen be turned away from the polls on the ground that he lias never written a play as good as Shake - speare 's , and the inexpediency of such a test of political and moral responsibility may be expected at some time or other to penetrate his brain .

		A PROMISING FIRST NOVEL .

		THE BALANCE .

		By
Francis R. Bellamy	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Double - day ,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	. -RRB-

		After one has closed the first novel of Mr.
Francis B. Bellamy	PERSON	, after one has thought about it a little , glanced once more at its title , opened it again at random , thought a little more , for it is a book that demands all these things , one arrives at a single com - mentary : balance .

		The exuberance of youth without its self-importance ; sentiment with - out sentimentality ; enthusiasm without fan - aticism ; sanity , humor , vitality , `` The Balance '' stands for these .

		It is not often that an author 's title furnishes so apt an estimate of his significance .

		It is from character rather than plot that Mr.
Bellamy	PERSON	has built his novel .

		And in his character drawing , again , one traces an anal - ogy with his title .

		The story of his two char - acters ' lives is the story of their struggle toward intellectual and spiritual balance .

		Sammy , or -LRB- as Broadway and the readers of his biography later knew him -RRB-
S. Sidney Tappan	PERSON	, started life as the apple of an indul - gent parent 's eye .


Paris	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
Vienna	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	witnessed the futile attempts of his genius to bud respectively into a Wag - ner , a
Whistler	LOCATION	, a De Reszke , and a
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Melchester , whose society knew him , did not consider play writing well , simply did not consider it .

		Therefore
Sammy	PERSON	's genius slum - bered .

		And it took some very loud knocks to rouse it for the noonday of
Sammy	LOCATION	's devel - opment .

		The first knock came early ; it was his mother 's death , his sudden loneliness , and the remorseful thought of that package of beautiful letters home that concealed his col - lege fiasco .

		For Sammy could be very beauti - ful .

		The second knock , the Pike episode , de - prived
Sammy	PERSON	of his ten thousand .

		That knock , however , was muffled by the providen - tial existence of Ricorton and the joint score of `` The Honeymooners . ''

		Sammy , bearing five hundred dollars , his still slumbering genius , and the heart of
Carrie	LOCATION	, took lodgings in
New York	LOCATION	with Ricorton .

		Carrie remained in Melchester .

		That calm , clear-eyed daughter of Melchester 's Grocery King -LRB- `` Wholesale , '' however , Mrs.
Schroeder	PERSON	would have interpolated -RRB- had `` everything except something to do . ''

		That , however , lay outside the function of a young girl accord - ing to the
Schroeder	PERSON	standards .

		Therefore she indulged in the mild philanthropy com - mon to Society .

		They all talked of it vaguely , those girls in that
Beecher Conference	ORGANIZATION	which she had joined at her mother 's suggestion ; talked and listened to mean -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 103 ingless reports and consumed pleasant quantities of tea and little cakes in comfortable libraries ; and secured sufficient funds to keep their Miss Strong going , and their own minds happy with the thought of accomplishment and duty done ... A very good thing to belong to , Mrs.
Schroeder	PERSON	would have told you .

		Sammy 's first play , significantly entitled `` The Lady in the Lion Skin , '' opened in Melchester with
Sylvia Tremaine	PERSON	as star .

		Sylvia heldjier public because she understood so well the art of suggestiveness .

		It was this same art which had inspired Sammy to write the play and which assured its success , for
Sammy	ORGANIZATION	's spots had already taken on the color of Broadway .

		The Melchester papers admired `` the daring art of the Lion Skin scene , without one word that could be con - strued improperly . ''

		But it revealed to
Carrie	PERSON	something which
Sammy	ORGANIZATION	, dazzled by success and the prospect of
Broadway	DATE	's adiilation , did not discern .

		She understood its full significance , for it menaced what she loved best in him .

		It is at this point , where
Carrie	PERSON	moves to the settlement to work out , her salvation alone , and
Sammy	PERSON	dashes to
New York	LOCATION	to take advantage of his success at full tide , that the really big spiritual forces involved in the story emerge distinctly .

		Characteristically enough , it took poverty to rouse the full strength of each of them ,
Carrie	PERSON	through this experience ,
Sammy	PERSON	through his own expensive suffering .

		The '' industrial depression '' of that winter brought bleak misery to the Melchester slums , unloosing the full flood of
Carrie	ORGANIZATION	's unre - strained sympathy and indignation .

		It was then that she faced the Grocery King with the taunt of charity as a gilded restoration for his capitalistic robbery .

		Carrie in her own way was giving as uncontrolled a rein to instinct as poor
Sammy	PERSON	.

		In those West Twenty-ninth Street lodgings industrial de - pression was no less real a thing .

		Ricorton , Ruby of the vaudeville , and
Jack Bantry	PERSON	, her overbearing , magnetic Irishman , all lived on the slender remnant of
Sammy	LOCATION	's royalties ; while
Sammy	LOCATION	, whose genius had executed a right-about-face and was impelling him irresistibly to the top of his powers , spent his hours before the typewriter .

		As the author remarks : It is to our
Sammy	PERSON	's everlasting honour that , through it all , it never occurred to him that his money would last longer if he had only himself to support .

		He would have thought as soon of casting these friends of his adrift in mid-ocean as on the streets of
New York	LOCATION	.

		I do not wonder that gradually there dawned in Euby 's eyes an appreciation of the strange code of honour of the man who sat writing ' `` Doctor Paulding , '' with starvation three months ahead , and never stopped even to question the motives of his friends .

		How it came about that
Sammy	PERSON	made his great sacrifice , which was really no sacrifice at all because he was simply carried away by the heroic , stupendous idea of the thing , how it came about that he was found by
Carrie	PERSON	in
New York	LOCATION	, and how it happened that he married her after all , are things best related by the author , who whimsically re - marks : `` If only he had had some other char - acter than that queer one he had he would have been a hero to me , too , then . ''

		I think it is partly this attitude toward his char - acters that constitutes the charm of Mr.
Bellamy	PERSON	's writing .

		He treats them all as if they were good friends of his whose foibles vastly amused him , and whose characters con - stantly intrigued his attention as they un - folded and developed in the different phases of their lives .

		The curiosity to learn with him just what they are going to do next with those funny , irresponsible , human natures , is what leads the reader on from chapter to chapter .

		For his is not the probing , cynical inquisitiveness of the pathological or psycho - logical realist ; he likes his people , and there is no false sentiment , either , about his liking .

		Joined with his sense of humor , it gives them dignity .

		Not that Mr.
Bellamy	PERSON	is without his faults as a writer .

		One could wish for his sake , for instance , that
Barrie	PERSON	had not written '' Sentimental Tommy . ''

		For
Sammy	PERSON	is very like him .

		And one must hope that his quite personal manner of writing will not be con - tinued indefinitely .

		Its very freshness lends his work charm in this , his first novel ; but one can imagine it hardening to pure man - nerism in his second or his third .

		But no amount of quibbling `` ifs '' can detract from the real worth of this novel .

		You will rarely find together three characters so freshly drawn from life as
Sammy Tappan	PERSON	,
Carrie Schroeder	PERSON	, and
Sylvia Tremaine	PERSON	.

		You will rarely find in the writers of this country such poise , and justifiable assurance , and true sense of proportion .

		A first novel is not always a good test of an author 's powers ; but such a novel as `` The Balance '' holds a promise , and arouses a great expectation .

		The finest thing about this exceptional novel is the mas - terly way in which the author has evolved his characters through the actions and incidents rendered inevitable by those characters them - selves .

		It is this conviction of truth that remains to exhilarate , long after the story has been finished .

		Miss
Maud Diver	ORGANIZATION	has a deep love of
India	LOCATION	as well as a considerable knowledge .

		I do not know her former novels , though I have often seen them mentioned , but from their titles they would be novels of
India	LOCATION	; one of them seems to show that
Desmond	ORGANIZATION	's Daughter must be the daughter of `` Captain Desmond , V. C. '' who has given his name to an earlier book .

		In fact
Captain Desmond	ORGANIZATION	, now old , a general , and one of the governors of
India	LOCATION	, appears in this story of his daughter , so that those who have read earlier chronicles will doubtless look forward with pleasure to some - thing more of the same sort .

		Miss Diver naturally sees in
India	LOCATION	one of the great opportunities of the English people to govern the earth according to justice and law , though necessarily and unfortunately , by force of arms .

		But she sees in it also more than that ; her book is infused with those ideas which even a glimpse of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	life will arouse in us children of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Vin - cent
Leigh	PERSON	, a young man of soldier tradition but with a leaning more to thought than to action , goes out to
India	LOCATION	rather to find his real relation to the rest of the universe than to make his place in the British army .

		He was shy as a boy , too different from others to get on at a public school , and , even after he had gone from
Oxford	LOCATION	to
Sandhurst	LOCATION	, he still had the unconquered desire to loiter in his own wandering bypath rather than follow the `` macadamized track of action and thought '' that lay obviously before him .

		To such a one
India	LOCATION	, with its facile and vague philosophies , was not without attraction , even though the chance to know it came in the form of a com - mission in an Indian regiment .

		Thought and action , individuality and society , the many and the one , philosophy and war , eastern mys - ticism and western effectiveness , these are ideas in which a set of characters may well move with interest to her who conceives them as well as to us who read of them .

		Miss Diver , however , is not a metaphysi - cian by nature , which is fortunate for her career as a novelist .

		One may think it a fault in her book that she does not really give much of an idea of the thinking of a hero who was fundamentally a man of intellect .

		Even when
Vincent Leigh	PERSON	escapes from the everyday routine of regimental work and social play , and goes off for a time by himself among the wonderful mountains of
Kashmir	LOCATION	and a season with a great Indian thinker , we get no very sure notion of just how his mind passed from one conception to another .

		But perhaps that is no drawback .

		This is no philosophical novel ; Miss Diver was intent on telling the story of a man in whom the melting pot of youth gave forth at last the fine metal of manhood , and if she suggests the things of the mind that were important , she probably does as much as she desires .

		At the bottom of her thought is doubtless the idea that action , even in the form of war , is necessary to make the finest manhood .

		So the English must naturally think to-day ; so indeed many Americans think .

		Some writers to-day feel that action is necessary for higher thought ; Miss Diver seems rather to feel that the higher thought realizes itself only in action .

		All of which is rather aside from the interest of her novel to the general reader .

		It is a good book and I have read it with inter - est , despite the immense amount of triviality which seems the necessary accompaniment of army life in
India	LOCATION	.

		It is hard to see how it is that soldiers can be developed by a life where all military duty is drudgery and `` shop , '' and the chief things of importance are dancing , flirting , racing , cards , and pri - vate theatricals ; but apparently the thing can be done .

		It is not strange that
Vincent Leigh	PERSON	found life at
Kohat	LOCATION	a bore , but it is strange that those who lived it systematically should ever be able to do anything else worth mentioning .

		All of which is neither here nor there ; we have an entertaining picture of life and had better not question too closely how it can possibly be what it is .

		If , in the course of its entertainment , it suggests to us things that are of help in hardening the fibre of spiritual life , so much the better .

		Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	, also , contrary to his usual custom , has an idea at the back of his head , or , we might better say , on the surface of his thought , namely , the difference between life in the the great world of
London	LOCATION	and simple life in the country .

		Just as an idea it is not so good as Miss Diver 's ; the Englishman in
India	LOCATION	is a suggestive personage .

		Mr.
Oppen	PERSON	- heim 's
Hillman	PERSON	is a certain
John Strangeway	PERSON	who comes from a lonely manor in
Cumber	PERSON	- land down to
London	LOCATION	.

		Fortunately he has just inherited a vast fortune , so that he is spared certain contrasts rather obvious in current fiction as in current life .

		He has his impression of the life of the great city .

		At first it seems to him merely an effort at mediocrity , `` an absolute vortex of human beings , all dressed in very much the same
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 105 fashion , all laughing and talking together very much in the same note . ''

		His view at first is rather superficial ; the women `` seem all the time to be wanting to show , not them - selves , but what they have on . ''

		As to the men , he says little .

		To tell the truth , Strange - way is not really a student of society , nor is Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	in any ordinary sense .

		If Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	really thinks that the best and happiest life is that which is lived simply in some remote estate , far from the city and near to
Mother Earth	LOCATION	, he has been very suc - cessful hitherto in concealing his opinion .

		As a fact ,
John Strangeway	PERSON	comes to
London	LOCATION	, not to see
London	LOCATION	life , but to see
Louise Maurel	PERSON	, a wonderful actress , whom he desires to marry .

		Whether he ever really persuaded himself or her that life would be better in
Cumberland	LOCATION	than it was in
London	LOCATION	is doubt - ful , even at the end of the book .

		As it is , he manages to get along pretty well in the world of actresses and dramatists , men of the world and women of fashion in which he finds him - self .

		Probably he would not have liked it long , but then it is probable enough that
Louise	PERSON	, when once settled in
Cumberland	LOCATION	, would not have liked that very long .

		What - ever the philosophy of life presented , the sit - uation gives Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	the milieu which he loves and which he has so often made amusing .

		There are , of course , two kinds of Oppenheim books those that are the best of their kind and those that are not so good .

		`` The Hillman '' is one of the latter .

		Yet even so it will be read with unabated pleas - ure , and the reader will not be disturbed by questions of social science , nor , indeed , by questions of reality .

		Such is Mr.
Oppen	PERSON	- heim 's gift ; he carries one along in the flood of a life of amusement and emotion so that for the time being one cares little for the commonplaces of realism .

		How fine is his imaginative power in this matter may easily be seen by comparing his story of
London	LOCATION	life with that part of Miss Diver 's book which deals with the social life of an Indian canton - ment .

		Doubtless the life of the brilliant restaurant and the glittering theatre in
London	LOCATION	is a more powerful stimulant than that of the officers ' mess and the private theatricals at a regimental station in the border country , but Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	would probably have been equal even to the latter opportunity .

		Miss Diver had her own prob - lem in mind , a very different one from Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's .

		I rarely feel that I can criticize Mr.
Oppen	PERSON	- heim .

		`` Do not all charms fly before the cold touch of philosophy ? ''

		asked
Keats	PERSON	.

		To criticize these remarkable tales would be too much like analyzing some wonderful orchid , a proceeding useful to science , perhaps , but not helping our enjoyment much .

		It may be that no such world as Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's exists , yet I read his stories with never - failing pleasure .

		I do not believe I could get on with the
Prince of Seyre	ORGANIZATION	, with Lady
Hilda Mulloch	PERSON	, with
Aida Calavera	LOCATION	; yet they make a brilliant company which one may well enjoy without an aesthetic pang .

		And just , as one may admire the fine mural decoration of a big restaurant , or a theatre , or a hotel , indeed just as one may like such things in a friend 's house if not in one 's own , so I like to read Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Zane Grey	PERSON	has a fine eye for place and a fine sentiment for the spirit of place .

		I have not read all his novels , but those that I have read are memorable chiefly for render - ing the impressions of the vast and wonderful deserts of the great
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story of `` Wildfire '' is laid in northern
Arizona	LOCATION	near the
Grand Canyon	LOCATION	of the
Colorado	LOCATION	.

		The grey expanse of desert , the rushing river , the highly colored heights , the strange nat - ural monuments , the purple distance , the dim mountains , the blue-rimmed horizon , each with ten thousand variations of light and shade , cloud and storm , winter and
summer	DATE	, these make his landscape .

		Every feature comes to his mind -LRB- and to ours -RRB- in a hundred forms , the river , the canyon , the mountain rampart , the desert , and every form is keenly felt .

		People are apt to skip descrip - tions ; one must not do so here or one will miss some of the best things in the book .

		For after one has followed the story even with intensity , it fades a little in the mind in the days that come after , while one still remem - bers the atmosphere of the book or the char - acters .

		It may be that some incident , some situation remains fixed in the mind , as here the figure of the galloping horse with the half-naked girl bound to its back .

		But the prevailing recollection is more apt to be of place or of person .

		On the
Colorado	LOCATION	river , somewhere above the beginning of the Grand Canyon -LRB- as I make it out -RRB- , is
Bostil	LOCATION	's
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, or rather was in an earlier time , when the great wave of early western emigration was beginning to recede a little and to contract ; and in these regions , beyond the western settlements and not so far as the real gold country , was a population of odds and ends mingled with transient Indians , sheep traders , and Mor - mons .

		The real interest in life at
Bostil	ORGANIZATION	's
Ford	ORGANIZATION	was horse-racing ; `` Wildfire '' is really a horse-book , as one may say , and the un-horsy reader -LRB- like myself -RRB- must feel that he is 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 8	DATE	dealing with a strange and unaccustomed form of life .

		Bostil 's
Ford	ORGANIZATION	was named from `` old man Bostil . ''

		who had lived there for many years .

		The village at the
Ford	ORGANIZATION	was the centre of a set of horsemen , riders , horse - wranglers , Indians , and horse-thieves .

		Their minds were full of horse ; one would have said that there was nothing else in the world .


Lucy Bostil	PERSON	, the old man 's daughter , was commonly said to have been born on horse - back , and certainly she must have been on a horse for the greater part of her conscious life .

		She was as good on a racer as one of her father 's riders .

		Into this curious world comes a wild-horse hunter , a man who would go week after week in pursuit of some fine wild horse .

		Given these conditions , one can imagine the general course of the novel , though in this case a new and somewhat sur - prising element is injected into the story , as has been indicated .

		I rather think the
Mazeppa	LOCATION	motive is a little too fierce for most readers and not fierce enough for the impres - sion of real veracity .

		But however that may be , the story carries one along , gives a few thrills , and if it then fades from the mind , it leaves the impression of the wonderful western canyon-country and the curious out - of-the-world figures that used to people it .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	.

		o > r NEW FICTIOX .

		It is a difficult matter , according to the popular conception , for a man to `` come back . ''

		Yet two persons a man and a woman come back to round out successful lives in the novel , `` After - wards , '' from the pen of
Kathlyn Rhodes	PERSON	-LRB- Duf - field :
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		They perform their respective feats in very interesting if somewhat incredible ways .

		The hero , Dr.
Anstice	PERSON	, lives down the embarrass - ment of killing a woman who , as his companion , petitioned that fate at his hands when they were captured by religious fanatics in
India	LOCATION	.

		Anstice , who is unexpectedly rescued ten minutes after the performance of his disagreeable task , lives a life haunted by the grim memory .

		The heroine ,
Chloe Carstairs	PERSON	, a proud Englishwoman , confronts intol - erant neighbors following her release from prison , where she has been placed as the result of an unjust conviction for libel .

		Even her husband , unable to believe in her innocence , leaves their home to follow the English flag into foreign lands .

		The reshaping of these two lives is effected in the midst of events so correlated and so rapidly mov - ing that the reader 's interest never flags .

		Everyone knows the twinge of disappointment resulting from the discovery that a favorite friend has second-rate qualities as well as those unique virtues which endear him .

		Such will be the emo - tion of those who venture to read
Archibald Marshall	PERSON	's latest book , `` Upsidonia '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	, Mead ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		No one who read that superb story .

		`` Watermeads , '' would suspect Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	of so commonplace a mind as is revealed in this thor - oughly uninteresting story of a fictitious country in which the social crime is the possession of wealth .

		It is a barren tale of unpleasant people , without humor or originality or reason .

		Is Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	taking advantage of his well-earned suc - cess to palm off some adolescent effort ?

		Or does he feel that it is necessary to rush into print every six months with a new book in order to keep his public ?

		More than one writer of standing has discovered that there is such a thing as writing oneself out .

		Let us hope that Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	will not need to learn that lesson ; should he embark upon such a career , ours would be the loss .

		There are few who can tell a better story , or tell it with greater charm , than Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	, when he will .

		But if he will not , he deserves to be ignored .

		An excellent novel written about a theme which will ever be an interesting one is `` The Complete Gentleman '' by
Bohun Lynch	PERSON	-LRB- Doran ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The story deals with the efforts of
Henry Wedlaw	PERSON	to maintain his social position and satisfy his `` gentlemanly '' tastes by marrying wealth in the person of
Dolly Lowe	PERSON	, who has just come into an inheritance .

		Wedlaw 's real self is revealed when it is discovered that the legacy is his own .

		Instead of the conciliatory husband , he becomes the head of the household .

		His married life , moulded after his own views as to what married life should be .

		becomes a despotism , in which the wife must for - feit all the independence and much of the charm - ing individuality which had previously been hers .

		Then comes
Oliver Maitland	PERSON	, the trusted but untrustworthy friend of
Wedlaw	LOCATION	, who succeeds in wrecking the happiness of the Wedlaw household .

		The subtlety of character description , with its gradual transitions , marks the novel as one of real worth .

		It manifests intimate knowledge of the life it pictures , and a singular ability to impart that knowledge to the reader .

		It is unusual to find in an American writer the quality which distinguishes the work of
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, but the same poetic mysticism which haunts those imaginative tales is to be found in `` The Druid Path '' by
Marah Ellis Ryan	PERSON	.

		The volume consists of six tales , four of which are tales of ancient
Erin	PERSON	.

		The author has done more than rewrite old legends .

		She has infused her char - acters with such reality that they become living men and women , whose passions lay violent hold upon the reader .

		There is madness in these tales , the madness and recklessness of exalted emotion , and in their telling there is that wild ecstasy which characterizes Irish music and poetry .

		Mrs.
Ryan	PERSON	has a rare faculty of conjuring a sense of sig - nificance and portent and these stories have a background of mysticism which makes of the human characters symbols in some spiritual drama .

		Probably the story of `` The Dark Rose '' will find the widest appeal , since it is a tale of our own times , as recent as the Irish Rebellion of last year .

		It is a story of a shepherd lad who became a poet and leader and of an Irish girl who became the wife of a lord .

		These two understood , though
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 107 dimly , the reality of those mystical forces known best in the days of Druidical worship , and the magic of this understanding brought them so closely together that there was no separation when the poet fell before the firing squad whose officer was the husband of his beloved .

		The publishers have produced a book which is typographically worthy of the exceptional literary merit of the stories .

		The titles and page decorations have been taken from the `` Book of Kells . ''

		There are also included many of the airs of Irish folk music .

		Despite the modern improvements which we now enjoy in our literature , our cooking , our sanitation and general mode of life , there is lacking a quality which the Victorians possessed and which added a distinct charm to life .

		That is romance .

		With - out this our sky-scraper habit of thought seems a little barren , when one stops to think about it .

		It is with genuine delight that this reviewer dis - covered the presence of romance in
Harold Ohlson	PERSON	's `` The Dancing Hours '' -LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		It is splendid to be able to bury oneself in a novel without the horrible suspicion that one is being `` improved '' or imposed upon by some sugar - tongued propagandist .

		`` The Dancing Hours '' pretends to be no more than a story , but what a story !

		Here is all the antiquated lumber of mysterious heroines , dashing and handsome vil - lains , manly and long-suffering heroes , unexpected wealth , and happy endings .

		It is true that the reader knows that it will end happily , but Mr.
Ohlson	PERSON	has oiled the machinery so cleverly , dressed out his characters so attractively , and been so skilful in manipulating his plot that one may easily forgive him and accept this delightful story of
Jane	PERSON	, whose hair was red and whose heart was ambitious .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		JNTKR ARMA .

		By
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		These essays have several equally potent claims upon the interest of students of literature .

		In the first place , the essays are completely char - acteristic of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	: they display the lei - surely movements of mind so familiar to readers of his prose and verse , the usual gracious suavity of style , the occasional looseness in statement of fact , the old fulness of reading and catholicity of taste .

		One new but scarcely surprising strand of feeling sets all this familiar placidity into violent relief , like a thread of scarlet in a pearl-gray fabric : the ferocity of the references to the Enemy .

		For these are essays written `` under the excite - ment and anxieties of the war , '' addressed openly to men at the front .

		And herein lies the book 's second claim to attention .

		We do not associate literary discussions with soldiers in the trench .

		But , as Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	says , '' It has hardly been enough observed that we have sent out for our national defense in this war a soldiery far more widely read and deeply educated than has ever been the case before . ''

		It is almost ludicrous to think of a book like this being read very much `` somewhere in
France	LOCATION	'' ; but the thought brings home , as few thoughts can , the completeness with which every class , almost every fibre , of English society has been caught up into the struggle .

		Then again , the book is not a haphazard collection of papers .

		It has a central theme : affection for
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	can discourse upon this motive without hypocrisy ; for he has always been an outspoken friend of French life and letters .

		He probably means to remind his readers that the once alien land in which they are fighting , now the chosen grave of their dead , will forever be to the English spirit a part of English soil .

		`` War and Litera - ture '' pictures the reaction of French letters to the invasion of ' 70 -
' 71	DATE	; `` War Poetry in
France	LOCATION	, '' with its splendid and unique study of Deroulede and its tributes to
Botrel	LOCATION	and
Paul Fort	PERSON	, shows what the present spirit is and that it is very noble .

		`` The Unity of
France	LOCATION	'' answers the lying charge of French decadence previous to
1914	DATE	, and really proves that `` The Unity of the nation is the expres - sion of a store of vitality long amassed for this very purpose of defense in time of sorest need . ''

		`` The Desecration of French Monuments '' is a call for a day of reckoning .

		Even the more or less balanced essays entitled `` The Napoleonic Wars in English Poetry '' -LRB- the weakest part of the book -RRB- and `` A French Satirist in
England	LOCATION	'' are , so to speak , playfully affectionate reminders that men now comrades once quarrelled curiosities of lit - erature `` which can do nothing but excite a smile on either side of the Channel . ''

		The essay last named concerns the forgotten `` lambes '' of
Auguste Barbier	PERSON	, and makes a distinct contribution to liter - ary history .

		Barbier 's satire reads as if it came piping hot from the spleen of
Houston Stewart Chamberlain	PERSON	or of a Prussian junker .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's whole book has such an obvious unity of theme and feeling that one rather regrets the inclusion in it of the essay on `` The Neutrality of
Sweden	LOCATION	. ''

		!

		Restrained and admirable as this document is , it | spoils the artistic balance of the whole collection .

		None of these essays , perhaps , attain permanent literary value ; they are frankly journalistic .

		But there can be no doubt that , barring a few extremities in the expression of hate , they make what
Ruskin	PERSON	would call a good book for the times .

		TRAINING FOR THE NEWSPAPER TRADE .

		By
Don C. Seitz	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Don
C. Seitz	PERSON	, business manager of the ``
New York World	LOCATION	, '' contributes this small volume to ``
Lippincott	PERSON	's Training Series . ''

		Apparently a collection of popular lectures , several chapters | show a few repetitions , but they are not obvious .

		A table giving the departments into which a met - ropolitan newspaper is divided and the titles and duties of the various departmental staffs , forms an excellent supplement to the text .

		Mr.
Seitz	PERSON	's observations are often interesting and for the most part just , although one can hardly follow him to his conclusion that newspaper publicity i has prevented the development of an aristocracy i in
America	LOCATION	.

		In discussing the distribution of duties on a large daily , Mr.
Seitz	PERSON	shows a ` ood 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 8	DATE	grasp of his subject and draws illustrations and anecdotes from his long and intimate association with the profession .

		It is unfortunate , however , that he has not given his readers more of an idea of the copyreader who edits , and writes the head - lines for the reporters ' `` stories , '' for it is his touch which prepares and seasons the news for the public .

		And , incidentally , if Mr.
Seitz	PERSON	had shown his `` copy '' to a good copyreader , his book would have increased in readability by the ex - cision of many an exclamation point .

		While it is only sketchy in character , the book should prove of interest to the general reader who is curious about the way the world 's news is prepared for his breakfast table , and of help to the young man or woman who is thinking of the newspaper field as a possible profession .

		THE TIDE OF IMMIGRATION .

		By
Prank J. Warne	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Warne	PERSON	rehearses here large numbers of facts which he presented three years ago in `` The Immigrant Invasion . ''

		These facts relate to the volume , sources , nature , and regulation of the in - flux of aliens into the
United States	LOCATION	, and are read - ily accessible not only in the annual reports of the Commissioner-General of Immigration but in numerous books published within the past ten or fifteen years .

		The merit of the present volume arises , therefore , from a half-dozen chapters deal - ing with such matters of current interest as the literacy test , the effort to promote immigrant dis - tribution , and the effects of the European war upon the immigrant tide .

		Discussion of these subjects , however , is very brief .

		With respect to the literacy test it is contended that , notwithstand - ing express assertions to the contrary by Presi - dents
Cleveland	LOCATION	and
Wilson	PERSON	in their veto mes - sages , the adoption of the test would `` not be a departure from the fundamental basis underlying our national or traditional or long-established pol - icy but merely an extension of this policy to a class or group not now affected by the law . ''

		And by an analysis of the votes in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on sixteen bills embodying the literacy test since
1896	DATE	, it is shown that there is a strong presumption that the test is favored by the country as a whole .

		Admitting that the effects of many factors in the situation can not be foreseen , Mr.
Warne	PERSON	argues that the sharp decrease of immigration caused by the war will prove but temporary .

		The destruc - tion of capital and the retardation of industrial recovery likely to be caused by American tariffs , will lessen the home opportunities for labor .

		Ter - ritorial readjustments flowing from .

		the war will produce new oppressions and new impulses to migration .

		With wages in
America	LOCATION	already higher than can be paid in the re-established industries of
Europe	LOCATION	, and tending steadily to rise , the move - ment of labor to the
United States	ORGANIZATION	will be resumed .

		Finally , a revival of immigration on a gigantic scale , such as followed the Napoleonic and other wars of the nineteenth century , is predicted .

		Only early and sweeping restrictive legislation , it is asserted , can prevent the immigration of the com - ing decade from rivalling that of the decade past .

		The argument is not wholly convincing , but it commands attention .

		And more than one econo - mist of eminence would subscribe to it .

		The volume closes with a conventional plea for assimi - lation .

		OUR NATION IN THE MAKING .

		By
Helen Nicolay	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Believing that we take our history too seriously , `` as if it were a medicine rather than a cordial , ''
Helen Nicolay	PERSON	, daughter of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's secretary and biographer , has given us a volume which , writ - ten , she says , in `` cheerful disregard of established rules for history books ... cares less for spe - cific happenings than for movements and currents of feeling .

		When forced to choose between pic - turesque typical incidents and a conscientious nar - rative of dry fact it gravitates shamelessly toward the picturesque . ''

		History `` as she is taught , '' she declares , is frankly a bore .

		Miss Nicolay is , how - ever , too severe in her general condemnation of works on history for there are now scores of books by competent writers which are almost as interest - ing as this volume of hers .

		The period here cov - ered is roughly the
first half of the nineteenth century	DATE	, from
George Washington	LOCATION	to
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	.

		True to promise there is in this volume nothing of formal history but a lively and roundabout narrative , packed with brief stories , anecdotes too good not to be true but never - theless of doubtful authenticity in some cases , brilliant handling of personalities , `` descriptions of dinners , clothes , manners , and entertain - ments .

		There is also much that the dry historians whom the author scorns will pronounce good .

		The book furnishes a fine background for American history .

		The author has little to say about political and constitutional history but makes clear and understandable the political nature of the period and the political interest of the American people .

		As a story of the develop - ment of Americanism crude , earnest , and boast - ful it is very successful .

		The following titles selected from the twenty-three which make up the book will indicate the nature of the work : `` The Opening West , '' `` As Others Saw Us , '' `` Roads of the Promised Land , '' `` Women in a Free Country , '' `` Religion in a Republic , '' and `` Suffrage and Reform . ''

		The contents are as interesting as the titles .

		JOURNALISM VERSUS ART .

		By
Max Eastman	PERSON	.

		Knopf ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		When Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	and his friends called their magazine `` The Masses , '' they were doubtless indulging in a little private fun , for the only thing they share with the masses is a desire to see them get more bread .

		If the masses ever do read the magazine , it is probably with a chill in the heart and a fog in the head , and one can imagine them rushing for light and warmth to the falla - cious , capitalistic press .

		For Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	, as an editor , would never think of giving the public what it wants , and he sets himself here to show how journalism , which is only a very democratic
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 109 and shaggy kind of literature , is corrupting our taste in letters and art .

		It has banished personal - ity , because personality has a thrust too vigorous and a vision too personal to escape giving offence , and it is the business of magazines with large circulations to make their circulations still larger by pleasing everybody a little and displeasing nobody very much .

		Hence we have the curious magazine art and literature of the present , a thor - oughly standardized commodity which is never `` queer , '' never `` grotesque , '' never `` alien , or exag - gerated , or sublime . ''

		It has precisely the round , smooth , mechanical perfection that characterizes all goods turned out in great quantities to sell .

		With entire good humor Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	tells us of his own experiences in writing for pay .

		He wrote an article and then , in collaboration with the editor , lie rewrote it several times .

		It was finally accepted and printed .

		His friends read it . ''

		` That article does n't have any quality , ' they said .

		` It is just well written . '

		I told them I had learned the trade . ''

		Doubtless every rebel wishes to save something , and Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	would .

		like to save our spelling from the spelling reformers .

		His argument is certainly ingenious and amusingly fresh , but what he convinces us of in the end is not that it is a good argument but that it is good enough for a man who does n't want a change .

		In calling much `` free verse '' `` lazy '' verse , Mr.
East	PERSON	- man has got himself pretty generally misunder - stood .

		He admits that free verse may also be poetry of sorts , but he insists that `` In all arts ' it is the tendency of those who are ungrown to con - fuse the expression of intense feeling with the intense expression of feeling which last is all the world will long listen to .

		The journalistic vogue of free verse encourages this kind of con - fusion in poetry . ''

		Journalism fares throughout rafher badly at Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	's hands , a fact which is a little surprising in an ultimate democrat .

		One suspects that his instincts are really less insur - gent than his conscious creed , and that where his love is deep his protective instinct asserts itself as naturally as in the sheerest reactionary .

		MANUAL OF THE COMMON INVERTEBRATE ANI - MALS .

		By
H. S. Pratt	PERSON	.

		McClurg ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		The need has long been felt in this country of such a manual as Professor
Pratt	PERSON	's .

		The work does not include the insects , but does include rep - resentatives of all other invertebrate groups , with synoptic keys to genera , and numerous figures .

		It will be a useful book for the reference shelves of .

		biological laboratories , for general libraries , and for .

		students of zoology .

		It does not replace special monographs .

		A fifty-foot shelf could hardly hold the volumes of a complete manual of the known invertebrate fauna .

		It takes the place in .

		the central and eastern parts of the
United States	LOCATION	which
Leunis	PERSON	's `` Synopsis '' has so long occu - pied in European and American laboratories .

		It is to be regretted that many of the figures are so inadequately drawn , and so poorly printed , owing to the quality of the paper used .

		However , one of the greatest problems of authors and publish - ers of scientific books is that of keeping the price within the limits of the purchaser 's purse , and concessions in these matters tend to increase the number of users of the book .

		It is perhaps by reason of these limitations that the author did not include in the work the fauna of the Western states and of the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		Over one thousand illustrations , an annotated list of authorities for genera and species , forming a convenient list of authors of biological works , a glossary of tech - nical terms , and a full index add materially to the utility of this convenient manual , which will be welcomed by all American biologists .

		THE SHORT-STORY .

		By
Barry Pain	PERSON	.

		Doran ; 40 cts .

		THE LYRIC .

		By
John Drinkwater	PERSON	.

		Doran ; 40 ets .

		The two recent additions to the series named `` The Art and Craft of Letters '' are by no means of equal value .

		Mr.
Pain	PERSON	's book is perhaps as un - mitigated a stretch of drivel as the subject has produced .

		Not that it sins by ineptly dogmatizing indeed , one would welcome a few dogmas as signs of backbone ; but in the entire 63 pages that make up this little book , the author chats aimlessly on , and at the close leaves the reader in a state of astonished vacuity .

		The other book is notable for its clear thinking and well-sustained argument .

		Accepting
Coleridge	PERSON	's `` perfect and final answer to the question , ` What is poetry ' '' ?

		-LRB- `` the best words in the best order '' -RRB- , Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	reaches the doubtful conclusion that if a recorded mood does not `` exhaust the imaginative capacity , '' the pro- duct is either prose or `` insignificant verse . ''

		Poetry , that is , is inevitably supreme ; what is not supreme is not poetry at all .

		In accordance with the pres - ent tendency , the author looks at the matter from the point of view of `` energy . ''

		The specific poetic quality , he decides , is `` a maximum of imaginative pressure freeing itself in the best words in the best order '' ; and that is also the lyrical quality , so that `` lyric and the expression of pure poetic energy ... are the same thing , '' and `` lyric poetry '' is a tautological term .

		More novel and more profound is the discussion , in the latter part of the book , of `` free verse '' and kindred matters .

		`` The change of line-lengths and rhythms in a short poem written in ` free verse ' is nearly always arbitrary , and does not succeed in doing what is claimed for it in this direction -LSB- keeping the struc - ture of verse in constant correspondence with change of emotion -RSB- , while it often does succeed in distressing the ear and so obscuring the sense , though that is by the way . ''

		`` The truth is , '' he adds later , `` that the poetic mood , which is what is expressed by the rhythm and form of verse and may very well be called the emotion of poetry , is not at all the same thing as what are commonly called the emotions as happiness , despair , love , hate and the rest . ''

		Whereas the governing poetic mood is expressed by the rhythm of poetry , `` by flexible movement that is contained in an external symmetry , '' `` the emotions , '' the subject-matter , are expressed by words .

		`` Of perfect correspond - once of the strictly chosen words to the rhythmic movement is born the complete form of poetry . ''

DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
John A. Ryan	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		As a writer on questions relating to capital and labor Father
Ryan	PERSON	is not a novice .

		In this book he treats in a formal manner the problem of dis - tribution , and he brings a viewpoint that can no longer be overlooked .

		It is a long way from the `` economics of distribution '' to `` distributive jus - tice , '' but hereafter the ethical aspect of the prob - lem must be in the forefront .

		We must look to human values , to the man or woman who receives a part of the economic dividend .

		Nevertheless , the author is conservative in attitude , he defends the private ownership of land , is rather reluctant about taxes on land and finds the socialistic pro- gramme untenable .

		He would , however , increase public ownership of land and establish progres - sive income and inheritance taxes .

		In such a pro- gramme reason and experience are the important factors that determine what is conducive to human welfare .

		In discussing interest he concludes that the theories of productivity , service , and abstinence are all inadequate , but that a moral sanction exists , although this alone does not justify interest .

		Cooperation will partly eliminate the burdens that interest imposes .

		The ethical view - point is again emphasized in the examination of profits .

		What constitutes just profits and what is excessive , are among the questions discussed .

		Father Ryan advocates an attempt to restore a system of genuine competition before accepting the inevitableness of monopoly .

		Should this fail , then a plan of regulation would necessarily follow .

		A very important part of the book consists of the discussion of the wage problem .

		A family liv - ing wage represents a minimum that must be attained .

		This , , however , does not necessarily represent a just wage , which may be con - siderably more .

		There are a number of wage determining factors such as effort , sacrifice , pro- ductivity and scarcity of labor , but more impor - tant than these is the principle of human welfare .

		In so far as these factors establish a just wage they harmonize with the canon of human welfare .

		If they fall short the latter must fix the rate of wages .

		The author believes that minimum wage laws will be of material benefit to the laborer and that the extension of a system of cooperative pro- duction and distribution would supplement the return properly credited to labor with an addi - tional remuneration that would greatly improve living conditions .

		The book is written from a Christian standpoint and makes use of the whole realm of literature bearing on the subject .

		Occa - sionally the reader is impressed with the feeling that the Fathers , who are freely quoted , were not so conversant with the economic problems as one might wish .

		Nevertheless , their ideals were usually worth while .

		And if this book adds but little to the body of economic doctrine , but impregnates economic theory with an ethical ideal , it deserves most hearty commendation .

		The unconscious development of human society must be superseded by conscious effort to obtain distributive justice and all that this phrase implies in terms of human welfare .

		FEELINGS AND THINGS .

		By
Edna Kingslcy Wallace	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		It is difficult to resist skepticism whenever a new book of verse for or about children is an - nounced .

		There have been so many elaborate efforts at rendering childhood 's naivete that one wishes poets would mind their own affairs and leave childhood 's rose ungilded .

		Miss
Wallace	PERSON	, however , does no violence to the elusive charm of childhood .

		One feels in reading these poems that she is writing from within out ; she is not portray - ing childhood as she sees or remembers it , but interpreting it as she still feels it .

		In her choice of subjects and language , she is always well within the mood and psychology of her subject .

		In this slender book are to be found the vaguely defined imaginings , the sudden sharp impressions , the bubbling excitement and joyousness of childhood .

		Even the rhythm of the lines has the hop-skip - and-jump gaiety , the pause of perplexed wonder , and the sudden , ecstatic crescendo of discovery .

		These verses are distinctive and individual , and because of their authenticity and lyrical quality must take a high place in the literature of child - hood .

		A little more than a year ago ended the long life of that charming literary entomologist , the Homer of the Bee , the Spider , the Wasp , and the
Caterpillar	ORGANIZATION	,
J. Henri Fabre	PERSON	.

		His last book pos - sesses scarcely the supreme interest of some of his earlier works , notably the `` Life of the Spider , '' considered either as to matter or method , but there is in it charm enough to furnish out a hundred scientific treatises .

		The caterpillar itself is not quite so engaging as others of
Fabre	PERSON	's small friends , nor do these observations and conclusions appear to have much scientific importance .

		The two outstanding conclusions for which evidence is adduced are : the utter absence of intelligence in the operations of the caterpillar , and second , the disparateness between the sense of smell in the ordinary use of the term , and the marvellous sense wherewith the
Great Peacock Moth	PERSON	seeks out his mate in due season .

		For the most part , however , the volume , made up of scattered papers written over rather long intervals of time , some of them being among the very last work of the savant , gives an effect of scattering conclusiveness ; it will , I suspect , be found as valuable to the student of literature as to the student of entomology .

		Within these limitations , though , and perhaps because of them , the book has a charm not often attained by the chronicles of natural historians .

		One hardly knows which to admire most , the thirst for accurate knowledge which led this nonagenarian to incur deliberately most painful poisonings in order to learn what makes the caterpillar an irritant ; or the humility of the martyr-scholar toward those whom he considered and called his Masters ; or the endearing humanity and brotherliness toward his little friends whose comfort he always put before his own .

		The matter of the book concerns cocoons
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL ill and larvae and moths , but the subject of prime interest is , after all , the man .

		Despite this truth , which may make the scientist appear amateurish , the method revealed is unimpeachable in its thor - oughness .

		It is ultra-scientific .

		No labor or fatigue is too great a cost for the smallest fact , a fact which often proves of little general worth .

		Fabre eschews theory even to the extent of frequent old - fashioned thrusts at uncongenial philosophic views .

		Facts are to him supreme , though he is not pre - vented from breaking off his record for such a burst of poetry as this : `` Yes , caterpillars , my friends , let us work with a will , great and small , men and grubs alike , so that we may fall asleep peacefully ; you with the torpor that makes way for your transformation into moths , we with that last sleep which breaks off life only to renew it .

		Laboremusl '' A SHEAF .

		By
John Galsworthv	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	has here bound together a num - ber of papers , `` mostly pleas of some sort or other , '' contributed to newspapers and reviews dur - ing the past six years .

		Various as the essays are in subject and tone , they still possess a certain spiritual unity , giving us as they do the reactions of a sensitive and humane nature to much of the casual or wilful brutality in our civilization .

		The earlier papers , written before the war , show Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	in passionate revolt against the bar - barity of the hunting field , the torture of wild creatures shut into cages , the needless cruelty with which sheep and cattle are slaughtered for food .

		Those who imagine that the detachment which characterizes Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's method in the novel answers to something cold and unsympathetic in his nature , should read these early papers for their corrective effect on such a view .

		Toward the war Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's attitude has been fairly constant from the beginning .

		His first response was a shocked recoil , and it still seems to him a mon - strous madness , forced upon
Europe	LOCATION	by imperial and bureaucratic dreams .

		It involved the tem - porary overthrow of civilization , the `` grand defeat of all Utopians , dreamers , poets , philosophers , idealists , humanitarians , lovers of peace and the arts . ''

		The war meant that the central problem to which the enlightened peoples had at last seriously turned , the problem of lessening poverty , disease , and the hopeless degradation of the workers , had to be abandoned .

		It substituted destruction for con - struction .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	sees
England	LOCATION	fighting for democracy , fighting to make possible in the West a durable peace .

		Yet his conviction that such is the fact can invest the struggle with no glamour in his eyes : war has ceased to be glorious for those who can estimate justly its terrible cost .

		Nor does he believe that permanent spiritual gain will result .

		He denies the validity of the romantic notion that literature and art can profit by whole - sale murder .

		Why should such an expectation be held ?

		`` On one whose whole natural life is woven , not of deeds , but of thoughts and visions , moods and dreams , all this intensely actual violence , prod - uct of utterly different natures from his own , off -
spring	DATE	of men of action and affairs , can not have the permanent , deepening , clarifying influence that long personal experience of suffering has had on some of the world 's greatest writers on Milton in his blindness ; on
Dostoyevsky	ORGANIZATION	, reprieved at the very moment of death , then long imprisoned ; on de Maupassant in his fear of coming madness ; on
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, in the life-struggle of his dual nature ; on Beethoven in his deafness , and
Nietzsche	PERSON	in his deadly sickness .

		It is from the stuff of his own life that the creative writer moulds out for the world something fine , in the form that best suits him , following his own temperament . ''

		The writer 's momentary identification with the war has in it something spasmodic and feverish ; war is too for - eign to the real self within him to produce any fine or lasting work .

		A MONOGRAPH ON THE OCTAGON HOUSE ,
WASHINGTON	LOCATION	, D. C. By
Glenn Brown	PERSON	.


American Institute of Architects	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 12.50	MONEY	.

		No building in this country except the national
Capitol	ORGANIZATION	has had such an elaborate memorial as the
Octagon	ORGANIZATION	in
Washington	LOCATION	, to which Mr.
Glenn Brown	PERSON	has devoted a folio of text and plates .

		Few private dwellings indeed would furnish better material for such a monograph than this one , now the headquarters of the
American Institute of Architects	ORGANIZATION	, by authority of which the book is issued .

		It is equally distinguished as the house where the treaty of Ghent was ratified by Presi - dent
Madison	PERSON	, and as an artistic masterpiece from the designs of Dr.
William Thornton	PERSON	.

		In the work in hand , thirty plates of accomplished architect - ural drawings record every detail of design , con - struction , and decoration .

		The elaborate mantels and doorways are thus not merely reft from their environment as in too many books , but the draw - ings of them are accompanied by careful studies of plan and ensemble .

		These studies include even the results of excavations on the site of former outbuildings , and researches in the varied modes of framing the different floors .

		The drawings are supplemented by a series of photographs equally complete .

		Such thorough presentation , although it wouM scarcely be worth while in the case of every early American house , will be welcomed equally by the architect and by the student of our archi - tectural history .

		The accompanying text falls into two parts , a historical sketch of the building itself and a biographical sketch of its architect .

		The first relates the brief story of the erection of the house by Colonel
John Tayloe	PERSON	, of
Mount Airy	ORGANIZATION	, in the years
1797	DATE	to
1800	DATE	, and the longer story of its rescue by the
American Institute of Architects	ORGANIZATION	just a century later .

		This portion of the book includes also many significant observations on the internal evidence for the history of the building , which is further elucidated by colored reproduc - tions of two old water-colors made at different periods .

		Careful research in the documentary evidence and in previous publications lends the section a gratifying finality .

		The appearance of this monograph , which sets a new standard of elaborate and sumptuous presentation in its field adds to the debt which lovers of architecture owe to Mr.
Glenn Brown	PERSON	for his pioneer work in the history of American architecture .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
February 8	DATE	THE HISTORY OP THE FABIAN SOCIETY .

		By
Edward R. Pease	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		The most illustrious , the most moderate , and the most influential non-political organization of Socialists in the world is the English Fabian Soci - ety .

		Inasmuch as the Society is more than thirty - three years old , it is somewhat remarkable that no formal history of it has reached print until within the past six months .

		Mr.
Edward R. Pease	PERSON	, one of the organization 's founders and for twenty-five years its secretary , has now supplied the lack .

		That his book is of unimpeachable accuracy is to be inferred not only from its authorship but from the fact that numerous representative Fabians , including
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, Mr. and Mrs.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	, and
Graham Wallas	PERSON	, have collaborated in its preparation .

		The book consists , in the main , of a simple chronicle of the Society 's founding , growth , researches , and public activities .

		There is no striving for literary effect , and the book is in no sense propagandist save as by its interesting description of the aspirations and methods of the Fabian group it may win sympathy and support in new quarters .

		The purpose for which the organi - zation was established was affirmed originally to be `` the reconstruction of society in accordance with the highest moral possibilities , '' and Mr.
Pease	PERSON	considers this to be still the most accurate and compendious description of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's object and the nature of its work .

		Idealists the Fabians truly are .

		Nevertheless , far more than Socialists of most other schools and lands , they have been leaders in practical politics and participants in the quest of attainable reforms .

		The history of the social legislation of the past thirty years in
Great Britain	LOCATION	bears evidence on every page , not of the influence of Fabian Socialism as such , but of Fabian zeal for social betterment .

		To the devel - opment of Socialism itself the Fabians have con - tributed most notably , says the author , by breaking the spell of Marxism in
England	LOCATION	and working out application of the broad principles of the socialist cause to an industrial and political environment fundamentally different from that in which Ger - man , French , and other continental Socialism is placed .

		MAGNA CAETA AND OTHER ADDRESSES .

		By
W. D. Guthrie	PERSON	.


Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		On
June 15 , 1915	DATE	, the English-speaking world celebrated the seven-hundredth anniversary of the signing of
Magna Carta	ORGANIZATION	; and the constitutional convention of
New York	LOCATION	, which was then in ses - sion , also took proper note of the great event .

		One of the speakers on that occasion was Mr.
W. D. Guthrie	PERSON	, an eminent member of the
New York	LOCATION	bar , who is well known to the legal pro- fession for his writings on constitutional law .

		Mr.
Guthrie	PERSON	's address , with nine other essays delivered on various public occasions , has recently been published .

		In these papers the author dis - cusses such questions as the referendum , the recall of judges , primary elections , a graduated income tax , and the like , all of which he subjects to hos - tile criticism .

		The essay entitled `` The Duties of Citizenship '' was delivered before the Republican convention of the state of
New York	LOCATION	in
1912	DATE	, and is an effort to lay bare the fallacies in the platform of the Progressive party .

		Mr.
Guthrie	PERSON	's addresses add very little to the discussion of the problems which they are concerned with , but they have their value as a statement of the conservative view by a learned and clear-thinking student and teacher of the law .

		The essay on
Magna Carta	ORGANIZATION	is perhaps the least valuable of the entire col - lection .

		In this paper the author presents the older view of the content and purpose of this document , a view that has long since lost credit among English historians .

		Mr.
Guthrie	PERSON	still finds the representative principle in the Great Charter ; he still seems to hold that the document provides for trial by jury ; and he holds `` that
Magna Carta	ORGANIZATION	marked the greatest political epoch in the history of our race . ''

		It is exaggerations of this sort that have driven reputable historians to the other extreme , and to speak of the `` myth of
Magna Carta	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But although the reviewer can not accept Mr.
Guthrie	PERSON	's conclusions with respect to the great document of
1215	DATE	, and is not prepared to endorse his views on current political questions , he is glad to testify to the literary excellence of the volume : the `` addresses '' show that the author has not only thought his subjects out to the point of conviction , but that he is also able to express his views in fluent and forceful English .

		SHAKESPEARE AND His FELLOWS : An Attempt to Decipher the Man and His Nature .

		By
D. H. Madden	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		It is pleasant to record that this is a work which may safely be put into the hands of the young .

		In it , the author , the Right Honorable
D. H. Madden	PERSON	, Vice-Chancellor of the
University of Dublin	ORGANIZATION	, does his duty by the tercentenary and pours a libation of reverent bromides upon the honored bones .

		The matter in it is drawn from the best authorities and legendaries .

		The Vice - Chancellor has carefully studied the
D. N. B.	PERSON	and the books of Lee and
Dowden	PERSON	; and readers of those works will find themselves quite at home with the mass of edifying and charmingly discursive material here presented .

		All relations that
Spenser	PERSON	,
Heming	PERSON	and
Condell	PERSON	,
Jonson	PERSON	, and Mar - lowe had , or may have had , with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	are made to witness to the poet 's dominant , and some - what awful , Christian `` gentleness . ''

		The chief methods by which he is revealed are those hallowed by the use of our ancestors .

		There is the immortal quotation method .

		Apt lines are taken from the Sonnets , or out of the mouth of characters as diverse as
Orsino	PERSON	and Prospero , to illustrate
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own beliefs and personality .

		Then there is what may be described as the pious use of tradition .

		Legends that are nice and proper are never `` lightly regarded '' ; that is to say , they are swallowed whole .

		But any that are unedifying even though they may come from the same sources , such as one of
Davenant	PERSON	's boasts and the story
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 113 of the final drinking bout , are regarded very lightly indeed .

		Of course , the young scamp stole deer .

		But then , many of the very best people did so in those days .

		And , after all , boys will be boys .

		Finally , the Will is made to yield up beautiful secrets .

		A tender page is devoted to the second best bed .

		The effect of the whole career , as set forth in this book , may be translated into Amer - ican as `` From Log Cabin to
White House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It will be read with pleasure and profit by the curate of the Vice-Chancellor 's parish .

		FIVE MASTERS OP FRENCH ROMANCE .

		By
Albert Leon Guerard	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		A study combining a good deal of easily writ - ten and almost as easily read exposition of modern fictions , a modicum of undistinguished criticism of the romancers , and some welcome particulars of their lives and personalities , ought to answer to the present requirements of a good many read - ers .

		Professor
Albert Leon Guerard	PERSON	, author of `` French Civilization in the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' is likely to have better luck with the present volume than with its predecessor which , although a more valuable essay , was unfortunately timed .

		Dedicated to President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	and making an urgent plea for the disarming of
France	LOCATION	, the earlier work made its appearance just after the German attack on
France	LOCATION	through
Belgium	LOCATION	persuaded most lovers of
France	LOCATION	of the hopelessness of pacifism under actual world con - ditions .

		The present volume is , in the main , inde - pendent of politics , though we do not overlook the introductory and concluding chapters `` The Twilight of a World , '' `` Geniuses as Cannon-fodder and Survival of the Unfittest , '' `` Regeneration , '' and so on .

		The writers studied are
Anatole France	LOCATION	, primate of French literature ;
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, exotic representative of French Protestantism , `` and on the surface the least Protestant of all '' ;
Paul Bourget	PERSON	, `` the most skilful technician '' ;
Maurice Barres	PERSON	, `` defender of Tradition '' ; and
Remain Rolland	PERSON	, author of `` one of the world 's classics ; our young century has produced no work that compares with it in bulk , in ambition , in breadth of culture , in wealth of sympathy . ''

		Professor
Guerard	PERSON	is a well-read man and he has written a useful book of a secondary sort .

		His book is , as his college lectures doubtless are , highly instructive to those who are not already well informed in the field traversed .

		His exposition of French novels and French culture is discreet and balanced , and his knowledge of American life , its standards and limitations , adds to his con - servatism in the present work .

		There is no heat or passion here , either for men or works or ideas , and the level style and equal temper of the essays make them all the more judicious and all the less inspiring .

		In some ways the French-born author reminds us of certain
New Englanders	LOCATION	who have lost
New England	LOCATION	's faith but not its austerity .

		Professor
Guerard	PERSON	has seen the smoke and horror of
Europe	LOCATION	in ruin , but not the fire of it .

		An interesting feature of
the Allied Bazaar	ORGANIZATION	, which was held in
Chicago	LOCATION
last month	DATE	, was the sale of the original manuscript of `` Little Boy Blue '' to
John McCormack	PERSON	, the singer , for
$ 2400	MONEY	.

		The manuscript was donated by Mr.
Slason Thompson	PERSON	, a friend of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among those bidding were Mr.
Walter Hill	PERSON	and Mr.
Cyrus McCormick	PERSON	.

		Inscribed books from the collection of Mr.
James Carleton Young	PERSON	of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	will be sold at the Anderson Galleries
February 14	DATE	and 15 .

		Among the more interesting items are a presentation copy of the
Cruickshank	PERSON	Catalogue with an original drawing ; `` The Songs of a Savoyard '' by
W. S. Gilbert	PERSON	, containing an unpublished ballad in his autograph ; an edition of `` Tristram Shandy '' with
Sterne	PERSON	's autograph in three of the volumes ; and twenty-two volumes with inscriptions by
Zola	ORGANIZATION	, these forming the largest collection of the kind ever offered .

		Bibliography 's ideal , never to be realized in full , but always to be striven for and more and more nearly attained , `` is the description , in minute detail , of all the books of the world , present , past , and future , so as to be available forever . ''

		Thus writes Mr.
Louis N. Feipel	PERSON	in a treatise on `` Elements of Bibliography , '' published for the
Bibliographical Society of America	ORGANIZATION	by
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a clearly writ - ten work , presenting in brief compass the funda - mental principles of the subject .

		Its definition of a book as `` any composition recorded on a number of leaves bound together in proper order so as to convey ideas to anyone conversant with the form of composition used '' might at first seem to be comprehensive enough ; but good dictionary authority regards as books even parchment rolls and bundles of bamboo tablets .

		Perhaps , after all ,
Milton	PERSON	's glowing description -LRB- in the `` Areopagitica '' -RRB- can not be bettered : `` A good book is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life . ''

		Parts of Mr.
Henry E. Huntington	PERSON	's library were sold at auction by the
Anderson Galleries	ORGANIZATION	on
January 24	DATE	and 25 .

		Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	's purchases at the Hoe sale alone ran over
a million dollars	MONEY	, and he afterward bought the Americana collection of the late Mr.
Church	PERSON	, the library of the
Duke of Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	, the
Halsey	PERSON	and the Chew collections , and sundry small but choice English libraries , such as the Britwell collection of Americana , lately owned by Mr.
Christie-Miller	PERSON	, that was offered for sale in
London	LOCATION
last August	DATE	.

		Mr.
George D. Smith	PERSON	forestalled the dispersal of this last group by auction and conveyed it to Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	en bloc .

		This book might have been called `` The Romance of the Ring '' as all of importance in regard to the sentimental , the religious , the mystic significance of finger rings from the early mythological rings to that embodiment of the skill of the modern gold - smith and jeweler , the little circlet which today , and every day , the lady receives from her lover is treated by Dr.
Kunz	PERSON	in a romantic and fascinating manner .

		Rings of famous men and women of past days , and the profuse lore concerning the luck or ill luck which go with certain stones or forms of circlets are two of the many interesting features .

		Others are the rings of savage peoples , the mechanism of modern manufacture , the history of ecclesiastical rings , and a full list of mottoes used in the old days upon betrothal and wedding rings .

		As a reference work its authoritative and exhaustive information makes it very valuable .

		Students of contemporary poetry have a reasonable grievance against that group of poets whose best-known representatives are
Miss Amy Lowell	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	.

		They have had a name and a group existence for a couple of years now ; but as yet they have not put forth in an informing and scholarly way the philosophy of their departure from traditional metres and the history of the ideas they seek to expound .

		It is true they have written some prefaces : there is one to the anthology , `` Some Imagist Poets , '' published in
1915	DATE	, and one to Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's `` Irradiations Sand and Spray . ''

		But the announcements made in these pref - aces are really too naive .

		The Imagists could have used very well an essay on `` The Development of English Metres '' contributed by the Irish critic Mr.
William Larminie	PERSON	to `` The Contemporary Review '' of
1894	DATE	the
November	DATE	number .

		Mr.
Larminie	PERSON	's is a learned and informing exposition of the reasons for a departure from current verse-forms .

		His views as to the bur - den of technique which the long development of English poetry has placed upon the poets of to-day are the same as those delivered by Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, while his deliberate judg - ment of the results of this over-burden would be a compelling statement in an Imagist exposition .

		Mr.
Larminie	PERSON	has this to say : One writer who has not the gift of fluency tends to become obscure ; for the external requirements of art must at all costs be met , and direct simplicity of expression is unavoidably an-d unconsciously sacri - ficed .

		Of this class of poet
Eossetti	PERSON	is a con - spicuous example .

		The tendency of others , on the contrary , from whom the `` full flowing river of speech '' wells more irresistibly , is to dilute the idea .

		Difficulties of metre and rhyme are evaded by bring - ing forward a multitude of words and phrases from which the necessary expressions can easily be selected the process , as a rule , involving much circumlocu - tion , and the presentation of the idea in minute frag - ments , so that twenty stanzas are needed where two ought to suffice .

		Seriously Mr.
Larminie	PERSON	says here what the Imagists have said fitfully .

		Here are cor - responding ideas from their anthology of
1915	DATE	: 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22 4	DATE	.

		To present an image -LRB- hence the name `` Imagist '' -RRB- .

		We are not a school of painters , but we believe that poetry should render particulars exactly and not deal in vague generalities , however mag - nificent and sonorous .

		It is for this reason that we oppose the cosmic poet , who seems to us to shirk the real difficulties of his art .

		5 .

		To produce poetry that is hard and clear , never blurred nor indefinite .

		6 .

		Finally , most of us believe that concentration is of the very essence of poetry .

		On the question of shedding rhyme from English verse , it is Mr.
Larminie	PERSON	who makes the statement that carries conviction : Latin , which has a much more perfect quantity , has no stress .

		But English has stress of a very ener - getic kind , which helps out the quantitive deficiencies .

		French has neither .

		German , like English , has both .

		But in German the consonants are often so harsh that with English , in this respect so much more melodious , the final superiority among modern lan - guages remains .

		Yet , having this superiority , enjoy - ing these superior resources , and subject to the obligations imposed upon them , it has nevertheless also taken upon itself other burdens , it has allowed another language possessed of far inferior resources to impose upon it the law necessitated by its inferior - ity ; it has accepted the unnecessary burden of rhyme .

		Mr.
Larminie	PERSON	insisted that the strength of all English metre is in its quantitive rhythm and that the greatest English poetry relied upon quantitive rhythm only .

		The addition of rhyme has tended to distract attention from qualities that are really essential to good English verse , and has prevented the evolution of varied quantitive forms .

		Finally , Mr.
Larminie	PERSON	suggested the creation of verse-forms .

		that would have greater freedom and finer sound in `` quantity sweetened by assonance and assonance strengthened by quantity . ''

		The Imagists so far have made no such thoughtful statement as that contributed to `` The Contemporary Review '' in
1894	DATE	.

		Neither have they done much to reveal the occasions on which the forms they advocate have been shown in literature .

		They have referred to the well-known writers of free verse to
Dryden	PERSON	,
Blake	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, and
William Henley	PERSON	, but they have not directed attention to the more obscure places in which certain of their forms have been shown .

		It is worth noting that one of these places is the folk romance as it is still told in
Gaelic Ireland	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		In the folk tales there are passages , vehement or decorative , which are called `` runs , '' and which are given in irregular verse-forms .

		Here is a typical `` run '' in translation : He moved as sea-heaps from sea-heaps , And as play-balls from play-balls As a furious winter-wind So swiftly , sprucely , cheerily , Eight proudly , Through glens and high tops , And no stop made he Until he came To the
City	LOCATION	and court of
O'Donnell	PERSON	.

		He gave a cheery , light leap O'er top and turret Of court and city Of
O'Donnell	PERSON	.

		This particular `` run '' is from `` The Slim Swarthy Champion , '' a story given in Camp - bell 's `` Popular Tales of the West High - lands . '' ''

		The only authority for writing this as poetry , '' says
Campbell	PERSON	, `` is the rhythm and alliteration of the original . ''

		In order to let the eye of the reader perceive the external likeness to some of the verse of the Imagists , I shall give the original here : Ghluais e mar mhuir-mhill o mhuir-mhill , 'S mar mhire-bhuill o mhire-bhuill ; Mar ghaoith ghailbheach gheamhraidh , Gu sitheach , sothach , sanntach Sar-mheamnach , Trid ghleanntann as ard-mhullach ; 'S cha d'rinneadh stad leis Gus an d'thainig e Gu cuirt agus cathair O Domhnuill .

		Thug e leum sunndach , soilleir Thar barr agus baideil Cuirt agus cathair O Domhnuill .

		In these folk romances it is not the inten - tion of the story-teller to insert a poem into his narrative what he wants to do is to whip up his prose into passages that are vehement or decorative .

		Such effects are not sought in our narrative to-day , for with us narrative is written and not told .

		But in the prose that is declaimed , the prose of the orators , one sees the form being `` whipped up '' into similar energetic rhythms .

		Here is
Burke	PERSON	doing it in his oration on American taxation : He made an administration , so checkered and speckled ; He put together a piece of joinery , So crossly indented ; And whimsically dove-tailed ; A cabinet so variously inlaid ; such a piece of diver - sified Mosaic ; such a tesselated pavement with - out cement ; Here a bit of black stone , And there a bit of white ; Patriots and courtiers ; King 's friends and republicans ; Whigs and tories ; treacherous friends and open enemies ; that it was indeed a curious shew ; But utterly unsafe to touch , and unsure to stand on .

		I believe that it is in passages where prose is `` whipped up '' into strong rhythms , rather than in the free verse of
Dryden	LOCATION	,
Blake	PERSON	,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 127
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, and
William Henley	PERSON	, that the forms which the general reader is inclined to regard as typically Imagist have appeared before .

		Compare what has been given above with this passage from Mr.
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	's ``
London	LOCATION	Excursion . ''

		Yet I revolt : I bend , I twist myself , I curl into a million convolutions : Pink shapes without angle , Anything to be soft and woolly , Anything to escape .

		Sudden lurch of clamours , Two more viaducts Stretch out red yokes of steel , Crushing my rebellion .

		My soul Shrieking Is jolted forwards by a long hot bar Into direct distances .

		It pierces the small of my back .

		I have made comparisons between Imagist poems and passages in oratory and I think I can say fairly that many of the Imagist pieces are really efforts in oratory .

		But then there is no reason why there should not be a form midway between prose and poetry .

		It is necessary to distinguish such a form by a name and I suggest it be called a `` rhetoric . ''

		The Imagists , then , do not always start from the free-verse poets whose names they sometimes mention .

		Many of their pieces have a prose , not a verse nucleus .

		It seems to me that the idea of prose occupies the minds of tinany in the group as it occupies the mind of the orator and the teller of the folk tale , and the poem appears to them as a `` whipping up '' of their prose .

		This is not true of all the Imagist poets .

		It is hardly true of any one of them on every occasion .

		But we shall be better able to judge when they approach the poets and when they approach the orators if we keep a few passages from the oratorical writers in our minds , remembering always that `` oratory is the thing heard , poetry the thing overheard . ''

		I saw her Just above the horizon , Decorating and cheering the elevated sphere She just began to move in , Glittering like the morning star , Full of life and splendour and joy .

		Oh !

		what a revolution !

		And what an heart must I have , to contemplate with - out emotion That elevation and that fall !

		... I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards To avenge Even a look that threatened her with insult .


Burke	PERSON	, `` Keflections on the French Revolution . ''

		For Nature , As green as she looks , Rests everywhere on dread foundations , Were we farther down ; And Pan , To whose music the Nymphs dance , Has a cry in him That can drive all men distracted .


Carlyle	PERSON	, `` The French Revolution . ''

		She is older than the rocks Among which she sits ; Like the vampire , she has been dead many times , and learned the secrets of the grave ; And has been a diver in deep seas , And keeps their fallen day about her ; And trafficked for strange webs with
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	mer - chants : And , as
Leda	PERSON	, was the mother of
Helen of Troy	ORGANIZATION	, And , as
Saint Anne	PERSON	, The mother of Mary ; And all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes , And lives Only in the delicacy with which it has moulded The changing lineaments , and tinged the eyelids and the hands .

		The Imagists have really created many forms forms for oratory , for narrative verse , for lyrical verse , for epigram , for dramatic dialogue .

		If some of these poets write round a prose nucleus , others certainly write round a verse nucleus .

		And one would show himself blinded or invincibly narrow - minded if one went through a collection of Imagist poems without paying a tribute to the beauty and poignancy of Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	's `` Patterns '' -LRB- which , by the way , is not written in rhymeless verse -RRB- ; to the solidity of Mr.
F. S. Flint	PERSON	's `` Eau-Forte '' -LRB- written in unrhymed but measured verse -RRB- ; to the .

		prairie-like sweep of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's Arkan - sas poems ; and , if his poems which are in traditional forms may be mentioned as Imagist , to the poignant dramatic lyrics of Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	`` Fireflies in the Corn , '' `` A Woman and Her Dead Husband , '' and `` The Mowers . ''

		The new forms they are creating are likely to further the production of a distinctive poetic literature for
America	LOCATION	.

		These forms are words in a new Declaration of Indepen - dence .

		For the future American poet may be the child of a Syrian or a Swede , or a Greek or a Russian .

		The traditional rhythms of English verse may not be in his blood and he might fumble in his poetry if he tried to use them .

		But here are verse measures that he can mould as he pleases .

		As he uses them he will not be embarrassed by memories of forgotten dances , disused harp-strings , and unmastered languages that are in the tradi - tional poetic measures of the British Islands .

COLUM	PERSON	.

		128 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE GONCOURT PRIZE , AND OTHERS , awarded to French authors by more or less competent judges of literature , have suffered some irreg - ularity of award in the general upset due to the war , but are now being assigned with something like the old orderliness and method .

		Though
Edmond de Goncourt	PERSON	, in founding the academy and the annual prize bearing his name , stipulated that the award should be made to a young writer for a work of fiction , his instructions have seldom been literally followed .

		The
1916	DATE	prize , for example , has gone to the veteran writer ,
M. Henri Barbusse	PERSON	, for his novel , `` Le Feu . ''

		He is over forty , a venerable age in comparison with the youth - fulness of most earlier recipients of the Gon - court mark of distinction ; and `` Le Feu '' is by no means his maiden effort .

		With this lat - est award the deferred
1914	DATE	prize was also assigned : it went to
M. Adrian Bertrand	PERSON	for `` L'Appel du Sol , '' which had already ap - peared as a serial in the `` Revue des Deux Mondes '' before its issue in book form .

		Word comes that
Marcel Toussaint	PERSON	, to whom was given the Sully-Prudhomme prize for the best volume of poetry of the year , has recently fallen in battle .

		The holder of the latest `` Grand Prix du Roman , '' awarded by the French Academy , is an officer of high repute who was wounded in the defence of Dixmude .

		His novel-with-a-purpose , `` La Vocation , '' is the winning book .

		To
Pierre Mille	PERSON	, who ex - cels in the short story , has been awarded the Lasserre prize , which is bestowed by the gov - ernment in recognition of a life 's work rather than of a single performance .

		Of the various literary productions thus recently crowned ,
Rene Benjamin	PERSON	's `` Gaspard , '' winner of the
1915	DATE	Goncourt prize , is probably the best known to readers outside of
France	LOCATION	.

		Though the Goncourt award has not the pecuniary value of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	and
Lasserre	PERSON	prizes -LRB- 5000 as compared with 6000 francs -RRB- , it is held in the highest esteem of them all .

		CHARTING THE OCEAN OF LITERATURE would be a difficult task for even the most skilled oceanographer .

		Something less difficult than this , because confined to the commercial and statistical aspects of the subject , is attempted and accomplished by `` The Publishers ' Weekly '' in its graphic display of the ups and downs of the various lines of book-trade in this country for the past six years .

		Espe - cially interesting are the comparisons thus exhibited between the present day and `` be - fore the war . ''

		The only branch of literature to show uninterrupted gains since that happy time of peace and prosperity -LRB- as it now seems to us -RRB- is history .

		From the 400 class in
1911	DATE	it rose into the 500 division the next year , and has since been ascending rapidly ; in
1916	DATE	it approached 900 .

		Other depart - ments , while falling off under stress of war , have shown an encouraging tendency , with very few exceptions , to rally during the year just closed .

		Fiction has suffered with the rest , but has maintained its relative superior - ity ; and music , at the other end of the scale , has pursued the even tenor of its habitual course , with some decline in
1915	DATE	, and a good recovery in
1916	DATE	, when miscellaneous litera - ture vied with it for lowest place .

		Book-cir - culation in the belligerent countries shows a very natural decline since
1913	DATE	, with
Belgium	LOCATION	out of the running entirely , and
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	badly crippled .

		In neutral European countries there is an occasional marked increase in publishing activity .

		Den - mark 's book-trade has steadily improved since
1913	DATE	, and for the season 1915-16 was eight per cent ahead of its own high record of 1913-14 .


Switzerland	LOCATION	, too , and
Holland	LOCATION	seem to be more than holding their own .

		On the whole , the trade in books has suffered far less than many another department of com - merce from the ravages of war .

		GETTING THE MOST OUT OF BOOKS , out of the books one already has , instead of indulging one 's natural inclination to acquire all the inviting new books as they come out , is the policy forced upon some of us in these times , and upon others of us at all times .

		From
Mankato	LOCATION	,
Minnesota	LOCATION	, comes word of various devices adopted in a lean year to make the public library serve the greatest good of the greatest number so far as this may be effected without any considerable purchase of fresh reading matter .

		`` Inasmuch as almost no new books were coming in , '' says the librarian , `` we have tried to get a better use out of the books we had .

		We have made book lists on various subjects , keeping the lists on the desk where they could be easily consulted .

		The following lists have been made : Good stories to read aloud ; Detective stories ; Cheerful stories ; Interesting books not fiction ;
Chris	PERSON	- tian Science stories ; Readable essays ; West - ern stories ; Modern plays ; Notable recent biographies ; Interesting travel books ; War stories ; Short stories ; Entertaining books in large print .

		These lists have been given hard usage and have accelerated the use of our books . ''

		It has been a year of diminished resources -LRB-
$ 4,000	MONEY	instead of the customary
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 129
$ 5,000	MONEY	for all expenses -RRB- for the
Mankato	LOCATION	library ; and meantime the city parks are receiving
$ 9,100	MONEY	for their upkeep , the police department
$ 11,400	MONEY	, and the fire department
$ 13,000	MONEY	.

		To be sure , the former appropria - tion of
$ 5,000	MONEY	has been granted to the library for the coming year ; but that is not exactly lavish for a city of
Mankato	LOCATION	's size .

		THE ORIGINAL OF `` HUCKLEBERRY FINN '' has died in obscurity and , what is far worse , in poverty .

		A man capable of inspiring so great a work of fiction as the celebrated `` Adventures '' ought in his old age to have been supported in luxury , if he cared for it , from the proceeds of that unfailing popular book .

		As a matter of melancholy fact , his declining years were passed in the county almshouse at
Paris	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		Barney
Farth	PERSON	- ing was his name outside the pages of ro - mance , and he lived to the ripe age of eighty , having been born in
1836	DATE	, the year after his boyhood friend first drew breath in the town of
Florida	LOCATION	, near
Paris	LOCATION	.

		But so closely was he identified with the hero of the above-mentioned adventures that for years he had answered to the name of
Huck Finn	PERSON	as often as to his own .

		An original genius in later life , as he had been during the event - ful earlier period chronicled by his friend , he made the coffin in which he was buried made it in protest against the outrageous prices of the `` coffin trust . ''

		Other similar products of cabinet-making art he is said to have furnished in considerable number to friends and contemporaries , like-minded with himself in their opinion of the aforesaid iniquitous trust ; and to those of his own kin he rendered this service free of charge , add - ing also other properties indispensable at a rightly conducted funeral .

		Indeed , he seems to have specialized in the paraphernalia of funerals , in an amateur way .

		It is a satis - faction to learn that when his own end came he had something better than a pine box and a burial in the potter 's field .

		Kind friends gave him a funeral that would have rejoiced his heart .

		ALMANAC WISDOM is still in season .

		From one of the countless annuals namely , from `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly Almanac '' we quote a few precepts , perhaps not equal to Poor Bichard 's , but at least not devoid of interest for the curious .

		These precepts are exhumed by the almanac editor from
Charles William Day	PERSON	's `` Hints on Etiquette and the Usages of Society '' -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	, 1844 -RRB- .

		`` Never pare an apple or a pear for a lady unless she desire you . ''

		Excellent .

		Not quite equal to this in fine appreciation of the proprieties is the fol - lowing : `` Do not pick your teeth much at table , as , however satisfactory a practice to yourself , to witness it is not at all pleasant . ''

		How , we wonder , did Mr.
Day	PERSON	's contempo - raries receive the instruction next to be quoted ?

		`` At family dinners , where the household bread is used , it should never be cut less than an inch and a half thick .

		There is nothing more plebeian than thin bread at dinner . ''

		Evidently
Europe	LOCATION	was not then depleting our flour-supply by hundreds of thousands of barrels yearly .

		The last of Mr.
Day	PERSON	's ten commandments tells us , with ex - traordinary typographical emphasis on the first word , to `` lead the lady through the quad - rille ; do not drag her , nor clasp her hand as if it were made of wood .

		Dance quietly ; do not kick or caper about , nor sway your body to and fro ; dance only from the hips down - wards ; and lead the lady as lightly as you would tread a measure with a sprite of gos - samer . ''

		But that was long before the One Step and the Fox Trot and the Wasp Waddle and similar -LRB- or worse -RRB- terpsichorean audac - ities .

		GREATER LIBRARY FACILITIES FOR
CHICAGO	LOCATION	are planned by the library directors .

		Five regional branches are to be established , with seventy local branches auxiliary to them .

		There will be sixty deposit stations , where there are now thirty-five , one hundred indus - trial and commercial branches instead of the present twenty-one , three thousand classroom travelling collections of fifty volumes each -LRB- there are now 848 such collections -RRB- , and the speedy motor-car or motor-truck will be called into frequent service to expedite the circula - tion in this somewhat complex system .

		Chi - cago 's extent of territory and the size of its population make this expansion of its library system necessary .

		`` Public Libraries , '' in out - lining the new measures , says that ``
Chicago	LOCATION	comprises nearly 200,000 square miles of terri - tory and ... there are 700,000 poten - tial users of the library who are prevented from using it by reason of distance . ''

		Surely they must be thus prevented .

		A city of the above-named area and of
Chicago	LOCATION	's oblong shape would measure , perhaps , one thousand miles long by two hundred miles wide ; and to visit the central library many citizens would have to travel four or five hundred miles .

		Well ,
Chicago	LOCATION	is undoubtedly big , but as all
Illinois	LOCATION	contains only about 56,000 square miles , the case of the would-be library - user is not quite so bad as the afore-mentioned i figures might lead a stranger to infer .

		130 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	COMM UNICA TIONS .

		MR. POWYS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Nothing is easier than to discredit genius by showing up its inconsistencies .

		Whitman dis - counted this sort of criticism long ago in his `` Do I contradict myself ?

		Very well , I contradict my - self , '' and such would be the most effective answer to Mr.
Israel Solon	PERSON	's review of Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's `` Sus - pended Judgments . ''

		What manner of man Mr.
Powys	PERSON	is , may be gathered from this brilliant book of essays , which I hope those of your readers who love what is fine and rare will not be discouraged from reading by anything that Mr.
Solon	PERSON	has said .

		What manner of man Mr.
Solon	PERSON	is , may equally be gathered from his review .

		Just as there is `` the kind of woman that keeps a parrot , '' so there is the kind of man who `` takes notes '' at lectures .

		To this class Mr.
Solon	PERSON	confessedly perhaps I should say avowedly belongs .

		This means that he dissects the dead phrase and misses the live message .

		It is with the dissection of phrases that his review for the most part deals .

		He has failed to feel the authentic thrill of genius ; there - fore there is no hint in his review that Mr.
Powys	PERSON	can communicate that thrill ; but he can , and does .

		He plays upon his audience as on a harp : intoxicated with his own music , his lips are some - times touched with a coal from the altar , and Delphic utterances fall thick and fast .

		Hates , prejudices ethnic , political , puritanical are burnt up and disappear in the devouring flame of his eloquence , only to assert themselves afterward with augmented virulence .

		As a result , his most inspired discourses usually close more doors than they open , and it is perhaps for this reason that for the past few years Mr.
Powys	PERSON	has favored the firmer , freer , if less lofty and vertiginous , forum of the printed page .

		`` Suspended Judgments '' is asfar removed from `` the spawn of the press '' as is the star from the starfish .

		To
Emerson	PERSON	's dictum , not to read `` books about books , '' it is the exception which proves the rule .

		It is a record not alone of the adven - tures of Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's soul among masterpieces , but of its adventures amid the noise and jostle of our American scene .

		The man has apparently no skin to protect him , either from the assault of great minds or of little .

		His capacity for the enjoyment of the large free ravishment of the one is only equalled by his capacity for suffering from the puritanical inhibitions of the other .

		At one moment he is an embodied intelligence , contem - plating with compassionate and astonished gaze this slum of space : at another he is a mad amorist of `` the great imaginative writers . ''

		Again , he is the disillusioned and dyspeptic satirist of all those who possess a philosophy of life ; then , with a round turn , he brings us up , perhaps , with some so thrillingly true statement about life , art , or religion , couched in so crystal a clarity of phrase , that we love the man and adore the artist .

		One finds in `` Suspended Judgments , '' despite its varied content , certain constantly recurring themes : the warfare between genius and medi - ocrity , the dead hand laid on life by hypocritical puritanism , the futility of philosophical theorizing , the wisdom and beauty of the children of earth - that is , those who yield without qualm or question to life 's orgiastic tides ; but the great ground-rhythm of all this various music is of sex , sex , sex .

		None but hasty and superficial thinkers will take exception to Mr.
Powys	PERSON	here .

		Sex is as normally and naturally the secret preoccupation of the sons and daughters of men as gravitation is of the stone , or polarity of the electron .

		Such is the inevitable consequence of living in a dissevered universe striving toward unity .

		We are all stu - dents and practitioners of the ancient and sacred science of
Yoga	ORGANIZATION	union with the Divine .

		Now every dear thing is Divine as long as it is thrill - ingly dear .

		To man , the dearest thing is woman ; and to woman , man .

		Love , always and every - where , is `` the desire of the moth for the star , '' - for even the concupiscent flesh seeks sublimation into spirit .

		It is because our loves are so dampened by our egotisms , our cautions and our cowardices , that we rot and smoulder instead of breaking into purifying flame .

		This is the essence of Mr.
Powj	PERSON	's 's teaching : that love is a liberating thing .

		The sins of Sodom and Gomorrah , the sensualities of Tyre and
Sidon	LOCATION	, may excite his curious interest as showing `` into what red hell our sightless souls may stray '' ; but it is upon the cleansing power of pure , primodial passion that he places all his insistence , it is this that provokes his finest enthu - siasm , and inspires his most golden prose .

		RABINDRANATH TAGORE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the
New York	LOCATION	`` Nation '' of
November 30	DATE	appeared an article by
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	entitled `` Rabindranath Tagore '' which contains the surpris - ing statement that Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	`` is in essence every - thing that
India	LOCATION	philosophically and religiously was not . ''

		Let us ask who represent best the spirit of ancient
India	LOCATION	?

		We get our answer from the Sanscrit -LRB- `` Sadhana , '' p. 14 -RRB- .

		`` They were the rishis ... The rishis were they who having reached the supreme God from all sides had found abiding peace , had become united with all , had entered into the life of the universe . ''

		Compare with this Mr.
More	PERSON	's definition of the rishis as `` those seers who ... called to mystic contemplation , made their life of solitary retirement a strenuous ... discipline of will . ''

		The words `` solitary retirement '' are espe - cially misleading , for as the seeker after truth grew in wisdom , there gathered about him a group of disciples or students , and his forest abode became the
Asram	PERSON	, the seat of learning in ancient time .

		If we ask , Who are the greatest personalities in
India	LOCATION	to-day ?

		our answer is the same : they are the rishis .

		Many Americans know something about Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	's school at Bolpur where on the Asram site chosen by his father , the

		Art 's obituary contributed to the pages of the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' by her undertaker ,
George Moore	PERSON	, is not the first expression which he has given to an opinion he has held for some time .

		He said the same thing before and said it better when he wrote , '' Art must be parochial in the beginning to become cosmopolitan in the end . ''

		Fiction to-day , like religion , is harmed by a pernicious otherworldliness .

		We are always be - lieving that `` there 's a land that is fairer than ours '' and consequently letting our own remain less fair .

		But we are coming to see that the Here and Now is the matter we ought to have in hand .

		has founded a school deliberately modelled after the ancient Asram .

		In an English newspaper , the `` Statesman '' of
Calcutta	LOCATION	for
November 26 , 1913	DATE	, a writer describes his visit to the school as like the entrance `` into a different world ... On every side there was a sense of peace and tranquil - ity ... We had read of the asrama of Rishis but we had not seen one before . ''

		More expres - sive of the spiritual influence of the central personality of this school is the story of the Hindu student who , when he was the victim of a terrible accident in this country , found in the song of his master peace and joy for an awful moment .

		And all that Mr.
More	PERSON	finds to say about this poet who teaches men to die heroically , is that he `` is nice and he is pretty . ''

		Referring to the poem , `` Fruit Gathering LXXXV , '' he severely decries in it `` this effeminate feeling of defeat , this pacifistic waiting by the roadside and puddling in senti - ment . ''

		Let me ask if there is anyone else who is blessed with a reading knowledge of English who does not perceive that this Song of the Defeated is a song of triumph ?

		`` For she is the bride whom he woos in secret '' could there be a greater triumph to a believer in God ?

		It is not as a representative of a defeated people that Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	speaks .

		He sings of
India	LOCATION	, not
India	LOCATION	the weak and helpless , but
India	LOCATION	, the strong !

		in faith .

		Across the world he sees the splendid | nations in their death struggle , putting their trust j in guns and dreadnoughts ; and he sees
India	LOCATION	, suffering also , but putting her trust in God , the spiritual citadel of troubled times .

		Babylon has fallen ,
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	have passed away , but
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	live on , immortal in their human - ity and self-control .

		It is a simple message that Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	brings us the age-old message of the
East	LOCATION	.

		It is better to keep one 's own soul than to gain the whole world .

		It is better for a nation to keep its soul than to gain the whole world .

		In these days of bitterness and suffering , its stirring note is not to be drowned out by any sacrilegious chatter , j
America	LOCATION	is testifying that out of the East a pro- I phetic voice is sounding , and her heart vibrates responsively , as man 's heart will ever vibrate , to his word of the triumph of the soul .

Urbana	LOCATION	, III ,

		Our fiction , if it is to live as literature , must be hodiernal .

		The reason that fiction writers seek their in - spiration in things that are neither of their world nor in their world is their fear of provincialism .

		Never was a virtue so abused as provincialism .

		If we only knew it the part of us that never fails to interest others is our local part .

		It is impossible to give actuality in any high degree to something that has not been actual in our experience .

		There is no time like our own day and generation .

		If we try to make another age live again , the fact remains that it is only imagined , not seen .

		We all like to boast of our cosmopolitanism and to claim the wide world for our home .

		Ibsen 's saying that he began life as a Norwegian , then became a Scandinavian , and lastly developed into a Humanitarian shows a spirit we should do well to emulate ; but the point is that the secret of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's universal appeal lies not in his sweeping Humanitarianism , nor yet in his broad Scandi - navianism , but in his narrow Norwegianism .

		He was the quintessence of his own little locality , the epitome of his section .

		The whole may be greater than its parts but it is never so interesting .

		Be a man of parts if you would be a living writer , should be the novelist 's first commandment .

		It was a keen appreciation of this truth that prompted
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	to say that `` the man who writes about himself and his own time is the only man who writes about all people and about all time ... The writer who aims at producing the platitudes which are not for an age but for all time has his reward in being unreadable in all ages . ''

		The coming of the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	has been long awaited and often heralded .

		Not a few have even claimed its authorship .

		Yet the Great English Novel or the
Great French Novel	ORGANIZATION	has not so much as been expected .

		No one novel could possibly reflect the whole of any nation 's life .

		It is a harmful ambition and a wrong ideal to place before any writer .

		The more local his grasp the more national will be his reach .

		If he resorts to literary wayfaring , seeking material which he has not been brought up with , his provincialism will show itself at once .

		The way not to be provincial is to stay at home in books and out .

		The `` fatal germ of internationalism '' which has killed art for Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has but one antitoxin , provincialism .

Table of Contents	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many points , however , besides its convenience are to be rated in its favor .

		It is permanently , not to say handsomely , bound , and calculated surely to outlive its usefulness .

		As for the contents .

		There are in all about one hundred selected poems , the choice spirits of the 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22 year	DATE	.

		They are all good poems .

		There is really nothing the matter with any of them .

		They all embody yearnings .

		Which brings us to the real purpose of this letter .

		Is sentiment to be the dominant note in all our American poetry ?

		It seems so .

		Lately we have been swept by a wave of realism .

		It was a cold wave and it chilled .

		But it awakened us from slumber , romantic slumber .

		At the same time and probably part and parcel with realism came the Librists , the Prose-Poets , the Imagists , and
Kreymborg	PERSON	.

		Kreymborg is something all by himself .

		To me he is the
Anarch	PERSON	- ist Poet .

		Thus three things have come into our literary life romance , and realism , and the still - born Imagism .

		When are we to have thought ?

		This is a bold question .

		You will find it skil - fully avoided in literary circles .

		It is the unmen - tionable of poetics .

		Poetry and thought were divorced in the great Victorian era and it will take a greater era still to remarry them .

		If , however , we are to have no strain of logic in our verse , let us at least have real emotion , or real sentiment , or real beauty , or real something , even real realism .

		How does it come that so much attention is devoted by our anthologist to the `` Los Angeles Graphic '' while the `` Atlantic Monthly '' is wholly overlooked ?

		And why , speaking of neglect , if this be a record for
1916	DATE	, does Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	start his collection with the magazine issues of
October , 1915	DATE	which often appear in the middle of
August	DATE	and conclude it with the
September number of 1916	DATE	a date editorially reached some - where around
July	DATE	?

		Why does he so , unless it be to get his own book on the market for the new year or maybe , let us in Christian charity sug - gest it , in time for the Christmas gift season ?

		It was a surprise and a shock to find , even in so complete a list of published poems as this one , that the most prolific writers among us have scarcely printed twenty poems in the magazines of
America	LOCATION	during the entire anthological year .

		No wonder the poet is proverbially poor , even at
fifty cents	MONEY	a line .

		With great boldness from the select of the select I have chosen the following : `` The Red Month , '' by
James Oppenheim	PERSON	; '' To No One in Particular , '' by
Witter Bynner	PERSON	; `` Dirge , '' by
Adelaide	LOCATION	Crap - sey ; `` The Broken Field , '' by
Sara Teasdale	PERSON	.

		We can dispose of the last ; it has some thought and is not unskilfully expressed ; but it shall not be called `` distinctive . ''

		Let us place , then , these three poems of Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	, Mr.
Bynner	PERSON	, and
Miss Crapsey	PERSON	in a little book all of their own .

		They are examples of word-music , thought , and emotion .

		Let us call the book , `` Anthology of Magazine Verse for

		NOTES FROM JAPAN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The literary world of
Japan	LOCATION	has suffered a great loss in the death of Professor Natsume at the early age of 49 .

		He was , perhaps , `` the most noted writer of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' although that characterization might be disputed by
Yone Noguchi	PERSON	.

		He was unusually well informed in European , as well as Japanese and Chinese literature .

		One critic has said : `` As a novelist and essayist he attained in the esteem of his countrymen a position higher * than has ever yet been achieved by any writer of the modern school . ''

		He has been variously called `` the Meredith of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' `` the
Dickens	PERSON	of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' `` the Thackeray of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		He achieved unique fame in this land where ornamental titles are held in such high esteem and are much sought after , of declining the degree of `` Doctor of Letters , '' which the government bestowed upon him !

		His first work , `` Botchan , '' is one of his most famous , and is an `` autobiography in novel form , '' like ``
David Copperfield	PERSON	. ''

		His masterpiece is entitled in Japanese `` Waga Hai wa
Neko de Aru	ORGANIZATION	, '' or in simple English , `` I Am a Cat . ''

		It has been , in part at least , translated into English .

		The Hon. Mrs.
E. A. Gordon	PERSON	, of
England	LOCATION	, has been for many years an ardent student of Bud - dhism and has written much upon that subject , especially in its relation to Christianity .

		One of her works is called `` Lotus Gospel '' and discusses her theory of the same origin for both Christian - ity and Buddhism .

		In the course of her researches , she has accumulated a large amount of valuable material , in the form of books , manuscripts , pic - tures , etc. .

		She recently left
Japan	LOCATION	to return to
England	LOCATION	, and , before she left , decided to con - tribute her valuable collection to
Waseda Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , to which she had already presented 300 volumes .

		The collection to be handed over is said to comprise 1400 books in foreign languages , 200 books in Japanese and Chinese , and 400 pictures and 200 photographs of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Gordon	PERSON	was specially interested in pictures of
Buddha	LOCATION	; she is said to have copied many famous pictures and to have photographed others .

		In the course of her study , she visited almost all the famous temples of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		A committee has been appointed in the Depart - ment of the
Imperial Household	ORGANIZATION	to compile the poems written by the late Emperor Meiji Tenno .

		He is credited with over 100,000 verselets , as we might call the tanka , or 31 syllable poem .

		Another name is `` epigram . ''

		As the readers of THE DIAL have already been informed , the theme for the New Year 's Poem this season was `` Snow on a Distant Mountain . ''

		I append here two English verselets , of which the first was contributed to the `` Japan Times '' and the second to the `` Japan Advertiser . ''

		Look on the vast disquietude of
Earth	LOCATION	; On blackened fields , by war shells swept and riven !

		Then from these turmoiled scenes , Look out where Earth Uplifts herself , arrayed in glistening white , And silently Holds cpmmunings with
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Eve of lowering sky : Night of tempest , wind and rain : Morn of radiant calm See !

		Mount Fuji 's gleaming crest , Storm-free , bears a crown of snow .

		AMERICA AND THE NEW EPOCH .

		Mild English satirists like Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	tell us that business has become the American religion , with its own creed and its distinct evangelistic flavor of utterance .

		There is always a tendency for the successful to expand into a cult .

		And American busi - ness , more than any other activity , has had the glamour of success .

		Daring , swift , clean strokes of organizing and inventive genius brought their quick and exceeding great reward .

		The colossal booms , the mushroom growths of industrial plants , the expansion of trade , the sudden cataclysms , have touched American business with a sense of the miracu - lous .

		And now the original ruthless struggle for growth and survival has given place , with the integration of the .

		big industries , to a milder era .

		The improvement of technique has been accompanied by a new idealism .

		Disdain for the public , when the hand of every busi - ness man was against every man , has changed into concern for the public 's good will .

		A number of prophets have arisen to fortify and justify that sense of ubiquitous goodness which the business man of to-day seems to need around him as the fish needs water .

		Of these prophets
Miss Tarbell	PERSON	is one of the most industrious and comforting .

		She does not ask how far the new idealism has been forced by the pressure of government , by the fear of social unrest , by the desire for sweeter and subtler forms of control over the lives of the industrially subject classes .

		She accepts at its face value this new and anxious solici - tude for the welfare of employees , for the conservation of their health and intelligence .

		She makes a wide sweep of industry , and strains out all the good intentions from the chaotic , elemental , pig-headed American in - dustrial life that we see out of our car windows .

		These she presents to us with so evangelistic an ardor that our perspectives are quite destroyed .

		Her observation , she tells us , has been exhaustive , but one is skeptical about so unanimous a demonstration that American industry is finding the Golden Rule synony - mous with business profits .

		An idealism must surely be false when it is most impressive for what it glaringly ignores .

		One of the unhap - piest days of Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	's life was the occa - sion when she appeared before the
Industrial Relations Commission	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, and had her easy optimism remorselessly probed about the things she had n't seen in those industrial communities that she had visited .

		Her method was `` to see at their work all the men and women in a plant from those with the shovel or scrubbing brush to those in the head offices ; to look at their conditions , to see them in their homes , to learn from their lips what they thought and felt about it all . ''

		But she brought away none of the impressions that disturb other idealists among us , the subtle corrosion of the workers ' power of self-de - fence through corporation philanthropy , the destruction of collective effort through scien - tific management .

		Anyone who heard
Miss Tarbell	ORGANIZATION	's revealing testimony understood that she had gone out , not as a scientific investiga - tor or even as an understanding idealist , but as a detective to find the Golden Rule .

		The matter of her personal sincerity is irrelevant .

		The fact is that the model workshops and houses , the safety and anti-alcohol crusades , the health insurance and pension schemes , the profit-sharing , education , scientific manage - ment that she found , she advertises to the glory of business and not to the glory of grow - ing democracy and social responsibility .

		I do not mean to sneer at ideals in business .

		But I do insist that the value in reporting them must lie in a scrutiny whether such ideals are not inhibiting broader and more crucial visions .

		Is not this autocratic reg - imentation of the workers a handicap to democracy ?

		Should not the workers ' welfare be the concern of the community at large rather than of the individual corporation , to which it means only a more powerful instru - ment for control of the habits , ideals , attitudes of the worker , and for his ultimate feudal - ization ?

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	, as a prophet of en - lightened capitalism , does not even pose this question .

		She therefore befuddles her ideal - ism and is an intellectual darkener of counsel rather than a bringer of light .

		One turns to the more appealing Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, editor of `` System , '' lecturer on Business Policy in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, whose scheme of business idealism is scientific rather than , evangelistic .

		For if American business has been a religion it is rapidly becoming a sci - ence .

		The business man approaches his problems of production , distribution , and management in the same spirit of analysis and experimentation as the chemist in his laboratory .

		Such an idealism is one of effi - ciency and integration .

		To the layman Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's analysis will seem very obvious , busi - ness science the most elementary of all tech - niques .

		If success in business is not the lot of all of the even moderately intelligent , it 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	must be because there are external factors over which one has no control .

		The particular approach which Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	outlines seems lined only with the most truistic common sense .

		His science suggests the disquieting thought that American energy in its flood of enthu - siasm and conviction has gone into a profes - sion which makes little strain upon the intel - lect or imagination .

		It is not that ideals of efficiency and wastelessness are `` low , '' it is that they are so easy .

		The effect of many more such books on `` business science '' would be to destroy all our sense of the peculiar mystery , genius , and arduousness of the enterprise .

		Our current American imagination might slip away and begin to fasten itself on the really intricate problems of personal and class rela - tions .

		Welfare work , harmonious organiza - tion of labor force , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	sees rightly as part of the technique of efficiency .

		In our present industrial system it is far more fruit - ful to idealize the `` betterment '' forces in this way than in
Miss Tarbell	LOCATION	's prophetic strain .

		As long as we have our present class rule in industry , it will be healthier for the worker to be treated as an implement of production than as a laboratory for the working out of the
Golden Rule	ORGANIZATION	.

		If class rule passes in a socialist reorganiza - tion of industry , then these ideals of welfare and efficiency might both find their proper meaning .

		Welfare would become a series of minimum standards maintained by the indus - trial state impersonally for the benefit of all .

		Efficiency would become a spontaneously lived technique .

		Such a scheme Dr.
Steinmetz	PERSON	presents .

		His vision of American social recon - struction is so magnificent and far-flung in its implications that it should challenge the attention of prophets , experts , and laymen alike .

		The discussion and appreciation which these ideas create will almost be a test of the intellectual vitality which American socialism has left in its bones .

		For Dr.
Steinmetz	PERSON	has that rare and suggestive vision of the social - ist who is at the same time a great inventive engineer and an active officer in one of our most advanced and successful industrial cor - porations .

		He is personally engaged in fash - ioning the corporation out of which he hopes the industrial state will be built .

		His social - ism might be called a `` corporation syndical - ism , '' for what he outlines is a union of huge corporations into whose hands will be en - trusted the productive work of the nation .

		The corporation type of organization has demonstrated its permanent administrative superiority over any form of political machin - ery .

		The state of the future must be built out of the corporation rather than out of the present political organization .

		Politically or - ganized , the nation would have only veto and referendum power over general policy .

		The dual state , with parallel industrial and polit - ical organization -LRB- which we already virtually have , though the relations are disguised and infinitely disordered -RRB- , will be publicly recog - nized .

		A national organism , stable , flexible , effective , will be achieved where efficiency and democracy will at last strike their proper bal - ance and undertake the functions they can best perform .

		It is a grandiose conception , and quite the most plausible of all the Utopias .

		America drives straight to such an ideal , and into it can be fitted all other busi - ness and political idealisms .

		Dr.
Steinmetz	PERSON	turns prophet , too , and fears our slow decadence , in competition with the
State	ORGANIZATION	socialism of
Europe	LOCATION	, unless we develop our polity toward this dual government .

		The new epoch will drive us hard .

		Our slow democ - racy , striving to throw chains of control over the embryo industrial state , must fail .

		The new epoch forces this corporation socialism upon us .

		Business ideals which are to be fruitful must point toward this goal .


RANDOLPH S. BOURNE	PERSON	.

		TRUE STORIES OF
TURKEY	LOCATION	.

		STAMBOUL NIGHTS .

		By
H. G. Dwight	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		`` The Leopard of the Sea , '' `` His Beat - itude , '' `` The Golden Javelin , '' `` The River of the Moon '' these are some of the titles with which Mr.
H. G. Dwight	PERSON	intrigues the Western reader in his collection of Turkish stories .

		It should be said at once that the tales are every bit as good as their titles .

		Perhaps the most remarkable thing about them is that they are true true from several points of view .

		In his foreword to the possible reader , the author chooses to acknowledge that many of them were `` put on paper almost exactly as they were told me . ''

		However this may be about their main outlines , and due allow - ance must , of course , be made for the author 's modesty and his `` almost , '' anyone who has lived in the
Near East	LOCATION	can testify that in phrase and descriptive detail the stories are strictly true to Levantine speech and custom and turn of thought .

		There was the ill - starred
Leopard	ORGANIZATION	which on its strange voyage to
Basra	LOCATION	had the misfortune at one time to `` sit '' on the `` floor of the sea . ''

		There is the assurance that the infamous
Nousret Pasha	PERSON	, milk-brother of the Sultan and owner of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of the Giraffe , preferred `` a succulent
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 135 dish of ` The Imam Fainted ' or ` It Pleased the Manslayer ' '' to our European concoc - tions ; also the quaint idiom of the gardener Shaban who , when asked by his master why he left his family in
Albania	LOCATION	instead of bringing them with him to
Constantinople	LOCATION	, replied : `` Wives , mives a man will not die if he does not see them every day . ''

		But these stories and sketches are true in a more fundamental sense true to human nature , by and large , as it emerges to-day , picturesquely , or tragically , or both , against the alluring background of the
Near East	LOCATION	.

		They have their philosophy which serves to lift them out of the class of the merely clever achievements of the alert correspondent .

		Mr.
Dwight	PERSON	knows his local color so well that he also perceives its nicer relations to the whole color scheme of things , and it is thus that he reproduces it .

		Three tales , in particular , stand out in the volume as notable for their perfect orientation to their semi-Eastern themes and for the poignancy with which the strangeness of these themes is brought home to the Western reader .

		They are `` The Leopard of the Sea , '' `` The House of the Giraffe , '' and the final story of the series , `` In a Pasha 's Garden . ''

		The first of these has been dubbed a modern Turkish Odyssey .

		It is more Turkish than modern , I submit , in spite of its apparent date .

		The second , as one reads it , has all the excitement and bustle of a detective story , but much more than this remains when one puts it down .

		It is impossible to forget its two chief figures ,
Nousret Pasha	PERSON	, who began life as a wrestler on the
Marmora	PERSON	and ended it as the Sultan 's chief spy , and his more attractive , though if anything more inscrutable , servant Ali , blind and unwavering in his fidelity as only a Turk can be .

		But `` In a Pasha 's Garden '' seems to conjure up the
East	LOCATION	most powerfully of all the stories in the book it is par excel - lence a Stamboul night 's entertainment .

		Similar results Mr.
Dwight	PERSON	obtains in other cases by means just the reverse .

		He delights in transplanting to the Oriental scene an American missionary or politician with a typically impervious or even hostile attitude toward the new environment .

		Thus we are enabled to see with much humor and no small profit the inevitable collision when West meets East .

		For example , there is an amazing jolt between
Vermont	LOCATION	and the Per - sian
Gulf	ORGANIZATION	in the story called `` The Regicide , '' which narrates the somewhat farcical adven - tures of Mr. and Mrs.
Alonzo Blakemore	PERSON	, who were oddly inspired to forsake
Benning	LOCATION	- ton for
Basra	LOCATION	.

		More serious and also more suggestive is `` For the Faith , '' an account of the peculiar relations between the Rev - erend
Thomas Redding	PERSON	of Stamboul and a certain
Youssouf Bey	PERSON	, slave-trader and would - be founder of a new Arab empire in
Africa	LOCATION	, in whom the good missionary was for a time constrained to see his first and long-awaited Mohammedan convert .

		But the most effective of the stories that fall in this group is undoubtedly `` Mortmain . ''

		Herein another missionary ,
Horatio Bisbee	PERSON	of
Iowa	LOCATION	, in the process of erecting a mission house in Stam - boul undergoes an involuntary initiation into the mysteries of the ancient capital of the
Eastern Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		I will not spoil this story or any of the others in this rare collection by attempting to retell it .

		I will only warn the prospective reader that after he has read them all through once , he will probably be inclined to pick up his `` Stamboul Nights '' and read his favorites over again .

		And long after that , he may find himself marvelling what manner of stories they were .

		LIFE ON THE VELD .

		FROM THE HEART OF THE VELD .

		By
Madeline Alston	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		To see
South Africa	LOCATION	as Mrs.
Alston	PERSON	sees it is to feel that tugging at the heart-strings that summons all who have ever been there any length of time to return and taste the life that only
South Africa	LOCATION	in all the world can give .

		Not all of us will quite agree with Mrs.
Alston	PERSON	in all her judgments .

		In fact , few of us will , for we shall lack her generosity and her vision .

		Her statement , fearlessly expressed , that Lord
Milner	PERSON	was the greatest statesman
South Africa	LOCATION	ever saw , for instance , may give several of us pause .

		But surely no man or woman can read her book to the end and lay it down without feeling he has enjoyed a privilege .

		It is as if one had called on her in that sunny garden that overflows into the wilderness around her rose-bowered home on the Swazi - land border , and had listened while she talked and attended to the domestic duties that spell drudgery to so many women but to her are part of the art of living .

		`` Life on the veld , '' she says , `` is mostly work , '' and proceeds to prove it , yet knowing all the while that her real work is vastly greater than any the eye can see .

		The book is really a series of essays , each one dealing with her daily life from a differ - ent aspect .

		She explains the comfort of the veld 's loneliness , the charm of its freedom and wherein that freedom lies , its appeal to the imagination , and its wholesomeness -LRB- to some THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	people -RRB- .

		There enters into one chapter a vulgar little woman from
Johannesburg	LOCATION	`` who spoke of her gay life in the
Golden City	LOCATION	to us poor drudges of the veld , '' and of whom Mrs.
Alston	PERSON	writes , `` I would much rather have a hundred fat anti-British vrouws as my neighbors than one person with a mind like hers . ''

		To love the veld and not be overcome by it calls for character far stronger and higher than the ordinary , and a scorn of the shallower things of life .

		There are chapters on
Rhodesia	LOCATION	, on the drought in
Matabeleland	LOCATION	, on South African towns , and by no means least of all on `` going home , '' knowing that `` in good time the veld will call us back again . ''

		There is an account of Milnerton the bankrupt , unap - preciated Milnerton near enough to
Cape Town	LOCATION	to have been famous long ago , more peaceful now and beautiful than any seaside place in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Through her eyes we see old
Table Mountain	ORGANIZATION	at night with his sides afire , and that is a sight never to be forgotten .

		And we meet fat Dutch women who hate the British with the fanaticism of ignorance , yet who are neighborly enough once they are understood .

		And Mrs.
Alston	PERSON	understands them .

		Approach this book , then , deferentially as you would the lady herself among her dahlias , poinsettias , and hibiscus .

		You will find its author almost bewilderingly well-read ; but she has slept too often under the stars with the dew of
South Africa	LOCATION	on her pillow not to know , to quote her own words , that `` the world of books and of art and politics is of secondary importance , the woman question is an absurd - ity these are not the real things of life . ''

		And she proceeds to remind us what most of the real things are .

		But where , after all , the book 's chief inter - est lies is in the light it throws , all uncon - sciously , on the fusion taking place in
South Africa	LOCATION	to-day as surely , though doubtless as leisurely , as the mingling of two rivers .

		Mrs.
Alston	PERSON	seems totally unaware of it ; in fact she regrets absence of any sign of it .

		But the reader will find his memory wan - dering back through history to
Norman	PERSON	days , when
Norman	PERSON	nobles and their no less pur - poseful ladies strove with all that was in them to make
England Norman	LOCATION	, finally to be swallowed up and become an ingredient of a nation that does not even bear their name .

		Those who doubt the ultimate emergence of a united
South Africa	LOCATION	do so only because they view the country from the same angle from which the Normans once viewed
England	LOCATION	, as Mrs.
Alston	PERSON	frankly does .

		Yet the
Taal	ORGANIZATION	is no more uncouth to British tongues and ears than
Saxon	PERSON	was to
Norman	PERSON	; and no Boer yet lived who could more outrage a British lady 's sense of the proprieties and chivalry than a Saxon gentleman could offend the ears and eyes and nose of the conqueror 's wife of his day .

		As a conqueror 's wife , who has gloried in what seemed to be the fruits of conquest , and who has seen them snatched away by careless governments and trodden under foot by fools and worse , yet who still carries a high and faithful chin and writes of all she knows and loves and thinks and believes , without ac - rimony , who can still , in fact , love
South Africa	LOCATION	and all in it while being faithful to her birthright , Mrs.
Alston	PERSON	commands both re - spect and gratitude .

		Her book deserves to be bought and kept , not borrowed .

		She leaves me with only one regret one thing to cavil at , and I will therefore make the most of it .

		I emphatically assert that she ought not to have killed that toad .

		It is true , as she says , that many women have shot rhinoceroses but no woman could kill a toad , and she did not commit the crime in person but ordered it done by native servants .

		Nevertheless , as one who has lived more than a little in
Africa	LOCATION	, and has known by name and fondled toads that grew fat catching flies beside the lantern put in place expressly for them
night after night	TIME	, I here and now indict Mrs.
Alston	PERSON	of the crime of murder , only condoned in her case by the otherwise unblem - ished conduct of her life and by the great charm of her book .

		THE POWER OF INTELLIGENCE .

		ESSAYS IN EXPERIMENTAL LOGIC .

		By
John Dewey	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Chicago University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	. -RRB-

		In this book
Professor Dewey	ORGANIZATION	assembles articles dating from
1900	DATE	to the current year .

		The first four papers constitute his contri - bution to the studies in logical theory which he published in collaboration with a number of colleagues at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		These mark the status and attitude of prag - matic thought toward the dominant position in philosophy at that time .

		The remaining articles follow the development of philosophy in
America	LOCATION	to the present date .

		In that development there has been a shift in the emphasis of thinking from the implications of idealism to the assumptions of realism , and Professor
Dewey	PERSON	's book constitutes an admir - able definition of the attitude of pragmatism toward both these metaphysical positions in philosophy .

		1917 -RSB- 137 The position of idealism is summed up in the assertion , `` The world is my idea . ''

		The position of realism is summed up in the asser - tion , `` The world is my spectacle . ''

		It has been the function of the pragmatic approach to philosophic problems to show against the idealist position that thought actually arises in situations over which it has no control , and that its role in the conduct of life is to achieve control over these situations .

		The world , far from being the mere creature of the mind , exists on its own account , influences the conduct of man and must either be mas - tered ` or lost .

		As against the assertion of real - ism , the pragmatist declares that the very facts of experience indicate a vital give-and - take in which facts are modified by thought as well as thought by facts .

		Scientific think - ing consists in this give-and-take ; and the more radically scientific the thought is , the more fully the changed meanings which the mind imposes upon its environment must be incorporated into the constitution of the environment .

		The fact is that both realist and idealist conceive the world in ultimate and static terms .

		They deny the reality of change , the interaction between thoughts and things , and they imagine that by shifting the seat of quality from things to the relations between things , or from relations to things , they solve the problems of change and abolish the reality of novelty .

		The merit of pragmatism lies in its recogni - tion of the character and significance of change , of the causal relationships that are possible between things and do actually oper - ate between most of those that we are consid - ering .

		Once these are realized , it becomes possible to define an actual working method which so describes the processes of achieve - ment of which civilization is composed as to make it a programme for the further conquest of nature and the liberation of human nature .

		Civilization is really the working into the texture of our environment of all changed meanings .

		We live on the interest of our accumulated past .

		For every axiom began as a postulate and acquired its axiomatic cer - tainty by dint of a struggle for survival with other ideas which were its peers in the beginning .

		Perhaps the heart of the book is the demon - stration of the importance of change , of the interaction between thoughts and things , of the significance of active thinking in the life of man , and his remaking of the world .

		It is a demonstration of the creative power of intelligence .

		In turning over any random dozen of the verse books of the moment , one gets a rather painful sense of confusion .

		Free verse of the two chief varieties borders neatly chiselled sonnets as carefully wrought as any in
Milton	LOCATION	or
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Paeans to the stark and undraped libido pursue verses of the most ascetic , nun-like purity .

		Verses in praise of skyscrapers and abattoirs are set down cheek by jowl with prettily polished pastorals .

		Lyrics of a pure ethereal beauty sparkle out suddenly from rubbish heaps of verse of an almost incredible badness .

		Perhaps it has always been so .

		Bad poetry there must always have been , if only to serve as compost for the good .

		A fairly trust - worthy test of the poetic vitality of any age may be found in the amount of bad poetry which it produces and forgets .

		What really distinguishes our own time is the amount of bad poetry that gets into print .

		Once , the poet went forth like a solitary diver and moved about in the cool green depths of his mind and `` heart , painfully selecting and re - jecting .

		At the end of a month he might or might not come back to men with a single pearl of purest ray serene .

		But now we go forth with mud scows and steam dredges and shovel up tons of slime and ooze and let the public burrow for its own jewels .

		Fortunate is the reviewer who finds in a dozen volumes six that are worth writing about , and doubly fortunate if he can assert with his hand over his heart that two of these six seem to him very good .

		Mr.
Benjamin De Casseres	PERSON	brings together in `` The Shadow Eater '' a group of verses in the mood of a dyspeptic Whitman .

		On the principle that nothing is so emphatically de - funct as the fads of yesteryear , these verses make an impression of astonishing antiquity .

		Compared with
Longfellow	PERSON	they are old-fash - ioned and bromidic ;
Felicia Hemans	PERSON	, com - pared with them , is fresh and youthful .

		All the old exploded diseases of the soul that
Max Nordau	PERSON	took seriously , all the spiritual sores , 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	the puny blisters , the enfant terrible attitu - dinizing which our grandmothers gasped at in the French and German egoists of their day , are here exhumed and ranged anew for our in - spection .

		But the gasp turned long ago into a yawn .


Tom Sawyer	PERSON	could not go on forever mulcting his playfellows of pennies and marbles by the exhibition of his sore toe .

		Those who have read
Leopardi	LOCATION	,
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer ,
Weininger	PERSON	, and Baudelaire , will find no novel shudder in this book .

		They will see another desperate man storming sternly , inex - orably , against a Deity whose existence he has just denied .

		They will see him again , in a mollified mood , patting his God on the head , with a half surmise that he may himself be God .

		They will find the old familiar familiar - ity with the word `` lust '' and with the obstet - rical metaphor .

		-LRB- Is the time not ripe , by the way , for a midwife 's anthology ? -RRB-

		They will find another verse maker who is determined at all costs to be astonishing - who , when sense palls , tries nonsense , and , that failing , tries capital letters .

		All this was good fun
fifty years ago	DATE	, but the wind of the poor jest is broken .

		The determination to cast off all shackles of convention is carried into orthog - raphy , so that beside such words , caviare to the general , as `` adytum '' and `` lutescent , '' we have the spellings `` wafir , '' `` tapir '' -LRB- not an animal -RRB- , and `` cozzen '' !

		These spellings are the features of the book which one does not remember having met too frequently before .

		Now and then a line attains epigrammatic value by its vigorous compression .

		Here , for example , is the pessimist 's description of a human life : `` The cry in the womb , the re - lease , the hasty scud across earth , the thud in the Pit ! ''

		Here is solipsism in a nutshell : `` My soul is a fountain that balances the ball of the visible cosmos . ''

		Here , again , is the `` cosmic foot-pad 's '' word about Love , which , for reasons analogous to those which actuated
Otto Weininger	PERSON	, he says he `` rejects '' : `` Love , that accouched every star in the blue , that with knout of desire sends the young worlds grunting round and round the senescent suns . ''

		Old-fashioned in a very different way is Mr.
Frederick E. Pierce	PERSON	's `` Jordan Farms , An Epic in Homespun . ''

		This is a narrative in blank verse of the long-drawn-out failure of a
New England	LOCATION	farmer .

		The story is told in a manly way , with much true pathos , exact knowledge of the setting , and no humor .

		We are reminded so frequently in reading it of the moods , manners , and styles of earlier poets who have used blank verse in narrative poetry that we forget the present poet in attending to the Professor of English Litera - ture .

		The staple of the style is
Wordsworth	PERSON	- ian doubtless the best style available for the jog trot of narrative set off by Tenny-r sonian flourishes , with now and then an un - mistakably Miltonic pedal point .

		It is nearly inevitable that in such work chiefly the weak - nesses and mannerisms of the masters and not their high incommunicable virtues should be caught .

		Professor
Pierce	PERSON	fails as completely as
Wordsworth	PERSON	at his worst to reconcile the de - mands of dialogue and natural speech with those of poetry .

		One hopes that he is doing less than justice to academic English in ascrib - ing to one Professor
Milner	PERSON	the words the italics are my own : Weary but faithful many a time he came With gray head bowed , and weakening in his age ; And resting oftener than in sturdier years , Would talk with me , each seated on our stone .

		Faults of this sort are not explained away by the sub-title of the book .

		A main defect of the style is that it is so very far from `` home - spun . ''

		It is not woven out of home materials .

		Neither is it simple , sturdy , unpretentious .

		The method of narration , rather remotely analogous to that of `` The Ring and the Book , '' is too devious and difficult to suit the tale .

		The story is disjointed and unemphatic and the scheme of family relationships is too com - plex to be easily unravelled and held in mind .

		Professor
Pierce	PERSON	is at his best in descriptions of
New England	LOCATION	landscape .

		Mr.
John G. Neihardt	PERSON	brings together in `` The Quest '' those poems from his three ear - lier collections of lyrics which , `` having been read widely , have won approval . ''

		The poems in the present volume are arranged `` in ac - cordance with the succession of attitudes toward life incident to growth out of the erotic period into manhood . ''

		This rare and commendable effort to secure unity through a progressive treatment of themes enables the reader to get a clear and interesting picture of the poet 's mind and art such as no collection of scattered brilliants could have given .

		The long series of perfervid erotic poems is justified not only by the great intrinsic beauty of many of the individual pieces but by its outcome the answer of manhood to the self - torturing egoism of adolescence in which such things as `` The Shadow Eater '' are written .

		O many a night has seen my riot candles , And heard the drunken revel of my feast , Till dawn walked up the blue with burning sandals And made me curse the east !

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 139 For my faith was the faith of dusk and riot , The faith of fevered blood and selfish lust ; Until I learned that love is cool and quiet And not akin to dust .

		For once , as in Apocalyptic vision , Above my smoking altars I could see My god 's face , veilless , ugly with derision The shameless , magnified , projected Me !

		And I have left my ancient fanes to crumble , And I have hurled my false gods from the sky ; I wish to know the joy of being humble , To build great Love an altar ere I die .

		There is still abundant egoism in the poetry of Mr.
Neihardt	PERSON	, but perhaps not more than he needs for his self-preservation as a poet in that prairie country in which he lives and sings .

		Out of the great corn land he has drawn the best of his poetry .

		His imagination is luxuriant with the wealth and sun-drowsy with the heat of those vast plains .

		The moulding touch of environment , making al - most everywhere for beauty , normality , and strength , is evident in all his work .

		In a community preoccupied with almost anything but poetry , he was made to feel early in life the `` sin of being different , '' but this has not led him to a vainglorious and romantic in - dulgence in that sin .

		He has not said , with the mock humility of
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, I hand ` mid men my needless head , And my fruit is dreams as theirs is bread .

		On the contrary , when he discovered himself `` doomed to be poet forever , '' he `` longed to be only a man , '' with the `` cosmic curtains drawn . ''

		But this natural revolt has passed away and in the latter work we see the poet quite simply claiming his place among men , without timidity and without bluster .

		This is a triumph in the way of self-mastery almost as rare and difficult as any of Mr.
Neihardt	PERSON	's triumphs in his art .

		As a conse - quence of it , we see the poet everywhere com - pleting the man and the man strengthening the poet , so that in his wildest insurgency there is always a strong back-pull toward nor - mality a core of quiet at the cyclone 's heart .

		Poetry bubbles up for Mr.
Neihardt	PERSON	out of the most casual , chance-met things .

		I rear - range four stanzas from his autobiographical `` Poet 's Town , '' a group of brilliant little lyrics that throb from end to end with a strange music and startle one broad awake with flaming metaphors .

		Those were his fields Elysian : With mystic eyes he saw The sowers planting vision , The reapers gleaning awe .

		Sipper of ancient flagons , Often the lonesome boy Saw in the farmer 's wagons The chariots hurled at Troy .

		Trundling in dust and thunder They rumbled up and down , Laden with princely plunder , Loot of the tragic Town .

		The weird , untempled Makers Pulsed in the things he saw ; The wheat through its virile acres Billowed the Song of Law .

		Mr.
Louis	PERSON	How 's `` A Hidden Well '' shows two main influences at work the poetry of
John Donne	PERSON	and the art of painting .

		This verse is subtle , masculine , intellectual , con - cerned usually with the penumbra of thought and emotion .

		Mr. How stands away from his subject as a painter does , and for the same reasons .

		The mood is always critical , with a touch of austerity .

		Like an able fencer , this poet is agile , alert , always guarding his heart .

		It is natural , therefore , that he should do his best work in the sonnet .

		He gives us several examples of the Spenserian sonnet a form which seems to be very slowly winning the recognition which it deserves .

		In the follow - ing `` Epitaph for a German Soldier '' one sees the main characteristics of the whole group of poems crisp , unerring verse , directness of manner , strong and clear visualization , and the apparent impassivity of a man who really feels deeply .

		He thought his country right and loved her well .

		He marched a hundred miles on bleeding feet , And crouched in puddles with a crust to eat , A bloody crust that had a powder smell .

		He sang to drown the roaring of a shell : The vision in his eyes was very sweet , He saw a flower-bordered German street , And with a clean French bullet-wound he fell .

		And those that loved him never are to know If he was even shovelled in a trench , Grotesque and grim who was their fair delight .

		From that sweet seed but recollections grow ... Without a ray of hatred for the French , He fought for what was wrong , but he was right .

		In Mrs.
Olive Tilford Dargan	PERSON	's series of Shakespearean sonnets , `` The Cycle 's Rim , '' there is distinguished literary workmanship on every page .

		These poems are so close on the trail of a high beauty and of a deep and memorable wisdom that one is drawn back to them again and again with a self-condem - natory feeling that there must be more in them than he has been able to get out .

		I re - member having had that feeling , years ago , with regard to the poetry of
George Meredith	PERSON	, and I know now that my self-condemnation was just .

		In these poems of Mrs.
Dargan	PERSON	's , beyond a doubt , there is the authentic manner in which great work has been accomplished .

		Here , unquestionably , is a fine talent working with a skilful though not a finished technique 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	upon an ample , compelling theme , of univer - sal human interest .

		And yet ... The sonnets are dedicated `` To One Drowned at Sea . ''

		The first twenty-nine deal with the birth , growth , and declaration of love .

		In the thirtieth we learn of the death of the lover .

		From this point on , the move - ment is not unlike that of `` In Memoriam . ''

		The first blind stupor of grief is gradually healed by the beauty of Nature and by the sight of places hallowed by memories of the past .

		This brings a sense of communion with love stronger even than that of old and a new realization of the beauty and richness of life .

		But the .

		mourner stops short , it would seem , with Nature , and is not brought , as in Ten - nyson 's poem , to renewed and increased sym - pathy with mankind .

		In the thirteenth sonnet occurs the line , `` I 've built my Love a cabin on the cliffs . ''

		There it remains to the end .

		The mourner does not learn in the catharsis of sorrow that `` Love is of the val - ley '' but goes on forever `` folding the world away , a weary book . ''

		For this reason the cycle is on a much lower ethical plane than
Tennyson	PERSON	's poem , which has its splendid climax in the line `` I will not shut me from my kind . ''

		Mrs.
Dargan	PERSON	does not justify her choice of the Shakespearean sonnet by achieving greater ease and fluency than are common ! -RCB- '

		found in the stricter forms .

		Scarcely a quatrain is to be found umnarred by awkward inversions and wrenching of normal prose order or by the omission of articles and prepositions .

		This is partly due , apparently , to her somewhat timorous syllable counting and avoidance of elision .

		She prefers , for example , the un - gainly phrase `` on arrow feet '' to the swifter , simpler , easier `` on arrowy feet . ''

		In reading such lines as The clammy shade Of forest doubts clings now like faith that fills Cathedral air when holy touch is laid On saintly kneelers , one cries out for a few particles , if only to loosen the line , make it flow , break the monot - onous metronomic iambi .

		Also , as so fre - quently in reading these sonnets , one cries out for a glimmer of meaning .

		Apparently , to hazard a rash guess , we should be learning something in this passage about `` doubts . ''

		But what we should think about `` doubts , '' whether we should think about them at - all , these are matters hopelessly obscured by a swarm of images whose chief function should have been to clarify and illumine .

		The thought is clogged by blind and bottomless metaphors as the lines are impeded by clut - tering consonants and rigid syllable counting .

		This is not the obscurity legitimate in , if not necessary to , all high lyric utterance .

		If we may for a moment compare this right and needful obscurity to a beautiful musical theme , which may mean many things to many minds , then the sort of obscurity that we have before us will be like the cacophany that re - sults from the sudden striking of all the keys in the octave at one , a sound that can scarcely mean anything to any mind .

		Finally , if these poems have but little music and scarcely a single direct and piercing natural cry , they are sown from end to end with lovely phrases .

		In the very first sonnet we learn what we have to expect in this kind .

		Deep lies thy body , jewel of the sea , Locked down with wave on wave .

		Pearl-drift among The coral towers .

		If thou would ` st choose be gone , What sea-charm then could stay thee , bid thee lie Too deep for cock-crow earth or heaven 's dawn ?

		I have shown this latter passage to several persons among them , Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare and Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	.

		All were delighted with the beautiful phrase `` lie too deep for cock-crow . ''

		But then they saw that `` cock - crow '' is apparently intended as an adjective modifying `` earth '' and they were perplexed as I have been , not only about this phrase but about the entire beautiful disappointing book in which it appears .

		The most pleasing and satisfying volume in this group , all things considered , is `` The Lamp of Poor Souls '' by
Marjorie L. C. Pickthall	PERSON	.

		Most of these poems appeared in Miss
Pickthall	PERSON	's earlier collection , `` A Drift of Pinions , '' which was far less read in the
United States	LOCATION	than it deserved to be .

		Here is another name to be added to the long list of Canadian poets of the last twenty years .

		In music and magic of line , in range and delicacy of imagination ,
Miss Pickthall	LOCATION	yields to none .

		The rarest and finest thing about her poems is their strong clear music .

		Sheer beauty `` about the best thing God invents '' or lets his children discover is here in abundance .

		It should be said that the singing line is notably absent in all the other books I have mentioned , and this , to one who believes that whatever else a poet may do , he must sing , is a sad com - mentary .

		The themes and materials of these poems are as various as the forms .

		They are drawn from many sources Greek ,
Hebrew	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	- ese ,
Irish	LOCATION	, French , Canadian , English .

		The chief sources of literary inspiration seem to have been the works of
Swinburne	PERSON	and of
Bliss Carman	PERSON	.

		There are just two classes of people who have any illusions about the importance of the American theatre : those who are so closely identified with it that they are blinded by its mechanism ; and the great unthinking public who find it fairly entertaining and know noth - ing better .

		One of the former , Mr.
Arthur Edwin Krows	PERSON	, has written a book , `` Play Pro- duction in
America	LOCATION	, '' for the enlightenment of the latter , and unless there is a protest from those of us who are in the theatre , but not of it -LRB- and who , for that reason , know its short - comings and its comparative futility -RRB- , Mr.
Krows	PERSON	and his book and the theatre he ana - lyzes will probably be accepted without ques - tion by the audience for whom he has written .

		In reality , the American theatre has lost its soul in trying to perfect the mechanism through which to express its soul , and no bet - ter proof of that fact can be cited than this volume by Mr.
Krows	PERSON	.

		Like all youthful manifestations of the creative impulse , our theatre has not lacked the imaginative flame , but it has smothered the glow in meddlesome circumstance until most people , like Mr.
Krows	PERSON	, mistake the momentary warmth and flicker of the busybody for the iire of the artist .

		In trying to fashion easy , elaborate , and , above all , profitable channels in which the artist might work , our theatre failed to notice that the artist has tired of awaiting the completion of this fussily com - fortable structure and has gone off by himself to work simply and with struggle and sacrifice , but with the freedom without which there can be no art .

		It is both amusing and pathetic to see a man pore laboriously over an impossible puzzle , and it is with something of these con - flicting but not inhibitory feelings that we read this chronicle of a play on its way from the dramatist to the audience .

		In fact , I kept wondering , through each page and each chap - ter , whether Mr.
Krows	PERSON	would n't wake up to the humor and the pathos of the situation , turn roundly upon the mass of puttering de - tail and smothering red-tape with which our theatre is burdened , and passionately demand a broom to sweep it all away and build anew .

		Surely all this ceremony regarding the intri - cate processes of production ; these profundi - ties doled out to the tasks of the play broker , the play doctor , the scene painter , the stage manager , the electrician , the actor , and the press agent : these painstaking diagrams of all the crafts of the theatre , must be some huge
Gilbertian	PERSON	joke , some mountain of satire , like `` Seven Keys to
Baldpate	LOCATION	, '' which Mr.
Krows	PERSON	would pull down with sardonic glee in the last chapter or in an epilogue , as Mr.
Cohan	PERSON	did in his play .

		Instead , he seems sublimely satisfied , pushing his patient pen to the end , and never looking up to see whether his his - tory is not already out of date and belied by the dawn of another day .

		For another day is dawning .

		Little theatres and community theatres and experimental theatres are not springing up all over this country for nothing .

		Among the many more or less conscious motives of these , institutions , is the desire to get at the heart of this thing called the theatre , ignoring the pretentious and officious rigmarole that makes the produc - tion of a play on Broadway so costly , and , with all its cost , still so uncertain .

		Mr.
Krows	PERSON	can write the `` New Art '' of the theatre in quotation marks a while longer .

		He can sneer at
Gordon Craig	PERSON	and find
Brander Matthews	PERSON	and leering Broadway managers to applaud him .

		He can garble the description of For - tuny lighting until Fortuny is more widely known in this country than he is to-day .

		But he can ill afford to devote a patronizing half - page to the entire revolutionary movement in the American theatre .

		And he can hardly ex - pect to pass muster when he lets such glaring errors run riot in his pages as when he re - fers to the British woman playwright and author 's agent ,
Golding Bright	PERSON	, as a man .

		Mr.
Krows	PERSON	's book is of the same piece and viewpoint as
David Belasco	PERSON	's recent stupid at - tack on the Little and
Community	ORGANIZATION	theatres .

		It is of the type that will not learn , that can - not grow , and that worships that which is , only a little less than that which has been .

		Mr.
Krows	PERSON	and Mr.
Belasco	PERSON	are like the stodgy parent who has built a stiff and stately man - sion and then wonders why his young son 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	Billy would rather play in
Tommy Brown	PERSON	's old barn down the street .

		It is a relief to turn to plays that have found their way into print .

		That is an inter - esting series which Mr.
Alfred A. Knopf	PERSON	has started under the group title , `` Borzoi Plays . ''

		Starting with `` War , '' the relentlessly grim picture of the toll of battle on those at home , by the Russian Artzibashef , the series now includes
Beulah Marie Dix	PERSON	's `` Moloch , '' Lud - wig
Thoma	PERSON	's `` Moral , '' and
Nicolay Gogol	PERSON	's `` The Inspector-General . ''

		The Russian and the American plays born of the world conflict are physically as close and spiritually as far apart as the opposing trenches .

		`` War '' plies no thesis , twists no facts , dangles no puppets .

		`` Moloch '' is hopelessly a preachment , propa - ganda in the theatre at its worst . ' '

		War ' ' gets its tremendous effects by contrasting the hum - drum of life before the struggle with the humdrum of life after the blow has fallen , while `` Moloch '' shrieks and shrieks and shrieks , until you become hoarse listening .

		The other two translated plays are admi - rable of their kind .


Thoma	PERSON	's `` Moral '' is so - cial satire in dramatic form , unpretentious but incisive , not great drama , but good theatre .

		It would hardly do for an American audience because of our inability to under - stand why the investigation of the case and the house and the guests of
Ninon de Hauteville	PERSON	, lady of leisure , should be dropped when the mysterious visitor on the night of the raid turns out to be the prince of the realm .

		Gogol 's famous play , now translated ade - quately for the first time , deserves its un - challenged favor for three-quarters of a century as the greatest Russian comedy .

		It is theatrical , it is obvious this mad tale of grafting Russian officials , and of a penniless spendthrift traveller , who is mistaken for the inspector-general and feted and bribed to the capacity of his pockets .

		But it is irresistible fun .

		Those who are unused to reading plays and imagining their action may wonder at its fame , for four-fifths of the flare of `` The In - spector-General '' refuses to be caught on the printed page .

		Without the change of a line or a character , it should act in our theatre like the farce hit of the year .

		Another play from abroad that has indis - putable merit , is `` La Pecadora '' -LRB- `` Daniela '' -RRB- , from the Spanish of
Angel Guimera	ORGANIZATION	.


Wallace Gillpatrick	PERSON	has translated `` La Pecadora '' and has brought over into English most if not all of the hot and fluid passion of the original .

		Guimera is already known among us for his `` Marta of the Lowlands '' and ``
Maria Rosa	PERSON	, '' and the new play is worthy of the curiosity aroused by its predecessors .

		For acting pur - poses , at least with us , some of the scenes , notably the first half of the first act , would have to be condensed , but it makes easier read - ing as it stands , affording the opportunity to come slowly and surely under the spell of the emotions and the sensibilities of another race .

		Still another note from abroad is the new version of `` The Hour Glass , '' which the Irish poet ,
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	, has included in a new volume of verse , `` Responsibilities . ''

		Of all living playwrights , Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	loves most to - tinker with his past works , and this time it is a case of satisfying his own soul by altering the action of his philosopher !

		American plays are not so heartening .

		`` The Story of Eleusis , '' a lyrical drama by Mr.
Ledoux	PERSON	, may be lyrical , but it is hardly drama , even by the broadest and most lenient definition of drama .

		How these musical , if not deeply passionate , bits of song , strung to - gether by dull and monotonous stretches , could be made effective in a theatre passes belief .

		Mr.
Ledoux	PERSON	is only one more singer who must learn sooner or later , along with
Edgar Lee Masters	PERSON	and the rest , that Greek themes have been done and done forever , and that we have themes of our own crying for discovery by our poets and our playwrights .

		Mr.
Nirdlinger	PERSON	has taken American themes , such as they are , for his `` Four Short Plays , '' but he is n't a poet nor even a good playwright .

		Here is proven - der for vaudeville and probably for unimagin - ative amateurs , but it is all artificial and ' insincere hack work .

		Mr.
Holley	PERSON	has done far better in his `` Read - Aloud Plays , ' * ' a curious little volume of dramatic interludes , some of which create and sustain a genuine atmos - pheric moment , while others seem too de - termined to prove a point .

		Nothing in the volume is better than the opening sketch , `` Her Happiness , '' while `` The Incompatibles '' * is a kind of gauche
Schnitzler	PERSON	.

		There are moments in the others , too , and there is no > reason why some of the plays should n't reach the stage in spite of the author 's intention merely to have them read .

		It is an even greater relief to turn to Ru - pert
Brooke	PERSON	's ``
John Webster	PERSON	and the
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan Drama , '' an essay with which the late British poet won his fellowship at King 's Col - lege ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, in
1913	DATE	.

		For two years we have known what the world of poetry lost in the death of
Brooke	LOCATION	.

		Now we know how the world of criticism has been despoiled .

		A few weeks ago Miss
Laurette Taylor	PERSON	said : `` It would be a shame for anyone to be a critic when he might be a poet . ''

		But there doesn ' t seem to be anything to prevent one from being both .

		One can ' t be a poet all the time at least , not a great poet .

		Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's frequent lapses prove that .

		And a critic can ' t criticize all the time .

		Besides , true criticism demands vision THE DIAL 143 and imagination and insight just as much as poetry .

		That
Brooke	PERSON	had all these qualities in his verse has only made keener his loss .

		That he knew how to apply these same quali - ties to literary criticism is apparent in many pages from this often matter-of-fact essay .

		His genius as a critic was here in the bud a genius that evidently called for greater matur - ity than his poetry .

		But where it does break through , it is unmistakable .

		The chapter on the `` Elizabethan Drama '' is the most vivid , most original , and most thrilling addition in years to a long and distinguished body of comment .

		Speaking of
Kyd	PERSON	and
Marlowe	PERSON	, he says : To say that they grafted the energy of popular tragedy on the form of classical , would be to wrong by a soft metaphor their bloody and vital violence .

		It was rather as if a man should dash two dead babies together into one strident and living being .

		Of the romantic comedies preceding
1600	DATE	, he writes : Neither in themselves , nor as a sign of the taste of the times , have they much value .

		Occasionally they achieve a sort of prettiness , the charm of a stage -
spring	DATE	or an Academy allegory of youth .

		And Shake - speare threw a pink magic over them .

		But it should be left to girls ' schools to think that the comedies he obligingly tossed off exist in the same universe with his later tragedies .

		The whole stuff of this kind of play disguises , sentimentality , girls in boys ' clothes , southern romance was very thin .

		It did not achieve even this success .

		And then , characterizing the period , 1600-10 , the height of the Elizabethan epoch , he writes : Intellect was pressed into the service of the emo - tions , and the emotions were beaten into fantastic figures by the intellect .

		The lust of fame and the desire for immor - tality were racked by a perverse hunger for only oblivion ; and the consummation of human love was observed to take place within the bright , black walls of a flea .

		It seemed as though all thought and all the arts at this time became almost incoherent with the - strain of an inhuman energy within them , and a Titanic reaching for impossible ends .

		Psycho-analysis , originating in the study of the morbid , and developing into a compre - hensive explanation of wit and dreams and all the unintentional movements of every-day life , is now fairly on the way to become also a theory of genius and a philosophy of art .

		The CEdipus story , for instance , has long been regarded as a type of complex , a type appear - ing in such unsuspected places as Shakes - peare 's `` Hamlet . ''

		-LRB- See `` The -LRB- Edipus-Com - plex as an Explanation of Hamlet 's Mystery : A Study in Motive , '' by
Ernest Jones	PERSON	.

		`` American Journal of Psychology , ''
1910	DATE	. -RRB-

		Professor
Freud	PERSON	illustrates the method of psycho-analysis with even more daring in a striking study of Leonardo da
Vinci	PERSON	and his mysteriously smiling feminine beauties .

		The method is briefly this : the subject unconsciously reveals his suppressed desire by an apparently innocent act or word or dream ; the unintentional confession has biological or racial significance , analogies to it being found in mythology and popular superstition ; and the suppression of the desire is shown to be the one essential determining influence in the whole career and achievement of the subject .

		The complete and circumstantial array of evidence makes the argument seem formidable as well as astonishing .

		Inasmuch as the psycho-analyst always finds the sex motive in some form the funda - mental and pervasive influence in a personal - ity ,
Leonardo	PERSON	with his reputation for purity would seem unpromising material , especially in view of the meagre records of his emotional development .

		But for Professor
Freud	PERSON	only one clue was needed , and that was furnished by this innocent note in
Leonardo	LOCATION	's papers : `` It seems that it had been destined before that I should occupy myself so thoroughly with the vulture , for it comes to my mind as a very early memory , when I was still in the cradle , a vulture came down to me , he opened 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	my mouth with his tail and struck me a few times with his tail against rny lips . ''

		A little reflection suggests that this strange infantile memory is an erotic recollection of his nursing days , and that the vulture was really his mother .

		But the question arises as to the reason for this substitution of a vulture for his mother .

		`` A thought now obtrudes itself which seems so remote that one is tempted to ignore it .

		In the sacred hiero - glyphics of the old Egyptians the mother is represented by the picture of the vulture . ''

		The Egyptians also worshipped a `` motherly deity '' with a vulture-like head , called Mut .

		`` We may question whether the sound similar - ity -LSB- sic ! -RSB-

		to our word mother -LRB- Mutter -RRB- is only accidental . ''

		We have still to establish a connection , in an age before hieroglyphics were understood , between
Leonardo	PERSON	and the Egyptian goddess .

		This , however , is not so difficult as it appears .

		From such Greek and Latin writers as
Strabo	PERSON	,
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Ammianus Marcellus	PERSON	,
Horapollo Nilus	PERSON	, and
Hermes Tris	ORGANIZATION	- megistus , we learn that the vulture was a symbol of motherhood .

		`` Unexpectedly we have now reached a point where we can take something as quite probable which only shortly before we had to reject as absurd . ''

		Leonardo being an omnivorous reader , it was quite possible that he should have been acquainted with the Egyptian fable .

		Among the books he read `` there was no lack of older as well as contemporary works treating of natural history .

		All these books were already in print at that time . ''

		It may be worth pausing in this hasty argu - ment to remark that , with the exception of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	's `` Lives '' and one or two fragments , the books mentioned by Professor Freud as possible sources for Leonardo 's vulture were not in print .

		The earliest printing of any of them was the editio princeps of
Strabo	PERSON	, published in
Venice	LOCATION	in
1516	DATE	, when
Leonardo	PERSON	was in
France	LOCATION	in his sixty-fourth year .

		More - over , Professor
Freud	PERSON	's assumption that
Leonardo	PERSON	was an assiduous reader of the
Church Fathers	ORGANIZATION	at a time when few among the
Church Fathers	ORGANIZATION	were widely read even by ecclesiastics , is highly improbable .

		To resume the argument , it is further noticeable that the vulture of Leonardo 's phantasy was , like the Egyptian goddess , androgynous , and that `` the nursing at the mother 's breast was transformed into being nursed , that is into a passive act which thus gives the situation an undoubted homosexual character . ''

		Being an illegitimate child ,
Leonardo	PERSON	very probably passed his early infancy with his mother .

		The absence of the father in this critical period of the develop - ment of the boy is significant .

		We are led to believe in `` a causal connection between
Leonardo	PERSON	's childhood relations to his mother and the later manifest , if only ideal , homo - sexuality '' which Professor Freud thinks that Leonardo showed .

		This bold statement of the theory of Leon - ardo 's emotional development and nature is supported by a multitude of corroborative evidences , each of which , perhaps , is incapable of proof , but `` can lay claim to so many inner probabilities , it agrees so well with everything we know besides about
Leonardo	PERSON	's emotional activity that I can not refrain from accepting it as correct . ''

		One of these details is too important not to be mentioned here .

		Leon - ardo , as is well known , did notable work in investigating the principle of flight in birds , and he prophesied human aviation .

		But his interest was only a concealed Freudian wish .

		Children whose sexual curiosity is aroused dream of flying .

		`` Thus aviation , which has attained its aim in our times , has also its infantile erotic roots . ''

		How does this research help to explain
Leonardo	PERSON	's marvellous paintings of women ?

		The artist was , according to the theory , incap - able of loving any woman but his mother , and one might have expected that the imaginative and intellectual character reflected in his painting and his scientific study was deter - mined by this detachment .

		But such an explanation would be too much in terms of the mental .

		Professor
Freud	PERSON	thinks that `` the laughing women were nothing else but repro - ductions of
Caterina	LOCATION	, his mother , and we are beginning to have an inkling of the possibility that his mother possessed that mysterious smile which he lost , and which fascinated him so much when he found it again in the Flor - entine lady . ''

		As an illustration of the psycho-analytic method , this ingenious theory , tenuously drawn , with frequent disregard for probabil - ity , and leading to such meagre results , is not profoundly impressive .

		It is too much of an attempt to explain a personality in terms of the reflexes of the spinal nerve centre .

		As an interpretation of the
Mona Lisa	PERSON	it is futile to say that she is nothing else but the repro - duction of his mother by a homosexual artist ; she was not painted so blindly , so instinctively as that .

		Let us turn to
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's familiar words : `` Set it a moment beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beautiful women of antiquity , and how would they be troubled by this beauty , into which the soul with all its maladies has passed ! ''

		We begin to under - stand the creative ardor in the mind of the painter who was ever curious and active , both
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL mentally and emotionally , a child of the Italian Renaissance , but who contemplated from afar the perfect serenity of the ancients defuit una mihi symmetria prisca .

		And if one wishes to know what truth is clouded in this `` psychosexual investigation , '' in which an intellectual and artistic career is repre - sented as a `` sublimated '' erotic gratification , he may perhaps find it in the human and imaginative words of Leonardo himself : Cosa bella mortal passa e non I ` arte fair human - ity passes ; art endures .

		`` I am seeking only to face realities , and to face them without soft concealments . ''

		These were the words of President
Wilson	PERSON	not very long ago , and they won a quick response in the hearts of many people , though some of the responders have passed unpleasant hours since .

		To seek realities and to face them with - out soft concealments has long been one of the aims in the world of art , and especially among the writers of novels .

		In my way of think - ing such novels are best worth reading .

		True , there are times when we may well forget that there are such things as realities .

		And even remembering that there are realities , we may sometimes take an innocent pleasure or a decent satisfaction in seeing them softly con - cealed .

		But the spirit of our day leads us to think that , in the long run , the facing of real - ity is the finer thing .

		So thinks , I should say , Mr.
Sidney Dark	PERSON	, who has written `` Afraid . ''

		Not that he is what is called a `` realist , '' but we need not bother much with such ticketings nowadays .

		Mr.
Dark	PERSON	has an idea which he wishes to pre - sent as it is , without the concealments with which it is often surrounded .

		That idea may , perhaps , be guessed from his title .


Jasper Sedley	PERSON	lacked courage ; at least as that quality is usually thought of .

		I confess , to begin with , that I do not like the idea of a man , or a woman either , who lacks courage ; but per - haps that is because I do not think of courage as being merely that power of self-assertion , physical or moral , which is very apt to be without fear or timidity or any other self - distrusting quality .

		Mr.
Dark	PERSON	, however , has a somewhat similar view and so I got on with his story better than I thought I should .

		His central figure ,
Jasper Sedley	PERSON	, as a boy lacked physical courage and even as a man was con - stitutionally unable in many cases to do what he wanted to do , because he was afraid of the consequences .

		The true coinage is to accept yourself , in so far as you are sure you are worth accept - ance .

		To be oneself , to live one 's life , to insist upon one 's own individuality , personal - ity , or originality , these are familiar ideas nowadays , and too often they degenerate in practice into the old-fashioned `` doing as one likes . ''


Sedley	PERSON	, with all his failure in phys - ical courage , did not , at first , succeed in trusting to his own moral nature .

		He ac - cepted himself at first because he felt unable to do anything else , and in time , it would seem , because he almost enjoyed not being what others were .

		It is , of course , Mr.
Dark	PERSON	's idea that he worked out something better .

		Given some such idea , how should one pre - sent it ?

		There are many soft concealments in art even when one has no desire for them .

		Mr.
Dark	PERSON	, if I may trust a first impression , relies too much on vague sentiment and too little on creative imagination .

		Real as may be his idea , I feel a lack of reality in the way he presents it .

		His people are too much the characters needed to enforce his idea , too little actual personalities with whom
Jasper Sedley	PERSON	chanced to come in contact .

		Their talk is too much the thing needed by the development of the idea , too little the natural expression of the feelings they may have had .

		Mr.
Dark	PERSON	explains a good many things which , it would seem , should have been implicit in his people 's act and thought .

		More important than all this , the final event seems suggested by sen - timent rather than a knowledge of what life actually is .

		Mr.
Henry Kitchell Webster	PERSON	has so often qualified as an expert that one needs hardly to explain what he can , and what he can not , do .

		He has not till lately included the effort to face realities .

		In `` The Real Adventure '' he appeared to be doing so , but I did not think he succeeded entirely .

		`` The Thoroughbred '' is a slighter rendering of a similar idea .

		In his book of
last year	DATE	, it will be remembered , Mr.
Webster	PERSON	presented the view that people would get on better in marriage if they rec - ognized that each had a right to be somebody worth while .

		Rose
Aldrich	PERSON	left her husband because she wanted to make something of her - self .


Celia Blair	PERSON	does not find it necessary to leave her husband .

		Her husband having lost his money , there came an impassable barrier in their easy and luxurious early married life .

		Their relations had become such that Alfred 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	thought that what she would naturally do -LRB- and the best thing to do , on the whole -RRB- , would be to go back to her father and mother and live comfortably while he made an effort to win back enough to go on as they had gone before .

		She surprised him by realizing what married life should be , by insisting that they could live together on anything , and also by managing to do it .

		This is a good idea , as good as that of `` The Real Adventure . ''

		If people do live together as
Celia	PERSON	and
Alfred Blair	PERSON	lived , it is probable that a course of living in three small rooms on a small salary would be very good for them .

		A year or so ago there was a similar pair in another novel , and in that case the man carried his family off and they all lived in a cave for a year .

		Mr. `` Web - ster 's couple did not live in a cave , but the principle -LRB- and the result -RRB- was the same .

		Few will quarrel with Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's doctrine .

		But if his doctrine be sound , why admit the du - bious in the demonstration ?


Celia Blair	PERSON	may have been a thoroughbred , but the story of her proceedings is by no means as thorough even as that of her predecessor .

		I can not pretend to know what can be done in furnish - ing a flat and living on
twenty-two dollars	MONEY	and a half a week , but I am unreasonably in - credulous of
Celia	LOCATION	's exploits .

		I am still more incredulous about
Alfred	PERSON	.

		If a month or so after utter failure he could jump from twenty-two-fifty a week to twenty thousand a year , he must have had a very mercurial dis - position to be led ever to imagine that he was down and out .

		The whole thing seems too easy ; there is too much of the superman about it .


Alfred Blair	PERSON	must have had the square jaw , so sure a mark to-day of the man who can do big things .

		One feels that this is the kind of story that grandma tells the children when she thinks that adorning a tale will also point a moral .

		It is perhaps ungrateful to keep de - manding more of Mr.
Webster	PERSON	than he may choose to give .

		Or perhaps it is not choice ; perhaps he is by nature unable to see things as they really are ; perhaps he really does see them in a slightly iridescent mirage .

		But I do not think that is the case .

		I think Mr.
Webster	PERSON	could face realities as well as anyone .

		I think he could write good novels even if he imitated
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	and accepted the universe .

		They would be harder to criticize than those he writes now , but I am sure I , for one , should like them better , though I fear that others in his present audience would not .

		There is no question of facing realities in `` The Beetle , '' whether with soft concealments or without .

		`` The Beetle '' reminds me of a remark which I saw quoted the other day by Mr.
Christian Brinton	PERSON	in writing of the paint - ings of Zuloaga .

		`` La nature , c'est le pre - texte ; 1 ` art est le but . ''

		What more than a pretext can it be when a down-and-out gets into a dark and deserted house and there finds himself in the presence of a disgusting but compelling personality in bed , who forces him to strip naked and then go forth on a mad errand clothed only in a cloak ?

		Can such things be ?

		All will answer that it is of no manner of importance whether they can or not .

		One expects from such a book to sup full with horrors , not on bread and cheese or even on welsh rarebit and mince pie .

		The realistic situation is but the pretext ; the real aim is , shall we say , art or merely thrills ?

		Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	probably troubled himself very little as to which it might be .

		He calls his story a mystery , and although he provides a starting-point with a very realistic setting , and a wind-up with a sufficiently plausible explanation , he evidently attaches little im - portance to either , nor will the reader .

		Once started we proceed with a most extravagant tale in which a brilliant and rising politician , a remarkable scientist and ornament of high society , an attractive daughter of an old con - servative , and an amateur detective are twisted about in a film-like combination of astonishing circumstances , in which we have a confusion of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	magic , modern science , plain clamminess , and logical deductions , that leaves us no time to think .

		There will be those who would like to have a little more reality as they go on .

		Certainly the characters are rather puppet-like and their conversation often reminds one of the fiction of a hundred years ago .

		Perhaps the mind that likes to imagine a complicated web of extraordinary excitement is really unable to imagine actual men and women with suffi - cient vividness to give us much of an impres - sion of them .

		Even the creation of actual men and women , acting and talking as people actually do act and talk , seems a little tame when it gets mixed up with mesmerism and magic , with having a great beetle come climb - ing up you while you are in bed or a visitor vanishing while you are talking to him .

		So with the reader ; perhaps the reader who fol - lows intently the dreadful possibilities of hav - ing a person whom he likes subjected to name - less atrocities and then sacrificed to the God - dess
Isis	ORGANIZATION	, could not appreciate the stolidity and even stupidity of actual people living from day to day .

		One 's mind , perhaps , takes in only just so much .

		Still , I believe I could take in more than Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	seems to think I could .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 147 Is it a purely critical affectation to feel that these books are not good because they lack reality , because they do not try to convey the impression of life , but are content to give an idea or to tell a story ?

		What does it matter , one may say , if you have a good idea like Mr.
Dark	PERSON	's , or a good story like Mr.
Marsh	PERSON	's , or both like Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's , what does it matter if the characters be not absolutely like life , the conversations not very natural , the general impression not much like that of the actual world in which we live ?

		The story is the thing , after all , or the idea is the thing .

		Is it a dry-as-dust pedantry that says the idea is good or the story is good , but that the book is not good from the critical standpoint ?

		I think not , naturally .

		Of course there are times when anybody may like to read a good thriller like `` The Beetle , '' a pretty fairy-story like `` The Thoroughbred , '' a bit of sentimen - tality like `` Afraid . ''

		But from no critical standpoint , from the standpoint merely of common sense , I can see a considerable bar to anything further .

		There is an often-quoted remark of
Bentley	LOCATION	's about Pope 's translation of Homer : `` A very pretty poem , but you must n't call it Homer . ''

		Bentley was a great student of Greek , but he probably did not know more of Homer than most of us know of life .

		And when we say , `` A very pretty story , but you must n't call it life , '' there creeps into your enjoyment a feeling that is better away .

Valerie Sarton	PERSON	, an enchanting , fair-haired waif , was deserted in
London	LOCATION	by a self-indulgent parent and adopted perforce by the penniless
Blaise Barewski	PERSON	, who took her to live with a genial French landlady down an alley-way off Shaftesbury Avenue .

		Dur - ing the years that followed , until her eighteenth birthday ,
Blaise	PERSON	supported her and cared for her with the devotion of elder brother and mother combined .

		Then he discovered that he loved her , and upon the discovery sent her off to school in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		All this is charmingly described ; the ear - lier part of the book marks its writer as one of more than average talent and imagination .

		Va - lerie 's first romance and her tragic disillusionment are related with equal poignancy .

		But
Valerie	PERSON	deserted , spurning her lover , yet facing the future without resolution and without courage , ceases to be real .

		One reads through a sort of haze of her marriage with the trusting
Blaise	PERSON	, of her subse - quent falterings and subterfuges and follies , of her final milk-and-water repentance , and her shal - low sufferings .

		They lack any real bite .

		Was the author not great enough to grasp the opportunities of her subject , or was her inspira - tion exhausted , as seems to be so often the case , by her really good opening chapters ?

		Ev - idently one should be thankful for the rare pleas - ures rather than disturbed by the frequent disappointments of modern English fiction .

		The child
Valerie	PERSON	, and
Valerie	PERSON	in the first awakening of love ,
Blaise	PERSON	as pawnbroker 's assistant on thirty shillings a week , the black-and-tan
Henry	PERSON	, the voluble , devoted Tante , and that carefree gentle - man , the father of
Valerie	PERSON	, are all things to be thankful for .

		The novel remains , in spite of expectations unfulfilled , more than relatively good .

		`` Why torture yourself with such a recapitula - tion ?

		Let it wait until after we are married .

		Give yourself to the present , Isabel . ''

		What novel built around these words could fail to stimulate popular interest ?

		They have been the starting - point for a thousand tragedies , in fiction .

		The book which contains them is impregnated rather with associations and reminiscences of literature than of life ; it would take a very great author indeed to make them ring with the conviction of reality .


Victoria Morton	PERSON	, author of `` The Whirl - pool '' -LRB- E. P. Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is not a great author ; she is only a good author who constructs her novel with energy , and with an apparent feeling for the values of fictional material .

		For such an author , she is surprisingly melodramatic .

		As for the story , it is hardly necessary to say that Isabel , alias Bella Cavallo , did give herself `` to the present . ''

		Her husband , the Judge , did not dis - cover until their marriage was many weeks old that
Isabel	PERSON	was the Bella Cavallo who had come before him ten years earlier in a celebrated murder case and had been committed by him to the reform - atory .

		She appeared to him for the second time in the northern woods , a veritable angel come to rescue him from the horrors of approaching insan - ity .

		Sentimentality and melodrama mar the work of this author , who might , one feels sure , do some - thing better .

		Mary , quite natur - ally , chose forthwith the most impecunious man of her acquaintance , the patient aforementioned , to fall in love with , with what result , the reader who ventures to open the rather sentimental little volume will speedily learn .

		It is what the pub - lishers quite appropriately term `` a sweet story . ''

Randall	PERSON	was not actually glad that he had to wear a brace , but under the influence of his friend Mr.
Jonas	PERSON	, the one-legged war veteran who was normally , we trust , a rather jolly soul , he showed a disposition toward conscious cheer-giving that was unnatural in a youngster of his age , sex , and general normality .

		Limpy learned in the end that being lame of body does not necessarily imply mental lameness , and the reader feels a genuine interest in his struggles and in this final victory over his own sensitiveness .

		The author has a realistic and amusing manner of displaying his knowledge of boy nature .

		What with having to wear tight skirts a month after full skirts are `` in , '' and having to wear tango curls after tango curls are long , long `` out , '' and what with trying to make - the cook do her bit by eating margarine instead of butter , and the War Office do its obvious duty in paying Zeppelin insurance for the ruined ceilings when

		Maria on the subject of every - thing under heaven from war hens to submarines is a genuine comedy character , and one imagines that there may be not a little truth , however exag - gerated , in the picture of

		The heroine of `` Jimmy 's Wife , '' by
Jessie Champion	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Lane ;

		Jimmy had mar - ried and subsequently separated from a lady who exacted the promise that he should never openly recognize her if they met in the future .

		The vil - lage parson 's wife , who tells the story , being con - versant with
Jimmy	PERSON	's past , has reason to suspect that two different and equally charming persons are in love with her friend .

		Which , if either , is
Jimmy	LOCATION	's wife ?

		Which , if either , does he love ?

		What will the other do about it ?

		These are a few of the questions that harass tne poor parson 's wife and the reader who takes up her narrative .

		Such a sub-title as `` An Autobiographical Frag - ment '' can not fail to intrigue one 's interest , and it is not necessary to venture far into `` Philoso - phy , '' as
Henrie Waste	ORGANIZATION	has pleased to entitle her `` fragment , '' to appreciate the genuineness of the revelations recorded .

		There is about this book a quality of freshness and vividness which will hold the general reader 's interest even through the pas - sages of philosophical analysis and research .

		Tew who read will have the same enthusiasm as the author had for her studies at
Freiburg	LOCATION	, but her enthusiasm for intellectual exploration , the struggle between her intellectual self and her emotional self , and the gradual ascendency of the one over the other , are recorded with so infectious a charm that it is all unusually good reading .


Henrie Waste	ORGANIZATION	has a rare humor and the happy faculty of laughing 1 at herself just when even the most sympathetic reader wishes to indulge a laugh at her expense .

		The real awakening of her emotional self came when she discovered

		If those who are clamoring so loudly for `` pre - paredness '' in our country would read this story of military life , `` The Duel '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , perhaps they would analyze a little more closely than usual some of the remoter consequences of militarism .

		No more biting satire either of the stultifying effect of `` discipline , '' or of the officer 's character and pursuits , or of the empty misery of the men , has been drawn anywhere ; yet the picture is not overdrawn it bears evidence of truth on every page .

		The hero ,
Romashov	PERSON	, is one of the dreamers who abound in Russian fiction , not at all a Hamlet , as the publishers ' advertise - ment proclaims him , but a soft-hearted , helplessly impractical sentimentalist , absolutely out of place among the self-seeking egoists and ferocious brutes who surround him in the barracks .

		The woman he loves , like all the women he meets , is hard and ambitious , capable of sending him to his death in the duel with her husband which he long tries feebly to avoid .

		But the reader is not allowed to pity
Romashov	LOCATION	; Kuprin makes him more ridic - ulous than pitiable through an almost mercilessly witty portrayal , reminding one more of French than of Russian art .

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	, indeed , might have been responsible for the slyly con - temptuous , the cynically revealing description of the camp and its inhabitants which the first chap - ters give .

		On the whole , however , the great Frenchman 's dish is more highly seasoned than the Russian 's ; he could never write a popular book , and `` The Duel '' may become , and deserves to be , a popular

		THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE : An Introduction to Literary Criticism .

		By
D. W. Rannie	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The scope of Mr.
Rannie	PERSON	's book is truly tre - mendous .

		In a little more than three hundred pages , he discusses , or mentions , everything that lies between commas and fitness in epic poetry , with much extraneous matter .

		By consequence , the book suffers from a rather woeful confusion and dilution of ideas .

		Why , for instance , should sections on punctuation which are either inade - quate or wrong be unequally yoked with remarks on metaphorical language which are mostly pointless ?

		What illumination is there in being told that chapters are either named or unnamed ?

		Or what good can it do anybody any beginner at least to learn `` fundamental '' distinctions be - tween prose and poetry which may be contradicted from every great classic that comes to mind ?

		Pearls of wisdom like the following drop freely from Mr.
Rannie	PERSON	's lips : `` All plays require char - acter-drawing ; some require a great deal '' ; or `` The Round Table ' is non-metrical , ` The Table Round ' is metrical ; the first order is prose , the second poetry . ''

		It is a severe thing to say , but such profundities not unfairly represent the intel - lectual quality of the entire book .

		The author 's intentions are obviously good ; but he really helps no sort of reader or student to begin to criticize anything with just confidence and point ; and he does not throw much light upon any of the legion of topics he conjures up .

		SLAVERY IN GERMANIC SOCIETY DURING THE MIDDLE AGES .

		By
Agnes Mathilde Wergeland	PERSON	.


University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Among the students of life and civilization in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, the late Dr.
Wergeland	PERSON	held a high and honored place .

		The circumstances of her work as professor of history at the
University of Wyoming	ORGANIZATION	made it difficult for her to carry any extensive work to completion ; but her occasional contributions to journals devoted to the social sciences showed that she possessed wide informa - tion , rare scholarship , and keen insight into the life of the mediaeval past .

		Her friends , wishing to do something that should `` aid to perpetuate her memory in a way she would have especially liked , '' decided to publish one of her more impor - tant contributions in the form of a book , and se - lected a paper on `` Slavery in Germanic Society during the Middle Ages , '' which appeared some years ago in the `` Journal of Political Economy . ''

		The paper makes a small volume of 158 pages ; but it is the only discussion that covers the entire field of mediaeval slavery , and the only work that gives proper attention to the legal aspects of this institution in the Scandinavian lands , where Ger - manic society persisted longest in its heathen form .

		Dr.
Wergeland	PERSON	presents her materials under three heads : reduction into slavery , amelioration of slavery , and liberation .

		On all these points she contributes much valuable information and re - moves many misconceptions .

		The Church , for in - stance , has long been credited with an abiding enthusiasm for emancipation ; but the author finds that the churchmen , who also felt the need of cheap labor , took a greater interest in the liberation of the slaves of others than of their own .

		Dr.
J. Franklin Jameson	PERSON	contributes a preface , in which he writes with appreciation of the author and her work for history .

		TIGER LAND .

		By
C. E. Gouldsbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dutton ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Those who read Mr.
Gouldsbury	PERSON	's `` Life in the Indian Police '' will need no urging to take up this latest book of his , which deals with the chief sport - ing incidents of his long life in
Bengal	LOCATION	.

		He is an authority in his way , a man totally devoid of boastfulness , who has led an interesting , manly , highly useful life and now in -LRB- let us hope , pen - sioned ! -RRB-

		middle age sits down to tell us all about it .

		From the time when he went to sea as a stow - away -LRB- and was thoroughly thrashed by half the ship 's company -RRB- , his life has been one long adven - ture , for he joined the Indian Police in Mutiny days and stayed with them until `` time-expired . ''

		And with the possible exception of railway men in early construction days , and here and there a forest officer or two , no man in the world may see such sport as the officer of
Indian Police	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is plainly written , for this is not a man who has had time to dabble in art .

		His own adventures are much the best ; those he relates of others , at second hand , bear here and there the taint of sus - picion ; fortunately , far the greater part of the book is taken up with accounts of things he him - self saw and very often slew .

		Unlike so many books on `` sport , '' this one will not nauseate the reader with accounts of the butchery of helpless things .

		Tigers , panthers , and leopards seem to have been the only animals whose execution gave Mr.
Gouldsbury	PERSON	much joy , and although he did shoot bison and ibex and a sambur now and then , he escapes the charge of being a butcher by a very wide margin .

		In fact , one turns the last page with a feeling of contentment that there are such men after all , and of hope that in spite of the advertised attainments of rich modern `` Nim - rods , '' his mantle of modesty and restraint may have fallen on younger shoulders .

		Of another generation , Mr.
Gouldsbury	PERSON	does not pretend to write of
India	LOCATION	, or even of
Bengal	LOCATION	, as it is to-day ; for
India	LOCATION	is changing faster than he likes , or than the world likes to believe .

		But he tells a good story , like a gentleman who knows .

		More - over , he does know .

		To the man in an armchair who asks to for , get himself and be some other man , to live forty exciting years in the space of a few hours , he comes with the necessary spell .

		Since it takes forty years of good work to learn the secret of that spell , let us hope that , unlike the rifle recently discarded in
India	LOCATION	`` for ever and ever and ever , '' Mr.
Gouldsbury	PERSON	has not laid down his pen , but that he may write many more such reminiscences , without an unkind word or mean thought from cover to cover but with the truth and strength of that rare gift , sportsmanship .

		150 THE DIAL -LSB-
February 22	DATE	CREATIVE INVOLUTIONS By
Cora L. Williams	PERSON	.

		Alfred Knopf ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Miss
Cora L. Williams	PERSON	is a teacher of mathe - matics .

		Looking at the non-mathematical world about her has persuaded her that men and other living creatures live in groups and societies and that these groups and societies have qualities which individuals do not have .

		The qualities are such as make societies super-individuals that bear the same relation to individuals as the body does to the cells that compose it .

		Miss
Williams	ORGANIZATION	seems to have discovered this entirely by herself and she thinks that her discovery is new .

		She has been so overwhelmed by it that she has acquired a mystic regard for it .

		She calls it `` creative involu - tion '' and opposes it to `` creative evolution , '' in a language which is involved , obscure , dithyrambic , sacerdotal .

		The mystification she achieves becomes more than linguistic through her use of one of the romantic imaginings of the mathematicians the theory of a fourth dimension .

		Diction and
Fourth Dimension	ORGANIZATION	seem to have made an impression on ' Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	, who writes an introduction to the book .

		Those who are fond of mythology will find something to their taste therein .

		`` MADEMOISELLE
Miss.	LOCATION	''
W. A. Butterfield	PERSON	; 50 cts .

		This small volume of letters written by an Amer - ican girl serving with the rank of lieutenant in a
French Army Hospital	ORGANIZATION	at the front , is one of the most vivid contributions to war literature that the reviewer has read .

		Written as they were with no thought of publication , they are entirely free from all journalistic exaggeration or pose , unadulterated by any attempt at `` fine '' writing .

		They not only depict the simple and undramatic routine of hos - pital life within sound of the firing line , but con - vey also an extraordinarily intimate and glowing sense of the spirit of the wounded and the nurses .

		It is difficult for us at this distance to understand that human nature is much the same in the pres - ence of the nightmare horror of war perhaps not quite the same either , for the conviction which inspires men to risk their lives for a cause also inspires in them a calm hardihood , even a gaiety , in the experience of physical suffering .

		It is this superb note of spiritual exhilaration which char - acterizes these letters .

		No one can read them with - out being profoundly moved , even chastened .

		The proceeds of the sale of the book go to the Amer - ican Fund for French Wounded .

		This fact is sufficient reason why every American should buy a copy , but the exquisite quality of this letter - record will be a reason for treasuring and reread - ing it .

		THE SPELL OP THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS AND THE PHILIPPINES .

		By
Isabel Anderson	PERSON	.

		Page ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Four visits to the
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	and an ex - tended tour of the
Philippines	LOCATION	have qualified Mrs.
Anderson	PERSON	to write with first-hand knowledge of their peculiar attractions .

		Her pen reproduces much of the atmosphere of those
Pacific	LOCATION	posses - sions of ours , and does it in a manner of which only a bright and observant and firmly susceptible woman is mistress .

		Well drawn is the contrast between that paradise in the
Pacific	LOCATION	, that play - ground of the world , which was annexed to the
United States	ORGANIZATION	eighteen years ago , and those more distant , less easily assimilated islands that came under our flag about the same time .

		A third of the book is given to the nearer and better-known group of islands , two-thirds to the more distant and still unfamiliar archipelago .

		The lure of
Hawaii	LOCATION	exerts itself upon the reader , who is told that `` the temperature averages about 73 degrees .

		The trade winds blowing from the northeast across the
Pacific	LOCATION	are refreshing as well as the tiny showers , which follow you up and down the streets .

		There is not a poisonous vine or a snake , or any other creature more harmful than the bee . ''

		Every prospect pleases , and not even man is vile , in Mrs.
Anderson	PERSON	's pages .

		Philippine attractions , too , arc - not inconsiderable .

		Even the domestic animals fare sumptuously , as appears from the following : `` Pigs are kept by the Filipinos , and are put on a raised platform for about six weeks before kill - ing , so as to keep them clean and fatten them with good food .

		Salads , crawfish and trout , as well as cocoanut milks , red wine and wild coffee , are among the things they live on . ''

		Think of it !

		Yet it should be added that there is more than a pos - sibility that `` they '' refers , not to `` pigs , '' but to `` Filipinos . ''

		THE SPELL OP
SCOTLAND	LOCATION	.

		By
Keith Clark	PERSON	.

		Page ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Of Scottish ancestry and imbued with a true affection for his ancestral home , Mr.
Clark	PERSON	writes enthusiastically of `` The Spell of
Scotland	LOCATION	'' in the notable `` Spell Series '' now numbering not far from a score of volumes .

		To him the Scottish capital , the `` Empress of the North , '' is `` the most beautiful , the most romantic , the singular city of the world . ''

		To him
Edinburgh	LOCATION	is `` lovely , '' and `` the chalice of romance has been lifted for cen - turies on the high altar of her situation . ''

		But
Aberdeen	PERSON	, too , is a fair city , `` a dignified and an extraordinarily clean city . ''


Marischal College	ORGANIZATION	, `` founded by the Keiths , who were
Earl Mari	PERSON	- schals , '' naturally stirs the
Keith	PERSON	blood in Mr.
Keith Clark	PERSON	's veins .

		The chief attractions of
Scot	PERSON	- land are agreeably brought to our attention in the eleven chapters of the book , even the Hebrides , but apparently not
the Orkney	LOCATION	or the
Shetland Islands	LOCATION	, being included in the author 's tour of the kingdom .

		Literary allusion and quotation , with a sufficiency of history for popular liking , enrich the descriptions , which are made more vivid still by frequent illustrations from photographs and other sources and eight colored plates of much beauty .

		Appended is a bibliography which , without being comprehensive , is so widely inclusive as to take in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` Macbeth , ''
Wesley	PERSON	's journal , Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's `` Puck of
Pook	PERSON	's Hill , '' Black 's `` Strange Adventures of a Phaeton , '' and other pieces of literature that one might not look for in such a list , but is not at all displeased at finding there .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 151 THE SOCIAL CRITICISM OF LITERATURE .

		By
Gertrude M. Buck	PERSON	.


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Miss Buck 's short monograph is an attempt to resolve `` The Muddle of Criticism '' into rational order and end the long war of critical theories in the active peace of cooperation .

		She reduces the several kinds of criticism to three stages in the critical process : the critical reading and inter - pretation of literature in the light of all relevant facts about it ; the formulation of a body of laws derived from this reading ; and the ranking of particular pieces of literature on the basis of these discovered laws ; that is `` critical reading , '' `` crit - ical theory , '' and `` critical judgment . ''

		`` The larger criticism , '' which merges in itself the criti - cism of the various schools , has given us `` one priceless possession a vitalized , democratized con - ception of literature . ''

		To the modern critic `` a book can never again be a barren , finished product , a scholastic abstraction , but a living activity of more than writer and reader , a genuine function of the social body . ''

		It is no longer art for art 's sake but art for life 's sake .

		Literature is a primary means by which the race advances , and `` the critic 's function is to further this advance by facilitating the interaction of literature with society '' ; his aim is `` to make his expressed judgments of books thus provocative of genuine reading rather than in any degree a substitute for it . ''

		For literature is noth - ing to an individual till it becomes his own experi - ence ; criticism can not be vicarious .

		The critic must `` heighten the reader 's conscious life by in - creasing his capacity to read . ''

		The reader 's reac - tion to literature in his own life and in the life of the community is the concern of the critic and not a dry and meaningless formulation of rules and degrees of excellence for the bewilderment of an unsophisticated public .

		FAMOUS SCULPTURE .

		By
Charles L. Barstow	PERSON	.


Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		The third and last in this series of elementary art manuals follows the plan of Mr.
Barstow	PERSON	's `` Famous Pictures '' and `` Famous Buildings '' in giving only general outlines and salient features .

		First comes a preliminary chapter of not too tech - nical instruction , then chapters on ancient sculp - ture , followed by others on mediaeval , renaissance , and modern sculpture , with a brief view of sculp - ture in
America	LOCATION	and , finally , a rapid `` journey through Sculpture Land '' or some of the famous galleries and palaces where famous examples of this form of art are on exhibition .

		A pronounc - ing vocabulary , a glossary , and an index complete the work .

		The necessarily brief survey of Amer - ican sculpture confines itself , rather unaccountably , to short notices of
Rinehart	PERSON	and
St. Gaudens	LOCATION	, with two pages of more general matter .

		The commendatory mention of Powers and his Greek Slave , without qualifying comment , is a little sur - prising in a twentieth-century art critic , even in an uncritical elementary treatise .

		Many half-tone illustrations , mostly small and useful only as sug - gestions , help to give interest to the reading matter .

		DISEASES OF OCCUPATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL HYGIENE .

		By
George M. Kober	PERSON	and
William C. Hanson	PERSON	.

		Blackiston ;
$ 8	MONEY	.

		The development of the modern factory system and the specialization of labor in conjunction therewith have created many new hazards and dangers to the health of operatives , which result in the increase , on the one hand , of well known types of disease among persons employed in some occupations , and on the other , in the origin of new and peculiar types among employees in other fields .

		In the present volume we find an encyclo - paedic treatment of these subjects in which the socialization of medicine in its preventive aspects has made such rapid progress in recent years .

		Everything from hammerman 's to writer 's cramp , and from paraffin itch to furrier 's asthma , finds a place in the discussion of diseases incident to the extremely varied occupations into which mod - ern industry has diversified labor .

		Not only the history and incidence of vocational diseases are given , but also their symptomology , pathology , and treatment .

		This part is written by specialists of international reputation , and is designed for physicians , medical and legal experts , and insur - ance examiners desiring technical information .

		The second part of the work deals with the cause and prevention of diseases and accidents in a long list of occupations .

		Especial attention is given to the prevention of disease in the light of the experience gained by the various state bureaus for factory and workshop inspection , state commis - sions on occupational diseases , safety councils , and state and private industrial insurance bureaus .

		This part is of especial value to employers , nurses , social workers , and legislators .

		The third part is concerned with the legislative and administrative aspects of the subject , and is designed for the investigator , the official , and the organizer of legal and social movements to control , eliminate , and ameliorate the hazards to the health of the worker resulting from industry .

		The work has more than thirty collaborators , each a specialist in the treatment of some form of vocational disease , or experienced in the administration of factory in - spection or in public health service .

		Of general interest to social workers are the .

		chapters dealing with fatigue and occupation , the use and fallacies of statistics , the protection and the promotion ol women wage earners , the exclusion of minors from injurious and dangerous occupations , and effective legislation and administration .

		The chapter by the chief editor on the etiology and prophylaxis of occupational diseases has valuable discussions of dust prevention , light , temperature , humidity , food , posture , overwork and fatigue , speeding up , welfare measures , governmental activities , housing , hygiene , diet for laborers , alcohol and tobacco .

		The book is a mine of information , condensed , well-ordered , and authentic .

		It will be a useful addition to ' every library accessible to working men , a valuable adjunct for the physician and specialist in vocational diseases , and an indispen - sable aid to the social worker and employer inter - ested in the betterment of the conditions of labor .

		After the lapse of thirteen years , Mr.
Louis	PERSON	F. Post presents a third edition of his `` Ethics of Democracy '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		It has a cer - tain interest , of course , but mainly as an effort to steal fire from the fountains of the past to scarify the present .

		Amid the fall of systems and the clash of empires , one may be forgiven just the suspicion of a smile when one reads that `` where that -LSB- the land monopoly -RSB- flourishes , equal rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , are inevitably overthrown . ''

		Yet , despite sectarianism , Mr.
Post	PERSON	redeems himself by a pervasive spirit of love for human kind .

		Had his intellect something of the insight of his emotions , his book would be less exasperating .

		Nevertheless , it contrives to be an excellent irritant .

		There is an undeniable charm in `` The Flower - Patch Among the Hills , '' by
Flora Klickmann	PERSON	, sketches of garden making and housekeeping on the crest of a hill above the river Wye , overlook - ing
Tintern Abbey	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are the sort of thing which will appeal to those in whom the love of gardens is an instinct , and they will supply many a pleasant hour with homely gossip .

		It is not a book for the expert garden enthusiast , for it occupies itself entirely with the chatter inspired by the riot and quaintness of cottage gardens .

		Had the author been content to confine her writings to her garden and omitted the lengthy passages which deal with unwelcome visitors , the interest of the book would have been uninterrupted .

		She writes best of what she loves best , and flowers rather than humanity are her happiest inspiration .

George Frederick Kunz	PERSON	's handsome volume `` Rings '' -LRB-
Lippincott	LOCATION	;
$ 6.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The author has handled a large amount of detailed information in such a way as to make it most easily available for those interested in any particular feature of the subject .

		He has treated the , origin of rings , the several purposes of ring wearing , and the vari - ous methods and fashions in wearing .

		Special chapters are devoted to the materials of which rings were fashioned in ancient times , to signet rings , interesting historic rings , betrothal and wedding rings and love tokens , the religious use and significance of rings , the magic virtues of rings , the use of rings in healing , and present - day ring making .

		The volume is elaborately illus - trated with 290 cuts in color , doubletone , and line .

Norman Foerster	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		, is a companion volume to Professor
C. H. Page	PERSON	's `` The Chief American Poets '' ; and like it , is intended primarily for use with college classes .

		It brings together a total of thirty-eight selections from the works of the nine American writers whom the editor holds to have become , `` by common consent , the American prose classics '' :
Franklin	PERSON	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Cooper	PERSON	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	, Low - ell , and
Holmes	PERSON	.

		Little fault can be found with
Professor Foerster	ORGANIZATION	's selection of materials .

		Most of the specimens , moreover , are complete ; and some are now made accessible , in textbook form , for the first time .

		In one respect the volume suffers in comparison with Professor Page 's anthology : it is without biographical sketches of the authors represented ; but in all other par - ticulars the editing has been admirably done .

		Unwritten dictionaries still offer occupation a - plenty to lexicographers .

		One of these hitherto uncompiled lexicons suggested itself twenty-two years ago to an alert and receptive intelligence , and the result is that we have to-day
Wilstach	PERSON	's `` Dictionary of Similes '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- to the exceeding joy of all lovers of the pithy and the piquant in verbal expression .

		All the world knows the phrase , `` as handy as a pocket in a shirt '' -LRB- where , in fact , a pocket would be decidedly unhandy -RRB- ; but how much more pictur - esque , more undeniably apt , is Mr.
Wilstach	PERSON	's simile , `` as handy as a poker in hell '' !

		`` As dis - honest as a gas meter , '' `` as friendless as an alarm clock , '' and `` as shy as a submarine '' are other pregnant examples .

		`` As busy as a one-armed paper-hanger with the hives '' will appeal to any - one who has ever attempted mural decoration with paste and paper in a frame of mind or body that did not admit of undivided application to the task in hand .

		As every reader of Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	knows , Eng - lish society possesses a `` system . ''

		To see it to full advantage , one must see it from the inside .

		No better guide could be found than the Right Hon.
George W. E. Russell	PERSON	, the son of a Lord , the grandson of a
Duke	ORGANIZATION	, and , in addition , himself a dis - tinguished figure in public life on his own merits .

		In his `` Portraits of the Seventies '' -LRB- Scribner ;
$ 3.75	MONEY	-RRB- he has presented recollections of the leaders of Victorianism , when Victorianism was at its zenith .

		It would be difficult to find a more enter - taining , even enthralling volume .

		It is replete with anecdote , `` inside '' information , and first-hand appreciation of such political leaders as
Lord Beaconsfield	LOCATION	, Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	,
Lord Hartington	PERSON	, Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	,
Lord Randolph Churchill	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.

		This elaborate and unique book of more than 500 pages is the work of a true scholar , however limited its appeal .

		It appears that the most striking feature of
Moham	LOCATION	- medan financial theory is its distinctly dual nature .

		Public revenue is sharply divided into religious and secular sorts , with many devious and some - times amusing complications .

		Certain kinds of property are religious , and the payment of rev - enue on this kind of property is a religious cere - mony .

		The secular taxes are a purely civil obliga - tion , for the collection of which entirely different machinery is set in motion .

		There are many stimulating ideas contained in `` The Judgment of the Orient '' -LRB- Button ; 60 cts . -RRB-

		.

		The book consists of remarks on the war made by K'ung Yuan Ku ` suh , edited and translated by
Ambrose Pratt	PERSON	.

		The opinions recorded have a rapier-like penetration and can not fail to be a source of satisfaction to those who have the cause of the allies at heart .

		A few of them are : `` The Germans have large and highly cultivated brains , small and imperfectly developed minds . ''

		`` The Italians seem to me an old race a race that has matured its every faculty and allowed some of its finer spiritual attributes to mortify . ''

		To
France	LOCATION	: `` Do not ask for pity .

		Your right is to be praised . ''

		`` The Russian people can be humbled only by their kind . ''

		Of the soul of

		`` Did you know that souls have sex as well as stature ?

		`` The psychological genesis of the war between

		A set of three small volumes by Dr.

		While not notable in form or treatment , they will serve as a survey of the field in intelligible analysis and description .

		Keeping fairly away from the pronounced insanities , they cover the functional liabilities : the fears , despon - dencies , loss of control , insomnia , exhaustion , dis - qualifications , and minor ailments .

		Methods of treatment through mental appeal and a proper regimen are set forth , and illustrative cases appended .

		The volume upon abnormal children naturally follows a different course , and deals with defect , the dangers of development , the pre - cocities and instabilities of temperament .

		Dr.
Hollander	PERSON	is an adherent of a revived and scien - tifically revised doctrine of localization , similar to the phrenological assumptions ; but this aspect of his convictions only occasionally mars the per - spective of his presentations .

		196 NEW FORMS OF SHORT FICTION .

		The conditions under which the acted drama has been produced in different ages have come to be pretty well understood .

		The Greek theatres , however shattered and frag - mental , have had their general dispositions made clear .

		Moliere 's data his four trestles and a passion , along with a court audience are fully comprehended .

		The Elizabethan stage , thanks to the studies of Mr.
J. Brander Matthews	PERSON	and others , has issued from the dusk of conjecture and from the deeper dusk of ignorance which did not even realize that there was anything in particular to conjecture about .

		It is now clearly understood that the details of playwriting and of play-producing have been greatly conditioned everywhere by the mere physical and mechanical means of publicity .

		Some similar effort might be made on be - half of fiction , ought to be made , in fact , if the character and aspect of much of the light reading of to-day is properly to be appre - hended and appraised .

		How , in fact , have the modern equivalents for the choral altar and the inn courtyard , so to speak , made their in - fluence felt ?

		The fiction of the daily news - paper , of some of the weekly periodicals , even that of the `` movies , '' will be seen in a differ - ent and juster light if the conditions govern - ing publication are more clearly kept in view .

		The serial published in monthly instalments somehow still holds its place .

		It seems the lineal descendant of those novels by
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	which , during the '40 's , first saw the light in monthly `` parts . ''

		In days when the stately quarterlies held the first place in the public attention and esteem , the month did not seem a large unit of time .

		But the weekly and the daily have made the month a small eternity .

		The monthly serial still lumbers along , but its goal seems all the time to be the bound volume or book publication .

		In one of these forms the magazine serial reconquers , in this day of short-breathed haste , its interrupted continuity , overcomes the disjointing of its consecutiveness .

		The most striking example of fiction con - 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	ditioned by method of publication is to be found in the daily press .

		This type of fiction concerns itself most with the hitches and drawbacks of married life .

		One distressful couple , with subordinate figures and occa - sional simple changes of scene , quite suffices .

		Marion and
Wilbur	PERSON	appear daily , to the ex - tent of a column or so .

		The wife may be flighty and extravagant , the husband grave and patient .

		Or
Wilbur	PERSON	may be dogged , un - gracious , inconsiderate , and
Marion	PERSON	sensitive and plaintive .

		Thus through every week-day of the year , with each section of the story more or less independent and self-sufficing .

		You go off for a week to
New York	LOCATION	, or for a month to
San Francisco	LOCATION	, or for a year to the Pole , and when you return
Marion	PERSON	and
Wilbur	PERSON	are having instalments of their familiar jars on the familiar scale .

		This might be called the angleworm type of fiction : short , choppy lengths , each one of them intelligible and available without exact regard for the other lengths .

		The worm so finely cut up seldom reassembles himself fails , in fact , to turn back for a well-rounded finish .

		The chief objection to this type of fiction is that , in point of characterization , it is static .

		Anything like real development , like true evo - lution , is absent .

		Wilbur , if dour and selfish and inconsiderate in
February	DATE	, is found to be none the less so in
August	DATE	.

		Marion , however long-suffering when we left her in early sum - mer , never reaches the point of open protest or rebellion by the end of
December	DATE	.

		The two creatures merely mark time , performing a shuffling dance that brings them no nearer a goal .

		Their manoeuvres lend some color to the claim that the journey itself , not the journey 's end , is the main consideration in humanity 's mundane experience .

		Another objection to this type of fiction is that it must be written or is written in a `` style '' to coalesce with that employed in adjacent columns an undis - tinguished style for undistinguishing people .

		Yet literature is like enough to fail when it addresses an ideal reader : that is as bad as to write for posterity , or to write as
Charles Lamb	PERSON	once threatened to do for antiquity .

		One must write for the public that exists in one 's own day .

		If that public is long on heed - lessness and short on taste ... Another form of fiction that is largely con - ditioned on publication at short intervals , for one definite body of readers , is the intermit - tent serial founded on the doings and adven - tures of a single individual : the biographical type .

		This individual is frequently a detec - tive , more important or less important , whose doings -LRB- or triumphs ; they are the same -RRB- rest on a basis blandly ratiocinative or speciously scientific .

		Recently the central figure of such a series has come to be , with frequency , a woman a girl who moves through Western scenes as a kind of brash , self-confident special providence ; or an elderly woman -LRB- English preferred -RRB- who composedly circulates as a globe-trotter through the wild waste spaces of the earth and sets things right when the local authorities fail .

		The serious objection to this type of fiction is that it , too , is static .

		The protagonist has one established character that is never modified or developed .

		Again , he always `` comes through '' must , indeed , come through , if the series is to continue .

		Thus an important element , that of uncertainty , is sacrificed .

		If the author , miscalculating the public 's interest , or failing to maintain his own , kills off his leading personage , there is but one thing to do : he must revive him , put him on his legs and start him again on his course .

		Another objection is that the real in - terest gets to be transferred to the subordinate figures which must constantly be fed into the series ; sometimes , even , to the new environ - ments in which these figures function .

		So that the death of the protagonist , even if pre - mature , is not always a calamity ; particularly in a certain kind of detective story , where the two necessary rules seem to be : first , write backwards ; second , avoid characterization .

		Yet the established type of character always has held , and always will hold , its own against new , fresh , authentic studies .

		Imbedded in a series of stories of the biographical sort , it holds its own and meets a real need .

		A plausible but exasperating form of fiction is one which is encountered in certain weeklies and runs through three or four consecutive issues .

		It is pseudo-autobiographical in char - acter and may be called the telescope type .

		It purports to be the intimate , detailed experi - ences of a single individual , reported by himself .

		If such a fiction is represented as com - ing from the hand of a successful professional man , a man whose success has enabled him to penetrate to scenes which the less successful , however avid , have been unable to reach , and if it professes to handle with exactness and
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 169 without reserves the financial details of the social advances of himself , wife , sons , and daughters , with what it all cost and how the cost was distributed , then it is pretty cer - tain to gain acceptance and vogue .

		Yet can anyone doubt that a fiction of this sort is a mere compilation , drawn from a dozen `` careers '' real or imagined ?

		`` Mere , '' how - ever , is not the word for such extended indus - try and such far-flung inquiry or inven - tion as must enter into the composition of a social study of this type .

		The experienced practitioner , though he detects readily enough the essential humbuggery of the scheme , can - not withhold admiration for the hand that cast the net so wide and composed its hetero - geneous haul to such an effect of compactness and plausibility .

		`` The Gold Bug , '' such a fiction might be named .

		And what is to prevent others of like nature ?

		`` The Bird of Paradise , '' for exam - ple , might telescope the social experiences of a dozen brilliant daughters of the fortunate , behind whose reiterated `` I 's '' stands per - haps a robust , sardonic young man .

		`` The Drudge , '' written not on a kitchen table but in some scented boudoir , will epitomize for us , in a fashion not too open to the charge of faking , the concentrated domestic routine of a hundred weary wives and mothers in lowly circumstances .

		And weekly numbers will carry the second instalment over the land before the impression created by the first has had time to dim .

		And the third will follow the second .

		The tourist serial , an elastic , peripatetic affair which may be called the Pullman type , does not call for much attention , though it appears to be growing in favor .

		I presume it stems largely from the
Williamsons	LOCATION	.

		A small group of people , preferably incongru - ous , shift along past varied backgrounds , scenic or historical .

		If these people , men and women alike , have an easy command of slang , or even of the jargon of the sporting column , they will not make reading any harder for their creator 's clientele , nor his success any the less .

		All this presupposes , of course , a newspaper public , one reading quite in the newspaper spirit .

		The movies may profess to rest on a picto - rial basis , just as the opera professes to rest on a musical basis .

		But scenario , no less than libretto , has a literary aspect that conditions fundamentally the whole work .

		The screen , indeed , by virtue of its many `` leaders '' and `` inserts , '' bits of conversation , and facsimiles of letters and telegrams , is constantly con - cerned with literary expression .

		One would wish for `` The Adventures of Anabel , '' for `` Narrow-mindedness , '' and for `` A Daughter of Heaven '' an initial quality of thought that might make the enormous expenditure of time , effort , and money seem better justified .

		One inclines also to wish that the multitudi - nous bits of text thrown on the screen might be less pitifully awkward and illiterate .

		One might even suggest a literary adviser for the great producing studios , were it not for the fact that , to the masses , the second-rate is often more acceptable than the first-rate , and the further fact that , with minds of a certain calibre , finish abashes rather than gratifies .

		About free verse as a new and practicable medium of fiction , I have already written in these pages .

		To the names of
Masters	ORGANIZATION	,
Frost	ORGANIZATION	, and
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, in this field , may properly be added the name of
Mary Aldis	PERSON	.

		Many of the pieces in her `` Flashlights '' are definitely called `` Stories in Metre , '' and -LRB- however sharp-edged , bitter-tanged and disconcert - ing some of the themes may be -RRB- fully justify her title .

		They have a contemporaneity and an actuality that should not fail with a public whose chief reading is in the daily press , and yet possess qualities that make them accept - able on a different and higher plane .

		To end with , these newer forms of fiction are conditioned not only by the vehicle of publication , but by the public state of mind and by the general average of public taste .

		If that improves , literature will improve in response .

		Yet why demand that it improve ?

		To many persons art in all its forms is but a mere casual diversion .

		If one can enjoy what is currently placed before him , why put oneself out by trying to qualify for the enjoy - ment of something that would be sure to be different yet would not be sure to be more amusing ?

		Eecall the case of the two travel - lers who were once thrown together as room - mates .

		Number One , seeing Number Two busy with soap , tooth-brush , nail-file , and the like , exclaimed wonderingly , `` How much trouble you must be to yourself ! ''

		But the best is not reached without travail .

HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.

		170 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	LORD DUNSANY : AN IMPRESSION .

		If the French word fantaisiste best indi - cates the nature of Lord
Dunsany	PERSON	's talent , it is not that his work is in any way alien to that imaginative revival which lies back of
Ireland	LOCATION	's literary renaissance .

		The fantasies of a
James Stephens	PERSON	or a
J. M. Synge	PERSON	are fundamentally related to those of Lord
Dun	ORGANIZATION	- sany , although the latter has chosen to invent his own mythology , instead of seeking his ma - terial in the field of Celtic legendary lore .


W. B. Yeats	PERSON	confesses how his first impulse was to urge Dunsany to turn in that direc - tion , `` but even as I urged , '' he writes , `` I knew that he could not , without losing his rich beauty of careless suggestion , and the persons and images that for ancestry have all those romantic ideas that are somewhere in the background of all our minds . ''

		To pre - serve the spontaneity of his mood it was essential that he should follow freely the promptings of his own amazing imagination .

		It must be admitted , however , that
Lord Dunsany	PERSON	is something of an enigma in con - temporary Anglo-Irish literature .

		The man himself gives the impression of a contradic - tion in terms .

		Coming of an old , aristocratic family ,
Edward John Moreton Drax Plunk	PERSON	- ett , eighteenth
Baron Dunsany	PERSON	, retains to some degree the traditional habits and characteris - tics of his class .

		He was educated at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	, and became a lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards , adding an unsuccessful parliamen - tary contest as the final incident to a typical career .

		Of this phase Lord Dunsany bears the imprint , for his tall , athletic stature , fair hair , and military moustache of the same color , give him the air usually associated with the English officer in mufti .

		One could im - agine him , correctly attired in the conven - tional silk hat and morning coat of Bond Street , passing undistinguished among his fellows at
Epsom	LOCATION	or
Goodwood	LOCATION	.

		In point of fact ,
Lord Dunsany	ORGANIZATION	is known as a cricketer and sportsman to many who know nothing of , and care nothing for , the poet that is in him .

		His is , as it were , a double life : on the one side , his activities in the world of sport and society ; on the other , his adventures in the world of letters .

		For let it be understood that the immaculate , `` clean-limbed English - man '' we have pictured does not correspond so much to what he is as to what , but for the grace of God , he might have become and remained .

		Of his social existence as Lord Dunsany there is no doubt , nor any need to insist upon it .

		But , just as in his personal appearance there is an element of carelessness betraying preoccupations not confined to the conven - tions , sartorial or other , so he fails , also , to conform intellectually to type .

		He is almost what he seems at first sight but `` not quite . ''

		There lingers about him some touch of the `` Bohemian , '' an indefinable something sug - gestive of things not dreamed of in the philos - ophy of a lieutenant in the Coldstream Guards .

		One senses the presence of the other Dunsany , not the officer whose cricket parties at
Dun	ORGANIZATION	- sany
Castle	ORGANIZATION	affirm the pursuits of his class , but the fantastic prose-poet familiar to liter - ary
Dublin	LOCATION	, whose true contemporaries and friends are
Yeats	PERSON	, `` JE , ''
Padraic Colum	PERSON	, and
James Stephens	PERSON	.

		It was at an exhibition of `` JE 's '' pictures , a couple of years ago , that Lord Dunsany introduced to us the young poet ,
Francis	PERSON	Led - widge , whom he had announced as his great `` discovery , '' and whose `` Songs of the Fields '' recently appeared under his sponsorship .

		Striking indeed was the spectacle they pre - sented on that occasion : Dunsany , tall , com - manding , keenly interested in the paintings , and in the friends gathered together at the private view ;
Francis Ledwidge	PERSON	clinging timidly to the arm of his protector , and obvi - ously ill at ease at finding himself suddenly the centre of interest in a group which would decide as to his admission into the ranks of Anglo-Irish poetry .

		But
Dunsany	PERSON	moved about in blissful ignorance of the perturba - tion of the country boy at his side , pouring into the ear of `` JE '' an enthusiastic story of the new poet 's achievements , and of his ad - venturous progress , which ended in his facing the charge of witchcraft at the hands of the peasantry in
Lord Dunsany	ORGANIZATION	's own county of Meath .

		Who would have dreamed at that time of the cataclysmic changes which were to come upon the members of that circle ?

		Before the poems of
Ledwidge	PERSON	reached the general pub - lic , the European war had broken out , and he and his protector had enlisted in the same regiment .

		While the lance-corporal , Led - widge , was drafted for service , one of his offi - cers ,
Lord Dunsany	PERSON	, was destined to remain in
Ireland	LOCATION	long enough to face fire in circum - stances of real tragedy .

		He was wounded in the street fighting during the week of the Irish rebellion in
April	DATE	.

		While there is no evidence that he actually came into direct conflict with
Joseph Plunkett	PERSON	or
Thomas Mac	PERSON	-
Donagh	PERSON	, who were posted in different parts of the city , yet it was from the forces under
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 171 their command that he received his wound fortunately a light one .

		To understand the poignant significance of this , it must be re - membered that the executed poets were the successors of
Padraic Colum	PERSON	in the editor - ship of `` The Irish Review , '' which
Dunsany	ORGANIZATION	had done so much to develop , and to the pages of which he contributed so many of his most remarkable stories .

		Associated as all these men were in a creative literary enterprise , they suffered the disruptive influences of the Great War , which dispersed , and in some cases , destroyed them .

		The year
1906	DATE	, which saw the defeat of Dunsany as the Conservative candidate for
West Wiltshire	LOCATION	, may be said to mark the beginning of his literary career .

		His first book , `` The Gods of Pegana , '' appeared , it is true , in
1905	DATE	, but passed almost unperceived by the reviewers and the general public .

		It is characteristic of Dunsany that the period immediately preceding his bid for parliamen - tary fame should have been occupied with the elaboration of that weird theogony .

		One sus - pects him of having drawn upon himself for the material of that delightfully contemptu - ous fable of politics , `` The Day of the Poll , '' which was published a few years later in `` A Dreamer 's Tales . ''

		The poet in that story who seduces the voter from his duties as a citizen probably expresses Lord
Dunsany	ORGANIZATION	's attitude toward the humbug of politics .

		It is obviously not the sort of narrative of the polls one would expect from a man who had himself come forward as a candidate for political office .

		The suspicion suggests itself that , in contesting
West Wiltshire	LOCATION	, he was merely doing half-heartedly what seemed to be the customary thing for one of his position and education .

		It was in
1906	DATE	that
Dunsany	PERSON	published his second series of mythological tales , `` Time and the Gods , '' which has been followed , at inter - vals of two years , by `` The Sword of Wei - , leran , '' `` A Dreamer 's Tales , '' and `` The Book of Wonder . ''

		These years of continuous lit - erary activity have brought about a gradual but growing recognition of the author 's pow - ers as a story-teller , worthy to be ranked with Villiers de 1 ` Isle-Adam , and comparable , in some of his later work , with
Poe	PERSON	and
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	.

		His fame as a dramatist has helped , in a measure , to direct attention to the other writings of a man who possesses the most brilliant imagination in contemporary Irish prose .


ERNEST A. BOYD	PERSON	.

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		This winter has seen pass away in
France	LOCATION	several prominent writers and thinkers , the most prominent of them all being perhaps
Paul Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	, the well-known political economist .

		His sudden death creates several vacancies , a seat in the
Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of the Institute of France	ORGANIZATION	, a chair in the College of
France	LOCATION	, the presidency of the
French Society of Political Economy	ORGANIZATION	, and the editorial desk of the `` Economiste Frangais , '' the able weekly which he founded in
1873	DATE	.

		This last men - tioned vacancy has already been filled .

		Pro- fessor
Andre Liesse	PERSON	, of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, took over the editorship in the second number fol - lowing the death of the founder , and it is highly probable that he will succeed
Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	PERSON	at the
College of France	ORGANIZATION	where he has often acted as the regular professor 's sub - stitute in the chair of political economy .

		The following excellent estimate of
Paul Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	as a political economist is taken from a letter to me from my friend ,
M. Daniel Bellet	PERSON	, Perpetual Secretary of the So - ciety of Political Economy : It can be said honestly and without any exaggera - tion that the four big volumes of
Paul Leroy-Beau	PERSON	- lieu 's wonderful `` Trait6 d'Economie Politique '' embrace all that can be written on the subject .

		There is not a single question which he has not treated in that work ; so when anybody sits down to write a volume on some subject in this field , he finds that most of the ideas which he would put into his book have already been considered by Leroy-Beaulieu .

		This was my own experience with three of my volumes .

		He has sometimes been criticized , very unjustly , I think , for having a tendency to vacillate , showing , for instance , a lack of decision in the matter of free trade and protection .

		But if you read his `` Traite '' care - fully , you will find that he is absolutely broad-minded on this complicated question .

		He did wish to be , and ever tried to be , practical , desired to take into consid - eration contingencies , and hence it was that he always urged that one proceed with caution and adopt transi - tory measures if necessary .

		Every subject examined by
Paul Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	was admirably studied and I fear it will be a long time before we can replace him .

		In the same letter ,
M. Bellet	PERSON	says : `` Al - ways a most indefatigable writer ,
M. Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	PERSON	was , when he died , engaged on a new edition of his works '' ; and I may add that his last book , published late this past
autumn	DATE	, was the second volume of `` La Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Delagrave , 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , the collection of his articles on the war which appeared each week at the head of the col - umns of the `` Economiste Francois . ''

		The volume stops at the end of
last July	DATE	, and , like its predecessor , mentioned in THE DIAL
last winter	DATE	, covers just one year of the struggle .

		172 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	It has not yet been decided whether a third volume will be issued .

		This would bring the history down to the beginning of last
Decem	PERSON	- ber , when Leroy-Beaulieu wrote his final article just four days before he died , a re - markable example of that unwearied intel - lectual activity which characterized his whole life .

		There was an American side to
Paul Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	PERSON	that should interest us .

		He read English with ease , knew many Americans , and was a contributor to several of our best peri - odicals .

		Through his wife he had a peculiar attachment to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		She was the daughter of
Michel Chevalier	PERSON	, the cele - brated French free trader of the
first half of the last century	DATE	, who , with
Eichard Cob	ORGANIZATION	- den , brought over the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	to the
Manchester School	ORGANIZATION	of thought .

		Chevalier went to the
United States	LOCATION	at the beginning of his career , and wrote at the end of the thirties a book on our transport system which at - tracted wide attention in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps it is not too much to say that this was the first book after de Tocqueville 's that again brought the
United States	LOCATION	before the eyes of the in - telligent classes of
France	LOCATION	, at the moment when they were taking up the railway prob - lem for resolution .

		Before this ,
Chevalier	PERSON	had gone off into Saint-Simonism , and among his correspondents at this time was the American Fourierist ,
Albert Brisbane	PERSON	, father of the present
Arthur Brisbane	PERSON	.

		Unpublished let - ters of the elder
Brisbane	LOCATION	to
Chevalier	PERSON	are to be found in the Saint-Simonian archives at the
Paris Arsenal Library	ORGANIZATION	, and when
Albert Brisbane	PERSON	, in his old age , visited the French capital in the eighties , he renewed with the son-in-law the early acquaintance begun with the father-in-law .

		One of the best places in which to study Leroy-Beaulieu was the president 's chair of the
Society of Political Economy	ORGANIZATION	, which met for many years in the old Restaurant
Durand	PERSON	, torn down some little time ago , when the society removed its Penates to the even more ancient Restaurant Cardinal , farther down the
Boulevard	LOCATION	.

		Here it was my privilege to see four very different men preside over these meetings .

		The venerable
Frederic Passy	PERSON	did it with a chill peculiar to French Protestants , who always seem to be on the defensive , a re - sult perhaps of their stormv historic past .


Emile Levasseur	PERSON	was more affable and invit - ing .


Yves Guyot	PERSON	, with his leonine head , was always decisive and often even aggressive in both manner and speech .

		But
Paul Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	PERSON	seemed to combine all these qualities .

		He too had a striking head , reminding one a little of the bison 's , which resemblance was increased when he would lean forward at times and sway it from side to side .

		He could be , and was , in turn reserved and affable , inviting and decisive , but perhaps never ag - gressive ; and when he summed up the even - ing 's discussion , he did it with a clearness and authority vouched for by the attention and approval of the whole room , ^ always filled , especially when it was known that Leroy-Beaulieu was to preside , by leading thinkers and writers on economics , statistics , banking , and public affairs .

		On the same day that
Paul Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	died , another celebrated French thinker passed away ,
Theodule Ribot	PERSON	, whom
Gaston Rageot	PERSON	declares to have been `` the creator of French psychology , '' and whom Professor
Maurice Milloud	PERSON	, of the
University of Lausanne	ORGANIZATION	, calls `` one of the last survivors of that grand generation of savants who re - newed the mentality of the nineteenth cen - tury . ''

		But perhaps what would have pleased him most among the kind words of admiring friends , was this statement from
Professor Benrubi of Geneva University	ORGANIZATION	: ``
M. Ribot	PERSON	's periodical has not published , since the war began , a single article showing hatred of
Germany	LOCATION	, and the works of German authors have been treated , in the review articles , with the same objectivity as was shown before hos - tilities began . ''

		The periodical referred to is the `` Revue Philosophique , '' now over forty years old .

		M.
Felix Alcan	ORGANIZATION	, its publisher , tells me that `` the new editor , Professor
Levy Bruhl	PERSON	, of the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, was selected by
M. Ribot	PERSON	himself as his successor . ''

		M.
Pierre Janet	PERSON	, of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	and the
College of France	ORGANIZATION	, and senior editor of the `` Journal de Psychologic , '' another of M.
Alcan	ORGANIZATION	's publica - tions , writes me that much space in the next number of his bi-monthly will be devoted to
M. Ribot	PERSON	, when among other things will be given one of
Ribot	PERSON	's unpublished lectures ; while an early number of the `` Revue Phil - osophique '' will contain an essay on
Ribot	PERSON	's work by Professor
Georges Dumas	PERSON	, of the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, and junior editor of
M. Janet	PERSON	's periodical .

		M.
Janet	PERSON	continues : ``
Ribot	PERSON	has left quite a large number of manuscripts of unequal value .

		Those which are complete enough to be published will appear in the ` Revue Philosophique . ' ''

		His widow informs me that her husband was working on a study entitled `` The Finalist Conception of His - tory , '' but felt that an essay with such a title and of such a philosophical school could not be finished at such a time .

		My own memories of
Theodule Ribot	PERSON	centre round a spot peculiar to
Paris	LOCATION	and the like of which must be rare in any capital .

		I refer to that room on the second floor of
M. Felix Alcan	ORGANIZATION	's publishing house in the Boulevard
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 173 Saint-Germain , which is the editorial office , at one and the same time , of the dozen learned periodicals of which
M. Alcan	ORGANIZATION	is the energetic publisher .

		By means of a sort of Box and Cox arrangement , each of the twelve editors of these twelve different periodicals occu - pies this room on the morning or the after - noon of one day each week .

		So here one might see in the same cabinet , seated at the same desk and in the same easy-chair , but separately and alone , such totally dissimilar French intellectuals as
Yves Guyot	PERSON	,
Gabriel Monod	PERSON	, Dr.
Louis Landouzy	PERSON	,
Pierre Janet	PERSON	,
Louis Escoffier	PERSON	, and
Theodule Bibot	PERSON	, much as when an artist in his studio shows his sketches by inserting one after the other in the same frame , in both instances an excellent man - ner of judging of the comparative merits of men or things .

		And now that I look back on that group of notable savants viewed in this way , I perceive in how many respects Theo - dule
Ribot	PERSON	stood out the equal of any of them .

		The death of another intellectual French personality , though of quite a different type from the two just mentioned , calls for a paragraph or so for several reasons .

		Dr.
Gerard Encausse	PERSON	, known to the Parisian adepts of the so-called occult sciences as Papus , `` the grand master of contemporary occultism , '' as his publishers describe him , has left behind him a manuscript which has awakened considerable curiosity at this time , `` Ce que Diviendront nos Morts , '' which
M. Jacques Brieu	PERSON	, the chroniqueur on esoter - ism and psychic sciences of the `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	, '' tells me will not come out until the
spring	DATE	.

		But perhaps the most interesting circum - stance , at least to the public , in connection with Dr.
Papus	PERSON	is his publishers , their cata - logue , and the evidence which it gives of the wide-spread attention paid in
France	LOCATION	to these unsatisfactorily explained human mysteries .

		The
Durville Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, 23 rue
Saint Merri	PERSON	,
Paris	LOCATION	, who have issued over a dozen books by
Papus	LOCATION	, some of them costing ten francs , a high price for a French volume , print a list of all their publications , affirming that their house is the most important in the world on the subjects of spiritualism , magnet - ism , hypnotism , somnambulism , telepathy , theosophy , astrology , alchemy , cartomancy , graphology , clairvoyance , etc. ; and they cer - tainly present a most extensive and original collection of books and pamphlets , with , in most cases , full explanatory notes appended , the whole thing offering a mass of curious and often amusing facts and comments .

		Scat - tered among living writers on these subjects , you find the names of
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	,
William Blake	PERSON	,
Allan Kardec	PERSON	,
Strindberg	LOCATION	, and other eccentric minds among the dead .

		A colleague of Leroy-Beaulieu and Bibot at the
Academy of Moral	ORGANIZATION	and Political Sci - ences ,
M. Louis Leger	PERSON	, has recently published two or three noteworthy short studies bearing on the situation in the
Near East	LOCATION	.


M. Leger	PERSON	is an authority in
France	LOCATION	on the
Balkans	LOCATION	.

		`` Les Luttes Seculaires des Germains et des Slaves '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Maisonneuve	PERSON	, 1 fr . -RRB-

		should be read , especially for its second part , which has to do with `` the Slavonic peoples and German intrigues , '' where we learn that when , some years ago , newly freed
Bulgaria	LOCATION	was looking for a ruler ,
M. Leger	PERSON	entertained the mission in
Paris	LOCATION	and urged them to select as chief of state a native Bulgarian and to es - tablish a republic .

		If this radical but very sensible advice had been followed , the whole situation in the
Balkans	LOCATION	would probably now be very different from what it is .

		In the most interesting portion of this essay the venerable savant calls upon some scholar `` younger and more patient than I '' to under - take a work which would be nothing less than a history of the Slavs in their relations with the Germans .

		`` I am not sure , '' says
M. Leger	PERSON	, `` whether a single worker could accomplish this big task .

		But it might be done under the auspices of the Academy of
Petrograd	LOCATION	in con - nection with the
Czech Academy	ORGANIZATION	and the Polish Academy of
Cracow	LOCATION	. ''

		In a recent address before his own academy ,
M. Leger	PERSON	again refers to Russian learned circles and calls attention to an act that stands out well amid the many dark things of the present war .

		I quote a few passages from the manuscript text of this speech which
M. Leger	PERSON	has sent me : The Eussian government had the happy idea of attaching to the army operating in
Asiatic Turkey	LOCATION	a scientific mission charged with the preservation of all things relating to art , letters , and history .

		At the head of this mission was placed Mr.
F. J. Ouspensky	PERSON	, formerly director of the
Eussian Archaeological Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute at
Constantinople	LOCATION	, whose work at
Trebizond	ORGANIZATION	has been remarkably successful .

		It appears that the bom - bardment of the city did not last long and did very little harm to the public edifices ; and as soon as the Eussians entered , severe measures were taken to pre - vent pillaging of the mosques .

		All precious objects were deposited in places of safety , and all the Greek monuments and libraries were put under the special protection of the bishops , who were held responsible for their preservation .

		The mosques , which had been installed in the ancient Christian churches , were closed to the public and then thoroughly examined by expert archaeologists , with many happy results .

		Especial attention was given to the grandiose ruins of the im - perial palace and to three churches , particularly to
Haghia Sophia	LOCATION	, which had long ago been transformed into a mosque .

		Here the discoveries were very inter - esting .

		Frescoes were brought to light which the Mussulmans had covered with a layer of plaster , and when the wooden flooring was taken up , fine mosaics 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	were revealed .

		It appears that these frescoes show tendencies in mediaeval art not known up to the pres - ent time .

		Mr.
Ouspensky	PERSON	has also secured a certain number of rare manuscripts and books , which he has already deposited in the Asiatic Museum at
Petrograd	LOCATION	.

		The complete results of this mission will be given later in a special publication illustrated with photographs .

		M.
Daniel Bellet	PERSON	, whom I quoted at the be - ginning of this article , has just brought out a volume that American manufacturers should be interested in .

		`` Le Commerce Allemand '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Plon	LOCATION	, 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- shows what German trade was before the war , how it was built up , and what it will probably be after the war .

		The book contains many references to our business methods and prospects , and dwells at some length on a tour of observation which
Edison	ORGANIZATION	made in
Germany	LOCATION	in
1911	DATE	`` to see how they did it . ''

		In connection with
M. Beliefs	ORGANIZATION	book one might read also the second volume of `` La Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Felix Alcan	PERSON	, 3 frs .

		50 -RRB- , which well presents the whole economic and industrial activity of
France	LOCATION	during the war , an admirable presentation given in the form of a series of interesting lectures delivered at
Paris	LOCATION	by French specialists such as
Daniel Zolla	PERSON	,
Joseph Chailley	PERSON	,
Andre Liesse	PERSON	, and others .

		These economic questions , at least so far as
France	LOCATION	is concerned , are well summed up in this extract from a letter which
M. Andre Siegfried	PERSON	, professor at the
Paris School of Political Sciences	ORGANIZATION	, sent me with his latest book : I think the outcome of the present conflict will be to put
Europe	LOCATION	, and especially
France	LOCATION	, in an economic and moral position more and more like that of the
United States	LOCATION	and the new countries .

		The huge con - sumption of wealth will have destroyed or diminished many of the existing fortunes .

		Instead of living on their income , the French will have to rely on their work .

		Increasing salaries will correspond to higher cost of living , and as many things will have to be started anew , the possibilities for the workingman or for anybody desirous of laboring will be great .

		But the position of the old rentier , the independent bond - holder , will be difficult .

		I hope , however , that despite this transformation ,
France	LOCATION	will be able to remain an intellectual country and devote a great part of its energy to art and intellectual work .

		The French should not forget that science , art , and brain-work are also capital and a source of power for a nation .

		The basis of the power and influence of a country can not be exclusively material .

		The book which I referred to above is `` Deux Mois en Amerique du Nord '' -LRB-

		,
M. Siegfried	PERSON	having been in the
United States	LOCATION	,
Alaska	LOCATION	, and

		He has been acting since as an interpreter with the British heavy artillery in

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		AN OCTOGENARIAN AUTHOR 'S HONORS have seldom , perhaps never , been so well earned and so liberally bestowed as those that have just been paid to Mr.
Howells	PERSON	by friends and admirers far and near on the completion , in health and activity , of his eightieth year .

		Like
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	before him , he was cradled in the sheets of the paternal news - paper , which , as in the
Hale	PERSON	instance also , was very much a family possession and a family pride .

		In that little printing office in southwestern
Ohio	LOCATION	the boy
Howells	PERSON	breathed the atmosphere of types and presses , and , as he relates in his `` Impressions and Experiences , '' the familiar odor has ever since stirred him with emotion .

		In a passage interesting for several reasons , he further says : '' The greatest event of our year was the publication of the President 's Message , which was a thrill in my childish life long before I had any conception of its meaning .

		I fancy that the patent inside , now so universally used by the country newspapers , originated in the custom which the printers within easy reach of a large city had of supplying themselves with an edition of the President 's Message , to be folded into their own sheet , when they did not print their outside on the back of it .

		The rich story of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's life has been so well told by himself , in sev - eral memorable volumes , that not even an out - line is called for here .

		Both he and his readers are to be congratulated on his remark - able retention , at four-score , of the vigor and the skill , the life and grace and all the name - less subtleties of style , that early marked him as a writer of force and distinction .

		The charm and humor and the playful handling of detail that delighted us in `` The Lady of the Aroostook '' still captivate in `` The Leath - erwood God . ''

		THE LAST OF THE CONCORD IMMORTALS , the famous band that included
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	;
Alcott	PERSON	, and
Ellery Channing	PERSON	, has passed from earth with the death on the 24th of Februarv of Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	at the home of his son in
Westfield	ORGANIZATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	was born at
Hampton Falls	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	,
December 15 , 1831	DATE	; was graduated from
Harvard	LOCATION	in
1855	DATE	; became secretary of the
Massachusetts State Kansas Committee	ORGANIZATION	in the following year ; and from that time his activ - ities in politics , and in journalism and liter - ature and on the lecture platform , made him a conspicuous figure , especially in
New Eng	LOCATION	- land , and more particularly in and about
Boston	LOCATION	.

		In
Concord	LOCATION	, where he fixed his domicile early in life , he had long been
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 175 prominent , and it was a source of satisfaction to him to be able to recall his intimacy with
Emerson	PERSON	and
Alcott	PERSON	,
Thoreau	PERSON	and the poet
Channing	PERSON	, each of whom he made the subject of a biography in his later years when these and other friends and associates were passing in rather rapid succession out of his circle , leaving him to uphold alone the
Concord	LOCATION	tradition .

		With
Alcott	PERSON	and
W. T. Harris	PERSON	he founded the famous
Concord School of Phi	ORGANIZATION	- losophy , of which he says , in characteristic vein , in his autobiographical reminiscences : `` There was much scoffing outside , of course , some of it among the
Harvard	LOCATION	circles , where is a greater power of turning up the nose at what is beyond its round 0 , than exists any - where -LSB- else -RSB- on earth unless at
Oxford	LOCATION	, among persons of vaster special learning .

		In
Concord	LOCATION	itself there were many jests , few of them good ones , and a bitterness of feeling in some instances which divided families . ''

		Of Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's published works , the offices he held at various times , the movements he aided , and the honors that came to him , the tale is too long for this place .

		In the stand - ard books of reference it will all be found duly set forth .

		THE
JOHN CASSELL	PERSON	CENTENARY , celebrated a few weeks ago by the great
London	LOCATION	publish - ing house bearing his name , recalls some of the good old books issued under the
Cassell	PERSON	imprint and endeared by their sterling worth to thousands of readers .

		Founders of great publishing houses , such men for example as Archibald Constable ,
John Murray	PERSON	,
Daniel Appleton	PERSON	,
James Harper	PERSON	, and
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner , commonly leave an enduring stamp on the enterprises started by them .

		Thus the
Cassell	PERSON	methods and policies show to-day the influence of him whose boyhood was spent in the cotton mills of
Manchester	LOCATION	, and who there acquired a familiarity with the workingman 's literary needs that governed him later , to a great extent , in determining the kind of books he should offer to the public .

		From his press , accordingly , came the pioneer series of inex - pensive reprints , retailed at sevenpence the volume and including standard works in his - tory , biography , and science .

		``
John Cassell	PERSON	's Library '' has had a very wide sale , as has also ``
Cassell	PERSON	's Popular Educator , '' a penny ency - clopaedia , in serial form , adapted to the hum - bler reader 's needs and comprehension . ' '

		The Magazine of Art , '' established in
1851	DATE	, has done much to popularize what is best in the fine arts .

		``
Cassell	PERSON	's
National Library	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		ed - ited by Professor
Henry Morley	PERSON	, comprised 214 volumes , sold at threepence each , a record never since equalled in good and cheap book - production , and attained a circulation of nearly eight million volumes .

		From La Belle
Sauvage	PERSON	-LRB- as the house of Cassell fantastically calls itself -RRB- have appeared such masterpieces as
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Treasure Island , ''
Quiller	PERSON	-
Couch	PERSON	's `` Dead Man 's
Bock	PERSON	, '' Rider Hag - gard 's `` King Solomon 's Mines , ''
Traill	PERSON	's `` Social England , ''
Farrar	PERSON	's `` Life of Christ , '' and notable works by
Barrie	PERSON	,
Conan Doyle	PERSON	,
Grant Allen	PERSON	,
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	, and other eminent authors .

		INDEXING EXTRAORDINARY , indexing carried to the utmost limit of possibility , seems to be among the achievements standing to the credit of the
Seattle Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In an issue of its alert little `` Library Poster '' there is a short article on `` Library Service to Business Men , '' in which occurs this announcement , in accents of justifiable pride : `` We have the departments , the assistants , and the books , pamphlets , magazines , newspapers , and other materials , arranged and indexed in such a manner that a vast amount of information on a thousand practical subjects is almost imme - diately available to any business man who is willing to state his problem and to do what - ever reading his case may require . ''

		To arrange and index library departments and , more difficult still , library assistants , is a refinement of library economy that has prob - ably never before been attempted , much less accomplished .

		A complete index , or alpha - betical table of contents , to a corps of library assistants must indeed be a triumph of the cataloguer 's art .

		AN AUTHOR 'S CONFESSION of his literary likes and dislikes is often illuminating .


Walter Pater	PERSON	enjoyed
Stevenson	PERSON	, but was afraid to read him lest the Stevensonian manner should affect his own style .

		This was charac - teristic of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's preciosity and provokes a smile .

		Most writers like to read authors of their own kind , just as most actors enjoy a good performance by other actors , and artists are frequent vistors at art galleries .


Mark Twain	PERSON	, in an unpublished letter to
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	, dated
May 16	DATE	-LSB-
1886	DATE	-RSB- , makes a confession that one might not have expected from the author of ``
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	, '' `` Huckle - berry
Finn	PERSON	, '' `` The Gilded Age , '' and `` Joan of Arc . ' '

		He says : '' If it be a confession , then let me confess to wit : -LRB- 1 -RRB- All the romance which I have read in twenty years would not overcrowd a couple of crown octavo volumes . ''

		Then follows , as the second item of the con - fession : `` All the poetry which I have read in twenty years could be put between the lids of one octavo .

		I do not read anything but history and biography , etc. '' This fragment , it should be added , is quoted from the inter - 176 THE DIAL -LSB-

		CENSORSHIP IN
HOLLAND	LOCATION	may safely be as - sumed to lack much of the strictness prevail - ing across the border in either direction ; but a significant hint as to the situation is found in a letter , interesting for other reasons also , from a young Belgian refugee to the equally young editor of one of our school papers .

		The Belgian boy had been asked for a literary con - tribution .

		He thus replied , from Harder - wijk ,
Holland	LOCATION	: `` I well receive your nice card and postcard .

		Many thanks .

		I see you enjoy you well ... Now here our situation is always the same .

		We attend peace or war here .

		Heaven give that soon war is over !

		For a story of mine over war , it is not sure that censor will permit it .

		... BOOKS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN , but for the sifting process carried on , day after day , month after month , and year after year , by some hundreds or perhaps thousands of pub - lishers ' readers , form a stupendous total that is seldom even remotely conceived of by those book-weary persons who complain of the already superabundant plentitude of our annual literary harvest .

		From the recent confessions of a publisher 's reader who enter - tainingly imparts some of his experiences in a contribution to the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post , '' it appears that five book-manuscripts a day is no unusual record for a large pub - lishing house ; that is , about fifteen hundred are received in the course of a year , and out of this mountain of manuscript perhaps fif - teen books may eventually take shape .

		If a single house annually spares the public the infliction of
1485	DATE	more or less worthless books , how many are held up in the entire country in the entire world ?

		The brain reels at the thought of the multitude of books that might have been .

		Every six months , says the authority here referred to , there comes to hand the inevitable treatise on the fourth dimension , or on making gold from sea-water , or on utilizing moonlight for running dyna - mos , or on Pope
Joan	PERSON	or Prester
John	PERSON	.

		He might have added the ever-recurrent disser - tations on perpetual motion , the squaring of the circle , and the flatness of the earth .

		The number of things not so , that the credulous world is saved from learning by the long-suf - fering publisher 's reader is beyond calcula - tion .

		COMMUNICATION 8 .

		REALISTIC HISTORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		With something akin to astonishment , I read in ``
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly '' the other day an atrabiliar at - tack , in the most approved style of forcible-feeble sarcasm , upon the author of a book review in THE DIAL .

		With ignorance incredible , if it be not fine assumption , the writer in ``
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly , '' un - der the caption `` History , '' holds up for national condemnation and obloquy the `` modest critic , '' and in the true spirit of the discoverer pronounces with bated breath the `` unknown '' name of
William E. Dodd	PERSON	!

		Let me say not for the enlightenment of the crassly ignorant writer in ``
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly , '' but for the sake of expressing the prevailing opinion among students of our national history , profes - sional and lay that there is no more graphic ex - positor and astute critic of the American people , as manifested in the growth and development of our institutions on the political and economic side , than Professor
Dodd	PERSON	.

		In his writings , forceful in expression and reliable as to fact , he unflinchingly sets himself the task of portraying the actual con - ditions , industrial and economic , as well as social , political , and cultural , under which this country has come to be what it is and taken on certain of the characteristics and attributes of a nation .

		Be - neath the surface manifestation of the life of the people , upon which his fancy often lightly plays , we are made pervasively conscious of the great tides of economic interest , of social thrust , and of industrial causation , which have propelled consoli - dated masses of the people at every period of our history .

		In dealing with the various sectional in - terests of the country , he has accepted facts with the utmost sang-froid ; and , what is even more re - markable , has drawn from these facts the chilling lessons , so deadly to romance and hero-worship , which they convey and compel .

		One need only read Professor
Dodd	PERSON	's concise biography of
Nathaniel Macon	PERSON	, leader in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for many years , the intimate of
Jefferson	PERSON	and Ran - dolph of
Roanoke	LOCATION	, to see the fine touch of the
Leip	PERSON	- zig scholar and to sense the historic realism of the handling .

		Both in his penetrating `` Life of
Jeffer	PERSON	- son
Davis	PERSON	, '' in which he endeavors with utmost sincerity to draw the conclusions which facts im - pose , and in his brilliant , if somewhat ruthless , `` Statesmen of the Old South , '' he presents in a clear and searching light the fine flowers of ex - haustive research at the source ; and , whether one agrees with his conclusions or no , certainly one must face them and swallow them or devise a new historical pattern coinciding with the facts at a greater number of points than does the ingenious design executed by Professor
Dodd	PERSON	.

		As exponent of this new school of historical writing , the
School of Beard	ORGANIZATION	and
Farrand	LOCATION	, Professor
Dodd	PERSON	has edited , and written one of the four volumes of , the `` Riverside History of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 177 the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		At the time of their appear - ance , I reviewed these volumes at great length , and pronounced this history the best and most readable account , in brief compass , of our national development economic and political which I had ever seen .

		This opinion I now repeat , with em - phasis .

		It is the first realistic handling of our national development ; and Professor
Dodd	PERSON	's vol - ume , `` Expansion and Conflict , '' is the only thor - oughly impartial study of the force of sectional interest in our national development that exists .

		Men of the mental cast of Professor
Dodd	PERSON	herald a new era in historical writing in this country ; and they purport to present the facts in truer atmosphere and juster perspective , since they disclaim the influence of the ulterior motive , of the arriere-pensee , in their writings .

		Professor
Dodd	PERSON	looks beneath the personal utterance of the states - man to the social will , the economic impulse , under - lying that utterance ; and thus views American politics in the light of communal and sectional self - interest .

		`` Public men generally determine what line of procedure is best for their constituents , or for what are supposed to be the interests of their constituents , and then seek for ` powers ' or clauses in state or federal constitutions which justify the predetermined course . ''

		Animated by such a prin - ciple , Professor
Dodd	PERSON	has gone scientifically about his task of deracination uprooting many a cher - ished tradition and presenting it , reeking , to our not undisturbed gaze .

		To many causes , to many indi - viduals , this relentless iconoclasm does realistic vio - lence ; but it throws open the window of truth and lets in a breath of freedom on the rays of revela - tion .

		With the logic of the major premise of his work , quoted above , Professor
Dodd	PERSON	proceeds re - lentlessly upon the assumption that the classic is - sues , so dear to us from the days of our childhood , when the romantic glamour of patriotism and ex - alted purity surrounded the cherished figures in the American pantheon , were ex post facto excuses invented by the sections themselves to mask the real motives of the struggle , which lay deep in the social and economic wills of these conflicting and hostile sections .

		This new view of our history , with its disclosure of sectional interests , material motives , and economic impulses , must be reckoned with , with a realistic frankness commensurate with that of the exponent of this new view .

		The economic interpretation of American history is only one of the many interpretations which may be advanced to explain the development of our nation and the growth of our institutions , but so able and distin - guished an exponent of this mode of viewing the evolution of the
United States	LOCATION	as Professor
William Edward Dodd	PERSON	can only be challenged by a histo - rian of his own calibre .

		The writer in ``
Collier	PERSON	's Weekly '' achieves with extraordinary success the by no means difficult task of making himself ridiculous .

		In your issue of
December 28 , 1916	DATE	, there is a review of `` What 's the Matter with
Mexico	LOCATION	? ''

		in the column `` Briefs on New Books . ''

		In the course of this review the writer says : `` He attempts a brief historical introduction that is neither clear nor accurate '' ; and again `` One may question the accuracy of his figures . ''

		As accuracy is the one thing I sought above all others in the writing of that memorandum on Mexican conditions , I shall be obliged to your reviewer if he will point out to me wherein and in what manner I have failed .

		I ask your indulgence in passing this on and assure you of my desire for the information .

Bronxville	LOCATION	, N. .

		,
February 12 , 1917	DATE	.

		The criticisms to which Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	objects refer principally to pages 7 to 18 inclusive of his little book .

		I feel that he has over-emphasized the word cuartilazo .

		No single phrase of the sort will serve to characterize Mexican affairs at any period .

		On page 8 , Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	refers to an attempt at freedom preceding that of Hidalgo by two years .

		His reference is not clear , and if he has in mind the series of events that led up to the deposition of the viceroy ,
Iturrigaray	LOCATION	, it is misleading .

		The brief statements regarding
Hidalgo	PERSON	's capture and execution , and the fate of
Morelos	LOCATION	require much more explanation to be intelligible .


Santa Anna	LOCATION	may have been as instrumental in the overthrow of Iturbide as the author indicates , but he did not work so openly as he implies .

		On the other hand , he had a greater part in the events of the following twenty years than appears from the text .

		Refer - ences to a `` native historian '' would be more satis - fying if his name , at least , appeared .

		Bustamente looms up more largely than his career warrants .

		The church did not cease to direct affairs with the success of the revolution but continued , with the army , to play a conspicuous part in contemporary politics to the death of
Maximilian	PERSON	.

		It would have been possible to add a brief paragraph showing that still other motives besides the clerical and military influenced the Mexican life of that period .

		As for statistics concerning
Mexico	LOCATION	's population , one may choose from a wide variety of estimates ranging from
Humboldt	LOCATION	's to those of Professor
Frederick Starr	PERSON	, and a careful writer will not con - tent himself with merely one set of figures .

		The above constitute some of the points that create in my mind the impression of inaccuracy .

		Others , I find , agree with me .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Is it a legitimate function of THE DIAL to give space to a propaganda of atheism , like the leading article of a recent number , under the guise of a criticism of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's book ?

		Christianity is too well established to be treated with sneer and an 178 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	assumption of matter-of-course inferiority in a form of literary debate .

		There are publications and publishers suitable for the use of writers of ethical and religious polemic .

		I think that in the pages of THE DIAL the agnostic should not be challenged by any particular assertion of Christian doctrine , and I feel sure that the Christian should not be insulted by attacks upon his faith , which inspires some of the best literature of the world .

		It seems to me almost to justify an apology in THE DIAL itself .

		TEN `` REAL '' WAR BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		He is convalescing from an attack of poison gas : a slow , hard pull .

		His hospital is near
Paris	LOCATION	, and he is a lieutenant of infantry who has fought both on the Somme and at
Verdun	LOCATION	.

		Since the gas got into his lungs , he has had plenty of time to read war books for a few hours each day ; and because in peace-time he is himself a bibliophile and pub - lisher , I am inclined to value his opinions .

		`` I will tell you , '' he volunteers , `` the real war books the books that will give you , not the tradi - tional , poilu , but the poilu as he really is .

		These are the only books in French that represent our war the war I know about .

		If you read some of these books , you will see things with a soldier 's eyes .

		But we of the firing line can not take most of the war books very seriously . ''

		This is his list of exceptions : `` L'Armee de la Guerre , '' by Cap - itaine Z. -LRB- Payot -RRB- ; `` Dixmude , '' by Charles le Goffic -LRB-
Plon	LOCATION	-RRB- ; `` La Guerre , Madame , '' by
Paul Geraldy	PERSON	-LRB- Cres .

		In English translation `` The War , Madame '' published by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- ; `` Meditations dans la Tranchee , '' by Lieu - tenant R. -LRB-
Payot	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; `` Cinq Prieres du Temps de la Guerre , '' by
Francis Jammes	PERSON	-LRB- Librairie de 1 ` Art Catholique -RRB- ; `` Gaspard , '' by
Rene Benjamin	PERSON	-LRB-
Fayard	ORGANIZATION	.

		In English translation , published by Brentano -RRB- ; `` L' Argot des Tranchees , '' by
L. Saineav	PERSON	-LRB- Fontenoy -RRB- ; `` Ma Piece , '' by
Paul Lin	PERSON	- tier -LRB-
Plon	LOCATION	-RRB- ; `` Les Vagabonds de la Gloire , '' by
Rene Milan	PERSON	-LRB-
Plon	LOCATION	-RRB- ; `` Sur la Voie Glorieuse , '' by
Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Champion -RRB- .

		Himself a publisher , my lieutenant includes only one of his own books in this list .

		All the same , he tells me that he is issuing more books than usual this season books in all fields , but espe - cially in philosophy and linguistics and other learned subjects remote from the war .

		`` Probably I 'll lose money , '' says he , `` but that does n't matter much .

		The essential thing is that we Frenchmen should show the world that we do not cease to be civilized , even when obliged to fight very hard for our civilization . ''

		My lieutenant 's list of books expresses a strong tendency toward works of a religious nature , though he shows his catholicity by naming first on his list a book by a writer whose wife charms the audiences of the Metropolitan Opera in
New York	LOCATION	.

		I have not read either of the books I am about to name , but another friend of mine , to whom I have shown the list given above , protests against the omission of `` Lettres d'un Soldat '' -LRB- Chapelet -RRB- and
Gaston Riou	PERSON	's `` Journal d'un Simple Soldat '' -LRB-
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Incidentally , I doubt if my lieuten - ant 's list of the best recent books would have included so many works of a mystical or pseudo - devotional ` temper , had he been drawing one up , say , in
1913	DATE	.

		But then , not so many were being published in that year !

		`` Gaspard , '' by
Rene Benjamin	PERSON	, is the story of a snail vendor in the rue de la
Gaite	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	.

		But snail vendors , too , were mobilized , so
Gaspard	PERSON	goes to war ... According to the Abbe
Ernest Dim	PERSON	- ' net , `` it is such a vivid piece of literature that undoubtedly it will be used as a document by future historians with as much reason as ` La Chartreuse de Parme . ' ''

		`` The poilu , '' maintains the Abbe , `` lives in those rich pages , unblurred by any inter - ference of literary or poetic embellishment . ''

		Yet `` Gaspard '' is not a favorite with some French soldiers of my acquaintance .

		They say it expresses less of the
France	LOCATION	of to-day than of the ante-bellum republic and the earlier tradition of heroism .

		-LRB- `` Gaspard '' was written while the war was young . -RRB-

		Perhaps
M. Benjamin	PERSON	has been a victim of too much praise .

		He has been labelled by silly persons `` the French Kipling '' !

		But Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, admit - ting that the book contains `` whole pages of Pari - sian slang , '' adds that it `` arouses the same sensa - tion on the Thames as on the Seine . ''

		While the Abbe Dimnet , in the
London	LOCATION	`` New Witness , '' affirms that `` not only the slang , but also the bouquet of it , baffles both description and transla - tion . ''

		Yet an essay has been made at translation .

		So far as I know , only two of the other books on my lieutenant 's list have , as yet anyway , been translated .

		One of the books translated is the poet
Charles le Goffic	PERSON	's account of the self - sacrificing Breton marines at
Dixmude	LOCATION	, and of how two regiments of them held off 40,000 Ger - mans for ten days .

		This heroic tale , `` The Epic of Dixmude , '' has been issued by
Heinemann	PERSON	.

		Some would classify `` Gaspard '' as the only out - and-out piece of fiction on the list given above , though obviously young
M. Geraldy	PERSON	's book has much of the value of fiction .

		Perhaps
M. Ben	PERSON	- jamin 's books for he has written a later one , `` Sous le Ciel de
France	LOCATION	, '' a veritable revelation of war-time
France	LOCATION	behind the front , a compre - hensive view of men and women , soldiers and civ - ilians are , with his friend
M. Geraldy	PERSON	's , the most French of them all .

		Certainly they reveal the brave and stoical spirit of the Republic more richly , and more realistically , too , than many more pretentious excursions into psychology and ro - mance .

		I am especially struck by the intellectual honesty of
M. Geraldy	PERSON	, his typically French hor - ror of heroics .


M. Geraldy	PERSON	is only thirty-one years of age .

		His untranslated poems have something of the charm of Musset 's own .

		To-day , he too , like
M. Benjamin	PERSON	, wears the uniform , though no longer at the actual front .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 179 POETRY IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		ANTHOLOGY OF MAGAZINE VERSE ,
1916	DATE	.

		By
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Laurence J. Gomme	PERSON	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Like the poor , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's `` Anthol - ogy '' is always with us : a year has passed , another myriad or so of magazines has fallen from the press , and once more Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite has scoured them all , and gives us the result in these one hundred and eighty-four pages .

		What new thing can be said of it ?

		It does not change .

		It is six pages shorter than last year ; it selects for special praise only fifteen , instead of thirty-five , books of verse , both of which abridgments are for the better .

		But whether through inability or unwillingness , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	seems no nearer learning that there can be little excuse for an anthology which does not select .

		Once more we have the clarion preface -LRB- a clarion uncertainly played -RRB- proclaiming that the present era of American poetry is to be com - pared with the Elizabethan and other great eras ; a solemn catalogue of names held illus - trious ; and once more the verse itself follows on this with a harshly negative answer .

		Is there any use in merely abusing Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	for the many inaccuracies and hasty superficialities in his preface for his cool assertion that Mr.
Pound	PERSON	is the idol of those nimble acrobats who whirl and tumble through the pages of `` Others '' ; that `` Poetry '' is Mr.
Pound	PERSON	's organ of radicalism ; that Mr.
Kreymborg	PERSON	is the one poet produced by the `` Others '' group , or Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	the one poet produced by the Imagist group ; or that
Masters	ORGANIZATION	,
Frost	ORGANIZATION	,
Oppenheim	PERSON	,
Robinson	PERSON	, and Miss Branch dominate each a group-ten - dency ?

		We have learned , I hope , to expect this sort of thing , and to discount it .

		We know that the affair is not so simple as this .

		We watch Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	sliding over the smooth surface , and smile .

		But none the less , if we are to help poetry at all in this wilder - ness , we can not rest content with amusement .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	is a standing warning to us that we must keep our wits about us ; if every word that falls from Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's lips is a pearl of eulogy , we on our part must be prepared to utter toads of censure .

		It is difficult to compare one of these an - thologies with another .

		The editor professes to see an improvement , to be sure , but if there is any , it is unimportant .

		What we can say clearly is that this year 's volume , like last year 's , is for the most part filled with the jog - trot of mediocrity .

		One must wade through pages and pages of mawkishness , dul - ness , artificiality , and utter emptiness to come upon the simple dignity of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's `` Lincoln '' -LRB- marred by a faintly perfumed close -RRB- , or the subdued , colloquial tenderness of Mr.
Frost	PERSON	's `` Home-Stretch , '' or the sin - ister pattern of `` The Hill - Wife , '' or Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's delicately imagined '' City of Falling Leaves . ''

		What else stands out ?

		Here and there are pleasant lines , stanzas , poems , but for the most part one gets an impression of amateurishness , of simply lines and lines and lines , all of them a little conscious of the fact that they are iambic , or dactylic , or ana - passtic , or trochaic , or prose , all of them a little uneasy about their rhymes , their ideas , or the appalling necessity of somehow coming to an end .

		Here we have poets who , with quaint solemnity , tell us of `` minstrelsy as rich as wine , as sweet as oil , '' who `` parley '' with stars , or confess to having `` tears of awful wonder '' run `` adown '' their cheeks , or describe the song of the swallows as their `` spill , '' or proclaim themselves `` cousin to the mud , '' or ask us to `` list ! ''

		when they mean listen ; and it is left to Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	to reach the height of bathos in asking God , when the rosy world first learned to ' crawl About the floor of heaven , wert thou not proud ?

		What is one to say to all this this inane falsifying and posturing , this infantile lack of humor or ordinary intelligence ?

		How does it happen that it is only a scant dozen times in the course of these 184 pages that we find anything like a profound approach to the problems of our lives , or a serene and propor - tioned understanding of them , or a passionate rebellion at them , or anything , in fact , but clutters of thin sentiment , foolishly expressed , and dusty concatenations of petty irrelevan - cies ?

		Is it Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's fault ; or is it because we have nothing better to offer ?

		Is there , then , any poetry being written in this country which we can hopefully put beside the recent work of the English poets the work of
Lascelles Abercrombie	ORGANIZATION	,
Wilfrid Gib	ORGANIZATION	- son ,
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare , or
Masefield	PERSON	?

		I think we can make an affirmative answer ; and in so doing , of course , we condemn at once the method employed by Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	in the compilation of his yearly anthology .

		For , as has already been said many times to Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	, it is comparatively seldom that any of our magazines print poetry .

		Of verse , to be sure , free or formal , they print any amount : they are stifled with it .

		In some measure they have tried to respond to the wave of enthusiasm for poetry which has risen in
America	LOCATION	during the
last three years	DATE	, but they have proved pathetically inadequate .

		What , after all , could they do ?

		Magazines can thrive only by reaching the greatest pos - sible number .

		And the one essential rule for reaching the greatest possible number is to 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	hold fast to tradition , whether ethical or lit - erary , to avoid anything even remotely in the nature of subversion ; or , if it becomes neces - sary through competition to advance , to ad - vance with the utmost caution .

		Then , too , there are the editors .

		Editors .

		are peren - nially , historically , middle-aged .

		Their radi - calisms , if they ever had any , are always recalled as youthful indiscretions .

		Their ideas were formed twenty years ago , and it is not strange that they should rebel violently at all changes , bad and good .

		The formal sonnet , sprinkled with `` thou 's '' and `` thee 's '' and exclamatory `` O 's , '' preferably calling upon the spirit of a nation , or addressed to a dead poet , or anything else dead , is to them the supreme gift .

		The exalted ode , clanking in conceited mail , pressing with horrible Latin - ose feet upon the forlornest of old ghosts of ideas , is a close second .

		And after these come the numberless hosts of the ephemeral sen - timental , all that we have been taught to consider good and true , brave and sweet .

		It becomes apparent , therefore , that if we are to find poetry in
America	LOCATION	to-day we must look for it outside the magazines in books .

		And this , of course , is where we do find it , such as it is .

		There can be no question that had Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	composed his anthology from books , instead of from magazines , it could have been one thousand per cent better .

		It is not certain that Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	could have done it , to be sure , for Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	is not by endowment a critic : the evidence before us in this `` Anthology '' for
1916	DATE	is dumbly to the effect that Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	is incredibly undiscriminating .

		What else can we say of the man who in his list of the fifteen best books of the year -LRB- we hope that next year it will be five ! -RRB-

		omits
Fletcher	PERSON	's `` Gob - lins and Pagodas , ''
Masefield	PERSON	's `` Good Fri - day , '' Masters 's `` The Great Valley , '' de la Mare 's `` The Listeners , ''
William H. Davies	PERSON	's `` Poems , '' the second `` Imagist Anthology , ''
Kreymborg	PERSON	's `` Mushrooms , '' and
Sandburg	PERSON	's `` Chicago Poems , '' while he includes the very inferior `` Songs and Satires '' of
Masters	ORGANIZATION	, `` War and Laughter '' by
James Oppenheim	PERSON	, `` Harvest Moon '' by
Josephine Preston Pea	PERSON	- body , and other works by
Bliss Carman	PERSON	, Ade - laide
Crapsey	PERSON	,
Amelia Burr	PERSON	,
Charles Whar	PERSON	- ton
Stork	ORGANIZATION	, and
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	?

		This is the plainest sort of critical blindness .

		It is here not a question of being conservative or radical it is a question of good taste .

		A study of these juxtapositions will make it only too painfully clear .

		If we are to take seriously , therefore , Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's enthusiasms over contemporary American poetry , as expressed in his preface , and in his critical summaries at the end of his volume , we begin to realize that he has damaged his case at the outset by restricting himself to such verse as gets into the maga - zines .

		It must be obvious to anyone that any such selection does our poe.ts a serious injus - tice : it is not , and in the nature of things can not be , fairly representative of our best .

		The basic principle is wrong .

		For that we have poets now who deserve to be taken seri - ously , even if they are not Shakespeares , there certainly can be far less question than there was even two years ago .

		In two years how much has happened !

		In the
autumn of 1914	DATE	,
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	and Mr.
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	first made themselves clearly heard .

		In the
spring of 1915	DATE	, one after another , came the first `` Imagist Anthology , '' Masters 's `` Spoon River , '' Frost 's `` North of
Boston	LOCATION	, ''
Fletch	PERSON	- er 's `` Irradiations . ''

		And in
1916	DATE	, a year in which for the first time in our literary history more volumes of poetry and drama were pub - lished than of any other class , we saw the publication of
Fletcher	PERSON	's `` Goblins and Pago - das , '' the second `` Imagist Anthology , '' the `` Others Anthology , ''
Sandburg	PERSON	's `` Chicago Poems , ''
Kreymborg	PERSON	's `` Mushrooms , '' Mas - ters 's `` Songs and Satires '' and `` The Great Valley , ''
Amy Lowell	PERSON	's `` Men , Women , and Ghosts , '' Frost 's `` Mountain Interval , '' and
Robinson	PERSON	's `` Man Against the Sky . ''

		Of all these ,
Edwin Arlington Robinson	PERSON	is the only one who clearly reaches back into the period before
1914	DATE	.

		Of the others , nearly all had been writing , and one or two had tentatively published ; but in the main they are poets who have reached their maturity within two years .

		What are we to say of these poets , and of their poetry ?

		No mortal , of course , can say finally , `` this is good and will endure '' ; or `` this is bad and will perish . ''

		Any opinion must be personal , rooted in profound and for the most part unconscious predilections and prejudices , obscured with biases of friendship or the opposite , confused with questions of social , ethical , or philosophical character ; and my own opinion , quite as much as Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite 's , is a ganglion of just such factors , and just as much to be guarded against and dis - counted .

		But having made this candid con - fession of our all-too-humanness , let us be candid in our opinions also .

		To begin with , we must face squarely the unpleasant fact that , both in and out of the public press , we have been very seriously overestimating the work of contemporary poets : enthusiasm for poetry , and an intense and long-suppressed desire to see it flourish in
America	LOCATION	, have played the deuce with our judgments .

		In too many cases the wish has been father to the thought .

		Not only have we
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 181 been undiscriminating , applauded the false as loudly as the true , but we have persisted in a sort of wilful blindness to the many and obvious faults of even our best .

		Bad leader - ship , of course , has conduced to this .

		We have had no critics whom we could trust .

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	and Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	, to both of whom we all owe more than we can say , have , when all is said and done , been better drum-bangers than critics .

		Both have been somewhat insular in outlook , intolerant of all that is a little alien to them , intolerant to each other , and somewhat amusingly determined to find `` great '' American poets .

		Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	and Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	, both ubiquitous review - ers , the more elusive because so many of their reviews are unsigned , are equally limited , intellectually , and leave always the savor of cult or clique in their pronouncements .

		Two critics we have who stand clear of axe-grind - ing and nepotism , who analyze sharply , who delight to use words as poniards Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	of `` The Smart Set '' and Mr.
Firkins	PERSON	of `` The Nation '' ; but with these the misfortune is that they are essentially of the older order , and have an embarrassing tender - ness for all that is sentimental , politely ro - mantic , formal , and ethically correct .

		The balance of power , therefore , has been with the praisers , with
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, whose `` Poetry '' has manifested a tendency to become a sort of triumphal car for the poets of the West and
Middle West	LOCATION	, with Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	, whose `` Transcript '' reviews have seemed at times to become a wholesale business in laurel wreaths , and with others , less fortunate in their power , of the same nature .

		And in con - sequence , even the most cautious of us have been in spite of ourselves somewhat infected by the prevailing idolatries .

		It has become habitual to accept , unpleasant to censure .

		When we criticize at all , we condemn utterly ; when we praise , we sing panegyrics .

		There has been no middle course of balanced and impartial analysis , no serene perspective , above all , no taste .

		It almost seems as if we have not been long enough civilized , as if there were too much still undigested or indigestible in our environment We have therefore a group of myths among us , some or all of them conflicting , and sedu - lously encouraged by the publishers .

		A vague notion is abroad that
Frost	ORGANIZATION	,
Masters	ORGANIZATION	,
Eobin	PERSON	- son ,
Lindsay	PERSON	,
Fletcher	PERSON	,
Miss Lowell	PERSON	, and others still who have not been quite so successful , are , if not great poets , at any rate brilliantly close to it .

		Whether this is true or not , need not at once concern us .

		What becomes im - portant for us , in the circumstances , is to realize that if these poets are as commanding as we think them to be , it is time for us to stop spattering them with unmixed praise which we do under the quaint delusion that we are writing serious articles upon them and look at them , for once , with more of the scientist 's eye , and less of the lover 's .

		We need to remind ourselves that they are flesh and blood , as liable to failures and mistakes as ourselves , constantly and sometimes desper - ately struggling for a precarious foothold , sometimes driven to foolishness by the keen - ness of the competition , sometimes exhausted by it .

		What compels them to do what they do ?

		What faults result from this , and what virtues ?

		What can we expect of them ?

		This is the sort of question we should be getting ready to ask them .

		Turning upon them from
this quarter	DATE	, we should at once find them looking a little less imposing .

		We should begin to see first of all one great and glaring characteristic of prac - tically all American poets : that , though rich in invention , they are poor in art .

		Exceptions to this there are , notably ,
Edwin Arlington Kobinson	PERSON	, who , perhaps , in other respects pays the penalty .

		But in the main that stigma touches them all .

		Most conspicuous in the work of Mr.
Masters	PERSON	and
Miss Lowell	PERSON	, it is by no means restricted to them alone , few , if any , escape it .

		No clearer line of cleav - age divides contemporary American poetry from contemporary English : we may prefer the greater richness and variety of the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can , its greater relentlessness in search of realities ; but the instant we turn to the English we feel a certain distinction , a cer - tain intellectual and -LSB- esthetic ease and free - dom , no matter on what plane whether in the clear lyrics of de la Mare and
Hodgson	PERSON	and
Davies	PERSON	and
Aldington	LOCATION	, or the strange , powerful , almost labored psychological epi - sodes of
Gibson	PERSON	, or the intellectual spacious - ness and tortuous energy of
Abercrombie	ORGANIZATION	.

		And this lack of distinction , this inability of our poets to make their inventions works of art , to speak with that single-toned authen - ticity which arises from perfect expression , constitutes the most serious menace against their possible survival .

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	is our most consistent performer , of course , we can place him over against the English poets akin to him without blushing .

		And Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	, too , is in this respect dependable , though he tends to jingle , does not command the power or the lyric beauty of the others , and abuses his trick of veiled implications .

		After this , we are in the dark .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	,
Fletcher	PERSON	,
Masters	ORGANIZATION	, have all done brilliant work in their kinds , but even the best of it is marred by strange artistic blindnesses .

		They can not be counted upon .

		They write prose with one hand and poetry with the other , and half the 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	time know not what they do .

		If one moment they select carefully , the next moment they empty cartloads .

		They seem forever uncer - tain whether to sing or to talk , and conse - quently try sometimes to do both at once .

		The plain fact is that we are passing through a period of ferment , a period of un - certainty , experiment , transition .

		A great variety of intellectual energies has been simultaneously catalyzed by a great variety of stimuli , and the result inevitably has been chaos .

		Realists have sprung up , reverent as well as irreverent ; romanticists have sprung up , radical as well as conventional ; and in addition to these major groups have risen detached individuals difficult to classify , and other groups heterogeneously composed .

		Ex - periment is the order of the day .

		Desper - ation to say the last word , to go farthest , to dissolve tradition and principle in the most brilliant self-consciousness , has led to literary pranks and freaks without number .

		Occa - sionally this has borne good results , more often it has merely startled .

		The bizarre has frequently been mistaken for the subtle ; plain and unselective treatment has been too often considered realism .

		The Imagists , straying too far in search of flowers of vividness and color , have ended by losing themselves in a Plutonian darkness of unrelated sensory phe - nomena : they predicate a world of sharply separate entities without connective tissue of relationship , and , in addition , have sacrificed a large part of their power to convey this vision by their unwillingness or inability to heighten their readers ' receptiveness through playing upon it rhythmically .

		Members of the `` Others '' group -LRB- if Mr.
Kreymborg	PERSON	will permit it to be so called -RRB- have sometimes seemed determined to revert to the holophras - tic method of self-expression which antedated the evolution of analytical self-expression and language .

		At its worst , the result has been captivating nonsense ; at its best , it gives us the peculiarly individual semi-poems of Wal - lace
Stevens	PERSON	and
Maxwell Bodenheim	ORGANIZATION	.

		This has been the background of rapid changes and experimentation , extravagance , over-decorativeness , variety , and fearless en - trance into the very penetralia of life against which our major group of Frost , Mas - ters ,
Fletcher	PERSON	,
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, and
Robinson	PERSON	have made themselves clear .

		They can not be detached from that background .

		They are constantly modifying it , and being modified by it .

		A process of mutual protective color - ation , of co-adaptation , is constantly going on .

		Where they fear , they imitate .

		In conse - quence we should expect to find the faults as well as the virtues of the background repeated in the protagonists , and we do .

		With the exception of Mr.
Frost	PERSON	-LRB- and even he has been slightly infected on the metrical side -RRB- and Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	, our leading poets , one and all , seem to be writing with a constantly shifting set of values in mind : their eyes are on their audience and on their rival poets , but seldom if ever on eternal principles .

		The result is a kaleidoscopic effect of shifting viewpoints , and it has become typical of our most typical poets that their work seems to proceed not from one centre , but from many .

		Now it is lyric , now it is narrative , now dramatic , or philosophic , or psychological and as the mood fluctuates so does the vehicle chosen , from the most formal through successively more loosely organized modes to the gnomic prose of `` Spoon River '' or `` The Ghosts of an
Old House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Our poets have not quite found themselves .

		They are casting about for something , they do not know what , and have not found it .

		And more than anything else it is this fact that gives their work that unfinished , hurried quality , impatient and restless , rapidly unselective , which makes it appear , beside English work , lacking in dis - tinction .

		Like the
spring	DATE	torrent , it is still muddy .

		It would be foolish to lament this fact .

		The
spring	DATE	freshet has its compensations of power and fulness .

		It would be equally fool - ish to delude ourselves about it , to imagine that we are already in the middle of a Golden Age ; up to the present point it is , rather , an age of brass , of bombast and self-trumpet - ings .

		In the meantime , we can look to the future with considerable confidence that out of the present unprincipled chaos , rich in energies , we shall yet create a harmony .

		And we can take comfort in a relatively serene belief that Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's `` Anthology of Magazine Verse '' very seriously misrepresents or , rather , hardly represents at all the true state of poetry in
America	LOCATION	to-day .

		PSYCHOLOGY AND WAR .

		THE PSYCHOLOGY OP THE GREAT WAR .

		By
Gustave Le Bon	PERSON	.

		Translated by
E. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	. -RRB-

		With this attractive title and the distinc - tion of the author in mind , one 's first query is whether this is a study by a French psy - chologist or by a psychological Frenchman .

		The answer must be given in favor of the latter , and with regret ; for the former offers the greater opportunity for a notable achieve - ment .

		The book is shot through -LRB- to use a Jamesian phrase that now bears an unex - pected meaning -RRB- with psychological comment
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 183 and interpretation , but does not rise to a unified apergu of the world-calamity .

		It is consistently and pardonably French ; it sets forth the scope and enormity of the German violations of territory , obligations , and moral sanctions in no uncertain terms .

		Nor is there in such an attitude any viola - tion of a scientific neutrality .

		If the actual conflict is that of a highwayman and his victim , there is no sense in treating it psycho - logically or otherwise as though it were a duel on a point of honor between gentlemen .

		If the etiquette of diplomatic relations which must somehow be sustained if the world is to go on as it is requires a formal acceptance of allegations and arguments presented by one great nation to another , no such rule is bind - ing upon the scientific student of their actual deeds and observable or inferable motives .

		Actions speak not only louder but , what is more significant , more clearly than words .

		The student of the phenomena of the war goes directly to the facts , precisely as in the con - sideration of any less momentous problem .

		The diplomatic documents form but a single phase of the data , to be interpreted with due allowance for the conventional code which they use .

		The psychologist may be expected to be objective ; and so far as M. Le Bon lapses from that attitude which he does fre - quently and with satisfaction he substitutes the Frenchman for the psychologist .

		To de - scribe the events as though they occurred upon the planet Mars between nations X and nations Y would suggest a fictitious objectiv - ity .

		None the less , to the psychologist it matters little who does what in this great war ; his interpretation aims to be impersonal .

		Yet he constantly consults his subjective `` Who 's Who among the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	, '' by which process alone he maintains a realistic touch .

		If the task is impossible , there is no less credit in the attempt .

		Consistently with his views upon social psy - chology , M. Le Bon ascribes great weight to the `` affective , collective and mystic forces , and the part they play in the life of nations . ''

		They sway sentiment and control action in the economic activities of peace , and come to the fore in other forms but with unaltered psy - chology in times of war .

		Racial tendencies , mob influences , cultivated ideals with a mystic infusion are traceable in the psychic war zones .

		They may not make war , but they are counted upon to support it , and they deter - mine its conduct .

		The first and largest psy - chological effect is the transformation that comes over the individual character when the collective national influence plays over it .

		This effect is by no means limited to , or even best expressed in , the transformation of the shopkeeper or the artisan into the poilu , the complete change in environment , occupa - tion , outlook , from an orderly and secure little commercial living to an imposed subjection to venture , danger , torture , and privation ; it is just as characteristic in those who stay at home and attain an inner conversion to a different set of values .

		What war sets free is determined by the qualities that races cherish or encourage .

		War makes one transformation in a Frenchman and quite another in a
Prus	PERSON	- sian , because of the difference in what has been cultivated in the two , by generations of ideals and social institutions .

		-LRB- What differ - ence of racial fitness for cultivation may parallel or direct ideals , or account for them , is another question . -RRB-

		Accordingly M. Le Bon goes to the histor - ical account of the formation of the German Empire as well as to accredited analyses of German traits in older generations , to find the basis for the amazing form which the martial transformation has produced in Ger - many .

		It is a psychological product acting through a political machinery .

		To
M. Le Bon	PERSON	's mind it presents the invasion of Bel - gium , the contempt for the word of honor , the cruelty to foe , the unspeakable intimidation , the massacre of the innocent , not as incom - prehensible paradoxes , but as natural issues of cultivated ideals , and a reversion to raw nature made possible by subserviency and an underlying persistent imperviousness to the life of refinement and restraint which civiliza - tion imposes .

		Such action is inferred to be not inherently , or at least violently , antagon - istic to the racial will , nor to the officially responsible wills which reflect even as they count upon the folk-psychology .

		As corrobo - rative evidence M. Le Bon cites the intellectual apologies for the war and its conduct , and the amazing doctrines of Teutonic megalomania ; for all this is as significant a transformation of the peaceful Teutonic psychology as that observable in the trenches .

		Clearly the psy - chologist has but one alternative : to hold either that the war spirit can completely rev - olutionize and unmake , or that the war spirit can but release what the controlled life of peace restrains .

		The charge in either case may be equally colossal and infernal , but M. Le Bon accepts the latter ; for there is a limit to the affective , collective , and mystic in - fluences , powerful as they are .

		The psychology of the feelings and reactions roused by the war in the several countries is reviewed ; the cumulative effect of a collective , all-absorbing occupation , obliterating social distinctions and binding men in a new com - munity , is added to the racial genius and finds composite expression .

		This is at once familiar 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	and not readily summarized .

		The psychology of those officially responsible for the war offers a very different application of principles .

		The inability of official
Germany	LOCATION	to understand the national psychology of other peoples , and the mistakes of other nations in failing to gauge the effect of omissions and commissions are commented upon .

		This is a contribution to the psychology of diplomacy , of psycholog - ical strategy on an international scale .

		In so complex an application , much of the action covers controversial ground .

		Admissions are affected by more than the personal unwilling - ness to admit error ; they involve motive , cal - culation , the offset of policy and honor , the prestige of nations , the fear of unfair advan - tage , the effect upon the morale of citizens , and all the complex conflicts between morality and desire in the national drama .

		Really to understand , to disentangle fact from fable , and unearth deep-seated motives , one would need at the least a psycho-analysis of the responsible individuals and a frankness of statement unknown in such circles .

		Another set of considerations centres about the psychology of modern warfare ; and this material is readily treated with a fair objec - tivity .

		M. Le Bon has interesting suggestions to offer upon the psychology of courage , the place of habit in deadening sensibility to suf - fering and sympathy alike , the intimate effect of the trench life and the lack of opportunity which modern warfare presents for the de - velopment of older types of pugnacity , the genesis of the hero , and the weaknesses of the soldier .

		The interest returns to as indeed it hardly leaves the psychological forces that make war possible , the animosities , prejudices , differences of ideals , incompatibilities of tem - perament that precipitate feuds and turmoils in all relations , and become gigantic when written in the colossal proportions of modern national clashes .

		What is really responsible for them ?

		How can they be avoided ?

		Is civilization built upon a smouldering volcano , which sooner or later must break through in the eruption of war ?

		Fundamentally this is a question of the machinery for the political control of national wills ; yet equally is it a question of the direction of national psychol - ogy .

		M. Le Bon believes that a relatively slight change in - sentiment would go far to ensure security .

		He sees in no national ideal , except the German , any menace to interna - tional cooperation ; and in his conciliatory mood , he concedes to the German an equal possibility of attaining to the same attitude .

		He intimates though not clearly that the German people may promptly recover from what he pronounces to be a mental aberra - tion .

		Collective
Germany	LOCATION	is for the time mad .

		No more convincing sign of this madness is to be found than in the pronouncements of intel - lectuals , the persistent denial of unmistakable evidence , the acceptance of delusions of special providence , and the host of minor irra - tionalities that follow in their train .

		How the restoration to sanity is to be accomplished is not indicated .

		Doubtless the impression of such a review is that
M. Le Bon	PERSON	's patriotism has run away with his judicial reserve ; and that the French psychologist is finding consolation in a manner no more justified than that by which the Ger - man philosopher finds vindication for his national ambitions .

		To remove that impres - sion the reader must assume the responsibility of a direct acquaintance with the whole of
M. Le Bon	ORGANIZATION	's argument .

		He will find it sat - urated with loyalty , but not blindly ; he will find running through it a sanity of compre - hension that may lead to irrelevance but not to injustice ; and he will observe a sincere objective intent .

		At the best the volume suffers from a lack of singleness of purpose and from the desire to write at once a state - ment of a case and a psychological analysis .

		M. Le Bon and his readers are both too near the canvas to gauge the proper effect .

		Upon the artist rests the greater responsibility .

		In view of the peculiarly meagre contributions that in any way illuminate the psychology of the war , and equally of the fact that so many writers admit and emphasize that the psycho - logical causes are the significant ones , the essay of
M. Le Bon	ORGANIZATION	attains an importance which his reputation presages and his per - formance confirms .


JOSEPH JASTROW	PERSON	.

		A BOOK OF MASKS .

		MEN OF LETTERS .

		By
Dixon Scott	PERSON	.

		With an introduction by
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		How these young Englishmen can write !

		Wherein lies the explanation of that friendly richness of humor , that half-laughing , half - eager , wholly rejoicing cleverness of phrase , which so many of them know the trick of , and which we Americans , of their generation , are so without ?

		Not that we imitate it ; we cultivate assiduously another style , not a bit less conscious , rather less robust ; but we are hard where they are human , stiff instead of resilient .


Dixon Scott	PERSON	died on
October 23 , 1915	DATE	, on a hospital ship near
Gallipoli	LOCATION	, whither he had gone as a Lieutenant in the
Eoyal Field Artillery	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is natural enough that readers
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 185 -LRB- and publishers -RRB- should halo the young man who having lived for letters dies for his coun - try ; of course the case of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	recurs to memory .

		Brooke was a creative artist ;
Scott	PERSON	is , to all appearances , a critic .

		That which I find most striking in
Scott	LOCATION	's work too , however , is its imaginative power .

		He too is a creator ; a fictionist , if you will , whose characters , named
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and
Wells	PERSON	, and Kipling and
Barrie	PERSON	, are as truly the children of imagination as
Becky Sharp	ORGANIZATION	or Boon .

		Booh is indeed an excellent example of what I mean ; I am glad I thought of Boon .

		Scott 's
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and
Barrie	PERSON	and Kipling are , like Boon , not living men , though they pretend to be , but men who are alive .

		Shaw is not innocent , but when I read `` The Innocence of
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	'' I accept him absolutely ; Kipling is not meek , but in `` The Meekness of Rudyard Kipling ' ' I find a delightful character ; a man I can love .

		Think of loving the real Rudyard !

		The light of
Scott	PERSON	's imagination shines through those crimson pages till it throws warm gules even upon the calculating breast of
England	LOCATION	's fiercest Jingo .

		All of these characters of
Scott	PERSON	's are lovable .

		Lamb said once that of all `` the persons one would wish to have met '' he would choose
Fulke Greville	PERSON	, the friend of Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	.

		Lamb gave a whimsical reason ; may not his actual reason have been that
Greville	PERSON	is remembered as a friend ?

		For that reason at least I should like to have met
Dixon Scott	PERSON	; for his amazing friendliness .

		Keen , clever , spirited , and young , he sees nevertheless that which is sweet and fine in men , as most keen , clever , spirited young men can not ; sees even , as I say , what is not there , and from his vision builds a splendid figure .

		Of course his method is to some extent of parodox , the Chestertonian .

		Turn inside out the ordinary view , and you have the ground - work of your construction .

		The monotony of this method , and one must say also the frank imitation of its style , are indeed
Scott	PERSON	's chief defects .

		Sentence after sentence in `` Men of Letters '' might have proceeded from the fat man 's pen .

		It is Trafford meekly earning guineas by lectur - ing because his wife has not studied Domestic Economy who is monstrous and unreal ; it is the airship falling out of heaven like a miracle that observes the true modesty of nature .

		It is when the novelist says `` I know no more than you what will happen , we are all children together '' that he is on the brink of making revelations .

		Sometimes I half believe
Scott	PERSON	imitated the phraseology of each man he wrote of there is a sentence , for instance , on page 105 , in the essay on
Henry James	PERSON	, which is pure
James	PERSON	.

		`` And since its avowed purpose , as plainly specified in the charter-party pasted on the poop -LRB- by which one only means the title on the cover -RRB- , is to provide not a triumphant imitation of high poopery , but a safe passage home to the reader 's conscious - ness and memory for the two noble personal - ities it names , then it is surely perfectly evi - dent that if the event be judged honestly in the light of its own aims and terms we have no option but to write it down a partial fail - ure . ''

		And I could quote a dozen others not only from this essay but from that on
Barrie	PERSON	in the style of
Barrie	LOCATION	, that on
Alice Meynell	PERSON	in dainty Alice-blue .

		On the whole , however ,
Scott	PERSON	is chiefly Chestertonian in touch .

		But he is always
Dixon Scott	PERSON	in feeling sweep - ingly , certainly , convincingly enthusiastic the perfect friend .

		Of course his enthusiasm leads him into an occasional excess .

		James , for example , wrote `` prose probably unsurpassed since Shake - speare 's , '' and yet
Scott	PERSON	is `` soberly convinced that the prose of
Alice Meynell	PERSON	is absolutely the most perfect produced in our language for at least the last twenty years . ''

		It led him into an excess of emphasis , indeed , on form in general .

		Sometimes he can not see the wood of his subject for the trees of technique .

		The
Sunday	DATE	following
Italy	LOCATION	's declaration of war I spent at a Belgian chateau near Ant - werp .

		The news of the declaration of war came to us early in the
evening	TIME	, at the dinner hour in fact , and our host read it aloud to us at the dinner table .

		His voice trembled as he read , and when he finished a long silence fell .

		186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	`` Wo n't they propose a toast to
Italy	LOCATION	? ''

		I whispered to my vis-a-vis like myself , a del - egate of the
Commission for Relief	ORGANIZATION	in Bel - gium .

		`` I do n't think so .

		Look at their faces , '' he added .

		Not one at that table expressed pleasure that a fresh power had enlisted on the side of the Allies !

		Not a Belgian there and they were all sincere patriots but was thinking of the deluge of human suffering and death and destruction which
Italy	LOCATION	's entrance into the danse macabre had loosed upon a new quarter of the world .

		The toast to the suc - cess of their new ally was never proposed .

		I am reminded of this incident on reading the late
Emile Waxweiler	PERSON	's ``
Belgium	LOCATION	and the Great Powers . ''

		For those whose faith in the honor and good sense of publicists abroad British , French , and Italian , as well as Ger - man has been shaken by the evidence of the war , will find their faith restored by lis - tening to this Belgian voice .

		Only a Belgian , I think , and a Belgian in the territory seized by the Germans , could write with the heart - breaking sanity and courage which this vol - ume shows .

		There is not one word of bitterness or cruelty in its pages .

		It is irre - sistibly fair .

		It is no recapitulation of stale facts , however .

		Like ``
Belgium	LOCATION	, Neutral and Loyal , '' it is news , much of which will aston - ish American readers .

		* Now that Professor Waxweiler is dead , one may fitly sum up in a review of ``
Belgium	LOCATION	, Neutral and Loyal '' and ``
Belgium	LOCATION	and the Great Powers '' his service to his nation and to the world .


Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	, the great Belgian poet , one of the greatest poets of the nineteenth century , is dead , killed by a train at
Bouen	LOCATION	;
Emile Waxweiler	PERSON	, the patient ex - pounder of Belgian history , is also dead within the year ; Desire
Joseph	PERSON	, Cardinal
Mercier	PERSON	, the Catholic Primate of
Belgium	LOCATION	, alone of this trinity of leaders still lives .

		Waxweiler 's contribution was not the least made by these three men .

		He crystallized and placed in final form the evidence on behalf of
Belgium	LOCATION	a work which at the start of the war had incalculable effect on his own nation as well as upon liberal minds through - out the world .

		But
Waxweiler	PERSON	had his eye not merely on the present .

		He aimed at the future .

		That is why he denied himself the luxury of anathema and stuck close to the facts .

		Note this statement regarding Belgian neutrality : Now from the first days of the reign of
Leopold I.	PERSON	, the Sovereign and his Government had to impress upon their minds this dominating fact : if they wanted to guarantee the life of the country , it was necessary to give it a clearly independent position with regard to the three Powers whose proximity surrounded it with jealous influences .

		For
Belgium	LOCATION	the first con - dition of life was the balance of power , not so much , say , neutrality , the formula of doctrine , as equilibrium , the rule of action .

		Every tendency to favour one of the Powers at the expense of the other two inclined public opinion , by virtue of a true collective intuition , in the contrary direction ; every blow struck by one of the Powers at the national sovereignty led to a clear understanding with the others .

		In the same way , a mechanical system resting on three supports one of which should happen to give way , would only be main - tained if it righted itself in the direction of the other two .

		Again , quoting from the official report of the army command , he explains that when the Belgian mobilization was called , and be - fore the German note of
August	DATE	2nd was received , '' ` the 1st , 3rd , 4th and 5th divisions were placed respectively in each of the direc - tions from which danger could threaten Bel - gium : '' ` The
1st Division	ORGANIZATION	, or
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	division , faced
England	LOCATION	; '' ` The
3rd Division	ORGANIZATION	, or
Liege	LOCATION	division , faced
Germany	LOCATION	; '' ` The 4th and 5th Divisions looked toward
France	LOCATION	, the 4th being destined to face an attack upon
Namur	LOCATION	, the 5th an attack which should debouch from Maubeuge-Lille . ' ''

		-LRB- The 2nd and 6th divisions and the cavalry division remained at
Antwerp	LOCATION	and
Brussels	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		So much for the accusation that
Belgium	LOCATION	had already compromised her neutrality with
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		I have cited these extracts from ``
Belgium	LOCATION	and the Great Powers '' because they show
Waxweiler	PERSON	's attitude of mind and his method .

		His quotations are often startling , they are always interesting .

		His analysis is always candid and just .

		He refuses to look on the civilized world as a chessboard for diplomats , but equally he refuses to look at history as archives for devil 's advocates .

		And when books are forgotten , when the righteous , pas - sionate poetry of Verhaeren is no longer quoted , when
Cardinal Mercier	ORGANIZATION	's noble pas - toral letters are lost in dusty libraries , and when the name of Waxweiler has vanished from men 's memories , let us hope that some - thing of his critical statesmanship will have been built into the structure of the new and enduring
Belgium	LOCATION	and a more durable world .

		That , I think , is a thing which will be and which must be .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 187 PRIMITIVE MYTHOLOGY .

		THE MYTHOLOGY OF ALL EACES .

		Vol .

		IX .

		Oceanic .

		By
Koland B. Dixon	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Marshall Jones Co.	ORGANIZATION	; by subscription . -RRB-

		If primitive mythology is to be found any - where , it would surely seem that it might be among the scattered islands of the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	.

		Yet , stretching behind even the myths from the most isolated and undisturbed cor - ners of
Oceania	LOCATION	, one can see endless vistas of slow human development , while in the most evolved types of Polynesian cosmogony , for example , it is difficult not to believe them the expression of minds fully aware of modern theories of evolution , expressing itself in mythological symbols often of genuine poetic value .

		Moreover , one has the conviction that the more puerile myths often represent a de - generation from purer types of myth , rather than veritable primitive imagination .

		This might very well be , since , as Professor
Dixon	PERSON	emphasizes in the second volume to be issued of the `` Mythology of All Races , '' there is a bewildering composite of races in these islands , caused by migration upon migration from the mainland , as well as migrations between the many clustering islands of this veritable island continent .

		This has , of course , resulted in the mingling of many forms of primitive fancy .

		`` While this contact of race with race brings about development , it must be ad - mitted that it often tends to the coarsening of the imagination , a good example of which is to be found in the later mythology of
India	LOCATION	as compared with the songs of the `` Rig Veda . ''

		Though the mythology of
Oceania	LOCATION	turns out upon investigation to be far from primitive , it has no such richness and variety as that of the North American Indian .

		We question , however , whether a different treatment of the subject of Oceanic mythology might not have brought out more satisfactorily the very real fascination it possesses in some of its aspects , as those who have read Lord
Grey	PERSON	's `` Poly - nesian Mythology '' know .

		Professor
Dixon	PERSON	states in his introduction that he will venture upon no interpretation of any of the myths , and this determination is religiously adhered to , with the result that the reader finds him - self constantly longing for some illumi - nating critical appreciations .

		These need not necessarily be the turning of the stories into solar or lunar myths , or symbolical abstractions , as Professor
Dixon	PERSON	seems to think .

		He is quite right when he says the danger here is very great , but primitive myths cut off from any relationing to the primitive customs and rituals which must necessarily be reflected in them , lose all their meaning , since few of them , and least of all those of
Oceania	LOCATION	, can stand upon their pure literary value .

		On the other hand , primitive customs among these peoples , especially those of
Australia	LOCATION	, have remarkable interest in view of their remote origins , as brought out by
Frazer	PERSON	in his work on Totemism .

		A study of the relation of these customs to subsequent myth developments would put into them a vitality which they sadly need .

		Though Professor
Dixon	PERSON	has not to our mind treated the subject in the most inspiring fashion possible , too much can not be said of his painstaking scholarship , according to his own lights .

		He has hedged himself about so carefully with scholarly doubts in connec - tion with his own conclusions that there re - sults an unbounded sense of confidence in his judgment in those cases where he allows him - self to exercise it unrestrictedly .

		There are one or two aspects , especially of the mythology of the Polynesian peoples , which single out these primitive islanders as thinkers of no mean order .

		A scientific and philosophical bent of mind comes out in many of their cosmogonic myths .

		This type is de - fined by Professor
Dixon	PERSON	as the genealogical or evolutionary type .

		The essential elements of this form are summarized by him as fol - lows : In the beginning there was nothing but Po , a void or chaos , without light , heat or sound , without form or motion .

		Gradually vague stirrings began within the darkness , moanings and whisperings arose , and then , at first , faint as early dawn , the light appeared and grew until full day had come .

		Heat and moisture next developed , and from the interaction of these ele - ments came substance and form , ever becoming more and more concrete , until the solid earth and overarch - ing sky took shape and were personified as
Heaven Father and Earth Mother	ORGANIZATION	.

		After Heaven Father and Earth Mother have been attained , their offspring are the phe - nomena of nature and the myriad gods .

		The Polynesians had their creative myths as well as their evolutionary myths , and Pro- fessor
Dixon	PERSON	is inclined to think these be - longed to the genuine aborigines to whom a migrating race brought the remarkable evolu - tionary type .

		Possibly there are traces of Hindu influence in these .

		It has been stated that the distinctive characteristic of the Aryan mind is a belief in law or growth from within , while that of the Semitic mind is a belief in external creation and revelation .

		If the re - verse of this were also true , namely , that wherever you find the former , you may con - clude there have been Aryan migrations and 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	influence , and wherever the latter , Semitic migrations and influence , primitive man might be divided into these two races , for these two types of cosmogonic myths seem to have existed side by side from time imme - morial .

		Probably they are both pre-Aryan and pre-Semitic .

		The types may even have become fixed before our ancient emergence from our simian ancestors .

		Of Polynesian mythic heroes , the most fasci - nating is
Maui	LOCATION	, who has a whole cycle of legends attached to him with as many vari - ants as the mediaeval tales of
Arthur	PERSON	and his Knights .

		His chief exploits were the fishing up of the land and the snaring of the sun both , it may be remarked , not at all distinctive of
Maui	LOCATION	's skill , for many other primitive gods and demigods and animals have been recorded as doing the same thing .

		But
Maui	LOCATION	has be - come fixed in our minds as the supreme primi - tive type of sun-snarer , as Apollo represents sun mythology at its utmost sesthetic and phil - osophic flowering .

		Maui was also a fire - bringer .

		In fact , he was a culture hero who not only gave his race the land on which they lived , but discovered fire for them in the bowels of the earth .

		And evidently he flour - ished so long ago that he assisted at the slow - ing up of the earth 's rotation on its axis , or perhaps the precession of the equinoxes , cer - tainly suggested by the sun-snarer stories .

		Again we seem to have extraordinary knowl - edge or intuition of actual scientific occur - rences .

		In Melanesia the primitive mind seems to have become sociological rather than cosmo - logical , for here tales of culture heroes abound .

		The doings of these heroes are not , however , especially interesting , though the recognition in these tales of the existence in social life of forces making for good and evil shows penetration if not sesthetic imagination .

		The imagination of this region seems to ex - press itself more interestingly in drawings than in tales .

		A native drawing of a sea spirit shows a remarkable man-like creature with a fish for its head , and fishes for its hands and feet , while decorations of seaweed sprout from its knees and elbows .

		There is also a delightful female bogy , called a dogai .

		She looks as if she might be a goddess of vegeta - tion , and not at all a fearsome person to meet .

		Yet she was slain , and became a group of stars , of which Altair is one .

		It will be found upon comparison of the different divisions of
Oceania	LOCATION	that , while the mythology as a whole presents many elements of resemblance , each region seems to develop some type or types of stories peculiar to itself .

		For example , Deluge myths prevail among the mountain tribes of
Northern Luzon	LOCATION	in
the Philippines	LOCATION	a region which Professor
Dixon	PERSON	tells us was practically uninfluenced by Islamic or Hindu culture .

		Here there are always the sky and the sea to begin with , and earth is made either in or on the sea .

		Again , in
Indonesia	LOCATION	, trickster tales abound , some of them directly traceable to Buddhist sources in
India	LOCATION	, and others evidently original though imitated from the Hindu tales .

		In
Australia	LOCATION	, animal tales and stories of totemic ancestors are the prevalent types .

		About the origin of the world the Australians have little to say , but upon the origin of man - kind some of their myths are peculiarly in - teresting , for they seem to point to the earliest form of the doctrine of reincarnation .

		Among certain tribes , to quote Professor
Dixon	PERSON	, `` the belief is held that the totem ancestors of the various clans come up out of the ground , some being in human , some in animal shapes ... And ultimately they journeyed away beyond the confines of the territory known to the par - ticular tribe , or went down into the ground again , or became transformed into a rock , tree , or some other natural feature of the land - scape .

		These spots then became centres from which spirit individuals , representing these ancestors , issued to be reincarnated in human beings . ''

		Here is an example of a myth whose value would be immeasurably enhanced by an account of the curious beliefs and customs from which it sprang .

		The idea of reincar - nation so widespread in what has been called the lowest type of man the Australian
Bush	PERSON	- man goes far to prove that even in his most savage state man was searching for God , and had already , even before he had discovered all the meanings of his physical existence , dis - covered his spirit .

		These are mere glimpses of the more im - portant material that may be found in the book , material which gives much food for thought to those who are interested in re - ligious and scientific origins .

		The notes are entirely of a bibliographical character and , along with the very full bibliography , are of inestimable value to the special student .

		As in the previous volume , the illustrations are of the first order of interest .

		They are gen - erally of religious objects of some sort which evince a ghoulish type of imagination , rival - ling the gargoyles of Gothic art or the sculp - tures of the Futurist school .

		Some time ago Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	, in an inter - view with a Canadian newspaper man , pre - dicted `` the death of decadence in British fiction and in British literature generally '' as one of the results of the war .

		That was an interesting view , for Mr.
Lane	PERSON	has known literature well for a long time , and whatever he thinks about it is likely to be of value .

		Just what he meant by `` decadence '' was probably clearer to one who read the whole interview than it is in a mere phrase .

		I sup - pose he had in mind a quality which was more common in the literature of the nineties than it is to-day .

		Mr.
Grant Eichards	PERSON	's story `` Bittersweet '' reminds one of that period , in which some , at least , of the writers of the day prided themselves more upon a `` decadent '' quality in their work than upon certain sturdier virtues .

		The word was first used in
France	LOCATION	and there was more of the quality in the
France	LOCATION	of that day than there was in
England	LOCATION	.

		There is less of that sort of thing now in French literature and in French life .

		The new century made a difference , and the war has made more .

		There is less , too , in English literature and life .

		It is decadent -LRB- if one is to use the word -RRB- to fix one 's mind upon what is ignoble , and to render it in artistic form .

		Mr.
Eichards	PERSON	knows that much of his subject is ignoble , but I suppose he thinks that much is fine , and that the fine things can be seen only by seeing also the ignoble surroundings .

		`` Serious fiction , '' say the publishers and rightly , - : - `` of unusual distinction , a fine piece of realism done by an artist with an artist 's restraint . ''

		All true enough , and yet the book is not sufficiently fine to make one for - get the rather too sordid substance .

		This is the story of an average English merchant who loves his wife and children , but who loves still more , or at least more fiercely , a girl who dances at the
night	TIME	restaurants in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He loves her and leaves her , sees her once more , loves her and again leaves her .

		This time it seems to be for good , and he goes back to his wife and children .

		So far there is little to attract the artist such cases are not un - common in our day ; but , common or not , it would take a very thoroughgoing realist to think such a story worth chronicling .

		All that is but the kind of vulgar intrigue which the novelist would hardly want to touch unless it offered him something in the doing that was fine .

		Some , perhaps , would merely try to find something that was exciting .

		Mr.
Eichards	PERSON	here shows his restraint ; there is no commonplace excitement as to whether the man will be found out , as to whether his wife will know .

		There is no conventional senti - ment about the man 's ruining himself by the extravagances of his mistress .

		He spent a good deal of money , but his recklessness did not bring him to ruin .

		No ; it is merely the story of the intrigue , and of course one will guess that the only thing that can make such an intrigue interesting is the figure of the woman .

		She may be so fine that one forgets all else .

		It is not a novel idea that there is often good in evil surroundings .

		That ignoble world that may be found elsewhere , as well as in
Paris	LOCATION	, includes not a few people who are probably good and kind in the common walks of life , even though their means of livelihood is a sordid pandering to something that is evil and cruel .

		It may hold natures that are capable of greater nobility than we are apt to see in our everyday existence .

		The
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	would possibly find more generosity in a saloon than in a country-club .

		Illona , the dancer , is the figure that makes such a tale possible .

		She is of the temper that led Julia to write to Juan that love was of man 's life a thing apart , but woman 's whole existence .

		Illona loves
Gervase Blun	PERSON	- dell as
Julia	LOCATION	loved .

		But she has another feeling , too ; she loves him so much that , when she sees his boy , she feels that she must give him up , even though she must make him forget her to do it .

		Such things might make a really fine figure , one an artist might want to render .

		People may doubt its realism , but then many people know little of
Illona	LOCATION	's world , and so can not be good judges there .

		Yet , fine or not , real - istic or not , even
Illona	PERSON	does not take from the book the quality once called decadent .

		Why write of such things ?

		There are charm - ing things in the book ; the fresh and lovely country of
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	is very different from the close night restaurants of
Paris	LOCATION	;
Illona	PERSON	had much that was charming about her , even if
Gervase	PERSON	had much that was mean .

		But the lasting impression and that is the thing that counts is unspeakably sordid .

		Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	is not decadent and never was , even though `` Earthwork Out of
Tuscany	LOCATION	'' came in the nineties .

		He has writ - ten much since then , and it has been his fancy or his will to write things of very dif - ferent kinds .

		Perhaps it is decadent in a more refined sense to wish to appear always in protean guise to vary one 's personality , 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 8	DATE	as they used to say in the nineties .

		The greatest writers seem to think little of how they do things , and so they are always them - selves .

		So , at least , it seems to us .

		To the Elizabethan playgoer it may be that Shake - speare seemed always trying experiments , as he passed from `` Love 's Labour 's Lost '' to `` The Comedy of Errors '' and then to `` A Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' and so on , through the stately pageant that seems to us so obviously woven out of the same wonder - ful stuff .

		It may be that
Shakespeare	PERSON	him - self liked to vary the masks through which he looked upon the world as much as
Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	.

		However that may be ,
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	has written stories of many kinds , and the last kind he has chosen to write is a story after the fashion of the Icelandic saga the first and , it may well be , the greatest real - istic fiction of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		They are great things , those old tales of everyday life , and they , are told in a great way .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	has the idea of it the simplicity , the directness , the strength .

		It is only in the refined sense that one could call such work decadent .

		It may be the sign of a decadent art when one is able so absolutely to adopt the manner of another .

		Of late it has been said that Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	is losing his power , but it is hardly losing one 's power to write as he writes in `` Thorgils . ''

		The book tells the story of Thorgils of Treadholt from the time of his birth to the time of his death , of how he loved when he could and fought when he had to , of how he lived in
Iceland	LOCATION	, went to
Greenland	LOCATION	, came home , and finally died .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	tells only the important things and makes no fuss even over them .

		There are no descriptions , or conversations , or character studies .

		That is certainly a very different sort of writing from `` Richard Yea-and-Nay '' or `` The Queen 's Quair , '' and people nowadays will not like it so well .

		Yet , like it or not , the result is much the same ; out of the book there emerges a pretty definite figure .

		A great novelist can do more in kind ; he can leave a dozen or a score of definite figures ;
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thack	PERSON	- eray did , as a rule .

		But it is something to leave even one .

		And as one goes on and on in this rather bare chronicle of action , one does feel that the figure of a man emerges , a pretty clearly seen person .

		Rather more clearly , I should say , than
Gunnar	PERSON	who fell in with that attractive girl who had been married to the
God Frey	ORGANIZATION	, of whom Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	told a year or so ago .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	never would do what people wanted ; he always wants his own way .

		He likes to write sagas , and so he does .

		One thing I might say , however : Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	is the man who wrote `` Art is adjectival , is it not , Donatello ? ''

		There are very few adjectives in `` Thorgils . ''

		But Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	would say that `` adjectival '' was but a figure , that art gets and gives its qualities in different ways .

		It is not so very important whether `` Bitter - sweet '' be decadent or whether `` Thorgils '' be not .

		Each is a well-written book , but neither is a book that gives much idea of that renas - cence of which Mr.
Lane	PERSON	spoke to his
Cana	LOCATION	- dian friends .

		Mr.
Lane	PERSON	thinks that the war will bring a period of virility in which
Canada	LOCATION	will play her part .

		Mr.
Richards	PERSON	's story has virility of a certain sort and Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's has virility of another sort , though probably neither has the fresh power that Mr.
Lane	PERSON	had in mind .

		I should hardly think that `` virility '' was the thing needed in English fiction ; reality , feeling for beauty , penetra - tion beneath the hulls and coverings of life , these would seem to me more important things .

		Mr.
Jerome K. Jerome	PERSON	does not have so much of those qualities that we hail him at once as a great man , but he does have some - thing of them .

		His new collection , `` The Street of the Blank `` Wall '' -LRB- named from the first story , which has no connection even in idea with the rest of the book -RRB- , is made up of half a dozen stories that show as many different qualities .

		One of them is little more than a sketch out of real life , a short and pathetic idyll which may easily be `` founded on fact . ''

		Another is a fairy-story of modern life , frankly impossible I should say , except that Mr.
Jerome	PERSON	hardly seems to consider so slight a matter .

		Between the realism and the fantasy come a murder mys - tery , a rendering of the passage of souls from body to body , and an extravaganza clearly meant to give something that is pretty true .

		Mr.
Jerome	PERSON	's stories show us , in little , a number of things that English fiction can do without trying to keep up the strain of Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	and Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	, and without trying the various experiments with the past that Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	seems to enjoy so much .

		All these stories are in veins that have been cultivated by others , sometimes at greater length and with greater success , usually with less .

		The last year has offered us fantasies , extravaganzas , tales of metemp - sychosis , detective stories , sketches of daily sentiment .

		In all these different forms Mr.
Jerome	PERSON	writes with sincerity , with feeling for reality , with some insight into the deeper pos - sibilites of life , with a feeling for what is lovely as well as of good report .

		And that sort of thing is in itself good , better , I should say , than a striving for virility .

		COTTON AS A WORLD POWER : A Study in the
Economic Interpretation of History	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
James A. B. Scherer	PERSON	.


Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Sixty years ago a large number of southern leaders had convinced themselves that `` Cotton is King '' an economic force against which hostile influences could not prevail .

		The Civil War proved that Cotton was not
King	PERSON	, though the fleecy staple showed a mighty strength .

		The ex - traordinary developments of the
last quarter	DATE	- century have again brought cotton to the front as the most important single crop produced .

		Gold excepted , its influence is the most far spread , the most international of all concrete economic forces .

		It was the suddenly magnified importance of cot - ton caused by the European War which induced Dr.
Scherer	PERSON	, who had long been interested in the subject , to publish this work .

		The author , now a college president in
California	LOCATION	, lived , when a youth , in the cotton country ; he has travelled widely where cotton is grown or used and his reading covers the entire literature of the subject .

		This book of 450 pages covers in 75 short chapters the history of cotton from its very earliest men - tion to the crop of
1915	DATE	from the myths of the `` Vegetable Lamb of Tartary '' -LRB- half animal , half plant -RRB- to the latest long staple of the
Imperial Valley	ORGANIZATION	in
California	LOCATION	.

		Among other influences exerted by cotton , attention is called to the way it fastened upon the South negro slavery and the plantation system , free trade ideals , and conserva - tism , both social and political ; to the sectional divergence caused by the rapid development of its power ; to its part , both American and interna - tional , in the history of the Civil War ; and to its effect in drawing women and children into fac - tories .

		The proposition is advanced that the South might have made a more effective use of its cotton during the Civil War by assuming control of the entire supply and using it as a basis of foreign credit .

		The author should have made it clearer that the white man of the New South in competition with the free negro has a much larger part in making the cotton crop than had his grandfather in competition with negro slavery .

		Interesting as the long history of cotton is , the most striking facts which the author sets forth are those of its present-day influence .

		For the last ten years the value of the world 's cotton has been greater than its production of gold and silver for the same time .

		The annual export of raw cotton from the
United States	LOCATION	amounts to twenty-six per cent of all exports and exceeds in value the total of the next four great groups , iron and steel , meat and dairy products , copper , and breadstuffs , and yet forty per cent of the crop is manufactured in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It takes the place of gold in international exchanges and enables the
United States	LOCATION	to maintain a favor - able trade balance , since its annual export value is almost exactly the amount due to
Europe	LOCATION	by the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is the only crop all of which is sold by the producer , and it is practically indestructible .

		It possesses more of the attributes of a legal tender than anything else except gold , and no other product of human hands is so widely exported .

		So careful is the author to develop his background that at times the work becomes prac - tically a general economic history .

		Especially is this true of the period before
Whitney	PERSON	's invention of the cotton gin .

		The latter part , which deals with cotton as a really important economic force , is better proportioned .

		Contrary to the generally accepted American view , the author does not be - lieve that the southern states will remain undis - turbed in their monopoly of cotton production .

		New cotton fields are being developed in every continent , but the European War has probably made the South safe for a long time .

		The book is well worthy of its title .

		It is a notable study in history and economics and at times rises to the grade of literature .

		Other than two small volumes for children it is the only treatise on the subject of such a nature that the general reader will find pleasure in reading it .

		THE FOUNDATIONS OF
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		By
J. Ellis Barker	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
J. Ellis Barker	PERSON	, as one of the most compe - tent authorities on certain phases of German economic life , is sure of a circle of interested readers for his most recent book .

		The author , though a German by birth , is a naturalized Englishman and an ardent partisan of
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	political ideals .

		The present volume is totally distinct from his `` Modern
Germany	LOCATION	, '' of which a fifth and greatly enlarged edition was published last year .

		It is by no means of equal importance with his earlier work , being chiefly made up of unrevised magazine articles , as a con - sequence of which the material has the double defect of being heterogeneous and at the same time repetitious .

		The most valuable portion of the book is a sort of appendix which gives in the original French five important state papers of
Frederick the Great	PERSON	, who is , in the author 's esti - mation , the real maker of the German Empire and the great prototype of modern Prussian aggression .

		ESSAYS IN WAR TIME .

		By
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	always writes with definiteness and clarity .

		The war has naturally shaped his con - temporary interests .

		War , morality , eugenics , feminism , social problems , the birth-rate form the shifting centres of interest of the several essays .

		The biological defence of war is demolished , and a timely analysis of the actual part it plays in the modern world is set forth .

		This confused realm , wherein partisan prejudices freely disport themselves , is restored to a scientific sanity of vision .

		In discussing the relations of the sexes , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	reenforces his earlier conclusions by newer evidence , utilizing the part played by woman in the war , under stress of unusual circumstances .

		The limitations as well as possibilities of eugenic provisions indicate that the control of the future generations is one of the vital matters now at 192
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
March 8	DATE	issue .

		As an older advocate of birth-control , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	now comes to his own and appeals for a campaign of enlightenment .

		In his view of the marriage relation Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	is fairly radical , as judged by the entrenched morality which he calls upon to defend itself .

		In the course of the eugenic argument the relation of quality to quantity is made prominent .

		The fallacy of an unchecked birth-rate as a national asset is argued .

		The fal - lacy of associating genius with defect likewise receives attention .

		Thus the sheaf of essays is bound by a continuity of interest and a consist - ency of point of view which may be described as a scientific radicalism , challenging the estab - lished beliefs when these rest upon tradition rather than upon cogent argument and experience .

		SPANISH EXPLORATION IN THE SOUTHWEST , 1542-1706 .

		By
H. G. Bolton	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		From diplomatic origins to the pioneer annals of exploration stretches a gap of nearly two cen - turies .

		But Professor
Bolton	PERSON	's carefully edited volume in the `` Original Narratives of Early Amer - ican History '' series touches another phase of the same general field .

		The present volume comes from another important workshop in what we may call `` Our Hispanic Hinterland . ''

		The narratives of ex - ploration that he presents in original text , though not in facsimile , begin with the voyage of Cabrillo -LRB- 1542 -RRB- , and end with the journey of Father
Kino	ORGANIZATION	in
1710	DATE	.

		These sixteen decades contain no such striking events as marked the wonderful half - cen - tury ushered in by
Columbus	LOCATION	, but there is the same exhibition of heroic devotion and sacrifice .

		By such deeds as these early explorers and missionaries per - formed was
Spain	LOCATION	's colonial empire expanded and a picturesque background prepared for our more prosaic occupancy .

		Professor
Bolton	PERSON	's work fol - lows that of
Hodge	PERSON	and
Lewis	PERSON	in the same series .

		His field extends from
California	LOCATION	to
Texas	LOCATION	.

		A full third of his documents , which are typical rather than exhaustive , now appear in print for the first time , while another third were previously available only in Spanish .

		Technically his work as an editor approaches perfection .

		The text of the narrative is accompanied by a wealth of information , backed by copious references .

		An original map and fac - similes of two contemporary ones add greatly to this valuable study .

		THE SEXES IN SCIENCE AND HISTORY .

		By
Eliza Burt Gamble	ORGANIZATION	.

		Putnam ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This is a revised edition of `` The Evolution of Woman , '' published in
1894	DATE	.

		The revision is con - fined mainly to the beginning and the end of the book .

		The intermediate portions , consisting of statements of the position of woman in prehis - toric times and throughout the ages , may stand .

		The sub-title , `` An Inquiry into the Dogma of Woman 's Inferiority to Man , '' indicates the bias of the work , which has not yielded in the twenty years nor adjusted itself to the actual facts as biologically or socially interpreted .

		A work of this kind serves few useful purposes and does many a disservice to the cause which it pre - sents .

		The position of woman has far stronger defences than the dubious interpretations here as - sembled .

		The maintenance of a sex antagonism such as is here vindicated forms an argument in the hands of those who oppose the too rapid assumption of responsibility on the part of women .

		What is valuable in the work is its in - sistence upon the qualities used by civilization which owe their strength to the feminine nature .

		As a general contribution to the `` woman question , '' the book is pernicious .

		THE CONFESSIONS OF A HYPHENATED AMER -
ICAN	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Edward A. Steiner	PERSON	.

		Revell ; 50 cts .

		That the hyphen should be regarded as a wed - ding-ring and not as a symbol of divorce is the contention of Dr.
Edward A. Steiner	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	, for instance , is an Austro - American ; that is to say , he was born in
Austria	LOCATION	, an unescapable fact ; but he has been an American by choice and adoption for some thirty years and , having worked his way up from alien to citizen , he gives this country his undivided allegiance .

		A visit to
Vienna	LOCATION	arouses no patriotic thrill in his breast .

		`` I have , '' he says , `` nothing but loathing for this foul and unthinkable war , for I have lived where it was bred , and I have watched the dastardly and damnable process .

		A generation of men was be - gotten and trained to be fodder for cannon and to walk joyously into that hell . ''

		In this admirable little book , which is the reprint of a lecture deliv - ered before the
League for Political Education	ORGANIZATION	in
New York City	LOCATION	, he pleads that the hyphen should be regarded as the simple expression of a natural fact , and that the part before the hyphen should not be emphasized either for exaltation or for reprobation .

		THE BOOK OF
BOSTON	LOCATION	.

		By
Robert Shackle	PERSON	- ton .


Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Anecdote , tradition , bits of history and biog - raphy , passages of description , and paragraphs of personal impression all these combine agreeably in the making of `` The Book of
Boston	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Robert Shackleton	PERSON	.

		A lively wit and gentle humor are also manifest in these rambling chapters about
Boston	LOCATION	's rambling streets and other characteristic features .


Boston Common	ORGANIZATION	appropriately claims first place in the author 's delineation of the city 's historic haunts ; and then , by a natural association of ideas , comes
Boston	LOCATION	Preferred , on the old and aristocratic Beacon Hill section of the town .

		In this chapter the observation is made that ``
Boston	LOCATION	goes to sleep early , and
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	goes even earlier than does the rest of the city .

		And , the people once in bed , it takes a good deal to rouse them . ''

		But present-day
Boston	LOCATION	is not so puri - tanical as the author would have us believe ; the police-court records offer sad proof to the con - trary .

		Mr.
Shackleton	PERSON	finds
Boston	LOCATION	a woman 's city ; a less courteous writer might have desig - nated it an old maid 's city .

		A few outlying towns of historic note are favored with more than brief mention ; in fact , the reader is invited as far afield as Salem and
Plymouth	LOCATION	and
Provincetown	LOCATION	.

		Good photogravures and drawings , with a colored frontispiece , enrich and embellish the book .

$ 2.50	MONEY	a year The editor of a popular magazine writes : '' / stopped reading the ` better class ' magazines some years ago ^ because I found them rather sad .

		When analyzed , their superiority consists only of the quality of the paper on which they are printed ; consequently I retired to the ` popular ' regions , where people at least know what a story is , though they may not worry themselves about its intellectuality .

		At times I have looked into the ` different ' magazines only to find that they are the con - coctions of epigrammatic children and intellectual incom - petents little groups of serious thinkers .

		`` But at last we have a magazine The Seven Arts !

		I feel in my bones that your secret motto is art for the people 's sake , and not art for art 's sake .

		I am sure thousands of people will be delighted with your publica - tion .

WILFRID WILSON GIBSON	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la Mare has recently re - ferred , not without a touch of irony , to those poets he is himself one who , having grown up in the service of the good Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, awoke suddenly one morning to find themselves `` Georgians . ''

		Thus it is with Mr. de la Mare 's friend and fellow-craftsman , Mr.
Wilfrid Wilson Gibson	PERSON	, who happens also t6 be in this country for the first time this
winter	DATE	, and whose new book , `` Livelihood , '' has just been published by
Macmillans	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ever since the appearance , in
1910	DATE	, of `` Daily Bread , '' Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has been regarded , with justice , as one of the main supports of the `` new poetry '' movement in
England	LOCATION	, sharing with Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	the distinction of having achieved popularity as a `` story - telling '' poet , but making a quite individual and unique appeal as the sympathetic interpreter , more or less from the `` inside , '' of the gray and sombre tragedies in the lives of the working classes .

		Yet Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	is not a `` new poet '' at all , strictly speaking .

		For a full decade before `` Daily Bread '' was issued , he had been publishing verse , and he already had seven volumes to his credit when that work appeared .

		But so com - plete a change occurred in his way of looking at life as material for poetic treatment toward the end of that decade , that the earlier books , with a single exception , `` Stonefolds , '' scarcely count to-day save in a purely personal view of his development as a poet .

		The precise nature of this change has been admirably noted by the poet himself in the poem with which he prefaces `` Daily Bread , '' and which may well be quoted in full , not merely because of its autobiographic interest , but as an example of the musical and imagina - tive quality of his verse in its more reflective mood : As one , at
midnight	TIME	, wakened by the call Of golden-plovers in their seaward flight , Who lies and listens , as the clear notes fall Through tingling quiet of the frosty night Who lies and listens , till the wild notes fail ; And then , in fancy , following the flock Fares over slumbering hill and dreaming dale , Until he hears the surf on reef and rock Break , thundering ; and all sense of self is drowned 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	Within the mightier music of the deep , And he no more recalls the piping sound That startled him from dull , undreaming sleep : So I , first waking from oblivion , heard , With heart that kindled to the call of song , The voice of young life , fluting like a bird , And echoed that wild piping ; till , ere long , Lured onward by that happy , singing-flight , I caught the stormy summons of the sea , And dared the restless deeps that , day and night , Surge with the life-song of humanity .

		We are now so accustomed to this surging `` life-song '' of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	, as the poet of the proletariat , of the modern industrial world in its bearing on the humble , hard-working lives which are its foundation , that it is diffi - cult to identify its note with the light , fluting bird-song of the author of `` Urlyn the
Harper	PERSON	, '' `` The Queen 's Vigil , '' and `` The Nets of Love , '' with their romantic remoteness from reality .

		Yet , even in this early work of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's , there are to be found evidences , however slight , of a potential interest in life deeper and more intense than is shown by the prevailing lyric or elegiac celebration of shad - owy Queen Avelaines and other figures drawn from , or suggested by , legend or old romance .

		Miss
Mary C. Sturgeon	PERSON	, writing of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	in her recently published `` Studies of Con - temporary Poets , '' finds such evidences in his first volume , `` Urlyn the
Harper	PERSON	, '' where the presence of a group of little poems called `` Faring South , '' with their glimpses of peas - ant life in the south of
France	LOCATION	, indicates `` that even at that time an awakening sympathy with toiling folk had begun to guide his obser - vation . ''

		They become much more striking , however , in a poem of somewhat later date , `` The Lambing , '' in the collection entitled `` The Nets of Love . ''

		This is no longer , in form at least , a mere travel note , but a gen - uine attempt to interpret ` the shepherd 's life , as it is lived in his own north-country , in its purely human and spiritual aspect , without any adventitious aid from foreign strangeness or picturesqueness .

		It tells the story so slight as to be an episode , rather of a young shepherd who , obliged to leave his wife at a critical moment in order to attend to his ewes in the same situation , brings the ewes through in safety , only to return to the house and find his wife dead .

		It begins : Softly she slept in the
night	TIME	her new-born babe at her breast , A little , warm , dimpling hand to the yielding bosom pressed As I rose from her side to go though sore was my heart to stay To the ease of the labouring ewes that else would have died ere dav .

		Banking the peats on the hearth , I reached from the rafter-hook My lanthorn , and kindled the wick ; and , taking my plaid and crook , I lifted the latch , and turned , once more , to see if she slept , And looked on the slumber of peace , ere into the night I stept Into the swirling dark of the driving , blinding sleet , And a world that seemed to sway and slip from under my feet , As if rocked in the wind that swept the starless , roaring night , Yet fumed in a fury vain at my lanthorn 's shielded light .

		We are still far here from the firm and vigorous handling of similar material in later work .

		There is a Tennysonian touch of sen - timental softness in the expression , to which corresponds , as it were , a certain anapaestic looseness in the languid effect of the long line , to which the poet never returns in his later work .

		But already his characteristic narrative and descriptive method has begun to shape itself ; and at once in its swift dramatic movement , its imaginative use of homely , realistic detail , and its sentiment of brooding sympathy , the little poem might almost have served as a preliminary sketch for the richer , deeper , more complex studies of the bleak desolation of shepherds ' lives contained in `` Stonefolds . ''

		This book , recently published for the first time in
America	LOCATION	as one of the three sections of the collection known as `` Battle and Other Poems , '' was the first , as Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	says , in which he really found himself .

		Here , indeed , we at last have all , or nearly all , that is to be found in `` Daily Bread , '' in the selection and treatment of subject , save for a final note of harsh austerity and of rugged strength .

		This , to a very large extent , is the result of the peculiar metrical form in which , in contrast with the supple Shakespearean blank verse of `` Stonefolds , '' the dialogue of the later work is cast , though it is doubtless true that this form itself is the direct outcome of the poet 's material and method of working .

		It is by its apparent formlessness that one is at first struck , however ; for there is no regular pat - tern in this verse , rough , abrupt , broken , con - stantly changing in its line length and the rhythmic arrangement of its syllables .

		But , as
Miss Sturgeon	PERSON	says , `` it is not long before we perceive the design which controls its apparent waywardness , and recognize its fit - ness to express the life that the poet has chosen to depict .

		For it suggests , as no
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 225 rhyme or regular measure could , the rugged - ness of this existence and the characteristic utterance of its people . ''

		The only question which arises in this con - nection is whether any method of metrical realism which makes so little allowance for the purely aesthetic pleasure capable of being de - rived from the verse itself , either as a musical instrument or as a mirror of the poet 's mood , does not carry the intention somewhat beyond the strict bounds of imaginative art , as in the case of all so-called `` free verse . ''

		However this may be , I own to a certain sense of relief in the return to the more regular , more musical verse forms in Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's next book , `` Fires . ''

		Inasmuch as the sensuous enrichment of his style in these delightful little stories , which show a less narrow con - centration upon the tragic aspects of the workers ' lives , is accompanied by no loss of profound human sympathy and significance , I can not help feeling that Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	, is naturally a narrative and descriptive , rather than a dramatic poet , for whom the rigid dialogue form remains something a little ill - fitting and foreign .

		If anything could suggest a doubt as to the justice of this broad generalization , it would be the success achieved in such a brilliant bit of dramatic dialogue as `` Hoops , '' which forms the real piece de resistance of the fol - lowing volume , `` Borderlands and Thorough - fares . ''

		Here he has certainly felt himself as free as in any of the tales in `` Fires '' to develop the full resources both of his language and of his metrical instrument .

		But it re - quires only a little reflection to perceive that what he has attempted in `` Hoops '' is something very different indeed from the problem he had set himself in the earlier dramas and , on the whole , considerably more artificial .

		Hitherto , having invariably se - lected the simplest , most ordinary types for portrayal , he had kept them strictly in char - acter , limiting their mental outlook , and consequently the range of their intellectual interests , to what was inherently probable in the circumstances .

		In `` Hoops , '' on the con - trary , he has had the fantastic notion of placing what is nothing more or less than a rhapsodic hymn in praise of physical , or manly , beauty in the mouth of a hunchbacked keeper of camels in a circus ; and however much he may have succeeded incidentally in justifying this procedure , the fact remains that the significance centers in the ideas and expressions as such , rather than in any reve - lation of character achieved dramatically through them .

		Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's method here suggests very closely that employed characteristically by his friend and fellow-poet , Mr.
Lascelles Aber	PERSON	- crombie , who , in his play , `` The End of the World , '' makes a group of rustics discourse through three whole acts like a company of poets and philosophers .

		It is perhaps not wholly fanciful to feel Mr.
Abercrombie	PERSON	's influence throughout `` Borderlands and Thor - oughfares , '' where there is evident an entirely new preoccupation with style as such , leading to a notable advance in the handling of the poetic medium itself in the vivid , evocative power of words and images , in the vigor and variety of the plastic phrase .

		At all events , Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	and Mr.
Abercrombie	PERSON	were asso - ciated at this time with Mr.
John Drinkwater	PERSON	and
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	in the editorial conduct of `` New Numbers , '' a quarterly magazine of verse , which ran for one year , and in which several of the pieces afterward collected in this book originally appeared .

		The influence was probably more or less reciprocal , and there can be little doubt that Mr.
Abercrom	PERSON	- bie 's choice and treatment of subject in his play , `` Deborah , '' dealing with Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's fisher-folk , was directly determined by his relations with the latter poet .

		The war , which broke up the little `` New Numbers '' group , taking
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	to his death and sweeping the others into occupa - tions more or less closely connected with
England	LOCATION	's participation in the great conflict , interfered with the orderly and logical devel - opment of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's art , and makes it impossible to say precisely what this might have been in happier circumstances .

		The war , itself , however , furnished him with material that could not but be of peculiar value and significance for a poet already so absorbed in the reactions of common humanity to its occu - pational environment , so alert to seize the typical and essential gesture of men and women in action under the stress of harsh circumstances .

		Moreover , his insight and his sense of dramatic contrast suggested to him an original method of dealing with the war in its relation to the humble individual involved in it ; and the little pieces , rarely more than a page long , in the first section of `` Battle and Other Poems , '' are masterpieces 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	by reason of the penetration with which they illustrate variously the persistence of the man the farmer or artisan or village shop - keeper in the newly made soldier .

		I wonder if the old cow died or not .

		Gey bad she was the night I left , and siek .

		Dick reckoned she would mend .

		He knows a lot At least he fancies so himself , does
Dick	PERSON	.

		Dick knows a lot .

		But maybe I did wrong To leave the cow to him , and come away .

		Over and over like a silly song These words keep bumming in my head all day .

		And all I think of , as I face the foe And take my lucky chance of being shot , Is this that if I 'm hit , I '11 never know Till Doomsday if the old cow died or not .

		There are war poems in Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's latest book `` Livelihood , '' also , though with one exception , `` Between the Lines , '' they do not deal immediately with the man at the front , but with the various ways in which his going affects those whom he leaves at home .

		In all these , and notably in the piece called `` The News , '' where husband and wife meet at the noon hour in his shipyard , and each conceals from the other a secret , hers that she is to have a child , his that he has volun - teered and been accepted , the poet displays his power of seizing and ' suggesting with extraordinary insight and skill the critical sense of a situation , however slight and com - monplace , its ever-fresh , ever-vital signifi - cance for those concerned .

		And all these humble and obscure human values in the great , absorbing drama of modern industrial life so diabolical or so indifferent , as we may choose to view it are developed , thrown into relief , with a quiet dignity and restraint .

		Only at rare moments is the legitimate demand for sympathy marred by a mawkish insistence upon the inessential , by a purely sentimental appeal .

		At most , in the way of criticism , one may perhaps note a certain effect of monotony in the very even - ness with which this admirable manner is maintained through an entire volume , and hint at the danger of its becoming in time a trifle mechanical .

		For this reason I believe it would be well if Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	should not confine himself too exclusively in the future to the particular material of which he has now given so many proofs of his mastery , or if he should attempt to intellectualize it a little further in pursuit of a more profound and universal human significance .

		The ele - ments that make of life a tragedy do not inhere exclusively in the vital conditions of the laboring classes , but are deeply rooted in human existence itself .

		Social sympathy , especially when it is coupled with the simple art of story-telling to so high a degree as in Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's work , often obscures this fact for the artist ; but `` Borderlands and Thor - oughfares '' of itself gives sufficient evidence that there is a thinker as well as a man of sympathy in this poet and justifies the hope that he may yet , since he is only just entering into the full maturity of his powers , bring to his work a richer range of imaginative symbols , a higher synthesis of moral and spir - itual values .

		FOR THE PRESERVATION OF FRENCH ART from the ravages of war and the hazards of the reconstruction period that is to follow , an association has been formed of members of the leading salons in
France	LOCATION	, under the pat - ronage of the President and other government officials .

		It calls itself `` Les Amis des Artistes . ''

		In aid of the movement repre - sented by this organization , the
National Allied Relief Committee	ORGANIZATION	will hold an exhibi - tion of the paintings of
Francois Charles Cachoud	PERSON	at the Anderson Art Galleries ,
New York	LOCATION	, during the two weeks beginning
March 26	DATE	.

		The proceeds will be forwarded to the above-named association .

		This timely effort to rescue from destruction what it is still possible to save of the imperilled masterpieces of French art will commend itself to many in this country , and their cooperation is invited .

		Any who may wish to contribute directly to the society are asked to send their offerings to

		THE FATE OF THE TAUCHNITZ REPRINTS of current English and American works , chiefly novels , may not yet have been decided , though at last accounts the popular shilling edition , made in
England	LOCATION	, was having a very large circulation on the Continent , as in the Eng - lish-speaking world generally , with a corre - sponding decline in the vogue of the handy little volumes from
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		Among late products of the
Tauchnitz Press are Professor Miinsterberg	ORGANIZATION	's interpretations of the war in its relations to
America	LOCATION	, and these writings do not , naturally enough , appeal irresistibly to the average English-speaking buyer of books .

		Mr.
Thomas B. Wells	PERSON	, secretary of the
Harper	PERSON	publishing house , has recently re -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 227 turned from a business trip to
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and he reports that the Tauchnitz edition of books in English is likely to have a relatively small circulation after the war .

		Many American readers , whose first acquain - tance with such authors as
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	,
Charles Reade	PERSON	, and
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	was made through the trim little Tauchnitz volumes so common in our libraries , will regret that the good
Baron	PERSON	's laudable enterprise has fallen upon evil times , and will recall with approval the business honesty and fairness and praise - worthy generosity with which he treated the authors on his list .

		`` THE SCARLET LETTER '' WITH THE SCARLET WASHED OUT , on the film of the moving-picture camera , is at present writing giving joy to the uncritical at some of the moving - picture theatres .

		The inexorability with which sin brings its own retribution is here softened to suit the taste of the easy-going , pleasure-loving frequenters of the movies ; and they leave the show with the comforting assurance that
Dimmesdale	PERSON	and
Hester	PERSON	were a pretty good sort after all , and that one need not fret oneself so long as all 's well that ends well .


Hester	PERSON	and little
Pearl	ORGANIZATION	and
Dimmesdale	PERSON	are at the end started safely on the high road to happiness , and of course they are to be imagined as living in contentment ever after .

		This , to be sure , is comic -LRB- or tragic -RRB- enough ; but even more so , to a quiet observer in the back of the audito - rium , is the cheerful and unquestioning satis - faction with which the entire house receives this denatured version of our greatest ro - mancer 's masterpiece .

		What would Haw - thorne himself think of the performance if he could see it ?

		STEVENSON 'S POSTHUMOUS POETRY proves to be fairly astonishing in quantity and also notable in quality .

		In two handsome volumes now issued by the
Bibliophile Society	ORGANIZATION	, with etched portraits and with facsimile reproduc - tions of
Stevenson	PERSON	's handwriting , two hun - dred or more poems , now first made public , are offered for the delectation of
Stevenson	PERSON	- ians and other lovers of graceful lyrics and well-turned bits of poetic fancy .

		`` Far from being ` rejected poems , ' '' says Mr.
Henry Howard Harper	PERSON	in a prefatory note , `` they are among the most intimate , the most self - revealing utterances that ever fell from
Stevenson	PERSON	's pen .

		Briefly , they are an auto - biography in verse , ranging over the entire period of
Stevenson	PERSON	's productivity from
1860	DATE	to
1894	DATE	and as an index to his char - acter and his reflective moods they stand in the same category as the personal letters of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, which contain the outpourings of his innermost soul . ''

		Mr.
George S. Hell	PERSON	- man , discoverer and editor of this material , contributes valuable introductory and explan - atory matter .

		Let us close with a few timely stanzas on that perennial theme of young poets ,
Spring	ORGANIZATION	.

		The verses are supposed to have been written in the author 's early twenties .

		Over the land is
April	DATE	, Over my heart a rose ; Over the high brown mountain The sound of singing goes .

		Say , love , do you hear me , Hear my sonnets ring ?

		Over the high brown mountain , Love , do you hear me sing ?

		By highway , love , and byway The snows succeed the rose .

		Over the high brown mountain The wind of winter blows .

		EMOTIONAL HYSTERICS , such as are indulged in by Miss
Cora Leonore Williams	PERSON	in her `` Creative Involution , '' are not unlikely to induce , if only temporarily , in the sober reader a regret that the fourth dimension and super-space and similar exhilarating incon - ceivabilities were ever suffered to contribute to the enlargement and enrichment of the human imagination .

		In a universe that dis - dains longer to content itself with mere length , breadth , and thickness , `` you have passed , '' Miss
Williams	ORGANIZATION	tells us , `` into the fourth dimension of spatial realization . '

		Time is past , ' you shout aloud , and laugh to find yourself in the inside of externality .

		Cubism in architecture !

		Futurism , in very truth !

		You visit again the galleries of the New Art , in earnest desire for enlightenment as to this thing which is so near to consciousness and yet so far ! ''

		And then , in a paroxysm of hyperspatial ecstasy , `` immediately you are transported in memory to the midst of a crowded street .

		In the mad bustle and noise you are conscious only of mechanical power ; of speed always of speed ... A swoon - ing sensation !

		Men 's faces as triangles , and horses with countless feet !

		The chaos of primal forces about you then darkness ! ''

		Yes , there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy ; but what good purpose is served by any such emotional inebriety as is exhibited in the fore - going ?

		The sane man has little use for a chimera buzzing in a vacuum .

		228 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	A CAUSE OF DIMINISHED BOOK-SALES is not infrequently found by some disappointed author in the increase of our public libraries .

		The greater the number of libraries , the larger the sales to libraries , of course ; but , on the other hand , it is alleged that these increased sales to libraries are more than counterbalanced by a falling-off in sales to individual buyers .

		Dr.
Allan McLane	PERSON	Ham - ilton , in his recent `` Recollections of an Alienist , '' writes : `` In
1910	DATE	I wrote a life of my grandfather -LSB-
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	-RSB- which was well received and had an immediate suc - cess and good sale for a time , but the profits were small .

		Possibly I might have had more return were it not for the sales to the public libraries , which in recent years have hurt most authors , and to a great degree publish - ers .

		While these are of course a boon to the public at large , tens of thousands of possible buyers are lost , for I found at several large libraries that the copies of my book were always ` out , ' showing how many readers it must have had , and the same thing probably occurred in other places than
New York	LOCATION	, for I was told fifteen hundred copies were ordered by these institutions alone . ''

		Yet fifteen hun - dred copies , plus the unstated but presumably considerable number sold to individuals , is no contemptible figure for a biography .

		Book - sales , too , are helped , whether or not they are also sometimes hindered , by the wide publicity and accessibility given to books by the libra - ries .

		Another thing also is certain : in the infancy of our public-library system the sale of books was far smaller , in proportion to the population , than it is now , though we insist on no close connection of cause and effect in this .

		TRUNCATED TITLES are commonly prefer - able , for handy use , to the full forms .

		We speak of
Gibbon	PERSON	's ``
Rome	LOCATION	, ''
Boswell	PERSON	's `` John - son , ''
Butler	PERSON	's `` Analogy , '' and
Paley	PERSON	's `` Ev - idences , '' and are readily understood .

		Appli - cations for books , in libraries and bookshops , are seldom free from abbreviation , and they do not need to be .

		A word is enough to fix the desired work in most instances .

		But not always .

		A young library assistant who was lately asked for the `` Yellowplush Papers '' had an uncomfortable five minutes before ascertaining from one more experienced what `` those colored documents '' could possibly be .

		Somewhat similar perplexity might well be caused , but apparently is not , at the
Chatta	LOCATION	- nooga
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, where , as we learn in the librarian 's `` Twelfth Annual Report , '' in - completeness of designation is not seldom to be noted in the applicant 's request for some - thing to read .

		`` Books are called for by title , author , size , and even color of binding , while the ingenuity of the assistant is often taxed to the utmost to fit the title given to the book desired . ''

		A sixth sense has to be developed , and is developed , by the person at the deliv - ery desk before the service there rendered can be pronounced satisfactory .

		A QUESTION OF AUTHORSHIP that has pUZ - zled thousands of readers in the past has again caused some amusing perplexity .

		At the
Friends ' School	ORGANIZATION	in
Baltimore	LOCATION	the other day an examination in general information evoked the interesting statement that Ibid was `` a writer of olden times . ''

		This may deserve a place beside that other pearl of wisdom from a similar source , that Anon is '' a famous author often quoted , but his works are so scarce that very few of even our largest libraries possess a complete set . ''

		It may be noted in passing that Ibid was declared by another
Baltimore	LOCATION	student to be an Arctic bird probably , one surmises , a distant rela - tion of the sacred ibis of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Another author , as well as man of science ,
Charles Darwin	PERSON	, figured in the same examination as `` the discoverer of gravity '' and as a leader in the late Irish rebellion .

		Among other sur - prising answers , Stradivarius was said to be a Russian dancer , Archangel 's geographical location was fixed in heaven , the Teutons were defined as
Quakers	ORGANIZATION	, the meaning of `` boy - cott '' was given as `` not using eggs , '' and the oyster was called `` a bivalve because it ob - tains its food in two ways . ''

		THE DOLLAR IN LITERATURE gOCS back to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time and still earlier .

		In fact , the forms daler and daller -LRB- showing more plainly their kinship with the German thaler -RRB- are of great antiquity .

		In
Robert Recorde	PERSON	's `` Grounde of Artes '' -LRB- 1540 -RRB- we read , concern - ing the currency of the
Danes	LOCATION	, that `` they have also Dollars olde and new ; their common dol - lar is 35 grasshe , but of their new dollars some are worthe 24 grasshe , some 26 , and some 30 . ' '

		And in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` Macbeth , '' act one , scene two ,
Ross	PERSON	says to
Duncan	PERSON	: `` Nor would we deign him burial of his men till he dis - bursed , at
Saint Colme	ORGANIZATION	's Inch , ten thousand dollars to our general use . ''

		Such examples are intelligible enough , or become so after a little study ; but what shall we say of this from a current English novel , one of the best-sellers of the day : `` They found that remark true enough , and ` Erbert resumed losing half a dollar on a horse every
Saturday	DATE	, and ap -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 229 plauding the ` Spurs when they pushed a foot - ball through the thorax of every other team in the
Southern League	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		That will be found on page 98 of Mr.
William McFee	PERSON	's `` Casuals of the Sea . ' '

		The scene and the speakers and the entire environment are English .

		Why then `` half a dollar '' instead of `` half a crown , '' or , as a more exact equivalent , `` a florin '' ?

		Perhaps the author 's world-wanderings and his experience of many moneys in many lands induced the slip .

		JOY IN BOOKSELLERS ' CATALOGUES has no necessary connection with purchasing ability in the one who goes joy-riding through their pleasant pages , unless it be a connection in which the joy varies inversely as the square of the bank account .

		If a person had the mone -RCB- * to buy out the dealer 's stock to the last volume , gone would be the fun of ticking off , with discreetly hesitant or rashly precipi - tate pencil , here a title and there a title , with the consciousness all the while that it was more than likely to turn out only a game of make-believe , and that no grossly material bales of books would be the prosaic outcome of this bit of library - building in the air .

		The late lamented
Henry Ryecroft	PERSON	has said : '' Formerly , when I could seldom spare money , I kept catalogues as much as possible out of sight . ''

		But it is just when one has abso - lutely no money to spare that dealers ' cat - alogues are the safest and pleasantest companions : there will be no resultant crowd - ing of bookshelves and no laying-up of trouble against a future day of moving ; for books are an awful hindrance to free and inexpensive migration .

		However , booksellers , and also authors and publishers , must live ; consequently there must be buying and sell - ing of books .

		Therefore , in this season of frequent and inviting dealers ' catalogues , let not this rhapsody on the joys of self-restraint be taken too seriously .

		THE POET AS PROFESSOR seldom fails to fill his academic chair with a certain distinction , a certain grace and charm , not easily attain - able by his more prosaic colleagues .

		Long - fellow and his successor ,
Lowell	LOCATION	, delighted and inspired successive classes at
Harvard	LOCATION	;
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	brought to the teach - ing of anatomy and physiology a winsome - ness of manner and a pleasantly literary and poetic allusiveness that are not common in the classrooms of our medical schools ; and
Ruskin	PERSON	, if he may be classed with the poets , made of the Slade professorship at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	something that it had never been before and has not been since .


Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	has now secured the services of a poet as teacher of English literature .

		Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	, author of `` A Boy 's Will , '' `` North of
Boston	LOCATION	, '' and '' Mountain Interval , '' takes the place of Pro- fessor
George B. Churchill	PERSON	during the latter 's term of service in the
Massachusetts Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		He will conduct a special senior seminar on the theory of poetry , .

		and an elective course for juniors on the rise and development of the English drama ; and he will also assist in teaching English composition to the freshmen .

		The last-named task may seem like harnessing
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	to the plough .

		Yet it is an arrange - ment not without reciprocal benefits .

		A DENIAL OF COPYRIGHT VIOLATION in the recent Trading with the Enemy -LRB- Copyright -RRB- Act is set forth in a carefully studied `` Declaration of the
Committee of Manage	ORGANIZATION	- ment of the
Incorporated Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, Playwrights , and Composers , '' for which pub - licity is requested .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	`` regret that this Act was passed without previous reference to this Society , '' and ascribe all misapprehension to `` the very summary form of the Act '' a misapprehension that `` might well have been avoided if the
Government	ORGANIZATION	had consulted representatives of authors , who have at least as much interest in and knowl - edge of this subject as the trade organizations which alone appear to have been approached . ''

		But the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	believe the Act to be a protection , not a violation , of the rights of enemy authors and publishers .

		A CENTRE OP HISTORICAL RESEARCH .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		For the student of American history , the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, with its constantly growing resources in books , manuscripts , maps , and other historical materials , has now become the chief treasure-house of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In close proximity the archives of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, still unhappily ill-housed and scattered , afford untold opportunities for research , while the
Carnegie Institution	ORGANIZATION	through its
Department of Historical Research	ORGANIZATION	exerts a unifying and directing force ` beyond the power of any single institution of learn - ing .

		To bring together , under competent advice and direction , the younger men and women who would pursue research in history in
Washington	LOCATION	, is the purpose of the proposed
University Centre for Higher Studies	ORGANIZATION	.

		The plans for this new institu - tion took definite shape at a meeting of rep - resentatives of the larger eastern universities , the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Carnegie Institution	ORGANIZATION	, which was held at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION
last May	DATE	, at the call of Pro- 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	fessor
McElroy of Princeton	ORGANIZATION	.

		A committee was appointed to prepare a plan .

		The report of this committee was presented at a second conference held recently in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, at the time of the meeting in that city of the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, the
American Political Science Asso	ORGANIZATION	- ciation , and the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	Historical As - sociation .

		The report , signed by
Dana C. Munro	PERSON	as chairman ,
Waldo G. Leland	PERSON	as secretary , and
C. A. Beard	ORGANIZATION	,
A. B. Hart	PERSON	, and
Gaillard Hunt	PERSON	, out - lines the need for the Centre and the opportu - nities which
Washington	LOCATION	offers , and proposes a tentative constitution .

		The necessary financial support for the estab - lishment and maintenance of the
University Centre	ORGANIZATION	will be derived chiefly from subscriptions on the part of the cooperating universities , whether of the
United States	LOCATION	or of other countries .

		Though the details have not yet been worked out , it is thought that participation in the advantages of the Centre will not be limited to students of the contributing institutions .

		The plan looks to the acquisition of a common residence for the students who gather in
Washington	LOCATION	and for the appointment of a permanent director and a permanent secre - tary , with lectures by visiting professors and with assistance from government officials and others able and willing to further the plans of the Centre .

		At the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	meeting the report of the com - mittee and the proposed constitution with slight amendments were endorsed , and the same persons were appointed as another committee to present the scheme to the
American Historical Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion and other learned bodies of national scope .

		If this excellent plan reaches full fruition , there will thus come into being , not another addition to the overcrowded list of colleges , but a cooperative university for historical study which may be of high service to the cause of learning .

		To those young men and women who have begun their work under the limitation of remoteness from the sources , even more than to those whose geograph - ical location is more fortunate , the new plan holds out most attractive possibilities .

		Few suggested means for the promotion of scholarship offer a greater opportunity for hearty support and wise benevolence .

		`` THE GOLDEN FLEECE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The reviewer of `` Cotton as a World Power '' might well have stressed the adventurous aspects of cotton , for much of the appeal of Mr.
Scherer	PERSON	's book lies just in that .

		If he had named the book ' -LRB- as he named the first chapter -RRB- `` The New Golden Fleece , '' the volume might be listed to-day as a best-seller ; for we are all lured by titles , and those having to do with trade frighten us to the next counter .

		The genesis of the book is interesting : `` While reading
Frank Norris	PERSON	's
California	LOCATION	novel , ` The Octopus , ' in
South Carolina	LOCATION	,
fifteen years ago	DATE	, the thought occurred to the writer : if ` the epic of wheat , ' as
Norris	PERSON	properly phrases it , holds so much of interest and suggestiveness , might not the tracing of the great cotton influence prove to be quite as alluring , like the quest of a new Golden Fleece ? ''

		And right gallantly does he respond to the call , bringing to it scholarship of his own , much scholarship of others , and industry that must have been pleasure .

		Old political speeches , old pamphlets , and old newspaper files have been ransacked to show cotton weaving itself into the affairs of the world .

		Following the strands from times mythologic down to A. D.
1916	DATE	becomes the reader 's delightful and profitable business .

		And how the story marches !

		Cotton 's effect on the affairs of
Rome	LOCATION	,
Alexandria	LOCATION	,
Venice	LOCATION	,
Barcelona	LOCATION	, and
London	LOCATION	is considered .

		Cotton came into Eng - land in
1298	DATE	, as candle wicks from
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The part it played in the industrial revolution , and the response of invention to the call of the hour is skilfully dramatized .

		The pages thrill with biogra - phies of martyrs responding to
Arachne	PERSON	's challenge to weave better than she .

		Then we pass to
America	LOCATION	and the rise of the great cotton industry peculiar to the South .

		Mr.
Scherer	PERSON	takes a glance at what is known of cotton in
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Peru	LOCATION	.

		Who that has seen the won - derfully woven Inca cotton cloths in the Field Museum ,
Chicago	LOCATION	, but hopes for the day when some Rosetta stone of Central and
South America	LOCATION	shall be found to give the key to the unknown his - tory of great empires .

		If it is found in Mr.
Scherer	PERSON	's time , another fine chapter may be added to some future edition of `` Cotton as a World Power . ''

		With rare skill in narrative and selection of matter , Mr.
Scherer	PERSON	tells of the growing power of the great staple during those early years of the Republic , of the romantic invention of the cotton gin , and the tremendous acceleration of cotton growing and cotton commerce .

		The hunger of Lancashire looms fastened slavery on the South , seemingly forever .

		The hour struck for
David Christy	PERSON	to write : `` King Cotton cares not whether he employs slaves or freemen .

		It is the cotton , not the slaves , upon which his throne is based . ''

		The South used the cheapest labor at hand for its enrichment , and slaves multiplied .

		Then came the realignment of the states and the change of political doctrine .

		Through the great controversies that preceded the Civil War , Mr.
Scherer	PERSON	conducts us .

		Extracts from great orations fill the pages now , and long silent voices of great orators re - awaken , and if some of the fiery arguments seem antiquated and somewhat foolish in the face of what followed , a little looking around , a little listening , a little reading will furnish you with arguments just as fiery and foolish to-day .

		The
United States	LOCATION	has learned that its waste of blood and treasure was not for a high humanitarian purpose the mask of all war but for the settle - ment of economic differences brought about by cotton .

		In the great trade war now convulsing
Europe	LOCATION	, cotton is a frightfully destructive agent in the field and a beneficent influence in the hospital .

		Mr.
Scherer	PERSON	has accomplished his object .

		He has given us a book .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 231 TAMAYO Y BAUS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In his review of
Tamayo y Baus	ORGANIZATION	's `` A New Drama '' in THE DIAL for
February 8	DATE	, Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- bridge writes : `` It is a pity that the play could not have been published under a more attractive Eng - lish title . ''

		Many years ago
Lawrence Barrett	PERSON	appeared in an adaptation of this play by Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	, in which , by the way ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, though often referred to , did not appear as a character ; and the title , `` A New Play , '' was found so unsatisfactory that another was substituted , and as `` Yorick 's Love '' it became one of the most successful plays in Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	's repertoire .

		Apropos of the plot 's being `` remarkable for the skilful use of the ` play within the play , ' '' is it not probable that
Tamayo y Baus	PERSON	got the idea of turning the `` play within the play '' into reality , so far as the enveloping drama is concerned , from
Kyd	PERSON	's `` The Spanish Tragedy '' ?

		His play could not have been written without considerable study of the Elizabethan drama , a play with the title of
Kyd	PERSON	's would naturally attract him , and there he would find precisely `` the skilful use of the ` play within the play ' '' that Mr.
Woodbridge	PERSON	admires in `` A New Drama . ''

		A NOTE ON FREE VERSE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Inquirers into the `` past '' of free verse seldom carry the search farther back than the middle of the seventeenth century .

		Milton 's `` Samson Agon - istes '' -LRB- 1670 -RRB- seems to be , with many , the
Ultima Thule	LOCATION	of vers libre .

		But a perfectly satisfactory date can be found almost a century before this .

		Here is a passage from the first act of
Guarini	PERSON	's `` Pastor Fido , '' written in
1580	DATE	a work which had an enormous vogue all over

		THE WINDS OF SONG .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		However we may regard the New Poetry , we may not deny having derived from it more than the mere entertainment which its observation as a spectacle has provided .

		If consciously the New Poets have not succeeded in some of their high endeavors , unconsciously they have , perhaps , achieved more than they themselves imagine .

		One of those aspects of poetry upon which the move - ment has tended to concentrate attention is form .

		True , much of the dust of discussion has been stirred by controversies over mechanism , to the neglect of the much more vital element of organ - ism , poetic mechanism being merely superficial , whereas the organism is the very poetry .

		In this respect the New Poetry has served us well , if unconsciously , and so is it serving us in other ways .

		As a poetry of protest , of iconoclasm , it has also taught us how much more beautiful , how much more desirable , how much more precious , are many of the things that it seeks to destroy than , in the way of habit , we had come to hold them .

		Particularly is this true of poetry 's chief medium , language .

		One of the new efforts strains toward the outlawry of words , phrases , and locu - tions which long since the organism of poetry assimilated , taking over from them certain prop - erties invaluable for its own ends and in return conferring on them certain others enriching them in sound , in color , and in pith .

		No reader of the `` old authors '' with an eye or ear for the tone or hue , the flexibility or the plasticity , the expres ^ siveness or the suggestiveness of words , but is called upon to lament our impoverishment through the neglect of a host of them by current , or , if you prefer it , `` modern '' usage .

		The most effective workers in this field must always be the poets .

		The poet has ever been not only the greatest user , but the greatest maker of words , in which regard he claims and is allowed ^ a prescriptive freedom allowed to no one else .

		For this reason , if for no other , the attempt of a poetical movement which placards itself as `` free '' to forbid the poet the freedom which he has always enjoyed as a user of language , is an anomaly which no disguise wearing the mask of `` reform '' can for a moment conceal .

		Concrete example is always most convincing , so the reader 's attention may be directed to the war - fare against so-called `` poetical '' words , words which it is sought to taboo on the ground that they are mere `` literary affectations , '' as illustrated by one which has very recently drawn the fire of a distinguished New Poet in the pages of THE DIAL .

		This word is `` wind , '' used poetically with the long , or `` open '' sound of the vowel `` i , '' particu - larly as a rhyme for `` find , '' `` kind , '' etc. .

		Upon it an attack is made en echelon ; figuratively it is read out of poetry and in conclusion we are in - formed : `` Now we understand how ` wind ' came to be tortured into ` winde ' and can see why the latter is never under any circumstances to be em - ployed . ''

		Unfortunately for the proponent both the premises and the deductions brought for - 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	ward are contradicted by the facts , of which a brief summary may be presented : We shall probably have to wait several years for the instalment of the `` Oxford Dictionary '' containing the documentary history of the word `` wind '' from the date of its appearance in English .

		This is a handicap , but with the help of such authorities as are accessible an eclaircissement remains possible .

		We need not go tediously into the genealogy of the word , except to indicate its generally assigned root , the Gothic vaian , or waian which in itself is a clue to early pronunciation with the `` open '' sound of `` i. '' Coming down several centuries in point of time , we find that in Middle English the word was freely spelled `` wynd '' and `` wynde '' another indication of its vowel sound .

		If we consider our modern tongue to have begun , poetically , with Chaucer , we shall encounter these spellings in the `` Canterbury Tales . ''

		De - scending - another step , we encounter
Spenser	PERSON	and the `` Faerie Queene . ''

		Here we obtain a decisive clue , for here we find , in his triple rhymes , `` wind '' rhymed with `` kind '' and `` mind '' not only , but the three words spelled `` wynd , '' `` kynd , '' and `` mynd . ''

		Let us descend another step , to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here memory at once comes to the aid of the lover of poetry and of language and enables him to quote , from one of the most imperishable of the lyrics : Blow , blow thou winter wind !

		Thou art not so unkind As man 's ingratitude .

		Shakespeare long antedated any attempt by lexicographers to standardize either the spelling or pronunciation of the English language .

		The attempt at standardization of spelling came first , and not until long afterward that of pronuncia - tion .

		The movement toward this end may be said to have first taken authoritative shape in the
last quarter of the eighteenth century	DATE	and its initiators were
Thomas Sheridan	PERSON	and
John Walker	PERSON	.

		The former , who was the father of
Richard Brinsley Sheridan	PERSON	, in
1780	DATE	published his `` General Diction - ary of the English Language , one main object of which is to establish a
Standard of Pronunciation	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But as early as
1774	DATE	Walker had published a pros - pectus entitled , `` A General Idea of a Pronounc - ing Dictionary of the English Language on a Positively New Plan . ''

		He therein stated that his dictionary was ready for immediate publication ; but it was delayed for seventeen years , when his `` Critical Pronouncing Dictionary '' at last ap .

		- peared .

		But in
1775	DATE	he had published his con - densed Dictionary , `` answering at once to the purposes of Rhyming , Spelling and Pronouncing , on a plan not hitherto attempted . ''

		This was the work that became generally known as his `` Rhym - ing Dictionary '' and , in revised forms , is still in circulation .


Sheridan	PERSON	and
Walker	PERSON	were the fathers of Eng - lish orthoepy .

		Singularly enough , both men began life as actors , evolved into orators and elocution - ists , and ended as philologists .

		Both were passionate lovers of the spoken word and all later lexicographers have used their works founda - tionally so far as phonetics are concerned .

		From Walker we get direct light on the subject we are investigating .

		Of `` wind , '' he says , after giving two pronunciations , one with the short and one with the long sound of `` i '' : `` These two modes of pronunciation have long been contending for superiority until at last the former -LRB- short ` i ' -RRB- seems to have gained a complete victory except in the territories of rhyme . ''

		Continuing at some length , he remarks : `` Mr.
Sheridan	PERSON	tells us that Swift used to jeer those who pronounced wind with the ` i ' short . ''

		This evidence quashes the indictment of the New Poet , who contends , among other things , that `` wind '' `` never is and never was '' pronounced with the long vowel sound in prose ; and that its use in poetry was due wholly to `` wiseacres '' who `` insisted upon rhyming it with ` find / ` bind , ' etc. '' As a matter of fact , the spellings `` wynd '' and `` wynde , '' indicating the long `` i , '' besprinkle Early and Middle English prose and persist down to later times .

		Walker 's citation shows that it was still common to use the `` open '' sound of the vowel in the day of Swift and that only in that of
Sheridan	PERSON	and himself did the `` long contention for superiority '' not in poetry , but in general usage `` seem '' to result in a complete victory for the `` short i. '' There is , however , still another piece of evidence to be introduced , which is definitive .

		The word `` wind '' pronounced with the long `` i '' is still a live word , in good standing as a verb .

		When we say that a hunter or , if preferred , a fish-peddler , for the New Poetry leans heavily on the democracy `` winds his horn , '' we immediately falsify the assertion that the pronunciation condemned `` never is and never was used in prose '' ; that is , unless the pronunciation at once , by some strange alchemy , converts the prose into poetry .

		Of course if the latter is the case , it alters the contention !

		Now , when the hunter -LRB- or the fish-peddler -RRB- `` winds his horn '' he does not wreathe it about himself ; he forces `` wind '' through it by placing it to his lips and exhaling through it the breath of his body , that is , his `` wind . ''

		And if he is particularly long or strong winded , the sound has been known to carry a long way , even if thus far it has not penetrated the arcana of New Poetry .

		The verb `` to wind , '' as thus used , is derived directly from the noun , and its pronunciation is also derived from the former pronunciation of the noun .

		Is it necessary to go farther ?

		Let us take just one step .

		Our New Poet takes another fall out of the `` wiseacres '' because , in pronouncing the offending particle with the long `` i , '' they `` took all the windy connotations away from the word . ''

		Is this possible ?

		Reread the lines of that wise - acre
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, quoted above , and try an oral test .

		As a matter of fact , the
Bard	ORGANIZATION	, with his supreme artistic intuition , realized that the soft pronunciation of `` i '' failed altogether to convey the keen , piercing , biting edge which the `` winter wind '' possesses .

		The `` closed '' sound of the vowel can not do so in the same way as the `` open . ''

		So he rhymed `` wind '' with `` unkind '' for pure onomat - opoeic reasons .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 233 AN EVANGEL OF NEW LIFE .

		-LRB- The WHY MEN FIGHT .

		By
Bertrand Eussell	PERSON	.


Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		There is a type of temperament which is born to saintliness and martyrdom as man is born unto trouble .

		When philosophy used to be the handmaiden of theology and the world had a wall , when the enterprise of thought was dissipated by the timidity of faith , tem - perament of this type made a Christian hol - iday in autos-da-fe and other spectacles of the soul 's salvation .

		And in the days when new knowledge had pushed the world 's wall back to the infinite , when philosophy had become her own mistress and thought , as science , ad - ventured free , this temperament kept getting itself outlawed of men , belied and scorned and compelled to walk alone , in the byways of our common life .

		Nowadays , the influence of ideas of democracy , tolerance , and the value of originality makes for such temperaments a more endurable home in the world of the daily life : ordinary times regard them merely as eccentric and quixotic , but times of stress treat them after the historic manner .

		So
Shelley	PERSON	was treated , and so
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	; and they were so treated because of an inner kinship of nature .

		Both are endowed with a profound and ineluctable sincerity , a noble simplicity of mind that issues in a relentless obedience to the compulsion of motives in their logical and practical outcome in the tissue of events .

		Both are intense with moral indignation and righteous hatred of the un - necessary evil in things as they are .

		In
Shelley	PERSON	this compulsion was impulsive and of the imagination ; his Godwinian ideas of human conduct , which were not unlike what Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's used to be , were constantly vitiated by the more vivid realities of his own feelings , action , and fancy .

		In Mr.
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	this compulsion is dialectical and of the mind : his spontaneous humanism was constantly being vitiated by the logical im - plications of his ideas .

		Shelley the poet and
Russell	PERSON	the philosopher were both at their best when dealing with those matters that are farthest removed from the actualities of human conduct and from the living complex of instincts and appetites which is its ground .

		I say `` were , '' for
Shelley	PERSON	is now forever the
Shelley	PERSON	of abundant idealism and abundant irrelevancy , and
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	has , under the stress of this civil war which is devouring the youth and the beauty and the hope of
Europe	LOCATION	, finally discovered human nature and won from his discovery a vision of new life .

		`` To me , the chief thing to be learnt through the war has been a certain view of the springs i of human action , what they are , and what we may legitimately hope they will become . ''

		That this should be , is , in view of Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's past dealings with human nature , witness of the depth of the conversion the pentecostal calamity has worked upon him .

		Yet it might have been expected .

		Preoccupa - tion with the motives of human action , in the broad and in detail , has been a tradition of his breed , and his own absorption with the ethereal fastnesses of ultra-theoretical math - ematics , of metaphysical logic , of an unhuman logothetic ethics , is often crossed by a passion uttering itself with a vivid , lyrical eloquence akin to
Shelley	PERSON	's , and customarily altogether foreign to his themes .

		Nor is his dialectic vitalized by passion alone .

		It is often alight with deeply perceptive wit , cold with irony , and hot with satire painful in its truthfulness .

		But passion about mathematics is , on the whole , far from usual , and wit and irony and satire point to the existence of unharmonized motives in their user 's life and oppugnant ideas in his thought .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's has been , I suspect , a divided mind .

		In his thinking he has , like
Shelley	PERSON	in his feeling , followed with the blind singleness of absolute sincerity the logical movement of each successive idea to its fated end .

		Such ends are ordinarily at the opposite pole from reality , for the necessities of exact logic are not the compulsions of existence and consistency is more often than not the enemy of truth .

		It would seem that each time Mr.
Russell	PERSON	attained to a hopeless end of this kind , he made a new beginning and followed a fresh trail in the old manner .

		As a result , he may be credited with a number of systems , each inwardly whole , and incom - patible with the others .

		Readers of his `` Prin - ciples of Mathematics , '' his `` Philosophical Essays , '' his `` Problems of Philosophy , '' his
Lowell Lectures	ORGANIZATION	on `` Physics and Sense , '' his `` Justice in War Time , '' may follow these for themselves .

		They will suggest a central un - certainty of feeling , an incoordination of impulse for which the logical exactness of thinking is purely a compensation .

		The world of Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's conception , in these very dis - tinguished works , is a flat world and a static world , a world without action , from which the third dimension is lacking .

		The passion and the wit they reveal are interruptions which flash across their logical inter-articulations miraculously , coming from another region , God knows where , like the motion which
Descartes	PERSON	introduced into his plenum of rest to start this disarticulate and unhappy uni - verse 's becoming .

		One wonders what the devil they are doing in that galley even while one is delighted .

		They are human and uncanny , both , like Japanese drawings .

		234 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	Now , significantly , `` Why Men Fight '' has no such effect .

		The weave and texture of its thought is possessed of the qualities one is accustomed to expect in Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's works , even to the clefts and discrepancies which all dialectic must contain .

		But it does not op - press with the precision of explication that is proper to dialectic , nor defeat the straining mind with abstraction and tenuousness , with the faerie of the thinker , as
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's writing overwhelms with the faerie of the poet .

		The things this book deals with are near things , things important and terribly intimate , so intimate that they can not be seen save in the perspective of a great vision .

		And it is with just such a perspective that Mr.
Eussell	PERSON	en - dows them , a perspective suffused by what he rather ineffably calls `` Spirit , '' the loving affirmations , in spite of the skepticism of thought , of the excellences which alone can vindicate the otherwise tragic burden of life and living .

		The old intolerance toward self - ishness and patriotism is gone .

		They are sympathetically understood , and confederated into a larger and more impersonal love for mankind , and particularly for the future of mankind .

		Most significantly , the wit and irony and satire are absent .

		Brilliancy has given way to luminous depth and dialectic to perception in these utterances of Mr.
Eus	PERSON	- sell 's .

		They are full with noble passion per - vasive and sustained .

		The qualities of men , it has come to Mr.
Russell	PERSON	out of the war , are to be creative , strong , and free .

		Human nature is a complex of numerous impulses , more often than not unconscious impulses , and of desires seeking to realize themselves in action and in feeling .

		This action and feeling are not goals chosen or set for life , but the process of living itself : their good lies not in what they do , but in what they are , and they are the most and the best of life .

		Were the world made for us , living would be just autonomous and happy actualization of impulses ; but the world is not made for us ; our disharmonies with nature and conflicts with each other compel the repression of much of the impulse-born under - flow of life that any of it may rise to con - sciousness and go free at all .

		A great deal of the repression practised upon men by them - selves and by each other is inevitable ; much , very much , is needless and breeds an evil more vicious than the evil it seeks to abolish .

		For impulses are not destroyed by being repressed .

		Blocked at their natural outlets , they seek untoward ones , and instead of emerging in healthy and creative activities of the fellow - ship of man , they emerge in perversions of imagination , of belief , and of action , such as are the ground of the institution of war .

		Nor can these impulses ever be extirpated : they are of the fundamental constitution of human nature , and they can be only perverted , or opposed by other and stronger impulses .

		To escape perversion , they must either be made to regain their original direction , or con - fronted with a more potent impulsive life .

		`` It is not by reason alone that war can be prevented , but by a positive life of impulses and passions antagonistic to those that lead to war .

		It is the life of impulse that needs to be changed . ''

		.

		.

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	has learned concerning human nature of both
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	and
Freud	LOCATION	.

		To change the life of impulse requires most of all a change in its conditions , notably in those which are the work of man in the institutions of our common life , the state , property , education , morals , the churches .

		These practise upon the individual an original oppression which perverts impulse and com - pels it to generate still other institutions , evil , but able to serve it for utterance .

		All institu - tions , both original and secondary ones , are forces working good and ill upon the life of mankind , and mostly ill .

		Particularly is this true of the state , which is possessed of great , unnecessary , and harmful power that may be largely diminished without impairing the state 's value .

		Whatever be its other rela - tion to the citizens of whose collective force it is the repository , it is a tyrant , and its tyranny over them is most apparent in times of war .

		This it reaches ultimately in its power to compel universal military service .

		`` The state punishes , with , impartial rigor , both those who kill their compatriots and those who refuse to kill foreigners .

		On the whole , the latter is considered the graver crime . ''

		Indeed , in its relation to other states , in all its external activities , the state is essen - tially selfish .

		If men acquiesce in this terrible power , it is not because they think , but be - cause they do not think .

		They acquiesce because their vitality is low .

		They acquiesce out of tradition , out of primitive tribal feel - ing , out of a sense of the community of pur - poses which a state often implies .

		The integration of these , reenforeed by false ed - ucation , tends to endow the sentiment of patriotism with a religious character , so that nothing is too vile that is done for the state .

		Too strong to oppose , it becomes a sort of expanded self for the repressed or weak individual who has no force in his own nature , and a vicarious self-fulfilment of his own potentialities .

		Once it comes to be , it aims not merely to preserve itself , but also to grow in power .

		This it can do only by substituting law for force in the relations between men ; but law is static and retrospective it ham -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 235 pers spontaneity , growth , and creation .

		Hence the state is the most serious of all the menaces to liberty .

		It presents in its most drastic form the problem of combining liberty and personal initiative with organization .

		Solution for the problem is best sought , Mr.
Russell	PERSON	thinks , by increasing so far as possible the power of voluntary organization , by avoiding uniformity , encouraging initiative , and tolerating exception .

		The best form for the state is that of a federation , and the least harmful power , that of policing .

		Property is even more evil in its conse - quences than the state .

		It is both the cause and effect of diminishing vitality .

		Besting on the belief that all values may be measured in money , it restrains passion and limits life more than the fear of hell-fire .

		It is an insti - tution of worship which substitutes means for ends .

		It makes the American aim to be counted among the millionaires ; the English - man , among the idle genteel and the respect - able ; the Frenchman , among those who pre - fer safety of the family unity and name to freedom ; the German , among those who so prefer the state .

		The world has become money-mad .

		Through fear of losing money , forethought and anxiety eat away men 's power of happiness , and the dread of misfortune becomes a greater misfortune than the one which is dreaded .

		The happiest men and women , as we all can testify from our own experience , are those who are indifferent to money because they have some positive purpose which shuts it out .

		And yet all our political thought , whether imperialist , radical or socialist , continues to occupy itself almost exclusively with men 's economic desires , as though they alone had real importance .

		What is needed most in an economic system is that it shall leave men 's instinctive growth unhampered , shall provide a wide range for private affections , and every possible outlet for the creative impulses in men .

		Such a goal , socialism , of the existing programmes of economic reform , can not lead to : syndicalism and cooperative association promise more for its attainment , for these harmonize freedom with community of interest .

		The economic programme for the future must be a pro- gramme of industrial democracy such that it will be '' hardly more than a framework for energy and initiative . ''

		On this matter Mr.
Eussell	PERSON	is very close to
Steinmetz	PERSON	: he advo - cates an economic method such that `` the free growth of the individual can be reconciled with the large technical organizations which have been rendered necessary by industrial - ism . ''

		The achievement of such liberation involves education , but education has been and is one of the strongest forces against fundamental change .

		It transmits partizanship rather than impartiality : in the teacher it is with - out reverence for the child , whose free growth is not helped but distorted by interested dog - matism in the teaching particularly of history and religion .

		What is needed is growth in thought , not confirmation in creed .

		Creed makes for unity of organization and efficiency in fighting , and is therefore desired , while men fear thought .

		Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth more than ruin , more even than death .

		Thought is subversive and revolutionary , destructive and terrible ; thought is merciless to privilege , estab - lished institutions , and comfortable habits ; thought is anarchic and lawless , indifferent to authority , care - less of the well-tried wisdom of the ages .

		Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid .

		It sees man , a feeble speck , surrounded by unfathomable depths of silence ; yet it bears itself proudly , as un - moved as if it were lord of the universe .

		Thought is great and swift and free , the light of the world , and the chief glory of man .

		And hence a danger to all vested interests and institutions , so that churches , schools , and universities live inspired by the fear of thought and substitute for it dogma and authority .

		Education particularly needs to liberate thought , independence of spirit , to be guided by `` a positive conception of what constitutes a good life , '' `` to aim at an activ - ity directed toward the world that our efforts are to create . ''

		And it does not , anywhere .

		That it does not , the barbaric survivals of our sex-relationships that we call `` morals , '' no less than the other vested interests are to blame .

		And the problems that these raise need very particularly to be brought under the clear dry light of thought .

		The institu - tion of marriage is a political institution which has recently been subjected to in - fluences of which the law takes no cognizance , and such cognizance as it does take of the institution has a pernicious effect on the char - acter of men and women , on the propagation and education of children .

		It involves a widespread and flimsy hypocrisy that sac - rifices , not pleasure , but the future of the race .

		Among those persons who ought to breed , moreover , economic and other consid - erations have the same effect , and the libera - tion of women has meant the limitation of motherhood .

		A slow and destructive warfare is taking place , the civilized world over , be - tween the personal development of the indiv - idual and the future of the community .

		The best are being bred out , while those who are amenable to the authority of such a church as the Roman Catholic constantly increase in 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	number .

		The new population of the western world is thus likely to become one of female women and uncontrolled men .

		What an ironic , what a tragic commentary such a cul - mination must be on the woman 's movement !

		For the movement , by effecting through infer - tility the elimination of women capable of freedom , is likely to defeat its own end , through the survival of women entirely in - capable and undesirous of freedom .

		Every - thing must be done to encourage the reproduction of the best : social hindrances , economic hindrances , legal hindrances must be removed ; the institution of marriage must undergo radical reorganization .

		But above all , men and women need for the sanctifica - tion of marriage a new religion based upon liberty , justice , and love .

		And for the renewal and sanctification of the whole of life , no less .

		But such a religion is not to be found in the churches .

		Churches are vested interests , involving fixed creeds and the `` incubus of a professional priest - hood . ''

		From Mr.
Eussell	PERSON	's point of view the religion of the churches is not religion at all .

		Religion is the effect of a rather mysterious attitude of emotion which Mr.
Russell	PERSON	calls `` spirit . ''

		Human life , he declares , is a triad of instinct , mind , and spirit .

		Instinct is at the foundations of our lives ; it involves all the fundamental impulses and activities that keep life going .

		Mind is the exfoliation of the impulse to acquire knowledge ; its life is impersonal thought , while `` Spirit centers round impersonal feeling . ''

		It is possible to feel the same interest in the joys and sorrows of others as in our own , to love and hate independently of all relation to ourselves , to care about the destiny of men and the development of the universe without a thought that we are personally involved .

		Reverence and worship , the sense of an obligation to mankind , the feeling of imperativeness and acting under orders which traditional religion has interpreted as Divine inspiration , all belong to the life of the spirit .

		And deeper than all this lies the sense of a mystery half revealed , of a hidden wisdom and glory , of a transfiguring vision in which common things lose their solid importance and become a thin veil behind which the ultimate truth of the world is dimly seen .

		Spirit adds thus the third dimension to the life of instinct : it fuses the egotism of the senses with the impersonality of the intellect .

		It extends good will to the universe .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	has , I suspect , learned something from both
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	and
Bergson	PERSON	here .

		The war has led him to realize in his own experience some - thing of the `` intellectual love of God , '' of `` intuition . ''

		He speaks with the intensity and eloquence of experience , but also with the ineff ability of the mystic .

		`` Spirit '' is some - thing of a dark surd in an otherwise not un - luminous designation of human nature .

		Whatever it be , its restoration to its proper place in human life seems to be an indis - pensable condition for the righting of social wrongs and the abolition of war .

		War is a per - manent institution ostensibly aiming at power and wealth , but actually generated by the repressive effect of the other institutions on the life of men .

		Partly it is rooted in the combative instinct , which seeks freedom of action , partly in its service as a liberating medium to other impulses which are better served in other ways .

		Men want three things : self-expressive activity , victory over resist - ance , and fame .

		Distinguished men get these in their private capacity , for themselves , but the commonalty gets them vicariously , through the state , whereby it can be and do things it can not be and do in its several in - dividualities .

		As
William James	PERSON	has sug - gested , impulses and instincts can find expression , resistances can be conquered and fame attained by moral equivalents for war .

		The creation and use of such equivalents re - quires , however , a change of heart in men , the achievement of `` spirit , '' and radical changes in education , in the economic life and moral order of society .

		All changes to be suc - cessful must make for growth , spontaneity , initiative , and creative action in individuals , and against possession , conservation , inertia .

		The new life must be an active life , a free life , a fearless and hopeful life .

		Immediate change in things as they are , is not , of course , to be expected ; we must think in terms of the long run .

		And in the long run there is , happily , the power of thought to count on .

		This `` in the long run is greater than any other human power . ''

		It is true that creative innovators , thinkers of new thought , are usually outcasts and that loneliness is the penalty of spontaneity .

		But loneliness need not and should not mean aloofness .

		Spirit will guide the thinker , through reverence and liberty , to that confederation of himself with his neighbor , of the two with the community , and their community with the world through impersonal loyalty to a common , impersonal purpose : this purpose being `` to promote all that is creative , and so to diminish the im - pulses and desires that center round posses - sion . ''

		Such is Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's evangel of new life .

		We who are on the verge of a war for the sake of those assumptions of freedom on which it rests will do well to take its warnings as well as its promise to heart .

		It is easy to
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 237 pick flaws in the detail of its argument and the measure of its data , and if our lives are circumscribed by the narrow circle of mere instinct and mere patriotism , to deny its merit and appeal altogether .

		But the time is too momentous for flaw-picking by those who are animated by any real hope and set with any good will toward the future of mankind .

		This man 's message comes from too great depths and sounds too lofty a note .

		Particularly for Americans , it contains a warning and a pro- gramme , because
America	LOCATION	is in greatest danger from the evils it denounces , and near - est to attainment of the excellences it urges .

		It is a handbook for patriots whose concern is the soul of our country .

		He digs with a determined relish in the good fat earth of human character and human experience ; and if that earth happens to be the oozy muck of the barnyard , so much the better .

		Viewed from another angle , Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	seems a modern haruspex busy with dogged insistence over the quivering entrails of the poor poultry of his day .

		He even suggests a medical student one concerned , and over - concerned , with the odious remains of the dis - secting-table .

		But his most taxing phase is that in which he strives to enter the secret place where seen and unseen , known and un - known , come together , and indulges in an in - tensive , horrific study of the nexus which unites flesh and spirit busied with his Me and his Not-Me , his Self and his Selflessness .

		He probes insistently , incessantly , insidiously , into the hearts and souls -LRB- and bodies -RRB- of all alike the British pit-hand , the German in - fantryman , the Italian peasant ever intent on his great synthesis .

		He jangles confidently the
Petrine	LOCATION	keys ; his it is , almost , to bind and to loose .

		The cosmos is a unit , perhaps could we but unify it .

		One comes close to picturing an industrious hog , that roots in his lush pen and raises his muddy snout , now and then , toward the starry firmament .

		For the mud and the stars , with their respective implications , are but the two halves of one great Whole .

		The stream of English life has moved on for centuries in a double flow ; one current above the other , and the two have never quite blended .

		Hence , perhaps , the general im - mitigability of one 's place in English society .

		The under stream may be called the
Saxon	LOCATION	.

		The
Saxon	PERSON	nature inclines to deal with cer - tain primal matters in a fashion that is blunt , dogged , earthy .

		A
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	, an Ed - ward
Carpenter	ORGANIZATION	, may be restrained by certain philosophical and sociological considerations ; but many recent English practitioners in verse and in semi-poetical prose are re - strained only by artistic considerations which , in these free days , may mean no con - siderations at all .

		It disconcerts and repels when an author , moved by a grim determina - tion , opens up his people just as a cook 's helper , armed with a knife , opens up his oysters .

		One begs for a little delicacy , a little reticence .

		One comes to feel like an intruder , an eavesdropper as if in the thick of things to which one has no rightful access .

		Our author , apropos of a performance of Ibsen 's '' Ghosts `` by Italian peasants , in - veighs against the Scandinavians : `` They seem to be fingering with the mind the secret places and sources of the blood '' : he finds them `` impertinent , irreverent , nasty . ''

		And he goes on with some fine-drawn , but out - spoken distinctions which forward his thesis and perhaps aid his own defence , but which give the modest reader a considerable measure of malaise .

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	tells us that the Italians are over-sexed .

		So they are .

		Other authors have pointed out the fact , and have left it at that .

		But Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	does not leave it at that .

		He pursues his hapless Italian peasants of the Lake of
Garda	LOCATION	into church , into the theatre , into their little parties and gather - ings , and drives the fact home with a hundred strokes .

		He does not spare them ; he does not spare us ; he does not spare himself .

		One finally feels some degree of disgust and is prompted to inquire : `` Man , man !

		is the Italian the only one under the curse ? ' '

		In both these books all is surcharged , all is over-manipulated .

		Bits lovely in them - selves become wearing by their thick-pressing mass . ' '

		The bluebells here were still wan and few . ''

		`` The hazel spread glad little hands downward . ''

		`` From under the twig-purple of the bushes swam the shadowed blue , as if the flowers lay in flood water over the wood - 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	land . ' '

		As lovely as you like ; each phrase shows the spare , sufficing touch of the poet .

		But it all runs on , intermittently , for page after page , and is rubbed in mercilessly as the set scene for a rustic -LRB- and inconclusive -RRB- triangle drama .

		Our author piles it up .

		He will take the kingdom of art by violence by determination , perseverance , over-elaboration .

		The innocent English country-side becomes an oppressive jungle .

		`` A Frenchman , '' we feel like saying , `` would have done more with less he would have known when to stop . ' '

		If a man is intense over his woodland flowers , will he be less intense with his human creatures ?

		Hardly as I have already hinted .

		Two instances : two privates in the German army two victims , one need scarcely pause to say .

		One , ordered to climb a high ladder , knows that he is going to fall and fall he does , in great anguish and to deep disaster .

		Well , the reader is in the poor lad 's uniform , climbs with him , falls with him , suffers with him .

		The `` tactile values '' are triumphantly secured but you feel strained to the snapping-point .

		A stronger case : that of the young orderly , who is maltreated by his captain , and who comes to feel that the score is to be settled only between the captain 's throat and his own two strong hands .

		In the end the wretched fellow dies of rage , physical misery , mortification and -LRB- most of all -RRB- from sheer lack of power to coordinate the new floodtide of mental processes .

		We go through his ordeal with him and are almost as thor - oughly done up as he .

		Mastery , of course mastery , of a kind .

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's Germans do not altogether keep out of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The Alps look down on
Garda	LOCATION	, and behind them crouches the mad creature that springs and rends .

		The military nature qualifies , even conditions , the chief of our author 's `` set pieces '' those resolute , emphatic philosophical passages which , here and there , he casually hangs upon pretty small pegs or upon rows of them .

		A longish excerpt will serve to show his mind , trend of thought , style , and general nature .

		`` Tiger , tiger , burning bright '' is his text , and his discourse is on the supremacy of the flesh : Like the tiger in the
night	TIME	, I devour all flesh , I drink all blood , until this fuel blazes up in me to the consummate fire of the Infinite .

		In the ecstasy I am Infinite , I become again the great Whole .

		I am a flame of the One White Flame which is the Infinite , the Eternal , the Originator , the Creator , the
Everlast	LOCATION	- ing God .

		In the sensual ecstasy , having drank all blood and devoured all flesh , I am become again the eternal Fire , I am infinite .

		This is the way of the tiger ... This is the spirit of the soldier .

		He , too , walks with his conscious - ness concentrated at the base of the spine , his mind subjugated , submerged .

		The will of the soldier is the will of the great cats , the will to ecstasy in destruc - tion , in absorbing life into his own life ... till the ecstasy burst into the white eternal flame , the Infinite , the Flame of the Infinite .

		Then he is satis - fied , he has been consummated in the Infinite .

		This is the true soldier , this is the immortal climax of the senses .

		This is the acme of the flesh , the one superb tiger who has devoured all living flesh , and who now paces backwards and forwards in the cage of its own infinite , glaring with blind , fierce , absorbed eyes at that which is nothingness to it .

		Ah , the flesh !

		Even the carved wooden flesh on the crucifixes of the Bavarian high - lands is given its gruesome charm .

		`` Twilight in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' as may be gathered from the above , is nothing if not aggressively stylistic .

		A passage in a different tone may be cited , with the caution that it is but one bit of design embedded in a much larger one : Just below me I saw two monks walking in their garden between the naked , bony vines , walking in their wintry garden of bony vines and olive trees , their brown cassocks passing between the brown vine - stocks , their heads bare to the sunshine , sometimes a glint of light as their feet strode from under their skirts .

		... They marched with the peculiar march of monks , a long , loping stride , their heads together , their skirts swaying slowly , two brown monks with hidden hands , sliding under the bony vines and be - side the cabbages , their heads always together in hidden converse ... A partaker , .

		.

		I went with the long stride of their skirted feet , that slid springless and noiseless from end to end of the garden , and back again ... They did not touch each other , nor gesticulate as they walked ... Al - most like shadow-creatures ventured out of their cold , obscure element , they went backwards and forwards in their wintry garden ... And so on .

		The two monks were not pacing off polyphonic prose .

		They were walking ex - amples of neutrality . ' '

		The flesh neutralizing the spirit , the spirit neutralizing the flesh , the law of the average asserted , this was the monks as they paced backward and forward . ' '

		Peace to the garden .

		Peace to the monks .

		Most of all , peace -LRB- in due season -RRB- to him who watched them .

		It should be said finally , for the sake of clearness , that the volume of short-stories en - titled , none too judiciously , `` The Prussian Officer , '' is made up largely of pictures of life among the English colliers the same field and types that became known through Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's novel , `` Sons and Lovers . ''

		Sev - eral of these pieces are sketchy and seem to be juvenilia .

		`` The Daughters of the Vicar '' is the longest and perhaps the most meaty .

		`` Odour of Chrysanthemums '' provides the material for the last grim act of Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's one play , ' ' The Widowing of Mrs.
Holroyd	PERSON	. ''


HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 239 A MODERN MIND .

		SOCIAL EULE .

		By
Elsie Clews Parsons	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-


Elsie Clews Parsons	PERSON	is one of the few Nietzseheans we have among us .

		She sees that the business of understanding life is very largely a matter of sensing the manifold ways in which people get their desire for power satisfied .

		Nietzsche is so little understood in this country that it is good for us to have this demonstration that one can interpret life in terms of the will-to-power and still be , like Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	, a non-resistant pacifist .

		She makes it very clear that the power dogma is only a realistic diagnosis of life .

		Your ideal values are left unassailed .

		Nietzsche merely says that what we all seek is not so much hap - piness as the sense of control .

		This is the non - moral , raw material of living .

		The values depend on how this sense is obtained , whether through the destructive or the creative im - pulses , whether through life-denying or life - asserting interests .

		Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	has made herself one of the few radical writers who see that central conflict between the interests of personality , which make for life , and the in - terests of status , which inhibit and cramp and crush the personal life .

		What makes her books so fascinating is just this vision she has of the social and personal drama of the ages .

		There is none more compelling .

		As far as she is prophet , she is clear - voiced for the assertion of the personal values against caste and class and social gradations .

		As far as she is eth - nologist , she is a patient analyzer of the curious satisfactions upon which people build their codes and forms .

		Men and women are men and women to her whether they are the guests at her most recent dinner-party or her primitive friends among the Zuni Indians .

		Life drives always toward control .

		In her latest book Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	asks why some of the most familiar social categories are so `` compulsive to the conservative - minded , why they are given such unfailing loyalty , why such unquestioning devotion .

		To offset the miseries they allow of or further , the tragedies they prepare , what satisfaction do they offer ? ''

		And her answer is that we classify people because it gives us power over them .

		Status is simply a group solidifying of this passion for control .

		Classification is the weapon with which one group dominates another .

		Seniors control juniors ; men , women ; masters , servants ; the healthy and good , the delinquent and defective ; men , the lower animals ; the living , the dead .

		We even have the virtue of self-control to dominate ourselves .

		Social rule would be obviously impossible if our reactions to each other were entirely personal .

		Where would be the `` supremacy of the white race '' if each one of us accepted the negro individually on his own merits ?

		The fierce lust of group-power would be impossible .

		Status provides a beau - tiful economy of personal energy .

		If we label people in some category irrelevant to per - sonality , then we are saved the trouble of making any personal response or personal adjustment to them .

		Otherwise each case of personal domination would have to be settled on an individual plane .

		You would have to control the other person as another person , and not as the symbol of a class .

		Social classification simplifies your task immensely .

		Your victim gets born into a social category , or at least grows up in one .

		His label is all prepared for him by society .

		Moreover , he assents to his own subjugation .

		A social category makes everybody take for granted this relation of power .

		The dominator not only has the whole backing of his own class , but he gets the tacit support of the dominated class too .

		Status thus is a kind of insurance for the will-to-power .

		The satisfactions of power that social rule gives are thus magnified and reenforced in being shared by your class .

		They are far greater than any derived from merely personal control .

		The detailed analysis of this fascinating doctrine Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	presents with her usual conciseness and suggestiveness .

		In an Amer - ican intellectual world still too much divided between hopelessly unporous science and pop - ular sentimentality , her mind is a fortunate anomaly .

		Whatever she touches with her science , she makes significant .

		The profes - sional ethnologists are continually annoyed by these books of hers because she uses their data to illustrate truths of personal and class psy - chology .

		The sacred canon of pure , that is , useless science , has been outraged .

		The pro- fessional psychologists spurn her because she brings disconcerting ethnological specimens into what should be a disembodied discussion of generalized behavior .

		And the public is a little startled by the cool demolition she makes of respected social customs .

		If the workings of her hostess 's will-to-power over servants remind Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	of some folkway in a primitive African tribe , some bubble of our social self-esteem is pricked and we can take less seriously the forms and obligations with which we are surrounded .

		Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	uses her science in the highly important service of pricking these bubbles of social superstition .

		These religious , social , or sex taboos which only hamper life , however solidly based on reason they may appear , collapse when they are shown to be one with the irrational atti - tudes of primitive peoples .

		Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	's 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	mind goes about the world applying the sol - vent of her ethnological irony to the cruelties and intolerances and impoverishments of con - ventional people .

		Such a mind disconcerts and alarms not only the conventional but the scientific , who express their will-to-power by trying to lock science up , away from implica - tions or suggestiveness for the business of liv - ing .

		But such a mind is , all the same , a public blessing .

		The world would be a happier place if Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	's attitude were more common .

		The objective , impersonal attitude of science is still so new to our thinking that we are laugh - ably awkward in our wielding of intellectual tools .

		The superstition lingers that there is something dead and cold about a scientific attitude .

		Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	is one of that rare company who makes just the balance between the personal and the impersonal which we must get if modern knowledge is ever to fer - tilize life .

		But her objectivity never makes her personal discussion priggish , nor does the personal break down her firm lines of analysis .

		She has the detachment of science without the aloofness of the impersonal .

		You feel in her an irony that is genuine sympathy , and an intellectual comprehension which is none the less keen for caring so warmly for personal values .

		For her , people do not cease to be personalities by being types .

		And human in - cidents are just as richly flavored as if they were not also data for science .

		This charming adjustment between the scientific and the per - sonal is what the thought of to-day waits for .

		`` Social Rule '' should be read , not only as a brilliant `` study of the Will-to-Power , '' but as the product of a mind that is accurately modern in the intellectual values that we most acutely need .

		RANDOLPH
BOURNE	ORGANIZATION	.

		POLAND UNDER THE HEEL .

		WHEN THE PRUSSIANS CAME TO
POLAND	LOCATION	.

		By
Laura de Gozdawa Turczynowicz	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-


Madame Laura de Gozdawa Turczynowicz	ORGANIZATION	, in spite of her formidable name , is an Amer - ican woman .

		As
Miss Blackwell	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	she went to
Europe	LOCATION	to study and sing , and after three years married a Polish aristocrat , who was for a time professor in the
University of Cracow	ORGANIZATION	.

		The family estates were in Rus - sian
Poland	LOCATION	, and
Turczynowicz	PERSON	was connected in more recent years with the
Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	and the problems of agricultural education in that backward country .

		His wife entered into his labors with zeal ; and as they went from place to place , organizing and teaching the peasants , it seemed to them that
Poland	LOCATION	was entering upon a new stage of evolution , looking toward better times than had ever been known .

		In the midst of all this came war .

		At first mere confusion and uproar ; then the unifica - tion of popular feeling , Russians and Poles dropping their quarrels to unite against the common enemy .

		There was , it appears , no wish for war ; certainly no ferment of public opinion demanding it .

		The first reaction was that of naive distress ; the author 's servants , on hearing the news , `` as one , like a chorus , threw their aprons over their heads and began to howl , just as a dog keens and whimpers in the
night	TIME	when he is frightened . ''

		So with others , the manifestations varying with tem - perament , until people began to get used to the excitement , and to identify themselves with national ideals of victory and expansion .

		This was merely a matter of a few days , and less than a week after the terrible news had come a vague rumor that it was all a mistake produced a distinct feeling of disappointment .

		If any had their doubts as to the outcome , there was no time or chance to discuss them ; there was so much to do , and working for the great cause was so exhilarating .

		The
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	organization at
Suwalki	LOCATION	was under the presidency of the author 's husband , and she herself was a
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	nurse .

		The general moral elevation of the country seemed to find expression in the order from the Czar that all alcoholic liquors , with certain exceptions , should be destroyed .

		The spirits were seized by the police , and poured upon the ground , amid bestial scenes of peasants drunk on the last available drops , even lapping the liquor with their tongues as it flowed over the earth .

		`` I thought then what a wonderful thing the Czar had done for humanity .

		How brave it was deliberately to destroy a tremendous source of income in order to help his people ! ''

		Then the wounded came .

		The hospital , at a pinch , could take about two hundred and fifty .

		There had been no preparation , and everything had to be done .

		Cossacks arrived from the east , and innocently asked , as they came into
Suwalki	LOCATION	, if that was
Berlin	LOCATION	!

		Exag - gerated stories of victory were current ; the Russians had poured into
East Prussia	LOCATION	, by the road that passed close to the author 's house .

		Then the noise of battle was heard , and orders came to evacuate the town .

		Three chapters describe the incidents of the flight , but after various adventures Mine .

		Turczynowicz and her three children were able to return to
Suwalki	LOCATION	, the Germans having been driven out .

		Her husband became inspector of the Sanitary
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 241 Engineers at
Lemberg	ORGANIZATION	in
Galicia	LOCATION	, which was then in the hands of the Russians .

		Omitting details , it is now sufficient to state that the Germans returned to
Suwalki	LOCATION	, and the author , her husband far away , was left in the old house with her three children .

		She could not leave , one of her little boys being desperately ill with typhus fever .

		For seven months they had to remain , the children sick - ening one after the other , their lives at times despaired of .

		Finally , after sending in numerous petitions , they were granted permis - sion to leave for
America	LOCATION	by way of
Holland	LOCATION	, and they sailed from
Rotterdam	LOCATION	in
September , 1915	DATE	.

		The story of the long months of German occupation is told with extraordinary , with terrible vividness .

		Ability to write well is combined with an intimate knowledge of the country and the people , and strong sympathy for all who suffer .

		In comparison , numerous narratives of war experiences now before us seem superficial and inadequate .

		It would be difficult to imagine a more complete and con - vincing exhibition of the seamy side of war .

		German `` frightfulness '' is shown in its least restrained form , yet in the midst of horrors individual Germans did their best to be rela - tively or entirely decent .

		The church was the only thing left to the people they knelt round about the building in the dust of the street before it a heart-breaking sight those poor creatures never talking much , now grown quite inarticulate .

		The crucified people !

		Even the children were still and quiet , and weak .

		I often wondered what they prayed for , what the idea back of the telling of their beads was , and I came to the con - clusion they were without thought , just dumb and numbed with suffering , waiting for death to release them .

		That same mental attitude was in the air : every one felt so .

		Grey despair walked and sat with us ; we had to fight not to be overpowered .

		How many there were who tired of the struggle , laying violent hands on their own lives ; daily we heard of someone who had gone in this way .

		In the face of such a narrative , which not only interprets the general situation but gives innumerable details , it is difficult to preserve one 's mental balance .

		How the author lived through the events described , and yet kept her sanity and resourcefulness , we find it diffi - cult to understand .

		She not only managed to save herself and her children , but was the good angel of the town , incessantly helping those who could not help themselves .

		What may have happened since she left , we can only imagine .

		If we try to set aside our emotions , and interpret the story of
Suwalki	LOCATION	from the point of view of psychology and sociology , it is necessary to recognize certain facts .

		It is undoubtedly true that in times of war excep - tional individuals with criminal tendencies are likely to become prominent .

		Thus we are told that `` the Russian hospital was given a new surgeon-in-chief .

		He , the incarnation of Schrecklichkeit , too hard and cruel to be longer tolerated in the German hospital , was given charge over the Russians .

		When I learned this , there - were a number of officers sitting about my table drinking coffee .

		They told it as a good joke that this brutal man had been appointed , laughing uproariously that his first demand had been for a larger
Leichen Halle	PERSON	-LRB- morgue -RRB- . ''

		This dominance by some of the worst elements , unrestrained , sufficiently explains many of .

		the apparently unnecessary horrors of war .

		No one doubts the presence in our own population here in
America	LOCATION	of individuals who would make hell on earth could they have their way , of those , indeed , whose efforts in this direction are much more successful than we like to remem - ber .

		Secondly , the well-known German war - policy or for that matter , peace-policy of subordinating the individual to national ends gives a certain justification to acts which regarded singly appear to be those of mere brutes or lunatics .

		As the author shows in many passages , the German soldiers them - selves were not spared except so far as it was to the German interest to spare them .

		The individual , unless an officer , was absolutely of no account .

		That the officers , especially the higher officers , were able to escape from the clutches of the machine to some extent , and preserve personal privileges which had no particular relation to their efficiency , shows merely that individualistic instincts could not be entirely downed .

		The rank and file , after victories , were allowed even encouraged to display their personality in debauch , as a sort of safety valve .

		In addition to all this , it must be added that
Suwalki	LOCATION	is near the border of
East Prussia	LOCATION	, which had been raided by the Russians at the beginning of the war .

		It was the first place on which vengeance could be taken , and we are told that the excuse for everything always was `` Remember
East Prussia	LOCATION	. ''

		It is very doubtful whether all these evils may be ascribed to the inborn pugnacity of man , or to the barbaric nature of the Germans in particular .

		Max
Eastman	ORGANIZATION	says that in the long struggle for existence , `` the patriotic and pugnacious tribes survived we are those tribes . ''

		Yet after all , it was the Pueblos who survived , rather than the Apaches , the industrial and agricultural folk , rather than the professional fighters .

		The former could exist without the latter , but a world of rob - 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	bers means the extinction of the species .

		It is a fact that mankind is extremely open to suggestion , is highly educable , is amazingly responsive to environmental conditions .

		In this lies at once the hope and menace of the future .

		There is apparently no reason in their general hereditary make-up to explain the conduct of the Germans at
Suwalki	LOCATION	, or that of any other groups or individuals who have behaved disgracefully during the war .

		Aside from certain abnormal persons with debased inheritance , such as are found any - where , those Germans were and are capable of all the decencies of life , and of many admirable virtues .

		The problem is to restore their humanity by restoring normal human conditions .

		Something more is involved than a mere matter of sentiment , and the Germans are not the only ones who need assistance .

		Our hard but pressing problem is to determine for ourselves no less than for others what are the optimum conditions for human existence , and in what ways our activities may be guided into beneficent channels .

		By doing this at home we may do more to prevent the recur - rence of
Poland	LOCATION	's miseries , in the long run , than by going half-way along the militaristic road .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		A NEW STUDY OF
WORDSWORTH	PERSON	.

		WILLIAM WORDSWORTH : His Life , Works , and Influence .

		By
George McLean Harper	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Charles Seribner	PERSON	's Sons ;
$ 6.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		It is an earnest of the permanent fame of
Wordsworth	PERSON	that interest in his life , works , and value to humankind has grown steadily .

		In the past few decades he has been made the subject of notable activities in scholarship .

		These activities and achievements have not fallen to the lot of any single nation ; they have been divided among men of various nationalities , particularly the English , the French , and the American .

		England has been most conspicuously represented by Knight and
Hutchinson	PERSON	;
France	LOCATION	has yielded us the admirable volume of Legouis ; and
America	LOCATION	has produced the concordance and the investigation of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's reading by Professor
Lane Cooper	PERSON	.

		Now two volumes from the pen of Professor
Harper	PERSON	are added to the American contribution .

		It may be said at once that the study be - fore us is sound and comprehensive .

		In con - siderable degree it is the supplement and corrective of everything which precedes it .

		Not even the judgment of
Hutchinson	PERSON	, `` the most acute and accurate of Wordsworth scholars , '' or the insight of Legouis has been infallible .

		To be sure , the present volumes themselves do .

		not set all perplexities at rest .

		Professor
Harper	PERSON	has had the assistance , not merely of the printed material , but also of personal communication with men so well informed as Professor Legouis , Mr.
Gordon Wordsworth	PERSON	, and Mr.
E. H. Coleridge	PERSON	; he has had access to stores of letters and docu - ments not as yet made public ; he has con - ducted researches either in person or , more rarely , by deputy in various communities or through forgotten local records in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	; and he has devoted ten years to his task ; yet we should not be so bold as to say that his word is final .

		Words - worth , like Shakespeare , is so great and so baffling that no writer or set of writers can exhaust him .

		For all that , the present achievement is as thorough and satisfying as we may expect for many years to come .

		With unhurried care it sets before us the life , works , and influence of the poet .

		It traces the details of his conduct , his personal rela - tionships , the growth and changes of his thought and spirit , his contact with his times , his aloofness from his times .

		All in all , it gives us the best understanding of Words - worth the man , and in some ways likewise of
Wordsworth	PERSON	the poet , to be obtained from any single study .

		A few things stand out as preeminent amid the world of ideas and impressions which the book conveys .

		One is that
Wordsworth	PERSON	was , to an extent even greater than has been per - ceived , of a temperament passionate and susceptible rather than coldly tranquil and austere .

		Another is that he possessed an inner deference to criticism on one hand and to social amenities on the other which made the attacks of
Jeffrey	PERSON	and the connection with Sir
George Beaumont	PERSON	more harmful than has been supposed .

		Another less contradictory than it seems is that he was too tough and masculine to be crushed by the failure of the French Revolution , and that he did not relin - quish hope for
France	LOCATION	until
1802	DATE	or
1803	DATE	.

		Another is that , despite his egoism and the adulation he received from his little circle , despite too his astonishing indifference to con - temporary literature , he was not narrow but many-sided , and was less remote from public life than any other English poet except
Milton	PERSON	has been .

		The last is that his life fell into incongruous halves , the first guided by hope , the second driven by fear .

		Because our opinion of
Wordsworth	PERSON	is so likely to be derived from the latter period , a period of more or less apostasy , political , intellectual , moral , and poetical .

		Professor
Harper	PERSON	places
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 243 emphasis on the earlier .

		It is here that he has discovered most facts , here that he has revealed most shaping relationships some of which
Wordsworth	PERSON	did not afterward ac - knowledge .

		The study of the obscure years which followed the poet 's return from
France	LOCATION	is especially illuminating .

		The faults of the earlier period are no more concealed than those of the later .

		We are shown the self-will of the poet , and his almost reckless improvidence .

		The birth of an illegitimate daughter in
France	LOCATION	is frankly admitted .

		That his family practically dis - owned him is made evident .

		Personal con - siderations as well as disinterested motives are pointed out as determining his course .

		But if the poet is shorn of his excess of vir - tues , and invested with some thoroughly human frailties , he remains , when all is said , an inspiring figure , an essentially noble and heroic spirit .

		The contemporaries of
Wordsworth	PERSON	are pre - sented with fairness and sanity .

		Most inter - esting , of course , are
Dorothy Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		Dorothy was at first inclined to be sentimental , and her loving and minute observation of nature was rather a gift from her brother than an inherent quality .

		Two things , however , make it impossible to ignore her herself and her influence .

		Alert , re - sponsive , possessed of a keen sense for essen - tials , endowed with attributes which her brother lacked , and loving

		% `` She is to me , '' says Professor
Harper	PERSON	, `` the most delightful , the most fascinating woman who has enriched literary history .

		Poetry owes more to her than it owes to any other person who was not actually a great poet . ''

		Coleridge , with his instability , his procrastination , his addiction to opium , and his ailments and complaints about his ail - ments , was a trial to his two friends which they bore with exemplary patience .

		But beside his self-effacement ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	shows poorly .


Wordsworth	PERSON	, generous as he was in some ways , failed to give the full credit that was
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's due .

		He perceived , to be sure , that again and again his own best work came from his contact with that fecundating spirit , and he would have gone anywhere to be near
Coleridge	LOCATION	.

		But he commented ungraciously upon the `` Ancient Mariner , '' he was slow to forgive after a breach in the friendship had been made , and he failed to appreciate how his acceptance by the public was facilitated by
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's criticism .

		As for the personality of
Cole	ORGANIZATION	- ridge , faulty as it was , Professor
Harper	PERSON	can not resist it .

		Who can ?

		``
Coleridge	PERSON	's magnetism , '' he says , `` extends even to those who endeavour to fasten their attention upon
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Whenever the two are together , it is
Coleridge	PERSON	who catches the eye and enthralls the ear . ''

		In the study , of course , are individual con - clusions with which individuals will quarrel .

		The reviewer objects to a conception of romanticism of romanticism , at least , in English poetry which excludes
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		The conception is not a new one , and it can be presented plausibly enough ; yet it savors of `` Hamlet '' with Hamlet left out .

		Again , the perfection of artistic mastery attributed to
Wordsworth	PERSON	in the introductory chapter will very likely be challenged .

		While admit - ting that the range and genuineness of the poet 's taste and technique have been too sel - dom recognized , may we not say that on occa - sion both taste and technique were sadly at fault ?

		These weaknesses in Professor
Harper	PERSON	's work do not affect it so much as the bald statement of them would imply .

		In general there is singular freedom both from critical shibboleths and the mere desire to magnify
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		The poet is shown , as he should be , against the background of a tremendous epoch which it was largely his function to interpret .

		THE BAYS OF WAR .

		POEMS .

		By
Alan Seeger	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		We are invited very often in these days of war to admire the work of a writer because he has chanced to meet death in battle or has laid down his life some other way in the serv - ice of his country .

		It is a little like being commanded to rank the pictures of some deaf and dumb artist as masterpieces because he is deaf and dumb .

		That fact may well add to the curious interest of the work ; it may quite legitimately serve as an excuse for a philan - thropist 's purchasing the pictures in ques - tion ; but it could never justify his presenting them to an art museum .

		When an author suddenly grows into a romantic figure , the publisher 's temptation to capitalize the fact is almost irresistible and he can not be expected even to try to resist it so long as the public continues content with such a standard for judging the value of literary work .

		Sometimes the result is unusually unfor - tunate .

		The collected verse of
Alan Seeger	PERSON	is a case in point .

		Seeger was a young American who had only just passed his , twenty-eighth birthday when his division of 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	the
Foreign Legion	ORGANIZATION	was wiped out in a des - perate charge on the German trenches at Belloy-en-Santerre .

		Such a death undeniably lends point and feeling to the following lines , which were written only a short while before : But I 've a rendezvous with Death At midnight in some flaming town ,
When Spring	LOCATION	trips north again this year , And I to my pledged word am true , I shall not fail that rendezvous .

		But the poem of which these are the closing lines -LRB- it rapidly is becoming well-known -RRB- would have a thrill in any case ; and the habit of maudlinizing all criticism connected with , the war makes it preferable to risk a lessen - ing of this particular poem 's sentimental interest for the sake of gaining a more dis - cerning public judgment on contemporary verse in general .

		As a matter of fact , a large part of the poems in this volume can reasonably well stand on their strictly literary merits .

		Some of the best of them have no connection with the war , no foreboding of tragic death , and the pointedly funereal black cover chosen by the publishers does not seem at all in keeping with
Alan Seeger	PERSON	's usual spirit .

		We like to think that if
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	had lived he would have eliminated from his final volume some of the unnecessary gaucheries of expression , as well as some of the unworthy compositions which were rushed into print under the impulse of the sudden fame brought about by his death .

		The same thought occurs in the case of
Alan Seeger	PERSON	.

		For example , there really does n't seem any reason , either at the dictates of poetic diction or in the search for vigor of expression , for addressing
America	LOCATION	, in his last ode : `` You have the guts and the grit I know . ''

		He might have real - ized the fact had he lived to revise his work .

		It seems to have been
Seeger	PERSON	's habit to view events taking place about him almost entirely subjectively .

		The moods of world capitals , the glories of nature , the ebb and flow of war across the greatest battle-fields of
France	LOCATION	these he was interested in mainly as they hap - pened to chime in or conflict with his own emotions .

		Toward the end of the book his use of the first person comes to seem almost too persistent .

		The sonnet addressed to
Sidney	PERSON	is typical .

		It is , in part : I give myself some credit for the way I have kept clean of what enslaves and lowers , Shunned the ideals of the present day And studied those that were esteemed in yours ; For , turning from the mob that buys Success By sacrificing all Life 's better part , Down the free roads of human happiness I frolicked , poor of purse but light of heart , And lived in strict devotion all along To my three idols Love and Arms and Song .

		Not any supposed unfairness to other poets whose ways have not been the ways of war provokes this criticism of our habit of hero - worship for the unfairness , if there be any , is all in the other direction , toward those thou - sands of other soldiers who have died for their country in foreign lands , with just as great good will and cheerfulness , unnamed and un - noticed .

		Measured by that scale those all are as great spirits as
Brooke	PERSON	or
Seeger	PERSON	.

		These are more ; they are poets .

		AN AMERICAN OBLOMOV .

		THE UNWELCOME MAN .

		By
Waldo Frank	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown and Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Sixty years ago
Goncharov	PERSON	created in the hero of a famous novel one of those archetyp - ical characters that add so to the weight of Russian literature .

		What is the theme of `` Oblomov '' ?

		The incapacity of a quite healthy , whole-hearted , good-natured young man to make connections with the world about him .

		Endowed with a normal variety of gifts , Oblomov finds himself thrown into a society whose immemorial inertia has pre - vented it from developing a rich fabric of objective life .

		He himself , as a natural , aver - age man , might easily have made a career for himself in a more complex society .

		As it is , precisely because he is only a natural , average man , he can not create the conditions that are necessarily antecedent to such a career .

		And so he personally falls a victim to that very inertia which has made Russian society inca - pable of employing so many of its talents and the virus of which he has himself inher - ited .

		Mr.
Frank	PERSON	's
Quincy Burt	PERSON	is a sort of Amer - ican Oblomov , a character which is quite as typical in his own time and place , but of which all the terms are seen , as it were , in reverse .

		For
America	LOCATION	is simply
Russia	LOCATION	turned inside out .


Russia	LOCATION	is the richest of nations in spiritual energy , we are the poorest ; Rus - sia is the poorest of nations in social machin - ery , we are the richest .

		The problem of the
Quincy Burts	PERSON	, therefore , is not to find an external career or the incentive that makes an external career seem desirable ; the real trouble is not that their material instincts are unable to find any scope , but that their spiritual instincts are unable to develop suf - ficient intensity to give them a survival value even under the best conditions , while the con - ditions themselves , far from being the best , are almost the worst that the world has known .

		It is this that is creating a vast army of young men whose minds are filled , if not
1917	DATE	THE DIAL 245 with thoughts of war and suicide , at least with a sense of the futility of living .

		The primitive , material , national job has so largely been done that they are thrown out of the only employment they are bred for into a world that has not been interpreted and made ready for them .

		These are the `` unwelcome men '' of whom Mr.
Frank	PERSON	has drawn a highly individualized , but still composite , portrait .

		Nine readers out of ten who are not `` in the know '' will probably imagine that Mr.
Frank	PERSON	has attempted to draw a mute , inglorious
Milton	PERSON	.

		This conception simply shows how all but incapable we Americans are of appre - hending the simplest human values .

		We demand so little of life that we can not under - stand why any ordinary person should even desire to develop and express more than one or two strands of his nature .

		But
Quincy	PERSON	, like his obscure brothers in misfortune , is simply a boy all the sides of whose nature have unfolded themselves tentatively to the sunlight and the sunlight isn ' t there !

		His father , on the upward swing materially , scents an enemy in all these impulses of his son , a superfluous son , anyway , whose un - timely arrival has already branded him as an extra , leaden weight in an ascent all too dif - ficult at best .

		His mother 's affection , sapped at the roots , the cynicism , the blindness , the helplessness , and the inner poverty of his brothers and sisters are so many ever-present negations of the significance of life , a signifi - cance which he alone is totally unable to grasp if only because he is the offshoot of a stock that has immemorially denied it .

		The vitality of Mr.
Frank	PERSON	's conception is shown by the fact that it provides a concrete touchstone for most of the problems of our contemporary civilization .

		All the move - ments that are working themselves out in the thin , pragmatic way characteristic of the American mind at present refer back to just these `` unwelcome men '' in whom almost alone lies the promise of a richer and more rounded society in the future .

		Birth control , the free school , the socialization of industry , what is the object of all these causes except to stim - ulate and fertilize the long-forgotten , ignored , neglected impulses which give life its mean - ing and which have been bled and trampled upon by the steam-roller of industrialism ?

		It is just as
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	predicted half a century ago : industrialism has carried out its threat ; it has led to an appalling deficiency of human preferences .

		But half the ineffec - tualness of our reformers springs from the fact that they have never visualized in the concrete the human demands they are striving to fulfil .

		It is this that largely constitutes the social value of fiction .


Russia	LOCATION	, without her novelists , might have become conscious of the vacuity of her life ; but it was the novel - ists nevertheless that made her actively con - scious of it , conscious enough to seek values and create them .

		`` The Unwelcome Man '' belongs to the small group of American nov - els that promise to play the same part in our life .

		Is it a successful work of art ?

		Bather an extremely interesting than a successful one .

		The human material is perhaps not sufficiently thrown into relief ; there is not enough of an air chamber , as it were , between the animate foreground and the inanimate background .

		The author is so much interested in life that his own mind becomes at moments a part of its flow ; we are brought so close to
Quincy Burt	PERSON	that we ca n't see him .

		But of how many first novels are we able to say that they are too full of curiosity to yield up any one secret completely ?

		A NEW FRENCH BOOK .

		L ILLUSION HEROIQUE DE TITO BASSI .

		By
Henri de Eegnier	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- Mercure de
France	LOCATION	: 3 fr .

		50 . -RRB-

		In the preface to his latest novel , `` L ` Illu - sion Hero'ique de
Tito Bassi	PERSON	, ''
M. Henri de Regnier	PERSON	makes a kind of apology for publish - ing an unwarlike book during the war and is careful to explain that it was written in the
spring of 1914	DATE	.

		One wonders why it should be necessary for so distinguished a member of so cultivated a race to make such an apology .

		Had our ancestors refrained from creating works of beauty while their nations were at war , we should now have no art at all .

		It is the `` business '' of an artist to defend his national culture if indeed `` culture '' be national and not cosmopolitan by creating new art , as well as by fighting for it or labor - ing for it .

		The English poet ,
Frederic Manning	PERSON	.

		is publishing a book of singularly beau tiful poems , written for the most part on the battlefields of
France	LOCATION	.

		There are many other artists of the belligerent countries who have `` carried on '' in equally desperate circum - stances , and , since this is so , what reason is there for denying the use of a fine talent even to a mere civilian , simply because we are all at one another 's throats ?

		French cul - ture is not now in danger from Prussian arms but rather from an over-patriotic zeal , a kind of bellicose puritanism which forbids us to whistle as we work !

		If
M. de Regnier	PERSON	had written his book during instead of before the war , one would have felt it to be a real vin - dication of the deathless spirit of French cul - THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	ture .

		Perhaps , though , it is only the young who can still dream of beauty under the guns .

		`` L ` Illusion Heroi ` que de
Tito Bassi	PERSON	'' is one of those purely imaginative tales M. de
Regnier	PERSON	loves to tell himself and us of eighteenth century
Italy	LOCATION	.

		`` La Double Mai - tresse '' is his supreme achievement
Tito Bassi	PERSON	is a kind of elegant pendant , an after - thought , a midsummer night 's dream in
Vicenza	LOCATION	, city of palaces and dark streets and firefly haunted walks !

		You will find people who can not enjoy such work , who say : `` Yes , I see it is beautiful , exquisitely written , clearly rendered but what is its significance ? ''

		One can only shrug and reply : `` The same significance as a flower , a silk gown , a Chinese painting , any - thing that is ` merely ' beautiful . ''

		Yet there is another significance , a kind of moral in these tales of
M. de Regnier	ORGANIZATION	, some - thing which relates them to the imaginative drama of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	.

		I mean that they ex - press the impotence of the human soul to reach its desire , the thwarting of a fine , im - possible ideal by the rigid bar of destiny .

		The lovers of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's dramas are unhappy when lovers should be happy ; his dreamers achieve nothing ; his warriors fail .

		And the same feeling of the impotence of those who strive toward any noble end , which Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	expresses in his tragic , serious verse , is also expressed by
M. de Regnier	PERSON	in his serene , ironic prose .

		For
Tito Bassi	PERSON	is a poor Italian who dreamed of performing heroic deeds , who dreamed also that he was a tragic actor , but who was in reality only a moderately good comedian .

		And the tragedy of his life is that no one will see him as anything but a comedian ; no one , not even his wife , can understand his aspirations and bitter suffer - ings .

		He is always trying to live in the grand style and is always being brought down to the homely .

		His last and most desperate de - ception is ironically cruel ; he has been con - demned to death for having , as he thought , murdered his wife .

		He goes to the scaffold gladly , triumphantly , a tragic figure at last and finds the cloaked hangman is his wife , while all Vicenza roars with laughter at its comedian !

		Life is not so unlike that , nor art either .

		We are all Michelangelos until we begin to do drawings for the magazines ; all Shelleys until we find out the difficulty of writing even the humblest prose article .

		Perhaps its van - ity is the tragedy of mankind mankind which not so very long ago claimed to be a `` microcosm '' and now presumes to judge the weight of the planets !

		We are all first cousins to
Tito Bassi	PERSON	.

		Ignorant people ask : `` What is the use of art ? ''

		And like Pilate do not wait for an answer .

		Perhaps there is none to give ; as well ask : `` What is the use of life ? ''

		since art is simply a means of multiplying our per - sonality , refining upon our instincts and pas - sions , deepening experience , of giving life a simulacrum of immortality , of discovering the universe .

		This may sound very pompous , yet in cer - tain situations one feels the necessity of de - fining one 's `` of course 's . ''


Tito Bassi	PERSON	is noth - ing to me , nothing to you ; yet
M. de Regnier	PERSON	's art forces us to live the life , experience the passions and torments of this human soul he has imagined .

		Henceforth the life of
Tito Bassi	PERSON	is part of our own .

		This desire to multiply one 's personality is in all people , in a Michelangelo studying Dante just as in some `` mechanic knave '' gaping over the commonplace murders and rapes of the
Sunday	DATE	newspaper .

		Journalism gives us a coarse , trivial , vulgar multiplica - tion of personality ; it is the business of art to achieve this result ironically , if you will , but beautifully , nobly , with refinement .

		Perhaps that is what Aristotle meant when he said that tragedy was a purging of the soul by means of terror and pity .

		RICHARD
ALDINGTON	PERSON	.

		NOTES ON NEW FICTIOX .

		The reviewer opens ``
Lydia	PERSON	of the Pines '' with fear and trembling .

		He foresees visions of his choice of assorted nightmares : earnestly merry heroines , breaking a leg and sweetly thankful it was n't two ; men who build bungalows for birds and unite callow lovers ; self-supporting child - naturalists ; haroldbellrighteous cowboys .

		He is paid his penny and prepares to take his choice .

		But he reads a strong , unsparing portrayal of three or four welcomely human characters , several incidents entirely germane and not too thrilling , and a plot that is not marred , strangely , by a bit of pro-Indian propaganda about which Mrs.
Willsie	PERSON	seems to have been admirably in earnest .

		Lydia herself is a pretty fine piece of work : her love for , and loyalty to ,
John Levine	PERSON	, despite their difference of ideals and his proved dishonesty , makes her very real indeed , and very likable .

		She marries the right man in an ending that , natu - rally , is happy .

		But it is an irreproachably inev - itable ending .

		And what better `` blurb '' could a publisher himself write ?

		it is not a `` glad '' book !

		The thor - ough knowledge of the stage and of all things stagey which the author obviously possesses ap - parently does not include the capacity for under - standing the forces that underlie the struggles and the successes of its workers .

		Whether or not it sustains the reputation of the author of `` The Mississippi Bubble '' and `` The Magnificent Ad - venture , '' we are unable to say ; we can assert most emphatically , however , that the only thing that makes their successor readable is the appeal - ing jargon of Curly , the ex-foreman of

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		A WOMAN AND THE WAR .

		By the
Countess of Warwick	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doran ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		A result , it would seem , of the peculiarly diabol - ical methods and the previously unheard-of hor - rors of the present European war is a large crop of new literature which deals with the subject of ending all war forever .

		Various are the means therein suggested to secure and maintain peace : the pacifist may put his emphasis upon an imme - diate cessation of hostilities ; or he may consider such a step under present conditions merely a palliative measure ineffective in , or even detrimental to , the establishment of proper permanent relation - ships between countries .

		It is for a lasting adjust - ment rather than for an immediate creation of a world peace that the Countess of Warwick pleads in her recent book .

		She says , `` Personally I have no use for peace until we have won our victory or suf - fered our defeat .

		I believe that we shall win and that our first duties as victors will be to take whatever steps are needed to give peace permanence . ''

		As a requisite to permanent peace , she intimates , there is a certain fundamental condition which involves the position of woman .

		And we find here -LRB- as in other writings of , feminine pacifists -RRB- the smug assumption that woman , being somewhat more intimately concerned in the production of the race than man , is consequently more zealous for its conservation .

		Thus had the European govern - ments in
July , 1914	DATE	been made up of women , war would have been averted ; were woman economi - cally and politically independent , her vision as `` the savior of the race '' might be fulfilled .

		The
Countess of Warwick	ORGANIZATION	is primarily a feminist and sees that the worst features of the war as waged by
Germany	LOCATION	are due to the fact that the German women , more than the women of any other great power , are kept in the background .

		Having shifted , in part at least , the responsibility for the war from the shoulders of her sex , she discourses upon the many practical ways in which that sex may now , in times of war , be useful to her country , and considers how the cause of feminism , as well as that of democracy -LRB- inclined a little toward social - ism -RRB- , may grow strong through the present ordeal .

		She is flattering , almost embarrassingly flattering , to the
United States	LOCATION	when she looks toward us standing aloof in our neutrality and breadth of vision , ready to lead the world nations in their fight against internal `` diseases , privileges and in - effectiveness . ''

		These internal faults , especially in her own country , she is not slow to criticize , and besides the generalities on education and an `` honest interchange of opinion , she has many concrete con - structive suggestions to make for the social better - ment of
England	LOCATION	.

		The
Countess of Warwick	ORGANIZATION	has 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	had unusual opportunities of knowing the great Englishmen of her time , and of these she writes with intimacy and charm .

		Her tribute to
Lord Haldane	PERSON	, Lord French , and the glamorous per - sonality of the late King Edward stand out in high relief in a book where so much adverse crit - icism of government and conditions has been her self-imposed task .

		OGURI HANGWAN ICHIDAIKI .

Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
Peter Reilly	PERSON	;
$ 2.75	MONEY	.

		Western readers will find in this long episodic narration of `` the lives , the adventures , and the misadventures of the Councillor Oguri '' an example of a form of literature that has been for centuries the most popular one among the masses of the Japanese people .

		The present translation is a compilation of a number of kodan , or romantic chronicle-histories , which , at first recited by pro- fessional story-tellers to avid audiences , were later set down in book form , and often illustrated with the most blood-curdling designs by the woodcut artists of
Hokusai	ORGANIZATION	's age .

		The preface tells us that the various narratives here joined have been considerably condensed in the process of redaction ; but the narrative still remains better suited to the leisure of our forefathers , who loved
Mallory	PERSON	's interminable chronicle , than to the impatience of our own hurried day .

		To the student of Japanese customs and methods of thought , it will prove of real interest .

		It is a story of blood , battle , and wandering adventure , in which robbers , warriors , supernatural beings , and beggars combine into a kaleidoscopic whirl of formless narrative of Ash - ikaga times .

		It pictures curiously that fundamen - tal savagery , that profound blood-lust , which has been from the dawn of history so inexplicable a background to the delicate and urbane arts of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		ONE HUKDRED BEST BOOKS .

John Cow	PERSON	- per
Powys	LOCATION	.

		Shaw ; 75 cts .

		`` The essential thing , '' says Mr.
Powys	PERSON	, `` is that ... we should be thrillingly and passionately amused ; innocently , if so it can be arranged . '' '' ' ''

		.

		.

		and harmlessly , too , let us hope , God help us , but at any rate , amused . ''

		Well , we are , when we read `` One Hundred Best Books '' : not always thrillingly and passionately , perhaps , but at any rate , amused .

		The really funny thing , of course , is that Mr.
Powys	PERSON	himself has sunk to the very centre of gravity , thereby committing what he calls `` the only unpardonable sin . ''

		But he should not be so severe ; his fall from grace is entirely pardonable : it furnishes innocent and harmless amusement almost consistently from beginning to end of his book .

		Indeed , we rather resent two or three genuinely wise and eloquent pages in the preface , such fine notes as those on James ,
Hardy	PERSON	, and
Conrad	PERSON	, and other , not infrequent , flashes of insight ; for at these points sheer admiration unluckily compels the smile to vanish .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's general scheme is simple : he lists his favorites , more or less as they come into his head , assigning to each book or author a paragraph or two of `` adventurous criticism . ''

		His tastes are frankly modern , although he bows here and there to a great name as he hurries down the centuries to the very modern and somewhat `` massive '' novel which is his peculiar delight .

		The colloca - tion of names is often more than innocently funny : Catullus and
Dante	PERSON	,
Strindberg	LOCATION	and
Emerson	PERSON	,
Pater	PERSON	and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, are mystically yoked together .

		Mr.
Masters	PERSON	and
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	will be thrillingly amused to learn that `` there is something Chau - cerian '' in the `` Spoon River Anthology , '' though
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	will feel hurt that he himself is omitted from the Pantheon .

		The first niches in the gal - lery are filled by
King David	PERSON	,
Odysseus	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Baccha	LOCATION	?

		; the last but one , by
Vincent O'Sullivan	PERSON	,
Oliver Onions	PERSON	, and
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		Apparently Mr.
Powys	PERSON	is not very much amused by poetry : he lists only eleven numbers , none after
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	except Quiller-Couch 's `` Oxford Anthology , '' wherewith the book is brought to a sporting finish .

		As may be suspected , the author has `` purely psycho - logical reasons '' for believing in the value of his list : it is a confession , so he hints , of `` shame - less subjectivity . ''

		Perhaps the best way to indi - cate the type of subject thus revealed is to study his use of the adjective his particular part of speech .

		Beyond doubt , `` shameless '' carries off the palm for frequency , with `` demonic , '' `` massive , '' `` savage , '' `` ironical , '' and `` diabolical '' running close seconds .

		Let us now state the nature of the amusement harmless , let us hope , God help us which should put this book in the one hundred and first place : it is a revelation , we are led to suppose a massive , savage , and demonic rev - elation of a diabolical soul .

		THE PRIMATES or THE FOUR GEORGES .

Aldred W. Rowden	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 4.50	MONEY	.


Hogarth	PERSON	's famous picture of the sleeping con - gregation is often considered as typifying the religious conditions of his time ; and it is unfortu - nately true that the Anglican church in the eight - eenth century was sadly wanting in religious fervor .

		Frequently this condition is attributed to the con - trol exercised by the king 's Whig ministers : the rulers of the church being also important members of the house of lords , the government naturally selected Whigs to fill vacancies on the episcopal bench .

		As the clergy was Tory almost to a man , it was extremely difficult to find men of the proper type for the higher offices in the church .

		It may be doubted , however , whether this control really does explain the spiritual torpor of the time ; on the Continent there was similar dearth of religious enthusiasm , and the reaction which in
England	LOCATION	was represented by the Methodist and Evangelical move - ments had an earlier parallel in German pietism .

		But it is quite clear that a more spiritual episco - pacy could have done much to invigorate the An - glican church ; great bishops there were , such as
Butler	PERSON	and
Berkeley	LOCATION	, but these merely serve to emphasize the general mediocrity .

		The archbish - ops of Canterbury were scarcely above the com - mon level of the episcopacy .

		Mr.
Rowden	PERSON	, an English lawyer with a strong religious interest , has made the English primacy of the eighteenth cen - tury the subject of a sympathetic and fairly ade -
1917	DATE	THE DIAL 249 quate study .

		It begins with the consecration of
William Wake	PERSON	in
1716	DATE	, and closes with the death of
Charles Manners Sutton	ORGANIZATION	in
1828	DATE	.

		Eight men served as archbishops of Canterbury during the Georgian period ; but only two ,
William Wake	PERSON	and
Thomas Seeker	PERSON	, seem in any way to have measured up to the earlier standards of the primacy .

		The rest were learned and capable men , good and efficient administrators in a worldly sense , but with no real insight into the religious needs of the church .

		Mr.
Rowden	PERSON	's work is biographical in part , and contains a certain amount of personal history ; but his interest lies chiefly in the archiepis - copal office and in the great ecclesiastical problems of the time .

		He seems to feel that in their attitude toward the earlier dissent and the later Wesleyan movement , the primates were too timid and con - servative : a little wisdom on their part might , he believes , have saved the Methodists to the Anglican communion .

		It is interesting to learn , however , that the personal relations of several of the pri - mates with the great dissenting leaders , such as
Watts	LOCATION	,
Doddridge	PERSON	, and
Chandler	PERSON	, were of the most friendly sort .

		Americans will be interested in the author 's account of the plan to introduce the epis - copate into the American colonies in the decade just prior to the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Row	PERSON	- den discusses a great variety of other subjects , such as the various controversies between `` high '' and `` broad '' churchmen , the disabilities of the dissenters , Catholic emancipation , marriage and divorce , the negotiations looking toward union with the church in
France	LOCATION	and the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	com - munions .

		His work has been written with care and judgment , and will prove suggestive and help - ful to anyone who wishes to understand the relig - ious history of the eighteenth century .

		POVERTY AND SOCIAL PROGRESS .

		By
Maurice Parmelee	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		This is an excellent discussion of the causes of poverty and the problem of its prevention .

		The causes are characterized as follows : physical and mental defectiveness , social inadaptation of normal mental and psychical characteristics , certain characteristics and forms of social organ - ization , and physical environment .

		The biological factors in social life are first discussed ; then fol - lows an account of existing conditions , including the distribution of wealth and income , standards of living , and an estimate of the amount and extent of poverty .

		As specific causes of poverty are mentioned various economic conditions , chief among which is unemployment .

		Other causes dis - cussed are overwork , sweating , child labor , and industrial warfare .

		The relation of growth of population to problems of wealth and poverty , political mal-adjustment , and domestic and matri - monial difficulties are each given serious considera - tion .

		Dr.
Parmelee	PERSON	does not believe that the causes of poverty are so simple that they can be reduced to some single cause such as that urged by socialists , by single tax advocates , or others .

		The author begins his treatment of remedial and preventive measures with a discussion of the mod - ern humanitarian movement and the nature of phil - anthropic work .

		His incisive criticism of the methods and ideals of private philanthropy must jolt most severely those smug social workers who condemn all public relief and insist on the peculiar beneficence of a system of private charity which necessarily must gain its support from subsidies by the well-to-do .

		But any form of philanthropy , whether public or private , has little effect in lessen - ing the amount of poverty .

		To do this , the causes must be attacked at their roots .

		After dealing briefly with relief measures for the dependent and defective classes , the author considers a preventive programme .

		The eugenic programme is first discussed , but not regarded as likely to produce results .

		Likewise systems of insurance and pen - sions do not fundamentally affect the prevalence of poverty although they may alleviate it to some extent .

		Since poverty is the outcome of conditions attending the production and distribution of wealth , the preventive programme must be applied at this point .

		It is necessary to raise the rate of wages so as to increase the income of the poor .

		This may be done through legislation , by collective bargaining , limiting the increase of population , and by giving the laborer a share in the ownership of capital .

		A better distribution of income and of wealth is urged through such measures as profit - sharing and cooperative enterprises , systems of taxation such as land income and inheritance taxes , and other measures that tend to lessen inequalities .

		It is highly important to increase the productive - ness of society , which can be done by making industry more stable , by reducing waste and unnecessary competition , and by increasing the efficiency of workers .

		The movement toward the public control , especially of certain forms , of industry is approved and hopes are expressed for the eventual success of industrial democracy .

		Greater political democracy is also necessary ; like - wise more effective governmental organization .

		In choosing between humanitarian and democratic ideals the author selects the latter .

		The book is an able presentation of the subject and is quite fearless in statement .

		It is suitable for classroom use but serviceable also for that growing group of persons interested in social reform .

		Its organiza - tion is in some parts slightly confusing and is not so clear-cut as is desirable , but its general plan , purpose , and subject-matter are excellent .

		FRENCH POLICY AND THE AMERICAN ALLIANCE OF
1778	DATE	.

		By
Edwin S. Corwin	PERSON	.


Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Professor
Corwin	PERSON	, the present occupant of Wood - row
Wilson	PERSON	's old chair at
Princeton	LOCATION	, is very fond of making intensive studies of narrow historical questions , and then emphasizing , if not advocating , neglected views of those questions .

		The slightly controversial aspect of his style conduces , it must be confessed , to the interest of the average reader .

		In the present volume Professor
Corwin	PERSON	ably and in convenient compass has marshalled a mass of facts and authorities relating to the motives which prompted the French monarchy to aid the revolu - tionary movement in
America	LOCATION	, at first surrepti - tiously and afterward by open alliance .

		The popular notion , accepted by
Bancroft	LOCATION	, that
Ameri	PERSON	- THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	can intervention was primarily caused by the eight - eenth-century movement for intellectual freedom , is rejected by Professor
Corwin	PERSON	.

		According to the official statements of the French government , its action was entirely defensive , the object of this defensive policy being the
Caribbean	LOCATION	possessions of
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		This theory , of course , has never been accepted by historians .

		Was it desire for more territory or for increased commerce that primarily prompted
France	LOCATION	to intervene for Amer - ican independence ?

		Professor
Corwin	PERSON	thinks not .

		Quite sagaciously he protests against that prevail - ing habit of recent historians who `` are apt to give too slighting attention to all but bread-and-butter interests as interpretative of the conduct of states . ''

		Professor
Corwin	PERSON	finds the mainspring of French policy in the abiding conviction of French official - dom that
France	LOCATION	was traditionally the first of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean powers , that by the accident of the
Seven Years War England	ORGANIZATION	appeared to be a rival in pres - tige , and that
England	LOCATION	's embarrassment in
America	LOCATION	was the lucky occasion for the inevitable re-asser - tion by
France	LOCATION	of her historical position .

		As typ - ical of French thinking the following sentence is quoted from a confidential document of the For - eign Office penned in
1756	DATE	: `` The diplomatic object of this crown has been and will always be to enjoy in
Europe	LOCATION	that role of leadership which accords with its antiquity , its worth , and its greatness ; to abase every power which shall attempt to become superior to it , whether by endeavoring to usurp its possessions , or by arrogating to itself an unwar - ranted preeminence , or finally by seeking to dimin - ish its influence and credit in the affairs of the world at large . ''

		So it was not for liberty that French soldiers fought in
America	LOCATION	, or for democ - racy , or for land , or for yellow gold , but for glory and that particular kind of glory belonging to `` the fair days of Louis XIV . ''

		Professor
Corwin	PERSON	's book would be more valuable and convincing if he had paid some attention to popular opinion in
France	LOCATION	and its relation to governmental policy .

		THE PLEASURES OF AN ABSENTEE LANDLORD , AND OTHER ESSAYS .

		By
Samuel McChord Crothers	ORGANIZATION	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Perhaps the quality which we most desire in an essay is charm , something more easy to recognize than to define .

		There must , however , be a certain emotional depth or intellectual weight to ensure permanence .

		Because Lamb has these qualities he takes first rank among English essayists , surpass - ing
Hazlitt	PERSON	, who has emotional and intellectual content without the exquisite charm of his contem - porary .

		Mr.
Crothers	PERSON	's latest volume has charm without any special profundity in thought or feel - ing .

		Indeed , the lightness of his essays is part of their charm ; so delightfully do they play in and about their subject that we do not demand more of them than that they should be suggestive and entertaining .

		We are pleased to become with him an absentee landlord and to wander over the de - serted estates of history and biography without any sense of responsibility to scholarship or sci - ence .

		Thus we can take genuine satisfaction in
Matthew Hopkins	PERSON	's `` Discovery of Witchcraft '' of the year
1675	DATE	, and not care what his unpleasant business of ferreting out witches meant to some of his unfortunate contemporaries .

		So we can have delight in the human side of Saint Basil the Great when we learn of his interest in pickled cabbage .

		Similarly , we are charmed with our author 's de - lightful satire on educational conditions past and present in his essay on `` Protective Coloring in Education , '' the coloring being theological or sci - entific or whatever the contemporary fashion was .

		There is some admirable criticism in `` Seven - teenth-Century Prose , '' though the excellence of the old is somewhat overemphasized by contrast with some wretched specimens from the present .

		The deadly parallel is too good not to mention .

		The Authorized Version of the Bible reads : `` When Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all
Jerusalem	LOCATION	with him '' ; with which is compared the Twentieth-Century version : `` When
King Herod	ORGANIZATION	heard the news he was much troubled and his anxiety was shared by the whole of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	. ''

		The last two essays , `` The Taming of Leviathan '' and `` The Strategy of Peace , '' are more serious in tone since they are in large meas - ure suggested by the European War .

		The
Levia	PERSON	- than is from
Hobbes	LOCATION	; in
Europe	LOCATION	, it is political organization , which is to be tamed by democratic control ; in
America	LOCATION	, it is economic and industrial and professional power , which is to be tamed by idealism in the soul of the artist .

		In `` The Strat - egy of Peace '' Mr.
Crothers	PERSON	expresses his convic - tion that since we have built up a government of the people to safeguard the liberty of the individ - ual , we shall bring order out of the present inter - national anarchy .

		EARLY LIFE AND LETTERS OF GENERAL -LRB- STONE - WALL -RRB-
THOMAS J. JACKSON	PERSON	.

		By
Thomas J. Arnold	PERSON	.


Fleming H. Revell	PERSON	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The domestic qualities of
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	are traced in a biography by his widow , the military qualities , in the standard biography by
Henderson	PERSON	.

		Neither Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	nor
Henderson	PERSON	, however , was fully or accurately informed about the early life of the great soldier .

		Information regarding these formative years has been gathered carefully by Mr.
Thomas J. Arnold	PERSON	,
Jackson	PERSON	's nephew , and is now published .

		While no events of such nature as to revolutionize our knowledge of the subject are discovered , many small inaccuracies are corrected and many hitherto unknown facts are produced .

		The most important contribution to the biography of
Jackson	PERSON	is the evidence that the disadvantages he suffered in childhood and youth have been greatly overstated .

		Of still greater interest is a series of
Jackson	PERSON	's own letters .

		Most of these are addressed to his sister -LRB- Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's mother -RRB- , and they extend from his early manhood almost to the date of his death .

		The most notable is the letter of
January 26 , 1861	DATE	, in which he discusses the prospects at that crucial hour .

		The letters also deepen the impression , which Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	from his personal intimacy with
Jackson	PERSON	seeks to convey , that more has been made of personal eccentricities than is at all to be justified .

		The letters , like Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	himself , would give the impression that
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 251
Jackson	PERSON	was a cultivated man , with a considerable range of interests , and with far less aversion to society , and awkwardness in it , than is generally supposed .

		On the other hand , the testimony is ample that
Jackson	PERSON	on occasions was dull , absent - minded , and odd .

		Really , we surmise , there were two Jacksons the timid , self-absorbed stranger and the genial friend who had laid aside his reti - cence and was respected and trusted by men of prominence and discernment .

		The book confirms what we know already of the unbending will and absolute rectitude of
Jackson	LOCATION	.

		For those who would become thoroughly acquainted with either the exact details of
Jackson	PERSON	's life , or the fulness of his character , an acquaintance with Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's work is indispensable .

		THE FOUNDER OF AMERICAN JUDAISM .

		By
Max B. May	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		This biography of
Isaac Mayer	PERSON	Wise by his grandson is an act of filial piety performed with grace and discrimination .

		The life of this enthusi - astic and progressive rabbi is coincident practically with the `` adaptation '' of Judaism to American conditions .

		As Mr.
May	PERSON	says : `` Dr. Wise realized that if Judaism in
America	LOCATION	was to be preserved , it would be necessary not only to Americanize the Jew but also his Judaism .

		This was his life work ... His death found American Judaism modernized and adapted to its new environment and the
American Jew	ORGANIZATION	preserving the essentials of his religion , living in every community as an influential , respected , public-spirited philanthropic citizen . ''

		It is to-day an open question as to whether this description of `` American Judaism '' is correct , no matter how correct the description of the
American Jew	ORGANIZATION	may be .

		What is significant , what really stands out in the whole biography , is how definitively the reform movement in Judaism is a social and political movement and how little it is a genuinely religious movement .

		It sprang rather from a sense of social relationships and political responsibilities than from an influx of irresistible religious feeling .

		Acrimonious as its development seems to have been , and marked with persecutions and unhappiness , none of its protag - onists seem to have been moved by any great religious vision or any profound religious emotion such as is involved in religious reforms in other sects .

		Its bias was intellectual , and Rabbi Wise was perhaps as noble an example as any of the passionate intellectualism and ethical intensity that mark his race .

		His life and his achievement are in many ways the most important among the Jews in
America	LOCATION	of the past generation , and his success is perhaps the most tragic thing in the spiritual history of Jewry .

		EVERYMAN 'S WORLD .

		By
Joseph Anthony Milburn	PERSON	.

		Shores ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Living a retired life , but at the same time one of the widest spiritual freedom , Mr.
Milburn	PERSON	has evidently had time to ponder the deeper meanings of existence .

		Some of the fruits of this medita - tion are offered to those with a taste for such things in this engagingly communicative , inform - ally conversational volume .

		In his opening chap - ter he tells us , with some violence to Latin grammar , that he has `` lived in medias res , between two worlds the one dead , the other powerless to be born . ''

		That is , his boyhood was passed in the north of
England	LOCATION	, his later life in this country , so that he feels himself to be neither wholly Eng - lish nor wholly American ; and perhaps this in - complete adjustment to his environment has favored the development of the introspective qual - ity shown in the book , the tendency to philosophize about life rather than to live it unselfconsciously and whole-heartedly .

		He teaches the permanence and worth of spiritual things , the evanescence and worthlessness of material .

		An individualist in his doctrine , he goes so far as to assert that `` the primal virtue in the decalogue of achievement is not the talent , but the egotism of the talent . ''

		But how can this be if , as we are taught , modesty is the mother of all virtues ?

		Probably the answer is that the finest modesty is at the same time the most complete self-assertion ; so that here again is illustrated the law by which , in some mysterious way , extremes always meet .

		In eighteen readable chapters the author preaches his gospel of truth and beauty and love in a world that is , indeed , `` everyman 's world . ''

		PHILOSOPHY AND WAR .

		By
Emile Boutroux	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		To expect
M. Boutroux	PERSON	, as , a member of the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	, to maintain a philosophic view of the great struggle would be to ascribe too much importance to the fact that this academician hap - pens to be a professor of philosophy .

		`` It is a cruel fate to be reduced to talk and philosophize whilst the destinies of
France	LOCATION	are being decided on the battle-field . ''

		The moral indignation reflected from the field of battle obscures the outlook of the philo - sophic mind .

		M. Boutroux reviews the evolution of German science and German thought .

		He dwells upon the debt to
France	LOCATION	acknowledged by
Kant	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		He sees a complete desertion of the older ideals , and their replacement by a doctrine of force , mighty and indisputable in its own right , which in turn seeks and finds the sanc - tion of a philosophy .

		The eradication of feeling and the enthronement of an obedient discipline ignoring values , coupled with a ruthless efficiency disregarding the moral sanction , have become the German ideal . '

		In action it breaks obligations , spreads desolation , murders the innocent , destroys the cherished works of past glory , terrorizes and abuses in the name of a culture , justifying all means to the egocentric end .

		Clearly it is idle to expect a philosophic interpretation to emerge from such troubled unrest .

		M. Boutroux has not writ - ten a book on `` Philosophy and War '' but has expressed his outraged soul with patriotic fervor , and with some attempt to do so in the outlook of historical philosophy .

		Others with feelings less involved and interests in Germanic mentality of deeper origin , have been equally puzzled to recon - cile a professed idealistic culture with pursuits and actions so dismally and tragically contradictory .

		252 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 22	DATE	PAUL
VERLAINE	PERSON	.

		His ABSINTHE-TINTED SONG .

		Translated by
Bergen Applegate	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	:
Ralph Fletcher Seymour	PERSON	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Limited edition ,
$ 5	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Under this boding title , in a handsome volume bound in orange and green , and containing many collotype illustrations , are rendered representative selections from
Verlaine	PERSON	's poems .

		The translator avows that they `` defy interpretation in English '' and the reader must agree with him .

		No lover of
Verlaine	PERSON	can be satisfied with any version , and it is not likely that the present volume will tempt many to consult the original .

		The most effective medium for bringing
Verlaine	PERSON	's aroma to the Eng - lish sense is perhaps such verse as that of
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	, where a rhythm or an image from the French was haunting the poet 's brain .

		When we are obliged to follow line for line , even in free translation , the magic flees .

		This is not meant to imply that there are no happy renderings of indi - vidual verses , but only that the effort is seldom sustained through a whole poem .

		One might dis - pute occasionally Mr.
Applegate	PERSON	's interpretation , but after all the French is often susceptible of many meanings , and I prefer to cite one of the `` Poemes Saturniens '' which seems particularly suc - cessful .

		PROMENADE SENTIMENTALE .

		The sunset darted its level beam Where the wind-rocked water lilies dream ; The water lilies calm and pale That shine where reeds are green and frail .

		And I wandered alone with a heart full sore , By the pool where the willows line the shore , Where the vague mist wakened a phantom tall That wept in the voice of the wild fowls ' call , When they beat their wings by the willows white Where I wandered alone in the shrouding night Through the shadows that drowned the level beam Where the wind-rocked water lilies dream The water lilies calm and pale That shine where the reeds are green and frail .

		A noteworthy feature of the book is the preface , where a sane judgment -LRB- conspicuously rare among admirers of
Verlaine	PERSON	-RRB- is passed on the poet and his work .

		`` Verlaine never learned that the senses can only be exhausted , not satisfied , '' concludes Mr.
Applegate	PERSON	in his discussion of `` The Man . ''

		A brief bibliography and short notes to the poems complete the volume .

		The form of the book is worthy of all commendation .

		It is printed in large type on excellent paper .

		THE LONG ROAD OF WOMAN 'S MEMORY .

		By
Jane Addams	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Although the publishers imply that this book interprets the scientific theory of race memory , it is with difficulty that the reader gains the impres - sion that this is done .

		Nor does the introduction succeed in simplifying the problem .

		The closing chapter , however , contains a sentence germane to the thought of the book : `` A sincere portrayal of a widespread and basic emotional experience , however remote in point of time it may be , has the power overwhelmingly to evoke memories of like moods in individuals . ''

		The book is written in a charming manner , and will appeal to the popular , rather than to the scientific , mind .

		Mag - azine readers are already familiar with a portion of its contents , especially that which centres about the Devil Baby , whose rumored visits to
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	stirred many retrospective moods among the humble women who hoped to see him .

		They recalled significant experiences and observations , and thereby obtained a larger view of the problems of life .

		Through the many stories told by unfortu - nate and unhappy women are portrayed the special hardships of womankind rather than the sufferings of classes of humanity .

		There are untold hard - ships in the lives of men which might be utilized in similar ways .

		Whether consciously or not , the book will perform a service in strengthening the growing `` woman movement . ''

		In the later chap - ters the spell of the Devil Baby is lost , but reminiscences continue , one group relating to industry and another to war .

		Here , however , the use of memory as the vehicle for reaching one 's destination seems somewhat unnecessary , if not far-fetched .

		Experience is apparently the ener - gizing force that promotes rebellion against the unjust past and develops better ideals for the future .

		Does not this account largely for the moral abhorrence of war and for greater coopera - tion in industry ?

		HISTORY OF THE WORKING CLASSES IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		By
Agnes M. Wergeland	PERSON	.

		Univer - sity of
Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Shortly before the close of the
last century	DATE	there was published at
Paris	LOCATION	a monumental treatise by
Emile Levasseur	PERSON	entitled `` Histoire des Classes Ouvrieres et de 1 ` Industrie en
France	LOCATION	avant
1789	DATE	. ''

		In the course of time an extended review of the work , written by Professor
Agnes M. Wergeland	PERSON	, appeared in the `` Journal of Political Economy , '' and now this review appears in book form .

		As may be surmised , the author has written some - thing more than an ordinary book review .

		She was herself a scholar in the field of mediaeval and modern industrial history , and in her critique of
Levasseur	PERSON	she has provided a running commentary sufficient to give the casual reader a very satis - factory notion of the book 's contents and conclu - sions , and has , moreover , interpreted her author freely in terms of her own knowledge and expe - rience .


Levasseur	PERSON	's work comprised two ponderous volumes , one covering French industrial develop - ment from Roman times to the epoch of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, the other covering , relatively more fully , the development of the centuries between the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	and the Revolution .

		The sources from which the second volume was written were more satisfactory ; and , as the reviewer points out , not only is this volume more enjoyable and sug - gestive than the first , but it is , especially in the second edition of
1901	DATE	, a universally recognized model of painstaking and accurate scholarship .

		The present resume of the work is to be com - mended to anyone who desires a brief , authorita - tive portrayal of the industrial evolution of the French people .

		It is an account , in the novelist 's handwriting , of his arrival in the
United States	LOCATION	, and is believed to be unpublished .

		It was obtained from the

		The ending is as follows : `` He sees an American rail-way train for the first time , which starts modestly right away out of the street , and never stops until it lands him -LRB- from
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- in
New York	LOCATION	, him and his baggage in the street too .

		He sees that the cars are far more spacious and comfortable than those in the old country , and finds the journey much less fatiguing in the airy American carriage than in the close and wadded English carriage .

		He has scarcely started ten minutes when a little boy , with a bas - ket of pretty red books cries out ` Trackeray 's Works ' under his nose , and he purchases a copy of some of his own performances , which he has n't seen these twelve years , and which perhaps he would have wished should never have re-visited the old world or the new .

		Glimpses of
Colonial Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	abound in the pages of President
Ezra Stiles	PERSON	's notebooks and correspondence as presented in a volume edited by Dr.
Franklin Bowditch Dexter	PERSON	and entitled `` Extracts from the Itineraries and Other
Miscel	PERSON	- lanies of
Ezra Stiles	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, LL.D. , 1755-1794 , with a Selection from his Correspondence . ''

		Dr.
Stiles	PERSON	, who was born at
North Haven	ORGANIZATION	in
1727	DATE	, was for many years pastor of the church at
Newport	LOCATION	,
R. I.	PERSON	, and was called to the presidency of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
1778	DATE	.

		He died in
1794	DATE	, leaving considerable rec - ords of his travels in
New England	LOCATION	and beyond , as well as several books .

		Among items of varied interest his diaries make occasional mention of the Indian tribes still extant in and about
New Eng	LOCATION	- land in his time .

		For example , he notes in
1761	DATE	that the Saco tribe is extinct , and that `` there is not an Indian in the Prov .

		of
N. Hampshire	PERSON	, '' and of the Iroquois he says : `` The Senecas are esti - mated for
Number of Warriors	ORGANIZATION	to be half the Six Nations ; the Onondagaes the greatest Warriors ; the Onoydaes the greatest Rogues ; the Mohawks the best Counsellors ; Cayugaes piddling folks ; Tuscarores fierce & warm people not so good for Counsel or firm in War as the others . ''

		Very appropriately the imprint of the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	appears on the title-page of this volume from the pen of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	's president of a century and a quarter ago .

		The subject of margins , acutely interesting just now to certain frequenters of Wall Street , is not without interest , of a less feverish sort , to the bibliophile .

		In Mr.
Herbert P. Home	PERSON	's excellent manual on `` The Binding of Books , '' which has just appeared in a second edition , it is well remarked , though with an irritating excess of punctuation , that a `` broad margin has been said to be the glory of a book : but in recent years , the craze for wide margin has been carried to a degree of absurdity , especially in large-paper editions ; in so much , that it becomes necessary to qualify this assertion , and to say , that the glory of a book consists , not in an unduly broad , but in a finely proportioned , margin .

		In how many instances of recent ` editions de luxe , ' if the binder could but have a sense and knowledge of proportion , might not the plough be used with a liberty , which would be terrible to the prejudices of the collector , but consoling to the finer sense of the artist ? ''

		Many a book-buyer has rebelled against the necessity , which not seldom arises , of investing a considerable sum of money in blank paper in order to gain possession of the product of a certain pen .

		Perhaps the present paper shortage will check the tendency , referred to above , toward increasingly wide margins .

		If so , it will prove to be a shortage not wholly deplor - able .

		The slow development of the art of printing after its invention nearly five centuries ago is worthy of note in these later years when the Hoe press and the linotype machine and other mechanical devices and improvements have been treading on one another 's heels in their eagerness to displace the cruder appliances of our grand - fathers ' time .

		As Mr.
Henry R. Plomer	PERSON	says in his new book , `` A Short History of English Printing , '' almost four hundred years elapsed after printing was invented before the press as it was known to
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	and his workmen gave place to something less primitive and cumbrous .

		The Napoleonic wars created a more eager thirst for news in
England	LOCATION	, and a new and improved form of printing press was evolved to satisfy this thirst .

		First came the Stanhope press , which substituted an iron framework for the wooden body that had until then been in use .

		This gave greater stability and facilitated more rapid work .

		The platen , too , was doubled in size , thus allowing a larger sheet to be printed , and a system of levers took the place of the handle-bar and screw familiar to us in old cuts .

		Then
Koenig	PERSON	of
Eisleben	LOCATION	, and
Edward Cowper	PERSON	, a printer in
Nelson Square	LOCATION	, and
Augustus Applegarth	PERSON	, with many others , added each his in - vention or improvement , until to-day the per - fected press is as little like the contrivance that satisfied
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	as the eight-cylinder touring car is like the ancient ox-cart .

		There is little wonder that the early history of printing , simpler and less eventful than its subsequent story , is more familiar than its later and more bewildering record .

		The
American Library Institute	ORGANIZATION	, a smaller and more select body than the
American Library Asso	ORGANIZATION	- ciation , its parent organism , issues its `` Papers and Proceedings '' for
1916	DATE	in a substantial paper - covered volume of nearly two hundred pages .

		President
Ernest C. Richardson	PERSON	's address leads off , followed by utterances from such veteran libra - rians and masters of bibliothecal science as Messrs.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	,
Azariah S. Root	PERSON	,
Clement W. Andrews	PERSON	,
Frank P. Hill	PERSON	, and
H. B. Van Hoesen	PERSON	.

		Notable articles , tested by time , are reprinted from various sources .

		It is such a collection of professional papers as every librarian will like to see on his shelves .

		It is said that

		The
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	reports that
Mark Twain	PERSON	's historical romance , `` Joan of Arc '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is more in demand than any other book .

William Dean Howells	PERSON	's eightieth birthday will be a volume en - titled `` Ho wells '' by
Alexander Harvey	PERSON	, which is soon to be published by Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

Howells	PERSON	's place in the world of letters , of his contribution to
America	LOCATION	, and of the art which makes him one of the most conspicuous figures in American let - ters .

		Mr.

Konsistorialrat Dietrich Vorwerk	PERSON	, a German pastor-poet : '' Though the warrior 's bread be scanty , do Thou work daily death and tenfold woe unto the enemy .

		Forgive in merciful long-suffering each bullet and each blow which misses its mark !

		Lead us not into the temptation of letting our wrath be too tame in carrying out Thy divine judgment .

		Deliver us and our Ally from the infernal Enemy and his servants on earth .

		Thine is the kingdom , the Germans ; and may we , by aid of Thy steel-clad hand , achieve the power and the glory . ''

		The reorganized `` Red Cross Magazine '' presents an attractive appearance with its wealth of illus - tration and its variety of well-chosen reading matter .

		Of course the European war furnishes abundant material , both in picture and `` story , '' for such a periodical ; but it does not monopolize this magazine .

		Closing with the current number its eleventh volume , it proposes in future , as its editor explains in a personal letter , to broaden its field so as , if possible , `` to take in every path which leads to the betterment of mankind .

		Sanita - tion and happiness in the rural communities will henceforth concern the magazine as much as allevi - ation of the suffering of the enormous armies and the distressed millions of .

		civilians in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		THE SPRING ANNOUNCEMENT LIST .

		The war is beginning to affect the American publisher by way of playing havoc with white paper .

spring	DATE	carry no definite information as to price or date .

		The following list of
spring	DATE	announcements indicates however that the difficulties of the situation have in no way discouraged either the publisher or the ubiqui - tous author .

		324 CURRENT TENDENCIES IN EDUCATION .

		It sometimes seems as if educational ten - dencies might be compared to those of the changes in clothes .

		Styles and patterns alter ; the essential garments remain the same ; and even these superficial alterations appear af - ter all to work around in cycles .

		The more they change , the more they are the same .

		In one aspect , education is plastic and easily divertible ; in another , it is the hardest of all things to change .

		For to change it , means to change men 's minds , not their conscious beliefs nor their professed ideals but those mental sets which limit and control all con - scious thinking and desire .

		It would be a comparatively easy thing to educate children in an ideal way if the parents and elders did not have to be educated first .

		And , really , the old illustration of complete physical dis - ability lifting one 's self over the fence seems inadequate to set forth the impossi - bility of deliberate effort at radical alteration of mental habitudes .

		Nevertheless in the long run , clothes are changed in more than fashion or style , though the run may have to be long enough to take in centuries .

		The knights and ladies of the obsolete courts of a bygone world were garbed in other mode than the commuter and shop girl of to-day .

		For those courts are obsolete , and with their passing went the ways of liv - ing of which the court was but a symbol .

		And so it is in some wise with education .

		The educational reformer has little more in - fluence than the dress reformer .

		A few per - sons do something `` queer , '' and thus make it a little easier for others to do something which is slightly more sensible , somewhat further removed from convention , than what they were doing before .

		Meanwhile the active habitudes of life are changing in ways which are not willed and from these changes in conditions which underlie education follow inevitably transformations in its purposes and methods .

		A prolonged and insistent inspec - tion of the contemporary scene will not tell what is mere change in temporary fashion 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	and what is sign and evidence of enduring transfiguration .

		But a glance along a longer stretch of time shows tremendous dislocations .

		In speaking of current tendencies in edu - cation , then , one may mean either currents which are but the eddies of the day , no mat - ter how much they may be wearing away the banks which bound one 's own property , or one may refer to certain irresistible flows which are to determine the stream in years to come .

		If anyone tries to talk about the latter tendencies , he is betting on an un - known future , or , if you prefer a more dig - nified language , he is indulging in that liberty of prophesying which is man 's chief prerogative .

		If he is talking about the for - mer , he is discussing the technique of a pro- fession , a matter of interest to those engaged in it , but of no more interest to the general public than are the routine procedures of any other art save that they directly af - fect all who have children -LRB- and most do -RRB- and thus easily excite interest and engage con - troversy .

		Rival systems of handwriting , the phonic versus the phonetic method , both versus the word method , of teaching reading , are on the same level of elevation as most of our dis - cussions of ancient versus modern language and both versus natural science .

		They are primarily concerned with increasing shop effi - ciency , refining and enlarging the output , while reducing overhead expense and lower - ing the `` turn over . ''

		That , I take it , is why we do not find educational periodicals vying with daily newspapers , and weekly or monthly magazines , for the attention of even the most conscientious parent .

		To find fault is the only sure way of getting attention to the schools , unless it is to promote , by our modern advanced publicity methods , a brand new remedy for the teaching pains of all the ages .

		However , I fear I am taking more space for my introduction than I am going to be able to give to the body of my comment .

		But the introduction will , in any case , be more important than the body of my article if it leaves in the mind of the reader a due sense of the precarious nature of any effort to interpret current educational tendencies in any but their casual and transitory sense .

		I have forgotten just how many revolutions it was which the cynical character in
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's poem had seen , but educational revolu - tions occur about once a year , and overlap each other during about half that time .

		And this sense of the uncertain nature of the enterprise of observing and recording them is really significant if it but impresses the fact that the place in which to look for sig - nificant educational changes , those which are most likely to endure and fructify , is not education at all , but is important social changes which go on irrespective of education .

		For alterations of the former sort come and go ; the latter shape the aims and agencies of education .

		In my wagering as to the future which follows in the guise of a report upon the present , I am guided not so much by what I seem to see going on in the schools as by what I believe concerning the connection of these school events with larger currents of our social life .

		I attach very considerable importance , then , to the movement for introducing scales , stan - dards , and methods of measurement into teaching and administration , not so much be - cause of the amount of attention they are now receiving , as because they represent , I think , a seeping into education of `` efficiency '' con - cepts and methods which modern life is mak - ing inevitable .

		It is not a matter of liking or not liking them ; probably the first reaction of those of us who have developed their own highly individualized modes of efficiency and inefficiency is one of aversion .

		The signifi - cant thing is that modern industry has forced the recognition of the large part played by the factor of mechanism in any undertaking , and thus the recognition of the need that this mechanical factor be frankly acknowledged for just what it is and be made as accurate , as smooth-running , as is possible .

		That a school is a less mechanical thing than a factory goes without saying .

		But it has its mechan - ical side and base ; every study taught from the first grade on has its mechanical features .

		A movement toward standardization , toward the instituting of scales of measurement and applying them , is but the honest perception of this fact .

		To suppose that the movement is one of introducing and fostering the me - chanical element is to ignore the fact that nothing is already more deeply entrenched in the schools than the mechanical .

		To invest - igate it is the first step in the attempt to dis -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 289 cover whether it is within or beyond its due bounds , and whether it is actually accomplish - ing what it is supposed to effect .

		It will take time for the movement to clear itself up ; it is easy to detect much that is ridiculously like a caricature in all phases of the `` efficiency '' movement .

		But the movement itself is an expression of that scientific realism which notes the working of mechanism wherever results are accomplished , and , noting it , asks whether the mechanism is as effective as it may be .

		It was , I believe , Dean Swift who said that he had no idea of economy save as a servant of freedom .

		In the end , this must also be said of efficiency .

		The danger in the introduction of stan - dardizing methods in teaching and adminis - tration is not in the tools themselves .

		It is in those who use them , lest they forget that it is only existing methods which can be meas - ured and standardized .

		Efficiency methods might have been applied to various methods of using human muscle power before the advent of steam .

		Until after the advent of the latter , they could not have been used to measure the comparative efficiency of hand and leg power over against steam power .

		Doubtless many of the methods which are now in process of attempted standardization are not worth the attention they receive .

		Too often we are deciding upon which is best among three or four ways of doing things , no one of which is good .

		In short the limits of the efficiency movement are the limits of what is already achieved in the way of school tech - nique .

		The movement may succeed in ascer - taining which is the best , relatively speaking , among them .

		It can not tell whether any one of them has , relatively to some future inven - tion , any claim to existence .

		The counterpart , the balance wheel , of any such movement , must accordingly be one of creation , of inven - tion .

		This is represented , I think , in current education by the tendency to develop exper - imental schools .

		I do not mean of course that these are devel - oping just as a counterweight to the efficiency and measurement movement .

		They too draw upon forces working widely and deeply out - side the schools .

		Their immediate cause is generally dissatisfaction with the results at - tained in schools of the prevailing type , no matter what their efficiency may be as meas - ured by established standards .

		They often , perhaps most often , represent on their face simply a desire of some group of parents that their children have a happier and more whole - some school life than they have been enjoying , plus the reaction of some wearied and dis - gusted teacher .

		Even so , they lay hold on deep connections .

		The mobility and flexibil - ity , the freshness and variety , of modern life stand in increasingly startling contrast with the wooden routine , the deadly conventional - ity , of the average traditional school .

		The same forces which have wrought the change in the larger social life , and which cause one to choke and stifle when one happens to be forced back into the rigid circumstances which still persist here and there , are surely making their way also into the schools .

		Nor is this tendency to flexibility and fresh - ness -LRB- which is a large part of what goes popularly by the name of democracy -RRB- the only force operating to produce the exper - imental movement in education .

		Sometimes experimental schools , judged by their prac - tice , seem to be only escapes from routine I had almost written escapades .

		They have emancipated themselves not only from tradi - tion from also from directive ideas .

		This sort of experimentation represents , however , only the caricaturing shadow which accom - panies all vital motion in the sun .

		In truth , experimentation is the fruit of science in the field of creative endeavor , of controlled con - structive invention .

		It is based upon ideas and is a method for a continuous carrying of ideas on to maturity .

		That mechanical efficiency is a fruit of the modern scientific spirit is no truer than that this spirit has also awakened in man a sense of creative power and has equipped him with agencies for realizing the inventive ideas which the enlarged spectacle of the continuity of things breeds in his soul .

		I have not exhausted a list of the signifi - cant current tendencies in education .

		But the two which I have mentioned stand out to my vision at the present moment as I try to survey the flux and reflux of the infinite detail of school tendencies in their connections with the moving tides from which they draw all their enduring energies .

		290 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	COMMERCIAL SCHOLARSHIP .

		It is a matter of common knowledge in academic circles that the intrinsic value of the degree of
Doctor of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	is in danger of becoming seriously impaired .

		The exact significance of other academic degrees , such as that of Bachelor of Arts , Master of Arts , and
Bachelor of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, has become quite lost within the
last half-century	DATE	.

		But now the stamp of ripe scholarship and of productive research which was connoted by the most ad - vanced of our academic degrees is similarly threatened .

		The pressure that is being exerted upon it from three quarters may eventually reduce it to banality , unless it be speedily rescued from commercialism .

		In the first place , pressure is exerted by the candidate himself .

		More and more he is coming to feel that he has a vested right in the degree , if he spends a given length of time in preparing for it .

		The registrar 's add - ing-machine totals his graduate courses and his terms of residence ; dogged persistence in the collection of matter for his thesis re - places in his own mind any philosophical con - ception of scholarship as a search for vital truth or any conspicuous ability as an original investigator and expounder of truth .

		It must be owned , the candidate has had some reason for making such an assumption ; but it is a most unfortunate assumption , and one that must be firmly , if cruelly , dispelled , before any steps can be taken to redeem the degree .

		Pressure is also exerted by the prospective employer of academically trained men .

		Most of our universities and better colleges want only Doctors of Philosophy upon their per - manent faculty lists .

		If accepted temporarily without the conventional badge of scholarship , the appointee is warned that he can expect no promotion until he has secured the doctorate .

		`` We want only productive scholars , '' says the President ; and with this club over him , the young man scuttles for the degree in a neighboring university , or in the one where he is located for the time , displaying more alacrity than thoroughness in his pursuit of knowledge .

		Wives and babies serve to speed up the process , and his graduate committee is hard-hearted indeed if it allows foolish standards of superior attainment to stand in the way of a degree whose bestowal is con - tingent upon its mercy .

		Finally , there is pressure exerted upon the candidate by the very department in which he is doing his graduate work .

		This is the most inexcusable pressure of all , and the most easy to relieve .

		Each of the leading univer - sities which grant advanced degrees -LRB- and there are not more than a dozen that need be seriously considered -RRB- is desirous of turning out as many
Doctors of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	as possible from its graduate school .

		Its local and na - tional prestige as a seed-plot of scholarship is thereby greatly enhanced .

		Mediocre stu - dents are incited to study for the advanced degree , when they ought never to go beyond the master 's degree .

		Why ?

		Because the suc - cess of graduate schools and of individual de - partments is rated by the number of doctors they turn out .

		Quantity is to the fore just where it ought to be subordinated to quality .

		To the few universities with adequate staffs , educators look and write for prospective in - structors .

		Heads of departments in such universities keep a dignified employment bureau , with card catalogue containing the names , addresses , positions , salaries , and past records of their proteges .

		This system is no secret .

		It is at the public service , it is prac - tical , efficient , and perfectly honorable .

		But it exerts pressure upon the universities .

		If it is known that some good position is vacant , it is a temptation at the employment bureau to skimp the requirements of the candidate .

		If his deficiencies are complacently overlooked in
June	DATE	, the candidate may be placed in Sep - tember .

		Everyone appears happy and con - gratulates himself .

		It is a triumph of American acumen and of practical business methods .

		But the degree is cheapened ; schol - arship has become mercantile .

		Now is the degree worth saving ?

		There may be two opinions upon that subject .

		Per - haps
America	LOCATION	is incapable of maintaining a scholar 's degree at its highest point of sig - nificance ; perhaps those who feel as the writer does are behind the times .

		But there are many men on university faculties who deplore the pressure which is forcing down the value of the doctorate .

		Some remedy may be found for existing conditions by reducing the pres - sure along the three lines referred to above .

		Any thorough discussion of the doctor 's degree would involve us in the history of the meaning of all degrees in this country ; in our historical relations with
England	LOCATION	and Ger - many ; and in the relation of the universities to the conception and administration of edu - cation in the different states .

		For all this there is no space here .

		But of all the shifting standards of attainment required here and there for the different academic degrees , upon none should educators strive to agree more nearly than upon those for the doctor 's de -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 291 gree .

		It has long been the ne plus ultra in American scholarship , the `` great beyond '' upon which the universities launch with hope and confidence the flower of their intellectual aristocracy .

		We are all a little jealous of our most precious products , and by taking thought we may yet reserve for the doctor - ate some of the `` rights and privileges '' which properly pertain thereto .

		There are other minor considerations in - volved in what has been said , and to which reference should be made in this attempt to arouse cooperation in common academic prob - lems .

		Upon these topics there is space only to touch with a few queries .

		Can graduate work for the doctorate be profitably prose - cuted during the
summer	DATE	session maintained by many of our universities ?

		There is a dif - ference of opinion and of practice in this matter .

		What evidence of general informa - tion is to be insisted upon by examiners , such as knowledge of foreign languages , history , English literature , and general science ?

		May the general oral examination be held separ - ately , thus to precede that upon the accepted thesis ?

		Is the oral examination held before the academic public , or is it held before a small committee of insiders ?

		Are any stand - ards of English composition required in the thesis ?

		Is the thesis to be printed and de - posited before or after the degree is granted ?

		Need it be printed at all ?

		If the thesis is printed , who pays the bill for printing ?

		What proportion of graduate students hold univer - sity subsidies as fellows or instructors ?

		In all these matters there is no accepted usage .

		In institutions where the bars are down there is always danger that doctors will run through and disport themselves in the open pastures beyond the possibility of recovery .

		As affairs are , the insistent interrogator wishes to know where a given doctor obtained his degree ; then he draws his own inferences .

		By proceeding from the general to the par - ticular , we have been brought to the thesis as the foundation stone upon which the de - gree is commonly held to rest .

		It is at any rate the requirement upon which most in - sistence is everywhere laid .

		Yet here , too , the practice is most varied .

		It may be of interest to outline briefly what happens to a thesis between its conception and its public ap - pearance in the nursery of university scholar - ship , and to query what its magic properties may be .

		Possessing no competency to speak for the sciences , the writer will confine his remarks to literary theses , or , as they more properly may be called , literary dissertations .

		There is an ancient tradition held by some that the doctor 's thesis should be primarily distinguished by its originality : that it should preferably treat of that which eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither hath entered into the mind of man .

		A number of theses in
America	LOCATION	and in
Germany	LOCATION	, whence this tradi - tion is reputed to have reached our shores , have served to hold high this requirement among us .

		That he can select , unaided , such a recondite subject , or still more a suitable subject possessing broad human interest , is too much to expect from the average gradu - ate student .

		Several suitable subjects for a doctoral dissertation are therefore submitted for his consideration , and he makes a choice .

		It is worth while to point out that the per - sonal initiative in finding for oneself a point to argue or a field to treat is by this method lost to the scholarly character ; just as , fur - ther , the graduate student who is subsidized is not likely to be possessed of a devouring passion for his subject .

		He is in the act of being supported ; he has not left all to follow a scholar 's life .

		He may have a family , he must live , and he will drive bargains .

		After three to five years of residence in a graduate school , where he has been usually teaching elementary classes the while , the candidate submits his thesis for a first reading to his committee of professors .

		Sooner or later , the thesis is accepted , either in form or in principle , or in both , and the imprima - tur is placed upon it by the committee .

		When doctoral dissertations are printed , they reach a point where they come within the range of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	'S interest .

		A dissertation may be printed at the ex - pense of the author , or it may be accepted for free publication by a learned society , or it may be printed by a subsidized university press , or it may not be printed at all .

		Fol - lowing the European practice , if it is printed , a hundred copies or more must be deposited with the university library to use for ex - change .

		It is instructive to note that
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	does not require the printing of dissertations , and that the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	doctorate does not appear to have lost prestige by the fact .

		Harvard is , however , a law unto herself .

		So are
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Most other uni - versities feel that the printing of the thesis is a guarantee of the vital scholarship of the candidate , and that as an advertisement it has definite value .

		It is possible that the sec - ond is sometimes the dominating sentiment ; for it is certain that many dissertations escape from captivity too soon .

		So long as disser - tations are relegated to privately printed pamphlets or to dry `` Proceedings , '' there is 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	no great cause for the public to cry out .

		Such dissertations are written by specialists for specialists : similis simili gaudet !

		But when handsomely bound volumes selling for
$ 1.25	MONEY	or
$ 1.50	MONEY	are put on the book market by a university press , the public is entitled to ex - pect something of more general importance , written in a scholarly English style .

		There have been some notable contributions to lit - erary history by fledgling doctors , and there have been others which are paltry , ill-written , and immature .

		In the case of the latter , it seems a deplorable waste of money to spread over three hundred pages of well-set type such ill-digested and ill-treated material .

		Men of twenty-five to thirty are able to compile a technical pamphlet consisting of plots , re - sumes , and enumerations , but they are not likely to write a scholarly ~ book .

		Those who read dissertations have more often cause to curse than to sing praises .

		The theses for the French Doctorat are , indeed , an aesthetic delight to the reader ; but they , being written by mature scholars for a dif - ferent end , are in a class by themselves .

		Per - haps we might do well to look upon our doc - torate with the jealous eyes of the French , and give our master 's degree to those who simply wish a teaching degree .

		As a matter of fact , a teacher 's efficiency is seldom in - creased when he receives a doctorate .

		But for the present American needs , there is one suggestion we would make in the interests of the candidate , of his committee , of the unsus - pecting public , and of academic uniformity .

		It is this : let us confine the printed matter required by the university to its lowest terms ; let this minimum be as technical and dry and ill-written as the committee can conscien - tiously allow it to be ; it will be consigned to oblivion in libraries and in private gift - shelves , and the slim resources of the candi - date will not be seriously depleted .

		Later , if the subject is worthy of presentation to a larger public , let a book be written and pre - pared for the press with that consideration for the reader which is his due .

		There is no body which can handle a subject like this , where so many interests are involved , except the
American Association of Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Professors .

		Into the hands of this cap - able Association we commend the spirit of the doctorate and the vexed thesis requirements attached thereto .

		It is to be hoped that it will act speedily to save it from the clutches of commercialism , and fix its meaning in our academic nomenclature .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Professor
Jean Psichari	PERSON	, Greek man of let - ters and scholar of
the University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, has just given his important collection of books to the library of the
French Senate	ORGANIZATION	, where they will be beautifully housed in one of the grand saloons of the spacious Luxem - bourg Palace .

		But I prefer to associate these volumes with their former home in the plain but historic studio of the
Scheffers	LOCATION	, where I first saw the books covering the space from floor to ceiling and encircling the whole room where so many well-known canvases grew into being .

		Here , for instance ,
Lafayette	LOCATION	sat for the full-length portrait by
Ary Scheffer	ORGANIZATION	which hangs on the Speaker 's left in the
House of Eepresentatives	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	; and in the villa a rod or two away ,
Henry Scheffer	PERSON	's daughter married
Kenan	PERSON	, whose daughter married
Jean Psichari	PERSON	.

		Along with this scholar 's books are many souvenirs of the stormy days of the Eestoration .

		I have seen there the little red leather portfolio which
Lafayette	LOCATION	carried with him every day to the
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	, and on one occasion
M. Psichari	PERSON	showed me one or two of the let - ters of
George Washington Lafayette	ORGANIZATION	, written from
America	LOCATION	when the latter accompanied his father on the famous tour of
1824	DATE	.

		These and other historic relics and documents will go with the books to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, where a tablet will state that they are given in memory of the son of the donor and the grandson of Renan , Lieutenant
Ernest Psichari	PERSON	, who was rapidly coming to the fore as a figure in French literature when he was killed in
August	DATE	, during the first year of the war .

		The name of
Ernest Psichari	PERSON	is prominent in the list which stands and grows from month to month in the `` Bulletin des Ecrivains '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: 16 rue Bertin-Poiree -RRB- , a little period - ical which gives one the best idea of how the young writers of
France	LOCATION	are suffering at the front .

		The
February	DATE	number of this interest - ing but rather depressing monthly publishes the names of over 300 dead authors .

		Any Americans who may wish to aid this pub - lication , which a group of journalists in
Paris	LOCATION	sends free to the writers at the front , will be helping in an excellent work .

		I have spoken more than once of how the literary bodies of
France	LOCATION	are awarding their prizes to these young writers killed in battle .

		But so far as I know , these prizes have always been given to those who have printed some - thing .

		The
Paris Society of Men of Letters	ORGANIZATION	,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 293 however , recently bestowed a prize on a col - lection of poems still in manuscript `` Les Sons Graves et Doux , '' by a young poet named
Joseph de Joannis-Pagan	PERSON	.

		M.
Jean Jullien	PERSON	, the distinguished
Paris	LOCATION	music critic , writes me that these verses are remarkable .

		Their author , an infantry sergeant , was killed on
September 20 , 1914	DATE	in the battles around
Lirouville	LOCATION	.

		The war awards of this society are mainly known as the Barres Prizes , so named in honor of
Maurice Barres	LOCATION	.

		The medal was made by
Henri Nocq	PERSON	, a pupil of Chapu .

		The figure on one side was inspired by
Rude	ORGANIZATION	's famous group on the front of the
Arch of Triumph	ORGANIZATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	, and the equally famous `` seventy-five '' is represented underneath .

		The female figure with bowed head , on the reverse , is taken from a Greek medal struck 450 B. C .

		The motto reads , `` Credidi propter quod locutus sum et mortuus , '' which may be translated , perhaps , `` Because I believed , I therefore spoke and died . ''

		M. Barres in the third volume of `` L'Ame Francaise et la Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Emile Paul	PERSON	, 3 fr .

		50 each volume -RRB- , gives the history of the foundation of these medals .

		This series of volumes , by the way , is a col - lection of the articles contributed daily since the beginning of the war to `` L'Echo de
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		They are excellent examples of what war literature should be and show
M. Barres	PERSON	at his best .

		But the latest writing of M. Barres should be read by all who would catch the true spirit of the French army of to-day .

		I know of no more soul-stirring picture of military glory than that given in `` Le Blason de la
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, Is . -RRB-

		, an address read recently by
M. Barres	PERSON	before the
British Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Speaking of these war prizes leads me to mention one of a somewhat different sort .

		A retired artillery officer ,
Major Levylier	PERSON	, of
Decauville	LOCATION	,
Calvados	LOCATION	, writes me this touching letter : My son , Lieutenant
Paul Levylier	PERSON	, of the 25th regiment of dragoons , was doing his second year in architecture at the
Paris	LOCATION	School of Fine Arts when the war broke out .

		At the moment of mobilization , he wrote to his elder sister and asked her in case of his death to request me to give the necessary capital to found a prize at the school ; which I have done .

		His letter ended with these words for the rest of the family : `` Tell them to close their eyes ; then you kiss them and they will think it is I. '' He died bravely in Champagne on
October 6 , 1915	DATE	, crushed , at the head of his platoon , by a shell .

		His last words to his captain were : `` Tell father that I died for
France	LOCATION	. ''

		In this connection one might read
M. Paul Ginisty	PERSON	's `` Les Artistes Morts pour la Patrie '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Felix Alcan	PERSON	, 1 fr .

		50 -RRB- .

		It covers the period from the opening of the war to the end of
1915	DATE	and records the death of nearly 200 painters , sculptors , musicians , and architects .

		To the name of most of these dead young men is attached a short biographical notice , one of these being that of
Paul Nelson	PERSON	, an Amer - ican graduate of the School of Fine Arts , who naturalized himself in
France	LOCATION	when the war broke out , was wounded at the battle of the Marne , but returned to the front and was killed on
May 30 , 1915	DATE	.

		Some weeks ago
the Academy of Fine Arts	ORGANIZATION	invited to a reception the representatives of the various American military charities in
France	LOCATION	, the purpose being to thank them for all the
United States	LOCATION	has done for
France	LOCATION	in the present crisis .

		Sixty different organiza - tions responded .

		I have just received from
M. Charles Waltner	PERSON	, the talented engraver who is president of the
Academy of Fine Arts	ORGANIZATION	, the text of the little speech which he deliv - ered on that occasion and which he has written out especially for its place here .

		It is an ex - cellent proof of the friendly spirit toward us that exists in the intellectual centres of
France	LOCATION	.

		Being much moved by the great kindness which we have received from Americans , I seize this occasion to send a few words of thanks for the generous aid given to our poor wounded of the Conservatory and the School of Fine Arts given , in a word , to all our artists who have fought to defend our sacred rights and , at the same time , the civilization of the world .

		But these inadequate words of mine are far from repaying the debt we owe you and we shall keep at the bottom of our hearts as long as we live a feeling of profound gratitude .

		At the end of his letter ,
M. Waltner	PERSON	adds these lines on the effect which he thinks the war will have on the fine arts in
France	LOCATION	: It is not easy to form a correct idea on this point ; but it seems to me that the least that can happen will be to bring about forever the abandonment in architecture , painting , engraving , and even in liter - ature , of that heavy and presumptuous bad taste , which is without tradition , knowledge , refinement in a word , without respect for any truth whatsoever .

		Bad taste was beginning , through pure snobbishness , to infiltrate all classes of society to the great det - riment of the joy of possessing really beautiful works of art .

		Perhaps the best example of American aid to French artists is that offered by the Com - mittee of the American Students of the
Paris	LOCATION	Fine Arts School , 17 quai Malaquais , which issues an illustrated gazette .

		Mr.
Francis Jaques	PERSON	, in sending me a copy of this very original periodical , writes : `` We get out 24 numbers a month one for each studio of the school and we have been doing this for over 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5 two years	DATE	. ''

		Each number contains 24 pages , made up largely of illustrated letters from young French artists at the front , which are full of French wit and artistic feeling .

		Another and very different `` Gazette des Beaux Arts '' is the one founded in
1859	DATE	and still being issued .

		I call attention to it be - cause of the index to the whole collection down to
1908	DATE	, which has just been brought out by
M. Charles	PERSON	du Bus , of the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	, who is now at the front .

		This `` Table '' consists of two imperial octavo vol - umes of about 850 pages and lists 4500 articles and 18,000 engravings , a mass of art information for the period to be found per - haps nowhere else .

		Copies 25 francs for the two volumes may be had at 106
Boule	LOCATION	- vard Saint-Germain .

		The most reliable art work done at the front is that known as the `` Documents of the Pho - tographic Section of the French Army , '' the best of whose negatives are now being repro - duced most artistically in a series of ten albums under the title `` Patrie '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Ser - ment , 20 fr .

		each -RRB- .

		Three have already come out , quartos , each containing 24 helio - gravures in two colors .

		If they escape death , what the artist-sol - diers dread most is to be so wounded as to lose the use of their right arm .

		All the French military hospitals contain young men learning to employ the left hand .

		In fact , so common is this that
M. Albert Charleux	PERSON	, a young , public-school teacher who lost his right arm at the age of 14 , has published a useful and curious little book entitled , `` Pour Ecrire de la Main Gauche '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Armand Colin	PERSON	, 1 fr . -RRB-

		, which explains , with the aid of dia - grams , `` how to educate the left arm . ''

		But of course blindness is the saddest calam - ity which can afflict the victims of this dread - ful war , and this is well brought out by the talented Swiss novelist ,
M. Benjamin Vallot	PERSON	- ton in his pamphlet , `` Fonds Suisse Eomand en faveur des Soldats Aveugles en
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Fischbacher	PERSON	, 1 fr . -RRB-

		Maurice
Maeterlinck	PERSON	has also published a volume of miscellanies on the war , as , in fact , has almost every European writer of any rep - utation .

		`` It is a real obsession , ''
M. Alcide Ebray	PERSON	has said to me , very truly .

		Books of this kind still sell well and publishers push their authors in this direction , if there are any who hold back .

		Thus the first venture of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	in this field `` Les Debris de la Guerre '' -LRB-

STANTON	PERSON	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 295 CASUAL COMMENT .

		A FRENCH POET 'S PROTEST against the war comes to hand in Mr.
P. J. Jouve	PERSON	's `` Poeme contre le Grand Crime . ''

		The little book really contains four poems , one addressed to a slain soldier , another to unfortunate
Belgium	LOCATION	, a third called a hospital song , and , finally , an impassioned outpouring to
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, whose prevision of the present horrors is effectively worked into the poet 's verses .

		As in his earlier sheaf of poems entitled `` Men of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' so here he allows himself the utmost freedom in the construction of his verse , gaining thereby in rude energy what he loses in grace and harmony .

		A thorough - going pacifist , with an intense admiration for his pacific fellow-countryman , Remain Hol - land , for
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and for
Walt Whitman	PERSON	,
M. Jouve	PERSON	pictures the waste and the wantonness of war , and foresees the day when love shall prevail over hate .

		For his own part , he even now forgives the `` criminal ruler '' who has precipitated the present conflict .

		As a sample of his style , let this reproachful utterance of his slain soldier be quoted here , in a rather literal rendering : Why have you killed me ?

		Wherefore my death , and not the fair fruit I alone could have given you ?

		To what purpose my death ?

		By what right my death ?

		For what work of human endeavor in the world , or for what new happiness ?

		To defend what ?

		No land , no money were worth my slaying and being slain .

		And did one ever accomplish aught useful and good with death ?

		THE DRAMA FREED PROM THE FETTERS OF CONVENTION is accomplishing notable things in this country .

		It has been discovered that the stage was made for man , not man for the stage .

		Professor
Baker	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, in a recent lecture before the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	, en - larged upon this lately achieved emancipation .

		`` Somehow the stage of the 1890-1900 and 1900-1910 period was too rigid , '' he remarked .

		`` Playwrights were bound down by conven - tions which prescribed that you must act a thing this way and say a thing that way .

		Con - temporary playwrights have been insistent that after all the stage is merely a means to an end . ''

		Furthermore , our playwrights have become convinced `` that they ought to exper - iment as much as they liked in developing material into the play-form , whether it event - uated into one , three , or five acts .

		To-day we are using one-act plays as we never used them ten years ago , and we are recognizing that we can do something satisfactory in the one-act play .

		And look at the perfect free - dom with which we are using three or four act plays to-day as contrasted with the old conditions . ''

		The one-act play used to be relegated to the vaudeville performance or at most tucked in as a curtain-raiser , an accommodation for late-comers and other stragglers , at the better-class theatre .

		Now thanks to the increasing number of `` little '' theatres and their demand for short plays , the one-act piece is gaining in dignity and worth .

		It remains , however , for some Amer - ican playwright , or genius , to produce the play , long or short , so true to American life that it will retain its interest for us unim - paired through more than two or three or even half a dozen seasons .

		This desideratum is pointed out by Professor
Baker	PERSON	.

		But , after all , is the great American drama any more likely to be forthcoming , any more possible , in fact , than the long-awaited great American novel ?

		ANCIENT BABYLONIAN PARCEL-POST SERVICE , if there really ever was such a service , as recent excavations tend to prove , will serve as an added illustration of the truth that there is nothing new under the sun .

		Dr.
Stephen H. Langdon	PERSON	, curator of the
University of Penn	ORGANIZATION	- sylvania Museum of Arts and Sciences , Baby - lonian section , and also the world 's leading Sumerian scholar , is busy deciphering the museum 's collection of clay tablets unearthed at Nippur under the university 's auspices in a series of excavations that began as long ago as
1889	DATE	under the leadership of Dr.
John P	PERSON	,
Peters	PERSON	, and are still continuing .

		Nippur 's possession of a great public library , all in baked clay , has by this time become a matter of common knowledge .

		That this institution sent out by parcel post what might be called travelling libraries , or possibly inter-library loans of books , is probably less widely known .

		Dr.
Langdon	PERSON	, it appears , has deciphered cer - tain clay tablets indicating the existence not only of a circulating library at Nippur , but also of a parcel-post system such as we in this twentieth century have lately succeeded in establishing .

		Two tags have been found with inscriptions proving that they were at - tached to a basket of books -LRB- in clay-tablet form -RRB- sent from the Nippur library to Shu - ruppek , sixty miles distant , where , by the way ,
Noah	PERSON	lived and built the Ark , as local tradition avers .

		Whether this reading matter went to some book hungry individual in Shu - ruppek , or was set up in the town hall or village schoolhouse as a travelling library for the entertainment and instruction of all and sundry , has not yet transpired .

		Let us hope it was designed for the greatest good of the greatest number .

		296 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	ADOLESCENT AUTHORS exhibit one almost invariable and inevitable prime defect : they have little or nothing to say that is worth the saying .

		Last
summer	DATE	one of our popular magazines invited college girls to submit short stories for publication , offering
$ 150	MONEY	for each manuscript accepted , and bonuses of
$ 100	MONEY	,
$ 75	MONEY	, and
$ 50	MONEY	for the three best stories .

		More than eight hundred compositions from nearly as many pens poured into the editorial office as a result of this generous offer , and the judges have been hard at work trying to sift out the wheat from the chaff ; but , alas , it was found to be all chaff , not a single story showed enough experience of life and originality of treatment to deserve publication , and the fond hope of discovering even one embryonic genius was disappointed .

		Command of English and graces of rhetoric were not lacking in this mass of written matter , but the one indis - pensable quality insight , creative ability , interpretation of life , or whatever its name was conspicuously absent .

		Nor is this to be wondered at ; the real wonder is that such an offer should ever have been seriously made to so immature a body of would-be writers .

		As ``
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	lamented long ago , those who have a ready flow of language too often have nothing of value to say , while those who have experiences most worthy of publication com - monly shrink from making them known .

		IN SUPPORT OF THE NEW THEATRE , the play - house not controlled by a syndicate , not form - ing one of a string of theatres managed by a well-nourished financier with a love of art inversely proportional to his regard for box - office receipts , a quarterly publication called `` Theatre Arts Magazine '' has been started by a few nobly courageous persons , with head - quarters at
Detroit	LOCATION	.

		In fact , it is `` under the auspices of the
Theatre Committee of the Society	ORGANIZATION	of Arts and Crafts , '' of
Detroit	LOCATION	, that the magazine makes its appearance .

		Mr.
Sheldon Cheney	PERSON	is editor , with an able staff of contributing editors including Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	, Mr.
Walter Prichard Eaton	PERSON	, Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	,
Miss Euth St. Denis	ORGANIZATION	, and others to the number of eleven in all .

		Inter - esting articles and theatrical notes , with illus - trations of recent achievements in theatre architecture and equipment and decoration , fill the first number .

		The magazine , as editor - ially announced , `` is designed for the artist who approaches the theatre in the spirit of the arts and crafts movement , and for the theatre - goer who is awake artistically and intellect - ually . ''

		Further , it is intended `` to help conserve and develop creative impulse in the American theatre ; to provide a permanent record of American dramatic art in its for - mative period ; to hasten the day when the speculators will step out of the established playhouse and let the artists come in . ''

		Finally , it is determined `` not to be swallowed by the movies . ''

		All communications should be addressed to the Editor , Arts and Crafts Theatre , 25 `` Watson Street ,
Detroit	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	.

		THE FREE MAILING LIST has to answer for a yearly waste of tons of printed matter ; and as this class of mail is handled by the government at a loss , the free list entails a large annual expenditure of public money , with no corresponding public benefit .

		Even the humblest private person of any standing at all in his community receives every day enough undesired printed paper to kindle his kitchen fire the next morning ; and that is about all the good it accomplishes .

		And yet some persons have a passion for getting them - selves enrolled on the free mailing list .

		The current `` Bulletin '' of the
Russell Sage Foundation Library	ORGANIZATION	has this to say : `` A free mailing list is of doubtful value because of the large number of people who will take advantage of such a list whether or not the publication received will be of any use to the recipient .

		The
Russell Sage Foundation Library	ORGANIZATION	is desirous of building up a mailing list of individuals and institutions interested in its bibliographies on social subjects .

		Such a list is hard to make and is of corresponding value when made .

		Believing that a nominal charge to cover the cost of printing would eliminate at least those names representing persons having no interest in the publications of the library , revision of the mailing list was made in
January , 1916	DATE	, and a charge of
25 cents	MONEY	made for a year 's subscription . ''

		The new plan brought about the elimination of half the names , with benefit to all concerned .


HORACE HART	PERSON	, PRINTER AND BIBLIOPHILE , head of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	from
1883	DATE	to his recent death , and author of two notable books that grew out of his lifelong experience as printer , was one of those who ought to have written their memoirs but have chosen instead to make occasional oral offer - ings from their rich stores of personal reminiscence and to let the greater part perish with them .

		He worked his way up from ap - prenticeship to a position second to none in his calling .

		Many stories , the best of them true , are current concerning the extraordinary pains he took to have the
Oxford Bibles	ORGANIZATION	, as well as other works , typographically perfect .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 297 Large rewards were offered for the detection of misprints , but they were seldom earned , such was the vigilance exercised by his printers .

		His `` Kules for Compositors and Readers '' and `` A Century of Typography '' are authoritative and highly esteemed con - tributions to the literature of printing .

		`` The Periodical , '' issued by the press so long under his management , says of him , in a short re - view of his life and work : `` He had lived long : he could tell stories of his own early volunteering when the
City	LOCATION	apprentices were drilling to resist the aggression of
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	, and in his last month at the Press he , in the first week of the war , sent out sixty men in khaki whose training he had fur - thered during the years that followed the Boer War .

		He made upon every one he met the impression of a man devoted indeed to his business , but able to interest himself and pass shrewd judgment upon other affairs ... '' Mr.
Hart	PERSON	seems to have held among English printers much the same position as the late Theodore De
Vinne	PERSON	among American printers .

		To both printing was a fine art , both wrote of it as such , and both did much in practical ways to make it such .

		THE PROS AND CONS OF PAPER COVERS have been argued to the point of weariness ; never - theless there is not yet any general agreement as to where the undress of paper should cease and the stiff formality of a more rigid and durable binding begin .

		From time immemo - rial the continental countries of
Europe	LOCATION	have contented themselves with paper covers as at least a preliminary exterior for most of their current literature , the individual buyer being left to suit his own taste -LRB- and purse -RRB- in the matter of permanent binding .

		In
England	LOCATION	now there is at least the beginning of a ten - dency toward the paper cover .

		Mr.
Heine	PERSON	- mann declares his intention to issue his
1917	DATE	books in paper editions as well as in cloth , except that library novels and gift books are to appear only in the more durable form , for obvious reasons .

		Yet even library books of all kinds might be left to the libraries to bind , and indeed some libraries prefer to pro- vide their own bindings rather than trust to the often inadequate provision in this par - ticular made by the publisher .

		It is by no means unlikely that , as soon as our public had become used to the paper cover , as European countries have become used to it , book-sales would increase , by reason of the considerable reduction in price at which the books could be offered , even though nothing like the surprisingly low prices of European -LRB- continental -RRB- books might be possible .

		De - pendence upon public libraries for standard and serious works of the day would diminish , and the new novel of unquestioned worth , offered in paper at a temptingly low price -LRB- recall , for instance , the enormous sales of `` Robert Elsmere '' at
fifty cents	MONEY	, twenty-eight years ago -RRB- , would attain a wider circulation than under the present system .

		After all , why should a book-buyer be almost invariably obliged to invest so large a proportion of his money in mere cloth or leather ?

		EXEMPLARY LIBRARY ECONOMY arrests the attention in glancing over the record of things , done in the past year at the
Bancroft Memorial Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Hopedale	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		But could anything except the exemplary be ex - pected from a town bearing the name of Hope - dale ?

		It suggests comparison with Gold - smith 's `` sweet Auburn '' `` loveliest village of the plain , where health and plenty cheered the labouring swain . ''

		And it brings up memories of
Adin Ballou	PERSON	, rather amusingly esteemed by
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	as
America	LOCATION	's greatest writer .

		Appropriately enough , too , the Hope - dale library is especially rich in books and pamphlets and other relics and memorials of this
New England	LOCATION	sage .

		But to return to our muttons : the yearly financial statement of the institution shows an equipoise of re - ceipts and expenditures such as will not be found , it is safe to say , in an examination of a thousand library reports throughout the country .

		Money received from all sources amounted to
$ 3,533.78	MONEY	; money spent for all purposes amounted to
$ 3,533.78	MONEY	.

		There is no balance left over , nor indeed does there appear to be any balance brought forward from last year .

		Is it possible that the
Hopedale	LOCATION	library officials are able every year to trim their sails so as to sail thus close to the wind ?

		An annual deficit is not a bad thing as a spur to increased appropriations ; but , on the other hand , `` out of debt , out of danger . ''

		THE OMNISCIENT BOOKSELLER must in these days of almost infinitely ramified research carry a much heavier load of learning than in the comparatively primitive times of Ed - ward Cave and
Robert Dodsley	PERSON	and
Andrew Millar	PERSON	.

		Consequently a very small propor - tion of booksellers can now claim that so - called omniscience in the domain of literature which formerly it was no extraordinarily difficult thing to acquire .

		What the mental equipment of a modern vender of literature ought to be , in an ideal condition of bib - liopoly , is made clear by a set of examination 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	papers prepared by the head of the booksel - lers ' school now doing such notably good work in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Here , for example , are some of the questions in the paper on reference work : `` What and where is the Lion of
Lucerne	LOCATION	?

		Who was the original of Rebecca in
Ivanhoe	LOCATION	?

		What is a
Mace	ORGANIZATION	and why is it on our new ten-cent coins ?

		What were Scylla and Charybdis ?

		Who was the original of
Mona Lisa ?	PERSON

		How many children had Shake - speare ?

		Why is
England	LOCATION	called
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	and the
U. S. Uncle Sam ?	PERSON

		What is the con - nection between the god Pan and the word panic ?

		What is meant by pin money ?

		Who wrote the Laocoon ?

		What was the real name of the inventor of printing ?

		Place Lochinvar in literature . ''

		One may be tempted to ask what most of these questions have to do with the everyday business of bookselling ; but it is making itself clear that the pupils taking the courses prescribed by
Miss Graham	PERSON	, who con - ducts the school , are increasing their sales at the book-counter .

		Two of these pupils , em - ployed as `` extras '' in a local bookshop for the Christmas season , outsold two regular clerks in the same department who had been with the firm six years .

		Apparently the bookseller can not , for the good of his business , know too much about books and everything thereto appertaining .

LESLIE N. JENNINGS	PERSON	.

		Rutherford , Col. ,
March 15 , 1917	DATE	.

		MR. POWYS AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Upon one of the few occasions in recent years when
John Burroughs	PERSON	has been induced to give a public lecture , it was my pleasure to present him to his audience with introductory `` remarks . ''

		After the lecture he said : `` I liked your talk about me because you did not slobber me all over with praise . ''

		The incident was recalled to mind while I was reading , in a recent number of THE DIAL , the article in which Mr.
Bragdon	PERSON	slobbered the renowned Mr.
Powys	PERSON	with praise .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	surely has one faithful disciple , converted and sub - dued to his own qualities by `` the devouring flame of his eloquence . ''

		Mr.
Bragdon	PERSON	did not need to tell us that he `` loves the man and adores the artist , '' for his own incontinence is too like his master 's to be mistaken as to its source .

		It was my official duty , a few years ago , to attend Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's lectures for the purpose of reporting on their character and influence to the trustees of the institution for which he was lec - turing .

		I found a clever , literary vaudeville performer , entertaining a gaping and tittering audience with irreverent balderdash and `` stunts '' of every conceivable sort bodily contortions , rushings up and down the stage with a bedraggled academic gown flying from his shoulders like a black pirate flag , violences of speech , slang and shady stories , startling paradoxes , and sensational thrills .

		The main object of the performance appeared to be to produce laughter , which he accomplished about every five minutes .

		Instruc - tion , or interpretation of literature , was entirely subordinated to entertainment .

		A lecture on
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, in which the poet 's weaknesses were paraded in a limelight of hilarious jest and ridi - cule to the exclusion of his poetry , was the worst exhibition of bad taste and vulgar impudence I have ever witnessed on the lecture platform .

		To anyone who really loves the poets and poetry it was a sacrilege .

		Manifestly such literary char - latanry could be regarded only as a menace to the literary culture of popular audiences , since it would degrade the taste to a point where the lectures of a legitimate and instructive lecturer would not be appreciated or attended .

		I purposely use the past tense in speaking of Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's lectures , for conceivably he may have changed his spots as a lecturer in five years .

		But his `` brilliant book of essays , '' which Mr.
Bragdon	PERSON	commends as something exceptionally `` fine and rare , '' reveals no essential change of method .

		In
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 299 `` Suspended Judgments '' the essayist is still the vaudeville lecturer , minus the physical contortions .

		There is the same cacophonous and chaotic style of expression ; the same incoherent and irrelevant chatter , punctuated with paradoxes and inflated egoisms ; the same `` large free ravishment '' of the great minds of the ages , as Mr.
Bragdon	PERSON	calls it , which tears genius to tatters and serves it up to the reader in shreds and patches , resplendent in barbaric colors ; the same dashing and splashing literary criticism , producing that `` authentic thrill of genius '' which has so prickled the cuticle of Mr.
Bragdon	PERSON	's literary taste .

		It is worth while to quote a few of the `` Delphic utterances '' of these essays , embodied in Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's `` most golden prose . ''

		For example , `` All literature is created out of the vices of men of letters . ''

		One of his chief admirations is
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, whom he classifies with
Shelley , Poe	PERSON	, and
Verlaine	PERSON	as `` these great poets , '' and he thinks it a `` tremendous triumph , '' the manner in which this `` modern Antinous has taken captive our imagina - tion .

		His influence is everywhere , like an odor , like an atmosphere , like a diffused flame . ''

		`` To have seen Oscar Wilde and talked with him gives to such persons a strange significance , an almost religious value . ''

		Another of his admirations is
Voltaire	LOCATION	, whose very name is `` a call to sanity and sweetness and clarity and noble commonsense . ''

		Moreover ,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	symbolizes the beautiful ideal of enfranchised humanity for which Mr.
Powys	PERSON	yearns .

		`` He is the prophet of the age to come , when the execrable superstitions of narrow minds shall no longer darken the sunlight , and the in - famous compulsion of human manners , human in - tellects , human tastes , into the petty mold of oppressive public opinion shall be ended forever . ''

		Indeed , throughout these essays , it is painful to observe the suffering of Mr.
Powys	PERSON	under the `` compulsion of human manners . ''

		He loves Vol - taire 's `` Candide , '' even though it is `` outrageously indecent . ''

		And `` Why not ? ''

		he cries .

		`` Who put fig leaves upon the sweet flesh of the immortals ?

		Decency after all is a mere modern barbarism ; the evocation of morbid vulgarity and a perverted heart . ''

		Naturally Mr.
Powys	PERSON	has a feeling of kinship for
Byron	PERSON	, for his `` sweet devilry of reckless youth . ''

		Of course
Byron	PERSON	is a brute , as he admits , but `` not to relish the gay brutality of
Byron	PERSON	is an indication of something degenerate in our - selves . ''

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	loves freedom and hates re - straint .

		He groans under the `` dead weight of cultivated opinion . ''

		He abhors the necessity of being respectable ; his soul yearns for the happy liberty of the hairy savage and the dancing satyrs .

		The beast in literature he is always taking to his bosom with a brotherly hug .

		The true sources of literature and art he finds in the primordial in - stincts , subject only to the restraints of the pro- toplasmic conscience .

		Literature must get back to first principles , must get free from the `` puritan - ical censorship which now hangs like a leaden weight round the neck of every writer of original power . ''

		As a writer himself of original power , it is pitiful to think how he must suffer as he drags this weight about with him .

		`` Our humor , '' he says , `` is content to remain vulgar , stopping short so timorously of stripping the world to the smock . ''

		Here we have the bottom principle of art : stark nakedness is what we must have in literature , humanity stripped to the smock and exhibited in lectures , essays , and novels .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's application of this principle to fiction is illuminating : `` I love it when a novel is thick with the solid mass of earth-life , and when its passions
spring	DATE	up volcano-like from flaming pits and bleeding craters of torn and convulsed materials . ''

		The `` Three Devils of Bloody Gulch '' would seem to be about Mr.
Powys	PERSON	's ideal of a classic novel .

		Mr.
Powys	PERSON	has two choice detestations and one dangerous obsession .

		He detests puritanism , the `` thrice accursed '' and `` the most odious and in - human of all the perverted superstitions that have darkened man 's history , '' which has imposed upon literature the restraints of a `` degraded mob-ridden conscience . ''

		This terrible spectre is forever dog - ging his literary footsteps , so persistently persecut - ing him as to suggest the possibility that he has bartered his conscience for an emancipated intel - ligence , and does not find the trade entirely satis - factory .

		Certainly puritanism is his particular black beast , from which he seems never to be able to escape .

		He detests middle-class humanity , the `` mob - stupidity and middle class philistinism . ''

		The smell of `` the common herd '' is offensive to his delicate nostrils , and he never tires of railing at this enemy of his superior soul .

		Such rank in - gratitude in Mr.
Powys	PERSON	is shocking , since it is this very class that supports his lectures and reads his books .

		But all is not hate with Mr.
Powys	PERSON	.

		One thing he .

		loves , with a passionate , philosophic , unintennittent love .

		He loves woman , or more properly , the feminine principle in nature .

		Sex is his obsession , or as Mr.
Bragdon	PERSON	calls it , `` the great ground rhythm of all his various music . ''

		His mind is saturated with sex ; it is as impossible for him to keep Priapus and Aphrodite out of his essays as it was for Dr.
Dick	PERSON	to keep King
George	PERSON	out of his Memorial .

		He longs for the `` easy magnanimity '' of De Maupassant , in regard to sex matters .

		He admires the `` beautiful ruffian - ism of
Byron	PERSON	, full of normal sex instincts . ''

		He comprehends , as no other critic ever has , the `` inspiration '' of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	and
Emily Bronte	PERSON	, drawn `` straight from the uttermost spiritual depths of the sex instincts . ''

		Indeed , Mr.
Powys	PERSON	may be fairly regarded as already the prophet of a new literary cult the cult of the angelic sex instinct .

		In one of his moments of `` debouching '' comment , Mr.
Powys	PERSON	remarks in regard to charlatanism : `` I am almost scared to look up the word in the dictionary for fear of discovering that I am my - self no better than that opprobrious thing . ''

		In his `` Suspended Judgments , '' as in his lectures , he has furnished ample justification for that fear , which is certain to be shared by many of his readers .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	has given his view of the tech - nique and use of free verse in a recent number of THE DIAL .

		He proposes it as a reenforce - ment of the short-story , which he calls `` Amer - ica 's best contribution to the general body of art , '' and which , he laments , has degenerated into `` a hollow sapless affair , '' `` a spectre of incipient decay , '' `` punk . ''

		The reason for this degeneration Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	finds in the sub - jection of the short-story to a trivial formula , the application of which is fatally easy to learn .

		It has often been pointed out that prose literature suffers in comparison with the other fine arts with music , painting , poetry from the lack of a technique which requires formal initiation and mastery on the part of the aspirant .

		Anybody , so far as the public knows , can write prose , and , given the stereo - typed formula of description , characteriza - tion , `` punch , '' and climax -LRB- to quote Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's analysis -RRB- , anybody can turn out that staple article , the short-story of commerce .

		Indeed , the application of the formula is taught in all modern universities , correspon - dence schools , high schools , and night schools , and in such business colleges as have depart - ments of literature .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	would save the short-story by giving it a new medium and manner ; he would make it once more a form of artistic endeavor by endowing it with style .

		In the first place , it is permitted to question whether free verse will supply the short-story with that technical barrier which is necessary to keep out the interloper .

		The difficulty with prose literature is not that the art of prose is easy , but that it appears so ; and that in consequence the public will never take the trouble to distinguish between good and bad .

		No one , at least in
America	LOCATION	, knows this better than Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	, for no one has written finer prose than he , no one has measured more truly the difficulties and triumphs of the art , or has seen more clearly how little these things affect the enjoyment and appreciation of the reading public .

		Certainly , he would not main - tain that free verse is more of a fine art than prose , only that , in borrowing part of the technique of poetry , it is more obviously a fine art .

		Indeed , one suspects him of offering his present fiction in a spirit of mild cynicism to a public that plays the swine to his `` With the Procession , '' and `` The
Chevalier	PERSON	of Pen - sieri-Vani . ''

		He certainly writes free verse with his tongue in his cheek when he plumes himself , No scansion whatsoever there ; or when he chides himself , A bit ' / too much ' / like blank ' / verse here ' / abouts ' He seems to toy dangerously with the secret .

		One is afraid that at any moment he may let it out and that , supposing the public should be brought by Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's example to insist that short-stories be written in Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's form , the universities , correspondence schools , high schools , night schools , and business col - leges would teach it along with the rest of the art of the short-story and that this youngest daughter of literature would continue to walk the streets , unsheltered and unprotected , the object of promiscuous solicitation into com - mercial bondage by the cadets of literature who sally forth from the aforenamed resorts .

		It is to be said , however , that in the present volume Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	has set the short-story before us soberly and decently clad , and with - out any of the stereotyped antics and attitudes of the wanton .

		He has given us characters and local types much as Mr.
Edgar Lee Masters	PERSON	has done in `` The Spoon River Anthology , '' but instead of restricting himself to the brief monologue or epitaph , he has allowed himself the license of the writer of fiction in descrip - tion , narrative , and author 's comment .

		The story of each character is told extensively , but compactly a life summary of each .

		Most of his subjects round out their careers by the grave , with the immortal exception in `` The Death of Aunt Juliana '' And when she died ?

		you ask ?

		Died ?

		Died nothing !

		She 's living yet .

		All -LRB- at least , I have no exception in mind -RRB- lead the dull lives of the American bour - geoisie , without heroism in their loyalty see Benjamin C. Hill who lived by and died for
The Merchants National Tax-Title	ORGANIZATION	and

John M. Hart	PERSON	, who thrice married and thrice en - dured wakeful nights , Perambulators on the porch , More little tempers , More unfolding minds , Bills ; without imagination in their triumphs see
Melvina Woode-Shedd	PERSON	, who reaches the pin - nacle of social glory when After a while a great big yellow hall Put a new row of boxes at the back : Our own , own op ` ra in full bloom at last !

		Enough has been quoted to show that Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	is not in complete sympathy with the ideals of well-being and well-doing which make American life , to the rest of us , so simple , healthy , and honest .

		His titles sometimes sug - gest an unfavorable attitude `` Aridity , '' `` Rigmarole , '' `` Postponement '' or his com - ment : Well , do you ask an end ?

		Must every life have that ?

		Consider the existences so many Eueful and frustrate .

		But in a subtler way his form is a reflection of his philosophy .

		There used to be a question between
Henry James	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	as to whether art could compete with life or must forever lag behind it , in a race for the consolation prize .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	would accept neither creed he would make art run in double harness with life , keeping its pace foot to foot .

		This artistic philosophy is possibly behind Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's practice of free verse .

		To quote again from the article already referred to : `` First and foremost the writer must feel ... his theme .

		He must sense it , if but unconsciously ... as a matter of flow and cadence . ''

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's theme is life , and he senses it as slow .

		His art , indeed , con - stantly is tempted to outrun its team-mate , in those `` lines of iambics , dactyls , and other recognized measures of the older prosody , '' at which `` the thorough-going verslibrist looks askant '' and has to be slowed down by `` the more subtle rhythms and cadences of prose . ''

		There is a sustained passage in `` Victory '' in which the masterful heroine beats up the rhythm into long lines of rampant anapaests only to be checked by relentless prose and the abrupt short line , which bring us again abreast of life and into step with its move - ment .

		There is a recurrent irony in the way in which Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	's art , which becomes almost blank verse , aspiring and swift , is hob - bled into conformity with its pedestrian com - panion , life , which sets the theme and the pace .

		And yet truth to life may be false to Life .


ROBERT M. LOVETT	PERSON	.

		LABELLING THE HISTORIANS .

		THE MIDDLE GROUP OP AMERICAN HISTORIANS .

		By
John Spencer Bassett	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		By the middle group of American histo - rians , we are to understand those whose work was done within the period from `` let us say about
1826	DATE	, when
Sparks	PERSON	began to give himself to history , '' to a certain not precisely deter - mined date -LRB- sometime after the Civil `` War it was -RRB- when `` the scientific spirit secures dom - ination over the patriotic school that had ruled for several decades . ''

		Professor
Bassett	PERSON	does not bring into the story all who wrote history during this period , but has preferred to deal rather fully with the most eminent men , let - ting them serve as representative of the group as a whole .

		Therefore , apart from a pre - liminary chapter on historical writing in colonial and revolutionary times , in which one regrets to note that
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	is not men - tioned , the volume takes the form of four biographical essays three rather long ones devoted to
Sparks	LOCATION	,
Bancroft	LOCATION	, and
Peter Force	PERSON	, and one rather short one devoted to the `` two literary historians , ''
Prescott	PERSON	and
Motley	ORGANIZATION	.

		A distinguishing characteristic of the work is that it has to do with historians rather than with history : the author is far more interested in the men themselves and in their activities than he is in the books they wrote .

		Of the seventy-three pages given to
Bancroft	LOCATION	, a very few would include all that could be called an analysis or a criticism of his history .

		Prescott and
Motley	ORGANIZATION	, whose lives were relatively un - eventful , who at least did little for history except to write histories , are dispatched in short space ; whereas the chapter devoted to
Peter Force	ORGANIZATION	falls only three pages short of being the longest in the book .

		And , on the whole , I should say the chapter on
Peter Force	ORGANIZATION	is the best one of all , and next to that , the one on
Sparks	LOCATION	; the reason being that these men were primarily collectors of documents , and their work appeals to Professor
Bassett	PERSON	-LRB- who has no high opinion of the literary or patriotic histories -RRB- as having a higher value than the works of such men as
Bancroft	LOCATION	and
Motley	ORGANIZATION	, as being , in fact , a kind of `` permanent con - tribution to knowledge , '' such as `` The Rise of the Dutch Republic '' can lay no claim to be - ing .

		Professor
Bassett	PERSON	is therefore at his best and his best is very good in relating , for example , the efforts of Sparks to obtain pos - session of the
Washington	LOCATION	letters , or in tracing out for us the somewhat intricate history of the enterprise which resulted in the publica - tion of the `` American Archives . ''

		The book is itself a piece of careful research rather than a contribution to historical criticism or the 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	history of ideas ; and taken for what it is , it will be found , by professional historians at least , and one would think by a rather wide reading public as well , a very useful book and an extremely interesting one .

		If Professor
Bassett	PERSON	had been primarily interested in criticism or the history of ideas , his selection of eminent men would necessarily have been different .

		It would be difficult to find a principle of classification which would include under one category men so different as
Prescott	PERSON	and
Peter Force	ORGANIZATION	.

		Prescott might be described as a literary , but hardly as a patriotic , historian , since he was not con - cerned with the history of his own country ; but
Peter Force	PERSON	, certainly not literary and scarcely a historian , does not easily come under either category .

		Bancroft , of course , is the one representative who meets both require - ments : he was both literary and patriotic .

		Professor
Bassett	PERSON	does not indeed stress these principles of classification , his middle group being mainly a chronological affair .

		But at least the implication is that the middle group may be more or less conveniently labelled with either one or both of these tags , and that the middle period , in this sense , closes when `` the scientific spirit secures domination over the patriotic school that had ruled for several decades . ''

		Perhaps it is this latter distinction which enables the author to dispense with any special attention to criticism , since it is clearly a distinction which reduces the business of estimating earlier writers to relatively small proportions .

		The scientific method and its accompanying attitude of detachment having been at last discovered and applied , criticism becomes mainly a question of how far , and in what respects , any historian of the old school , whether literary or patriotic , falls short of measuring up to the modern ideal .

		With these simple fundamentals in hand ,
Bancroft	LOCATION	, for example , can be readily dis - missed by saying that , while he was an in - dustrious student of the sources and is gen - erally accurate so far as the facts go , he too often sacrificed exact statement to literary effect , and , on account of his militant patriot - ism and enthusiasm for democracy , inter - preted the facts in a glaringly prejudiced way .

		When this is said , what else is there to say ?

		Nothing really , except that
Bancroft	PERSON	is now read only for his style .

		Style , even in historical writing , is some - thing for which modern scientific historians profess admiration .

		To possess literary excel - lence is certainly a merit ; and while it would be `` retrogressing , '' as Professor
Bassett	PERSON	says , to go back to the literary school in other respects , it would be a good thing if we `` could bring forward their best qualities into our own group of scholarly and conscientious workers . ''

		Excellent in general and in the abstract , in particular cases style seems never - theless to impress Professor
Bassett	PERSON	as some - thing likely to cover hidden sins .

		`` Men who write with the hastening fingers of imagina - tion , '' he says , `` sometimes drop into obscurity details which more literally minded persons would consider very important , or they use expressions meaning more or less than they intend them to mean . ''

		In theory Professor
Bassett	PERSON	is far from maintaining any irrecon - cilable antithesis between the scientific and the literary genres , but in practice his scientific conscience makes it difficult for him to admit a literary historian to all the privileges of the modern guild .

		Thus it happens that Park - man , on account of his excellent writing , barely escapes being put with the middle group . ''

		While he wrote with that full appre - ciation of style which was characteristic of
Bancroft	PERSON	and the literary historians , his in - dustry , his research among documents , and especially his detachment seem to place him among the men of to-day . ''

		If
Parkman	PERSON	had only written badly , no one could question his scientific standing .

		All these conventional labels , having little to do with ideas or the quality of a man 's work , seem to me quite useless for purposes of historical criticism .

		To say of any his - torian , ancient or modern , that he is scientific , or literary , or patriotic , tells me little that I care to know ; and , particularly , to regard the term `` scientific '' as an adequate characteriza - tion of any group of historians is but to dis - pense with distinctions , and with that discrim - ination which is essential to genuine criticism .

		Many accurate , unprejudiced , and dull his - tories were written before the Civil War .


H. A. L. Fisher	PERSON	writes better than
Bancroft	PERSON	, and so do
George Otto	PERSON	and
George Macaulay Trevelyan	PERSON	; and I should think them all scientific , although I speak with some misgiv - ing , not knowing very well what is meant by scientific .

		Meanwhile , if I understand what others mean by the term ,
Germany	LOCATION	is full of scientific historians all patriotic , a few , perhaps , literary .

		The inadequacy of such conventional labels for purposes of criticism is nowhere better illustrated than in the case of
Bancroft	LOCATION	, who has suffered rather more than he has gained in the process .

		What one should say about
Bancroft	PERSON	seems well understood among pres - ent-day professional historians .

		It is that his history is interesting to read , but unsafe to follow ; he was a literary , but a prejudiced , historian .

		The case is one which calls for a
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 303 little , not after all so very subtle , discrimina - tion .

		If `` style '' is anything more than a kind of metaphorical embroidery covering literal and commonplace statement of fact , it should be clear that the chief merit of
Bancroft	LOCATION	is not his style but his scholarship , that careful investigation and exceptional accuracy which make his book , in the original editions , still a useful one for the student at least for the student of the Revolution .

		On the other hand , his chief defect is not his bias .


Gibbon	PERSON	had bias , and so had
Henry Adams	PERSON	, although his was not a patriotic bias .

		Next to his scholar - ship , the thing most worth noting about Ban - croft is his lack of ideas , the lack at all events of any but the most rudimentary discrimina - tion in the handling of such ideas as came to him .

		And it is for this reason precisely , be - cause he has no ideas , that his patriotism is so obtrusive and so irritating , - and it is for this reason precisely that his style , since he was bound to have a style , is extremely bad .

		I very much question if any one reads Ban - croft for his style .

		His style is highly artifi - cial , mechanical , sophomoric the style of a man with information and a vocabulary who says to himself : `` I must do these facts in a literary way for literary people ; I must make a composition . ''

		Bancroft made a composi - tion , a long one , in which he seems always struggling consciously , not indeed always suc - cessfully , to maintain a certain elevation , and to be always going on with the measured rhythm suited to the majestic march of his - tory .

		But having few ideas to work upon , and no real imagination , he impresses one with the hollowness of mere verbal eloquence .

		An excellent example of this verbal elo - quence resulting from absence of imagina - tion and ideas is the description of
King James	LOCATION	, in volume one , page 293 .

		-LRB- 3d .

		1846 -RRB- By changing or transposing perhaps a dozen words , the paragraph readily falls into the following lines .

		Dissimulation is the vice of those Who have not judgment or true courage .

		King
James	PERSON	, from imbecility , was false , And sometimes did his falseness vindicate As though deception had been worthy of a king .

		He was an awkward liar , rather than crafty In dissembling .

		He could , before the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, Call God to witness his sincerity , the while He was resolved to be wholly insincere .

		He feigned , such cowardice was his , A fondness for that
Robert Carr	PERSON	, Whose arrest , for murder , he had secretly decreed .

		He was afrighted of his wife , could be governed By being overawed , or with ease intimidated By the vulgar insolence of
Buckingham	LOCATION	.

		In
Scotland	LOCATION	, he solemnly declared attachment To Puritan practice and belief ; but 't was for fear Of open resistance .

		The pusillanimous man Assents from cowardice , and recovers boldness With the assurance of impunity .

		It is true , this is not good verse .

		But neither is the original good prose .

		And it is not because the author , `` with the hastening fingers of imagination , '' says more or less than he means .

		It is because no imagination is present , and no meaning at least none worth mentioning .

		A STRONGHOLD OF OBSCURANTISM .

		PROBLEMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION .

		By
David Snedden	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	:-RRB- Make vivid before your imagination the in - terests and impulses of American middle-class boys and girls between the ages of fourteen and eighteen , the quality of their lives , the loose disorganization of their social environ - ment .

		Picture to yourself their flirtations , their little snobberies , their queer , jumbled impressions of life , the craving in the best of them for expression , the craving in most of them to be understood , the craving in all of them for activity .

		Think of their preoccupa - tion with sex and with `` a good time . ''

		Think of the thoughtless and feverish business and domestic life into which they are shortly to be swept .

		Think of the popular magazine and the popular song and the `` movies '' and the religious meeting which form the cultural orientation of their lives .

		Think of the vague sentimentality and cheapness in which they must necessarily be bathed in our flauntingly ugly American towns .

		Think of the insistent ideal of success which our society holds before them , and which divides them into the ambi - tious and the listless .

		But think also of the faint stirrings of idealism that come to them and the restlessness for understandings and adventures which dogs the elect among them .

		When you have thought of all this , look in at that American institution which pretends to `` train , '' to `` educate '' these pre-adolescent and adolescent boys and girls .

		Ask yourself what the public high school does to connect with these interests and impulses .

		Ask your - self what the school does to bring all these nascent impulses to fruition , to counteract the evils of cheapness , to bring to focus these im - mature ideals .

		How does the school adjust itself to the work of making the crooked straight and the rough places plain ?

		Recall that in the majority of high schools the subject - matter of education still consists of algebra and geometry ; Latin , French , and German grammar , with stilted exercises in writing the language and a few innocuous and unre - lated classics thrown in ; an assorted collec - tion of some of the canonized masterpieces of English literature , chosen without the least 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	reference to adolescent interests and tastes ; a little ancient history , taught as a succession of incidents and dates ; and some epitomized and formalized science , accompanied by a few half-hearted laboratory experiments .

		Con - sider that `` physical education '' consists of two or three hours a week of formal exercise in a dusty gymnasium , and that the rough athletics of the field are reserved for the healthiest boys and the brawniest girls .

		And lastly , remember that dramatic or artistic ex - pression is of the most impoverished kind occasional amateur theatricals , a club concert , a school bazaar .

		Consider how the school , knowing the youthful life it must stimulate and train , actually goes about doing it .

		Ask yourself what single one of all the high school 's activities and interests really has meaning for the majority of the children who are in it .

		Was there ever a more farcical adaptation to youthful life ?

		Schoolmen rarely get the full irony of the secondary-school situation , for they think of children as something to be moulded to the school , rather than the school as something that has to be artfully constructed for the children .

		The elementary school has gone much further in a studied adaptation to the life of its children .

		The secondary school re - mains the last stronghold of educational ob - scurantism .

		And high-school teachers and principals are usually the least concerned of all about this maladjustment .

		They are usually extremely young and timid men and women who have just come from an academic college course .

		Studious themselves , they understand only the studious , and , without any particular philosophy of life or emotional drive , their chief anxiety is to master the technique of routine teaching .

		They soon acquire a curious priestly aroma , an air of spiritual aristocracy in the school system .

		They think of their school as the custodian of `` cultural values '' which the lower schools are discarding .

		Pedagogic discussion in the high school usually takes for granted the founda - tions of faith .

		It concerns itself with methods of teaching the traditional subjects , or of im - provements in administration , just as a priest 's activities might buzz about the repair of the church but never about the presupposi - tions of his dogmas .

		Dr.
Snedden	PERSON	's book should give this com - placency a hard jolt .

		It is true that he by no means senses the irony which I have sug - gested .

		But his criticism is all the more telling because he is so conservatively pro- gressive an educational leader .

		His air of feeling his way ahead and looking back over his shoulder to see whether the crowd is still with him gives him a strategic position .

		Noth - ing could exceed the tact and caution with which he goes over the problems that confront the public high school .

		But his challenge is very clear : Ask yourselves what you are do - ing , examine your aims and purposes .

		There is no educational agency so much under the spell of tradition as the public secondary school .

		Almost all its aims and standards , as well as many of its methods , are purely the product of selection in the past , conserved by adherence to quite artificial psychological standards in more recent years .

		He disposes of the bogy of college entrance examinations , under the tyranny of which the high school has excused its formal , bookish work .

		He suggests that the college itself will materially modify its requirements , and sub - stitute , for the ridiculous mechanistic `` units '' of so much material swallowed , some genuine tests of intellectual ability .

		He urges a two years ' high-school course which shall meet the needs of the many whose education will finish at sixteen , a course which should be rich in English expression , popular science , and social studies , adapted to the curiosity of the student about the world he lives in .

		And always the demand that teachers and principals ask a reason and a genuine social end for everything they are teaching and doing .

		Where Dr.
Snedden	PERSON	is critical , one follows him in hearty agreement .

		He touches , with a gentle pertinence that even high-school teachers should understand , these sterile atti - tudes and outworn notions that must be made over .

		It is only when he becomes dogmatic that one finds fault .

		Dr.
Snedden	PERSON	's convic - tion of the necessity of separating cultural and vocational education will certainly be shared by few educational progressives .

		He thinks , apparently , of `` culture '' as a `` des - sert '' for life , to be indulged in only when heavier toil is over .

		But what democratic education is seeking to discover is how good taste and imaginative appreciation may be worked into the life of all intelligent children .

		The `` dessert '' theory has worked very badly in this country , producing an anxious pseudo - culture and artistic cant which could not fertilize the national soul .

		The roots of original taste must be sunk very deep and very early in the elementary school .

		The high school gets the child too late , and can then only impose upon him the traditional classical tastes of others .

		Consequently our cultural appreciation reeks with hypocrisy .

		The cultural and the vocational must go hand in hand from the earliest years of education .

		You will only be justified in separating them in the secondary school when you have an elementary school that is a real education in taste .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 305 Even more disturbing is Dr.
Snedden	PERSON	's ideal of rigidly specialized vocational educa - tion .

		It certainly is not true in any progres - sive educational circles that `` the industrial school is now being conceived as a strictly vocational school , that its primary and con - trolling purpose is to fit properly selected groups of young people for definite profi - ciency in clearly defined industrial occupa - tions . ''

		This may be true for a very small number of occupations , but for the majority it is an ideal as undesirable as it is impossible .

		The public could not , and should not , afford the kind of vocational education Dr.
Snedden	PERSON	suggests .

		The solution that we are rapidly coming to see is the `` part-time , '' the `` co - operative , '' the `` continuation '' course .

		It is the function of education not so much to prepare for work as to accompany work .

		It is not the duty of the public school to provide miniature factories and workshops except as they contribute to the life of the school com - munity .

		The industry itself must be the arena for the practical work , and the young worker must divide his time between shop or store and school .

		The school can furnish the intellectual background for the work and sup - plement its practicality with theory and inter - pretation .

		Vocations are entirely too numer - ous for the school to provide anything but this supplementary education .

		The training in the specific technique should be a burden on the industry , not on the school .

		Employers have no right to shirk the organization of apprenticeship .

		The school has no right to shirk this accompanying education which shall give meaning and imagination to every calling in life .

		Dr.
Snedden	PERSON	's scheme of a highly organized secondary industrial school , prepar - ing for local industry , and sharply cut off from the `` cultural '' school , is an obsolete idea .

		It has no place in a democratic system .

		For it would mean only the giving of a technical education at public expense to a small , priv - ileged class of skilled labor .

		The majority of `` blind-alley '' boys and girls would be denied the stimulation and assistance which they , above all others , need .

		Dr.
Sneddenj	PERSON	like so many of the respon - sible educators of the day , fails in imagina - tion .

		And this defect is perhaps the most alarming that an educator can have .

		He knows there is something wrong with the secondary school .

		He knows that it needs to become far more self-conscious and purpose - ful .

		But it will take more imagination and daring to get it into that state where it stim - ulates and strengthens for the world we live in , our disintegrated body of modern youth .

		Battle 's magnificently stern array , as pic - tured in such personal narratives as the above - named , loses indeed much of its Byronic magnificence -LRB- if it ever had any -RRB- in the cling - ing mud of
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	, the dreary desolation of
Poland	LOCATION	, the cramped and stifling interior of the submarine , and the ghastly horror and heart-breaking misery piling themselves up on every side ; yet one reads on , chapter after chapter , book after book , thrilled by such examples of fortitude and heroism as have been revealed in no former war and can hardly be surpassed in any future one .

		`` I 've never kept up my interest so long in any - thing as in this war , '' was the rather flippant and even cruelly heartless remark made to the war correspondent , Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	, by a woman sitting beside him at dinner .

		Yet it is true of us all that our interest , our painful interest , in the frightful struggle can not abate until the end , so momentous to all the world are the issues involved .

		Hence the eagerness with which we turn to any new campaign or battle record that may help us to some notion , however mistaken , of the way the conflict is going .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's second volume of intimate experience with things at the western front shows no slackening of journalistic enterprise and energy , of `` push '' and perseverance in securing as nearly as possible a front seat for each successive performance in the great con - tinuous drama .

		Announced to his readers as `` the only accredited American correspondent who had freedom of the field in the battles of the Somme , '' he describes in vivid detail his crossing from
England	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	by `` the aerial ferry , '' the breathless incidents of a spirited and successful attack , under protec - tion of a `` patent curtain of fire , '' against the German trenches , the clumsy and comical but very businesslike behavior of the `` tank '' in action , and divers other novelties in up-to - 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	date military procedure .

		He is deservedly popular as a chronicler of the war from the vantage-ground of an eye-witness .

		In `` Bullets and Billets '' Mr.
Bruce Bairns	PERSON	- father shows himself to be a lively raconteur , a clever hand with the pencil , something of a poet when the temptation to rhyme and metre is too strong for him , the very reverse of a quitter when it comes to dogged persis - tence through the thick and thin of Belgian mud in an endurance contest between en - trenched armies , and through it all a humor - ist expert in the vocabulary of whimsical over-statement and equally whimsical under - statement .

		As a machine-gun officer early sent to the front , he saw service under trying con - ditions , and he knows how to bring those con - ditions rather vividly before the reader 's eye .

		His participation in the spontaneous inter - change of courtesies between embattled foe - men on that notable Christmas day of
1914	DATE	gives material for an unusually interesting chapter .

		His drawings are of the same humorous character as his narrative , though the grim seriousness underlying it all is ap - parent enough .

		The book ends with the writer 's being `` blown up by a shell , '' as he briefly describes the painful event ; hence , we infer , the leisure to write his story .

		Love and war , romance and hard campaign - ing , go to the making of `` The Ordeal by Fire , '' which is offered as the work of `` a sergeant in the French Army . ''

		M.
Marcel Berger	PERSON	, the author , has unmistakably seen service in the defence of his country against the invading host , and the events he makes his `` sergeant '' describe are not lacking in ver - isimilitude .

		From the sudden outbreak of the war , through the anxious days of threaten - ing disaster , to the splendid triumph of the
Marne	ORGANIZATION	, the story is told in the first person with all the characteristic incident and spirited dialogue to be expected from a French writer handling such a theme .

		The heroine ,
Jeannine	PERSON	, plays as important a part , in her way , as the hero ,
Michel	PERSON	, the supposed nar - rator , who ends his tale , after the loss of a leg in battle , with some bitter comment on the war and its makers , and with finding his sweetheart true to him despite a harrowing misunderstanding that had for a time ren - dered the issue doubtful .

		And so all 's well that ends well except that the war still goes on .

		Mr.
Frederic Coleman	PERSON	, who takes pains to declare himself an American , was one of the twenty-five members of the
Royal Automobile Club	ORGANIZATION	who in the first month of the war placed themselves and their motor-cars at the service of Sir John French ; and from that time until the
summer	DATE	of the following year , he seems to have had a succession of more or less ex - citing and perilous experiences , his car being on one occasion badly battered by an explod - ing shell , and other stirring events taking place with sufficient frequency to make things interesting .

		Although he names his book `` From Mpns to
Ypres	LOCATION	with General French , '' he came into contact with many other high officers besides General French ; and two of these , Generals Smith-Dorrien and de
Lisle	LOCATION	, have written him letters of appreciation , which he reproduces in facsimile .

		His nar - rative is packed with incident and is well illustrated .

		Another account of the earlier months of the war comes from the pen of Colonel
J. A. Currie	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, an officer in the gallant
Canad	PERSON	- ian `` Red Watch , '' which performed aston - ishing deeds of valor at a fearful cost and checked the German onrush at a critical moment .

		After the battle of
St. Julien	ORGANIZATION	only 212 out of
1034	DATE	were left to answer the roll - call .

		Colonel
Currie	PERSON	is an enthusiastic Empire man and an ardent advocate of national serv - ice as distinguished from the old-fashioned conscription with its unequal pressure upon the different classes .

		His book is much more than a narrative of battles : its topics cover a wider range and indicate a good deal of inde - pendent observation and reflection .

		The men under his command were certainly a band of heroes , and the story of their heroism stirs the blood .

		The pictorial feature is prominent .

		Mr.
Stanley Washburn	PERSON	, correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' with the Russian armies , having already given us his account of the great Russian retreat that might so easily have ended in a rout , but did not , now tells the story of
General Brussilov	ORGANIZATION	's famous offen - sive movement of
last summer	DATE	, in which ade - quacy of equipment enabled the Russians to make a splendid showing and to retrieve the misfortunes resulting from an earlier lack in this respect .

		A strict censorship has made it impossible for the writer to give names and details and explanations that would have added much to the interest of his narrative .

		But it is full enough for the general reader , and it also has the merit of handling topics not already written to death by dozens of other war-chroniclers .

		Mr.
Washburn	PERSON	is said to have been the only foreign correspondent accompanying the Russian forces throughout the operations described .

		Cool courage worthy of a better cause com - pels our admiration in following the fortunes of the German submarine known as the U-202 , as related by its commander ,
Baron Spiegel	PERSON	von und zu Peckelsheim .

		More than a dozen fine ships were done to death in the operations he describes , with a loss of life that can only
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 307 be conjectured , as the exigencies of the serv - ice do not admit of very strict attention to this detail .

		Nevertheless , the baron shows himself to be a humane man , within limits , and he professes his satisfaction whenever he is able to combine humanity with efficiency .

		An encounter with a steel net , from which extrication was with difficulty effected , adds a thrill to one of these stirring chapters , and there are other hair-breadth escapes in plenty .

		Eeferences to the hated English are some - times unnecessarily vituperative , as was only natural .

		The book is decidedly out of the ordinary , and will arouse even the jaded reader of war narratives .

		Almost equally novel is Mr.
Carroll Dana Winslow	PERSON	's rehearsal of his training and serv - ice as an aviator with the French flying corps .

		Though an American and as such offered certain exemptions and privileges , he preferred to enroll himself with the young Frenchmen just beginning their course in aviation , and he worked up to the honored position of fighting pilot , soon after which he was granted a leave of absence to return to this country , with the prospect of more dangerous service on his resumption of aerial activities .

		In terms easily understood by a layman he conveys much interesting informa - tion on the art and science of aviation in war .

		His pictures , especially those from photo - graphs taken at various heights , form a wel - come accompaniment to the reading matter .

		The final impression left by these several accounts of personal experience in fighting or in watching the fight is one of high-hearted intentness upon the given task and unbounded confidence in ultimate victory for `` our side . ''

		But on one side or the other it must necessa - rily , unless a stalemate is declared , be the victory of the vanquished .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		A JOURNEY OF THE IMAGINATION .

		FRANQOIS VILLON His LIFE AND TIMES .

		By
H. De Vere Stacpoole	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		There are few names in the history of lit - erature over which the shadow lay so long and so persistently as over that of the father of modern French poetry .

		Up to no more dis - tant period than the early part of the year
1877	DATE	, it was not even known what was his real name , nor were the admirers of his genius in possession of any other facts relative to his personal history than could be gleaned by a painful process of inference from his works .

		Then
M. Auguste Longnon	PERSON	discov - ered what we know of the biography of Villon , though , in truth , the facts and dates that he so valiantly and so ingeniously rescued for us from the vast charnel-house of mediaeval his - tory are scanty enough .

		He rendered the poet visible for the first time ; he led the way in delving into the documents of archives to obtain material for a commentary on the liter - ary text ; he first brought proof of the reality of the Villon world .

		All Villonists should render him this tribute .


Marcel Schwob	PERSON	fol - lowed with countless hours of research , and then , in
1901	DATE	,
M. Gaston Paris	PERSON	brought out his excellent book .

		We leave this topic momentarily to speak of the history of the poet 's vogue .

		There can be no doubt that
Villon	PERSON	was appreciated at something like his real literary value by the people of his time .

		Little as we know of his life , everything points to the conclusion that his writings were highly popular during his lifetime , not only among those princes whom he made his friends , but among that Parisian public of the lower orders with whom he was identified .

		The twenty-seven editions , still extant , that were published before
1542	DATE	are sufficient evidence of the demand that existed for his poems during the seventy or eighty years that followed his death .

		Then his repu - tation waned .

		For nearly three hundred years it remained under a cloud , the mass of the French nation knowing nothing and caring nothing about him .

		Then in
1844	DATE	the cloud began to part , for
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	became his excellent interpreter .

		This brought a host of other admirers , but surely the most aston - ishing of the posthumous fortunes of our Franpois was to have been adopted by the English school grouped around
Eossetti	LOCATION	.

		A
Villon Society	ORGANIZATION	was founded sponsor often enough for ideas more or less liable to sus - picion ;
John Payne	PERSON	translated with a re - markable talent the entire work of the Pari - sian ; and Eossetti himself ,
Swinburne	LOCATION	, and others put some ballads into English verse and imitated more than once the inspiration and the manner .

		The appreciation of the poet was overdone and
Stevenson	PERSON	wrote his somewhat vinegary article in which he turned
Villon	PERSON	's poor rags inside out .

		But to return to the biographers .

		In
1913	DATE	was published an excellent two-volume study of the poet and his times by
Pierre Champion	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here for the first time are plates showing old maps of
Paris	LOCATION	, old woodcuts , and title-pages of early Villon editions .

		But
M. Champion	ORGANIZATION	brings another novelty .

		He has searched the archives and libraries for information regard - ing the people mentioned in the poet 's test - aments .

		Finally , there is this study of Villon and his times by Mr.
Stacpoole	PERSON	, which is the only 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	extensive one in the English language , for none of the French biographies has been trans - lated to our knowledge , though
Payne	PERSON	and others referred constantly to them .

		Here Mr.
Stacpoole	PERSON	follows the plan of the French authors , who all try to meet the condition ex - pressed by
Clement Marot	PERSON	in his edition of Villon published in
1533	DATE	: `` In order to under - stand
Villon	PERSON	's poetry , the reader should have lived in his time at
Paris	LOCATION	and have known the persons , the places , and the customs . ''

		Our author takes us to this
Paris	LOCATION	of the fifteenth century ; we see how it looked then ; we fol - low the poet to his chosen haunts ; we learn to understand his irresistible longings , his passionate envy , his short-lived joys , his heart - burnings over a lewd and squandered life .

		In short , we make a journey of the imagina - tion , but all justified by documents .

		The author makes no mention anywhere of burying his own nose in musty manuscripts , so we infer that he used the French studies as books of reference .

		Indeed he seems to have rendered the Champion study freely into Eng - lish , though on a somewhat reduced scale .

		He , too , gives in an appendix , as Champion does , a report of discoveries regarding persons men - tioned by Villon in his legacies .

		These dis - coveries bring to light the fact that
Villon	PERSON	's pleasantries ought always to be understood by antiphrasis : if he depicts someone as a child , he means an old man ; if he says pov - erty-stricken , he means rich .

		For example , the poet leaves a share of his goods , or four blancs -LRB- one of the smallest coins of the day -RRB- , to three poor children , whom he names .

		Doc - uments show that -RRB- these waifs were three usurers , whom
Villon	PERSON	had probably every reason to dislike .

		Here too is explained the `` Pet-au-Diable , '' a romance dictated by
Villon	PERSON	to Tabary and willed to his patron
Guillaume Villon	PERSON	.

		The romance was lost , but
E. L. S.	PERSON	makes a great to do about it , insisting that the work was `` plainly neither decent nor devout . ''

		As a matter of fact , the `` Pet-au - Diable '' was the popular name of a rock which lay before the dwelling of Mme. de Bruyeres .

		The students rolled this rock into their domain and the prank was the cause of a lively battle between them and the town guards .

		Like most of the preceding commentators , our author is possessed by enthusiasm for the poetry and a feeling of friendliness for the poet , and so great is his power in creating atmosphere that we feel Villon to be a brother - man with a living voice , a fellow-sinner nearer to our hearts than any dead saint .

		However much Mr.
Stacpoole	PERSON	may take from the French biographers in facts , the able criticisms are his own .

		He points out how much better the Great Testament is than `` Les Lais '' and he ascribes this to the poet 's bitter experiences during his exile , especially the three months of torture and starvation in the pit of Meung .

		Without this , he would doubtless have given us works no more worthy than `` Les Lais '' ; he would not have pierced our hearts with the thorn that had torn his ; he would not have become the first modern poet .

		His faults , as
Gautier	PERSON	wittily says , lost us an honest man in the past , and gave us a grand poet for all time , and good poets are still more rare than honest folk though the latter are hardly common .

		Mr.
Stacpoole	PERSON	shows as good critical taste in his estimate of the worth of the various ballads , and he includes good poetic translations of most of them , as well as free prose renderings of the legacies .

		Read this book and you will learn to appre - ciate the perfection of
Villon	PERSON	's art for such is the verbal power that , despite the obscur - ities , one yields to the charm of the music and one knows not what to admire most , the choice and position of the word , the perfection of the verb , or the plaint of a heart at once good and bad .

		How personal the poetry is , and what a strength of genius this implies when one con - siders the commonplace contemporary work !

		How Villon makes himself the subject of his poetry , where all the marionettes whose strings he holds dance only around him and are in intimate rapport with him who moves them !

		We see that he is a great poet in his facility in passing from one tone to another , constantly mingling the pleasant and the serious , laughing among his tears , with an art both instinctive and conscious an art equalled only by
Heine	ORGANIZATION	.

		These abrupt changes have the effect of sharp dissonances when , for example , a melancholy revery is terminated by an ironic remark , or a facetious ballad serves as an introduction to a verse or two of real emotion .

		But these dissonances render more acute the impression the poet wishes to give .

		One feels that truly the device of our poet is `` Je ris en pleurs . ''

		Again , Mr.
Stacpoole	PERSON	makes us conscious of
Villon	PERSON	's gifts of observation and delineation especially of the comic or picturesque his gifts of poetic observation and artistic delineation of the old , crouched over their little fire of rotten wood ; of women seated in church on a fold of their skirts ; of students with thumbs in their girdles ; of skulls strewn in the Cemetery of the Innocents ; and of the skeletons of the hanged swaying in the wind on the gibbets of Montfaucon .

		In short , we see that the genius of
Franois Villon	PERSON	was -LRB- like that of many other geniuses -RRB-
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 309 of such a high order that he won an imme - diate celebrity among his contemporaries and that he remains the only French poet of the Middle Ages whom we read to-day .

		All of which goes , in turn , to say that Mr.
Stac	PERSON	- poole 's study is decidedly worth reading .


NELLIE POORMAN	PERSON	.

		THE WILL-TO-POWER .

		PELLB THE CONQUEROR .

		By
Martin Andersen Nexo	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	4 volumes , each
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		There is a proletarian journalist in
Martin Andersen Nexo	PERSON	's novel who represents the intellectuals of the labor movement and reads `` Les Miserables . ''

		He is authentic except for `` Les Miserables . ''

		I found it really impos - sible to believe that he cared deeply for that book .

		The whole emphasis of thinking has shifted since Hugo lived and wrote from faith in a naive emotionalism and vague good will to the constructive organization of force , and to place `` Pelle '' beside `` Les Miserables '' is to realize the great spiritual gulf that divides two generations .

		`` Pelle '' is a study of the labor movement as a whole .

		The life of this energetic son of a
Bornholm	LOCATION	peasant sweeps in the great drama of the modern world from its origins in iso - lated revolt and savage reprisal , through the struggle for organization , up to the present , and traces the gradual substitution of the will-to-power for a hopeless fatalism in the workers .

		The instrument of change was , of course , the machine , which revealed the mon - strous barbarism underlying the romantic private idealism of the last century .

		In ap - proaching a subject so vast , Mr.
Nexo	PERSON	had undoubtedly the same advantage over a novel - ist born in
Chicago	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	that the novelist born in a small town has over the product of a metropolis .

		In
Denmark	LOCATION	it is still possible , I suppose , to escape the confu - sion that comes from a mere multiplicity of detail and to discern more clearly the main lines of advance of any social movement .

		Mr.
Nexo	PERSON	had to think in a crowd , to be sure , but it is easy to imagine that it might make a dif - ference in the accuracy and ease of a man 's thinking whether the crowd was to be num - bered by millions or only by thousands .

		At all events , there is a simplicity and a steady focusing of the main issues in `` Pelle '' that it would be extremely difficult for a
Chicago	LOCATION	novelist , even of equal powers , to achieve .

		There is also and this is one of the most admirable qualities of the book a right pro- portion between the personal and the social ; the two strands are kept going back and forth and wrought firmly into a unified design .

		I except the last volume , and it is curious to see how the pressure of social fact squeezes out there much of the reality .

		In the last volume there is a suggestion of externality the kind of externality that comes from erecting even a wholly reasonable Utopia into the actual .

		There is , too , a diagrammatic rigidity , with impatient telescopings of the nar - rative here and there as if the writer had wearied of too long a task .

		Let us take it as an appendix to a fine and moving achieve - ment .

		To be sure , the third volume also shows a shift in emphasis from the personal to the social , but the shift there is inevitable and right , and it gives rise to one of the most con - vincing episodes of the novel as a whole .

		Pelle has reached the climax of his career ; he is engaged in directing the struggle with the forces of organized capital , and the respon - sibility of defeating the lockout rests largely upon him .

		He is like a soldier regimented for a campaign ; he lives largely in the life of his comrades , and much of his personal life falls away .

		In a society organized like ours a great part of the tragedy may lie precisely in such conflicting demands in the guilty conscience they impose on the individual .

		How much of himself does a man owe to the community ?

		It is a question
Pelle	PERSON	has no time to debate .

		Neither does he stop to consider how his dedication of himself to the cause may involve the virtual repudiation of his obligations to his wife and child may indeed wreck his family life altogether .

		To his men he is the invincible leader , the radiating focus of hope and courage ; to
Ellen	PERSON	, his wife , whose ambi - tions and loyalties and devotions are centred unalterably ^ f quite unselfishly in the home , he is only a visionary and a skulker who is allowing his child to starve .

		As the struggle goes on , and even crusts become scarce , the fierce and narrow maternal instinct is more and more outraged by the abstracter passion of the man , which draws a circle far beyond the family or even the group life and dreams of remote ends .

		There are no recriminations , but the atmosphere is surcharged .

		Pelle slinks at last from the silent accusation of his wife 's eyes ; his home is made impossible for him by the bad conscience imposed upon him by the necessity he feels of living so exclusively on another plane that of his public obliga - tions .

		Nor does
Pelle	PERSON	pay with a bad con - science only .


Ellen	PERSON	, in order to get bread for their child , sells herself at the moment when the men are all but triumphant , and
Pelle	PERSON	at the highest point of his public career finds 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	his private life in ruins .

		It is a part of the adequacy of Mr.
Nexo	PERSON	's art , in indicating the gradual widening of the rift , to present this fact of common experience with such justice as to hold the reader 's sympathy in perfect balance as between the man and the woman .

		The impulses of both are needed in the build - ing up of society the woman 's instinctive conservatism in fundamental relations no less than the man 's will to experiment .

		In presenting the growing firmness of
Pelle	PERSON	's intellectual grip on his world , Mr.
Nexo	PERSON	projects nothing less than the history of the labor movement itself .

		The will is for him the primary fact ; he shows it asserting itself blindly and gropingly , in the savagery of undirected revolt against the intolerable , and only later seeking to rationalize itself in a coherent philosophy .

		`` The Great Power , '' that Titanic figure of the earlier volumes who appals his fellow-workers as much as his ex - ploiters , is the natural precursor of
Pelle	PERSON	and his kind ; he becomes a sort of symbol in the book , but the kind of symbol which the actual world may offer us now and then .

		He finds the workers unready for his message of revolt , and
Pelle	PERSON	moves through his youth and ap - prenticeship untouched by the passion for justice to which `` The Great Power '' sacrificed himself .

		When he comes to
Copenhagen	LOCATION	,
Pelle	PERSON	is still full of the joyousness and hope of youth , and over him the metropolis casts its familiar spell as over any other rustic .

		It stimulates his desire for wealth and ease ; he fancies that with energy and good will he can make his way .

		It is by no independent activity of the mind that he parts with his illusions ; it is the impact of brutal fact , of exploitation and hunger , that stimulates his thinking and even so , his thirfking is con - fused and fragmentary .

		He revolts against no abstract injustice but against concrete wrongs ; he fights for concrete gains and for those that lie immediately within his grasp .

		It is this sharp and narrow realism that ex - plains his power over the workers , for they too want concrete things .

		During the whole period of his greatest ascendency , it is the will of the workers that
Pelle	ORGANIZATION	embodies a will that has behind it the irresistible drive of necessity .

		Whether Mr.
Nexo	PERSON	was aware of it or not , his novel illustrates beautifully the educative power of fact .

		From the moulding influence of facts
Pelle	PERSON	never escapes ; his phil - osophy is shaped by them ; and out of them emerges by a logical necessity his final pro- gramme the cooperative organization of in - dustry .

		In a novel crowded with living figures there are still a few that stand out from the rest .

		Of these I should put above the figure of Pelle himself that of Father Lasse surely a masterpiece of loving portraiture .

		There are few characters in current fiction that touch the heart so simply and profoundly by their authentic humanity .

		As for
Pelle	LOCATION	, he does not precisely become official as the novel progresses , but he undoubtedly suffers from a process of social absorption .

		He is , after all , a public man ; and what public man es - capes entirely the blight of institutions ?

		The young
Pelle	PERSON	is better to my sense , and the earlier volumes seem more steeped in the actual .

		It seems to me that Mr.
Nexo	PERSON	's mem - ories gain in adequacy as they recede ; at least his mind seems to be more energized and released by a little distance , so that one feels in the
Bornholm	LOCATION	peasants a greater variety and fulness of experience than in the world of workers .

		But here our literary habits of thought play us tricks and it is hard to be certain .

		We are prepared to accept the little struggles of the ego with its urgent appetites and needs , while the struggle for social ends still has for us something of the grandiose unreality of an epic .

		Taken all in all , `` Pelle '' is a fine achievement in democratic art , the most satisfying novel of the labor movement that I have read .

		DEMOCRACY AND EDUCATION .

		TRUANCY AND NON-ATTENDANCE IN THE CHI - CAGO SCHOOLS .

		A study of the social aspects of the compulsory education and child labor legislation of
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		By
Edith Abbott	PERSON	and
Sophonisba P. Breckinridge	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		In
1834	DATE	when
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	was a mem - ber of the
Illinois	LOCATION	legislature , he wrote in the Sangamon `` Journal '' : `` Upon the subject of education , not presuming to dictate any plans or systems respecting it , I can only say that I view it as the most important subject that we as a people can be engaged in . ''

		According to the interesting narrative of '' Truancy and Non-Attendance in the
Chicago	LOCATION	Schools '' Lincoln made these remarks and a succeeding plea for the extension of free education , as a public statement of his posi - tion in the great struggle for a free school system which preceded the establishment of our
Illinois	LOCATION	common schools .

		In the same year , in the same cause ,
Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	was exclaiming at a state educa - tional convention : `` Shall it be said that
Illinois	LOCATION	is too poor to educate her sons and her
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 311 daughters ?

		To hesitate upon this subject is to charge the people with a want of spirit and an ignorance of the character of the age in which they live . ''

		`` Truancy and Non - Attendance in the
Chicago	LOCATION	Schools '' carries the tale of public education `` the most important subject that we as a people can be engaged in '' through its vivid history in the second city in the
United States	LOCATION	, from the establishment of our free schools to the present day , indeed it may be said , to the last authentic news on the topic in the present day .

		For the increasing audience of readers in - terested in the multitudinous story of dem - ocracy as it is told in special investigations and public reports , this synthetic account will have the value of a distinguished social study .

		It will have also another value an original value closely connected with its power of giv - ing the last authentic news of its subject in the present day , and to be described later .

		Beginning with a picturesque survey of the struggle for the `` free-school '' principle -LRB- 1818 -55 -RRB- , the chronicle continues with a relation of the main events of the struggle for the compulsory principle -LRB- 1855-83 -RRB- `` when the first compulsory law was passed , '' and closes with a record of the various activities char - acterizing the period , still continuing , `` of struggle for the perfection of the compulsory law . ''

		The value of every law depends on the real - ization of its principle in terms of life .

		Miss
Abbott	PERSON	and
Miss Breckinridge	PERSON	's account of the supplementary laws and the administra - tive provisions which developed in
Chicago	LOCATION	in the course of the effort to make the compulsory education law effective in the daily existence of the children of the poor and the ignorant is of especial interest for two reasons .

		The account is of interest because it forms a strik - ing comment on a characteristic American weakness our failure to realize our in - ability to follow up with sustained attention or even with intelligent curiosity the vital social experiments made , or perhaps one should say the vital social experiments men - tioned as mandatory , by our statute-books .

		It is of interest also because of its description of our inability to correlate juvenile laws whose joint efficiency should guarantee a child a fair opportunity for education .

		What excellent civic end is served by keep - ing children out of work , if the compulsory education department will not compel their education ?

		Mrs.
Florence Kelley	PERSON	, our first Chief Factory Inspector , pointed out nearly twenty-five years ago the miserable results in the child-labor situation of the failures of the
Compulsory Education Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		She says in her report on a great suburban factory , in
1894	DATE	: Through all the heat of
last summer	DATE	, little boys worked among unguarded shafting and belting , in the fumes of the soldering , or crowded on a shelf in every crooked and unwholesome posture , poking sharp-edged circles of tin through the holes of the shelf ; or were seated at stamp and die ma - chines where every fall of the stamp is a menace to the fingers and hands .

		Some of these children , Italians , Bohemians and Poles , speak no English , and can not understand the warnings given them as to the dangers which surround them ; some of them can not read or write in any language .

		It was Mrs.
Kelley	PERSON	, certainly one of the staunchest and most fearless friends working - children have ever possessed , who was respon - sible for the advances of
1893	DATE	and of
1897	DATE	in the
Child Labor	ORGANIZATION	and Compulsory Education Laws ; and for the initiation of the better provisions of
1903	DATE	.

		Fascinating as the reader will find the book 's picture of the furtherance in the
last quarter	DATE	of a century of the meliorative work for
Chicago	LOCATION	's future citizens , undertaken in connection with the fight for their education the
Juvenile Court	ORGANIZATION	laws , the
School Chil	ORGANIZATION	- dren 's Aid Society , the
Factory Inspection Department	ORGANIZATION	, the Parental School his inter - est will focus naturally on the contemporary history of the present condition of compulsory education which occupies the main part of the book .

		With a shock one finds or rather one is unable to avoid the conclusion from the in - vestigators ' careful figures that the system of recording attendances now used in the
Chicago	LOCATION	public schools is so imperfect , and kept in a manner so slovenly , that it is not possible for the
Department	ORGANIZATION	to know accur - ately the number of children of school age in the city , the number of absences of those enrolled , or the causes of these absences .

		Many long and unregarded interruptions in the short , seven years ' schooling of the children of the poorer neighborhoods occur because of the inadequacy of the `` transfer system . ''

		In our migratory city these chil - dren in the change from school to school at - tendant upon `` moving , '' or on their entrance into parochial schools from public schools , or vice versa , pass into a species of limbo where apparently all the protection of the Depart - ment is withdrawn .

		Akin to the inefficiency of the recording system and of the transfer system is the slack - ness of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	, both in ascertaining causes of the children 's failures in attendance , and in removing these causes by the use of cooperative agencies .

		Eleven hundred visits 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	were paid by the investigators to absent scholars .

		For the misfortunes of these strug - gling little absentees a generous , unused pub - lic provision had been made in many cases .

		From the visitor 's specific accounts the faces of innumerable needlessly neglected and irre - sponsibly treated children look out sadly at the reader .

		One little boy whose absence was investigated had been out of school 62 half days during 24 school weeks .

		He was found at home sick , lying on the floor by the stove .

		His mother was away working and there was no one to look after the child , or the three smaller children who were at home .

		Another child
Josie D.	PERSON	a motherless little Italian girl of thirteen , whose father earned good wages , was found by a social worker at home , cooking and trying to iron and to look after little
Nick	PERSON	at the same time .

		She had just finished washing and was weary enough to say that she would much rather go to school , but there was no one at home to do the work .

		She explained that the baby had died during the past year and so there was only little
Nick	PERSON	to look after .

		Another visit was made when the father was at home , and it was explained to him that
Josie	PERSON	must go to school , that little
Nick	PERSON	would be much better off in a nursery , and that with a good salary such as he was earning , he ought to pay a woman to wash and iron .

		It seems that
Josie	PERSON	had not been to school for a year .

		Comment on this case is scarcely necessary .

		Josie had lost a whole year of schooling , and the baby had died , a double catastrophe which could probably have been avoided if the school authorities had known that co-operation with the social agencies only a few blocks away might have worked out a plan that would have released
Josie	PERSON	from the burdens she was trying to carry .

		It is interesting to observe that after the baby had died , and
Josie	PERSON	had lost a year 's education , `` The Superintendent of Compul - sory Education ... immediately took steps to have the child placed in school . ''

		This instance is mentioned in connection with the need of Visiting Teachers in the schools , to develop the cooperation of various meliorative agencies with the
Compulsory Education Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among other such agencies which would greatly profit by the development of such co-operation within the school would be the medical inspection and school nursing service of the
Department of Health	ORGANIZATION	.

		The City expends nearly
$ 350,000	MONEY	annually on the
Child Hygiene Division	ORGANIZATION	of the health service , and the devel - opment of any machinery that will enable it more completely to fulfil its purpose for which it is estab - lished can be regarded only as sound economy .

		Broad in the range of its historical and municipal reference the study is excellent in its presentation of detail , especially in these chronicles of the children who fall into the crevasses where Juvenile agencies do not meet ; and in its story of the Dogberries empowered to be `` Compulsory Education '' agents in some of the suburban districts .

		With regard to a family of three Italian children about whom the Director of the Immigrants ' Protective League made inquiry , one such agent wrote , `` we have a good many Italians tending our school they tend regular the 3 you have wrote to us about are not in our school . ''

		Another of these governmental protectors of public learning replied , `` we are Looking after all Foren Born Children Very Clost So that they are in School all the time . ''

		Besides its value as a social study this book has the power which is lacking in many social studies of well-focussed indictment , and an admirable method of indictment .

		Impersonally , without mentioning a name , without raising its voice , it yet says very clearly `` Iste !

		Iste Catalina ! ''

		to a situation shameful to
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		One of the most serious charges of this indictment refers to the state of our law itself .

		Chicago does not require of working-children an ability to read and write simple sentences in the English language .

		She permits them to enter into industry without a knowledge of the tongue in which the laws of the country are written .

		In this matter of establishing a minimum standard of education that must be attained before a child is permitted to leave school
Illinois	LOCATION	is shockingly behind other states .

		An exposure of the
Compulsory Education Department	ORGANIZATION	of the city , `` Truancy and Non - Attendance in the
Chicago	LOCATION	Schools , '' is also a constructive criticism .

		It offers an able ad - ministrative plan which would reorganize the present system by a standardized , state control of local authorities ; and by improved state laws .

		Pending the adoption of this larger and more distant programme , the authors suggest to the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	a number of imme - diate practical improvements in the present methods of compulsory education in the city .

		The mere mention of some of these suggestions serves to indicate the slovenly and unscholarly standards of compulsory education now dis - gracing
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		For instance , the first rec - ommendation is `` That the system of record - ing attendance be so re-organized that the facts with reference to non-attendance may be ascertained . ''

		Will the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	adopt these suggestions ?

		Will
Chicago	LOCATION	adopt them ?

		The reader closes the book with the memory of the words of
Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	echoing in his consciousness .

		`` Shall it be said that
Chicago	LOCATION	is too poor to educate her sons and her daughters ?

		To hesitate upon the subject is to charge the people with a want of spirit . ''

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 313 THE ARTFUL MR. HICHENS .

		IN THE WILDERNESS .

		By
Bobert Hichens	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Some years ago everybody read or intended to read `` The Garden of Allah . ''

		Seeking to shock a stolid Englishman , a young person who had devoured the story surreptitiously declared that it was a `` lovely book . ''

		Astute beneath his calm , the Englishman replied that
Hichens	PERSON	was a `` bon-bon-box writer . ''

		The young person retired in confusion : a mascu - line mind had summed up and disposed of her favorite author .

		`` The Garden of Allah '' was a distinct sur - prise to those who had enjoyed that delightful satire , `` The Green Carnation . ''

		They over - looked , or knew nothing of , `` Flames '' and `` The Slave , '' which preceded it the first a fantastic novel , prosy on reperusal , the second a haunting study of a jewel-worshipping woman .

		Here were the beginnings of a series of feminine portraits of which `` In the Wilder - ness '' is the culmination .

		Vivid , romantic , mystic , often witty and sometimes wise , elab - orately analytic , packed with descriptions of an unseemly lusciousness , Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	's work has won and held a place of its own .

		`` But you must not judge any woman with - out knowing what is in her heart , '' says
Eosamund Leith	PERSON	to her husband .

		Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	has acted on the hint .

		Carefully and minutely he dissects , weighs , probes , deducts , compares .

		.

		His good women are human angels , a little hard in their religious devotion but winning in their love for children .

		Frailer sisters , ob - sessed by a fixed idea , dedicate themselves to possessing their desire .

		There are no repent - ant Magdalens , no ladies weeping over a past .

		Avoiding pity and Puritan wrath , Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	refuses to uphold or to condemn .

		Now and again one has a sense of surfeit .

		The relentless analysis confuses and fatigues .

		No action relating to the characters escapes comment ; no symptom is overlooked ; this or that is done for such and such a reason , etc. , etc. , until one longs to repeat the advice of the
Great Pym	LOCATION	to
Sentimental Tommy	ORGANIZATION	embarking on the seas of literature : Analyze your characters and their motives at the prodigious length in which you revel , and then , my sonny , cut your analysis out .

		It is for your own guidance not the reader 's .


Dion Leith	PERSON	, the hero of `` In the Wilder - ness , '' resembles many another of Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	's heroes .

		He is interesting but hardly forceful .

		Two women dominate him ,
Rosamund	PERSON	his wife , a religious egoist , who `` longs for freshness and for peace '' ; and
Cynthia Clarke	PERSON	, the `` wild soul in an innocent body , '' whose face has a `` punished '' look .

		The first part of the book is charming , and may induce lovers to spend their honeymoon in
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Eosamund attracts and repels by turns , but even while you dislike her , you ca n't resist the spell of her way with chil - dren : What did she do ?

		... He could never re - member very much .

		But he knew that
Kosamund	PERSON	showed him new aspects of tenderness and fun .

		What do women who love and understand little boys do to put them at their ease , to break down their small shynesses ?

		Eosamund did absurd things with deep earnestness and complete concentration .

		After the tragedy which falls suddenly upon them ,
Cynthia Clarke	PERSON	comes subtly for - ward , an unusual type of siren who values the friendship of her sex and guards it as a useful commodity .

		Step by step we follow the prog - ress of this passionate cerebrale .

		Suspicion of her innocence in regard to other men awakens in
Dion	PERSON	's mind during one of her stealthy visits to him : There had been in her movement a sort of per - fection of surreptitiousness that was animal .

		He noticed it , and thought that she must surely be ac - customed to moving with precaution lest she should be seen or heard .

		Eosamund could not move like that .

		A life story seemed to him to be faintly traced in Mrs.
Clarke	PERSON	's manner of entering the pavilion and of sitting down on the divan .

		One may prefer the realism of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	or Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	to morbid symptoms of the soul ; one may be bored by an art that fails to conceal artificiality .

		Such , however , is the artfulness of Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	that one reads his book to the end and lays it down satisfied to have witnessed an achievement fine of its kind - ALICE BISHOP .

		NOTES ON NEW FICTION .

		The woman with a job who does not sail ma - jestically and irrepressibly to a salary of four figures , who does not possess a striking personal - ity but is , on the contrary , `` as un dramatic as a field daisy , '' who does not fail to make mistakes in love as well as in business such is the rather refreshing heroine of
Sinclair Lewis	PERSON	's new book , `` The Job '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	's ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Una Golden is an average young woman , whom circumstances and not inherent character force through the mill of office routine and matrimonial misery to the posi - tion of dignity and independence she finally occu - pies .

		Most young heroines of the business world of fiction are convinced feminists .

		Una , like the great multitude that fill
New York	LOCATION	's offices and shops , is an unintentional one .

		The story of her life , filled though it is with degradation and disillusionment and vulgarity , is yet a fairly true reflection of the career of the workers not the drones in the feminist ranks .

		The times and the cause of
Bonnie Prince Charlie	ORGANIZATION	are a source of fiction that is apparently 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	never-ending .

		We have them once again in `` The Yeoman Adventurer , '' by
George W. Gough	PERSON	-LRB-
Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , a rather commonplace tale in which youth and beauty play the leading parts .

		The yeoman
Oliver Wheatman	PERSON	by a lucky chance rescues
Margaret	PERSON	from the attentions of
Brocton	LOCATION	, who , as an enemy of the Stuarts , is pursuing her father .

		It is a yarn filled with captures and escapes , spies and incendiaries , giving us a glimpse of Prince
Charlie	PERSON	at the turning-point of his career .

		As a narrative it is neither better nor worse than most of its sort .

		The
Baroness von Hutton	PERSON	, in the guise of a kindly
London	LOCATION	bachelor , gives the history of a romance or two in her new novel , `` Mag Pye '' -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	's ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Her chattiness , her senti - mentality , and her talent for weaving a plot serve well her latest theme .


Margaret Pye	PERSON	is a child of uncertain antecedents , rather an ugly duck - ling , but possessed of an indefinable charm .

		Joined to her story is the narrator 's own a quiet tale of love at least ten times rejected , in which an heiress and a lost artist figure .

		The novel stands in that host of good , but uninspired , middle - class English fiction .

		The subject of hidden treasure has almost as great a fascination for the novelist as has treasure itself for the adventurer .

		It is unusual for this time-honored theme to yield so genuine a find as `` The Hiding-Places , ''
Allen	PERSON	French 's recent addi - tion to buccaneer bibliography .

		The treasure in this case consisted of gems contained in lead boxes and concealed by a wily old sea-captain about a
New England	LOCATION	farm .

		This farm has been divided between two cousins before the story opens with the discovery of one of the precious boxes .

		While the discovery of treasure and the lust for more inspire what follows , it would be a mistake to suppose that this is no more than a melodramatic tale .

		It is true that violent passions are engen - dered , both those of love and hate , but the develop - ing action carries far beyond the quest of hidden gems .

		To say that the tale is exciting is to pay slight tribute to a novel containing so clever a plot and such excellent characterizations as those of the hero , his mother , and his cousin .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	has set out to write a story , but in accomplishing his end he has shown respect for his public and him - self .

summer	DATE	and winter folks to know 'em .

		Done both twice and a half to
Natupski	ORGANIZATION	and by
Godfrey Mighty	ORGANIZATION	he gets harder to guess right along . ''

		Of such enigmatic stuff in very truth was the constantly increasing family that had found its way from
Poland	LOCATION	to
West Holly	LOCATION	,
New England	LOCATION	.

		It is the subject of `` Our
Natupski Neighbors	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Edith Miniter	PERSON	-LRB- Holt ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , a story of immi - grant life which leads one to the conclusion that fiction may be quite as enlightening on the score of that `` problem '' as either textbooks or sta - tistics .

		The Natupskis , with all the old-world cus - toms of the first generation and the emerging Americanism of the second , are drawn from life , and the author has given them the illuminating touch that leads to understanding , and to sym - pathy in moderation .

		The mood of the `` Atlantic Monthly 's '' famous `` Twenty Minutes of Reality '' is inherent in the new short novel of
Frances Hodgson Burnett	PERSON	, entitled `` The White People '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	's ;
$ 1.20	MONEY	-RRB- .

		It is to extend new hope to her readers , and to obliterate the omnipresent `` fear to die '' that
Jean	PERSON	, the Scottish chieftainess of
Muircarrie Castle	ORGANIZATION	, relates the story of her experiences with the
White People	ORGANIZATION	with
Wee Brown Elspeth	PERSON	and
Dark Malcom	PERSON	of the
Glen	PERSON	, with the pale-faced child of the weeping woman , and finally with
Hector MacNairn	PERSON	, one of the few people in the world who had understood the strange vision-seeing girl .

		Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	's transcendentalism will probably ap - peal more to `` New Thinkers '' and the like than to those whose fancies range less freely .

		In any case one may enjoy its consistent setting , in the purple
Scotch Highlands	LOCATION	, and the manner of the author 's narration .

		The
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Dutch form a community as concentrated in its self-complacency , as `` set '' in its customs of restraint broken by periodic aban - donment , as may be found among the remoter strongholds of
New England	LOCATION	tradition or in the inner fastnesses of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountains .

		Mrs.
Helen R. Martin	PERSON	has made its life her special study and she shows her mastery once more in `` Those Fitzenbergers '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		She has been in the habit of placing against the background of stolid Dutch cruelty and narrow - ness , a protagonist who has gained a higher level from which revolt is possible .

		In `` Erstwhile Susan '' it was the girl
Barnabetta	LOCATION	; and in the story of the Fitzenbergers it is
Liddy	LOCATION	, the child of tragedy , who with the friendly help of the `` Reverend Armstrong '' and his `` missus '' reaches a height that is unattainable by the equally am - bitious
Elmer Wagenhorst	PERSON	.

		The author exhibits more than a little sex prejudice in her treatment of
Elmer	LOCATION	; we are vastly sorrier for him when his castle of inherited , conscious male superiority comes tumbling about his ears than is Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	.

		In fact this apparent prejudice , which makes the boy a creature of almost incredible egotism , is the only serious fault in an otherwise excellent novel of character .

		The scheming stepmother , the sodden father whose crime has driven his family into social ostracism , Mr.
Wagenhorst	PERSON	, from whom
Elmer	PERSON	inherited in part his cruel assumption of infallibility ,
Liddy	PERSON	herself , and lastly the Arm - strongs , whose point of view throws into stronger relief the strangeness of the narrow little Dutch community all these are very real people .

		There is , however , a trace of bitterness in the author 's characterization that the book would be better without .

		There must be more than a little humor in such a settlement as
Virginsburg	LOCATION	.

		There always is .

		Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	too rarely shows her ability to catch its gleam .

		The English butler in `` Confessions of a Social Secretary , '' by
Corinne Lowe	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	's ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , after listening to a typical dinner-table conversa - tion , makes a remark in which the reader of this narrative is likely to concur .

		He says : `` These people do n't have many conversational powers : now in
England	LOCATION	, madam , it 's a treat to stand behind the master 's chair and listen to the talk
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 315 that goes on . ''

		The English novelist certainly succeeds in casting a glamour over his aristocracy and he frequently endows them with more than ordinary intelligence ; Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	, with all her sophistication and disillusionment in writing of a corresponding class in our own country , re - lieves the dulness of the situation by fine irony or by an alluring heroine ; Mr.
Robert Chambers	PERSON	, somewhat against our better judgment , keeps our attention by such devices as a dramatic meeting of hero and heroine at the depths of their host 's swimming-pool .

		Miss
Corinne Lowe	PERSON	attempts only to present a grim chronicle of the activities of a certain rich and fashionable set living in
New York	LOCATION	and
Newport	LOCATION	.

		She presents without illu - sions the life of these modern Romans , to whom -LRB- quoting a phrase of the author used in another connection -RRB- motion , not destination , is the goal ; a restless discontent and expensive gloom con - sistently pervade the atmosphere in which they live .

		One must be curious indeed about the doings of this set to be diverted by the details of their domestic arrangements ; these details Miss Lowe presents with photographic candor .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		CHINA INSIDE OUT .

		By
George A. Miller	PERSON	.

		Abingdon Press ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		The `` heathen Chinee '' shows himself as a very human , interesting , often admirable and even lov - able creature in the Rev.
George A. Miller	PERSON	's nar - rative of missionary experiences among the people of the
Flowery Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		It is no
China	LOCATION	from a car-window that he pictures in his pages , but a workaday , toiling , and suffering
China	LOCATION	, a
China	LOCATION	needing and responding to ` the appeal which hun - dreds of devoted men and women are now making to the higher nature of the lowly Mongolian .

		The versatility and resource of those engaged in the arduous labors of a missionary among
China	LOCATION	's countless millions are truly surprising and admir - able , as described in ``
China	LOCATION	Inside Out . ''

		`` Straightforward reports of laboratory expe - riments in spiritual life '' thus , in brief , the book is not inaptly characterized in an introduction by another pen than Dr.
Miller	PERSON	's .

		Excellent line drawings and a frontispiece photogravure illus - trate the book .

		GREAT COMPANIONS .

		By
Edith Wyatt	PERSON	.

		Apple - ton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In this collection from various periodicals of special articles on more or less literary topics , ranging from
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	's poetry to
The Department of the Interior	ORGANIZATION	's Guide-Book to the
Western United States	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- a literary topic , surely , if you define literature as `` work of the imagina - tion '' -RRB- ,
Miss Wyatt	PERSON	imparts enthusiastic informa - tion , unaccompanied by what she finds so common in our critical writing , `` the rapid blight of the explanatory touch . ''

		She treats her audience as equals , and they ought to be sufficiently grateful to overlook her habit of praising books for their `` tonic '' value , as though they were so much med - icine ; the more so as this unusual standard of values does not keep her from appreciating an amazing variety of tonics .

		Apart from a fondness for the `` back to the land '' movement she is appar - ently without prejudices , without even that prej - udice which most thinking American critics seem to have against the literature of their own country .

		She does , indeed , become mildly ironical over our slovenly , wholesale methods of writing , reading , and cataloguing ; but on the whole her taste , while discriminating , is less fastidiously aristocratic than Miss Repplier 's or Mrs.
Emily Putnam	PERSON	's , and she sees much to admire in
Stephen Crane	PERSON	,
Frank Norris	PERSON	, and other American authors like Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who happen just now to be more gen - erally celebrated but will probably go out of fash - ion shortly .

		As a `` tonic , '' `` Great Companions '' can certainly be recommended , for it contains something sufficiently rare : independent and , at the same time , cheerful thought about what we have done in literature and what we are likely to do .

		At a period when so many national authorities are being quoted , urging us to fall in line and sur - render any remaining intelligence to the tender mercies of group consciousness , it is encouraging to have Miss
Wyatt	PERSON	's assurance that such an in - dividual as Thoreau really existed in
America	LOCATION	.

		How TO READ .

		By
J. B. Kerfoot	PERSON	.


Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		There may have been a more fascinating exposi - tion written in some language , at some time , on some subject , than Mr.
Kerfoot	PERSON	's book ; but one is permitted to doubt it .

		The title , however , carries only partial truth .

		Three of the chapters do throw some light on how to read , but much of that mys - terious art remains mysterious .

		The main interest is in how we actually do read , not in the psychology of eye movements , but , to quote one of the chapter heads , `` Watching the Wheels go Round . ''

		It is on this subject that Mr.
Kerfoot	PERSON	has achieved a masterpiece of popular exposition .

		His compar - ison of reading to the production of a moving - picture show , in which the reader collaborates with the author , furnishing all the `` property '' of his memory and imagination to aid in reproducing the story , is , in its way , perfect .

		Unlike most anal - ogies , this gets better as you examine it .

		The `` movies '' give their lifelike impression by virtue of a succession of ten pictures a second ; a story re - produces itself by the successive images of words flashed on the retina of the eye three hundred to the minute or five a second .

		These words are not perceived as distinct symbols and analyzed con - sciously for their distinct meanings ; there is no time for that .

		They merge in a perfect synthesis to awaken ideas and call up pictures .

		The words are not the story any more than the notes of a score are the music ; both story and music await the performing artist .

		Of course , Mr.
Kerfoot	PERSON	points out the unlikeness between the `` movie '' and the written word : the `` movie '' tells the story without appeal to the creative mind of the audience , while the word depends upon the author and the reader .

		But this essential difference only stresses the mechanical , though superficial like - ness .

		Let us turn to the positive side of the art of reading , the core of the book .

		Our reasons for 316 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	reading are thus summed up : `` Some urge toward wanting to know , and some urge toward wanting to play ; both being forms of the desire to ` find ourselves ' ; and some urge toward wanting to for - get , the same being an impulse to escape from the consciousness of a side of ourselves that is weary , or baffled , or discouraged . ''

		The first rule in read - ing is that we must learn to look upon our curios - ity as `` the prompting of our mental hunger '' ; the second , that we must `` learn to evaluate our subsidiary curiosities '' ; the third , that we must `` never neglect any prompting of subsidiary curios - ity that is , of itself , sharp enough to shift , though only for a few seconds , the conscious focus of our reading attention . ''

		This third rule presents the very heart of the author 's advice on reading .

		Properly appreciated and applied there is little doubt that it would help a host of word-and-line readers to discover an unsuspected glimmering of originality in books which mere worshipful study of authorities would only serve to bury deeper `` than did ever plummet sound . ''

		A DAUGHTER OF THE PURITANS .

		By
Caro	PERSON	- line
A. Stickney Creevey	PERSON	.

		Putnam 's ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mrs.
Creevey	PERSON	is not only a botanist and a writer on botany , with several handy and useful books to her credit on our native flora and the pleasures of its study , but also an agreeable chronicler of events in the animate world of human beings .

		Her autobiography is simply and straightfor - wardly written , revealing much of the inner life of an earnest and conscientious young
New England	LOCATION	woman up to the time of her happy marriage to the man of her choice .

		Natural enough in one of her serious disposition , acted upon as she was by the religious influences of her puritanical environment , was the excess of piety that caused her to cherish the early ambition , if she should die young , `` to be made into a
Sunday	DATE	- school book , like ` Little
Jane	PERSON	, ' '' which she tells us she read many times with great relish .

		`` So I often said and wrote words , '' she adds , `` to see how they would sound in a book which might be read by thoughtless children and which might lead them into ways of piety . ''

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	has made similar confessions of childhood religiosity , but both soon worked their way out of the mor - bid mood and lived to laugh at it in the retro - spect .

		Mrs.
Creevey	PERSON	's account of her education and her school-teaching is good reading truthful and richly human , with a spice of humor .

		THE FRENCH RENASCENCE .

		By
Charles Sarolea	PERSON	.

		Pott ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Dr.
Sarolea	PERSON	's book is an agreeable but insub - stantial collection of occasional articles and book reviews dealing with
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	,
Pascal	PERSON	,
Madame de Maintenon	ORGANIZATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	,
Mira	PERSON	- beau ,
Robespierre	LOCATION	,
Napoleon	PERSON	,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Bergson	PERSON	, and President
Poincare	PERSON	.

		The `` Mirabeau '' reads like a fragment of an ad - dress , and the ``
Pascal	PERSON	and
Newman	PERSON	'' is reprinted from Dr.
Sarolea	PERSON	's book on
Newman	PERSON	.

		The title of the volume refers to the new birth of French idealism after the humiliations of
1870	DATE	, culminat - ing in the marvellous spectacle that all the world has witnessed since
1914	DATE	.

		To this subject the introduction and conclusion are devoted .

		The ar - ticle entitled `` The
New France	LOCATION	, '' written in
1912	DATE	, contains this sentence : `` English statesmanship realizes that
France	LOCATION	is the key-stone of Continen - tal
Europe	LOCATION	, that she holds the balance of power , that any serious blow aimed at
France	LOCATION	would be indirectly aimed at
England	LOCATION	and at European civilization , and that if it ever came to a
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean conflict , the decisive battles of
England	LOCATION	would have to be fought , not against
France	LOCATION	, as in the past , but in alliance with
France	LOCATION	and on French battlefields . ''

		Dr.
Sarolea	PERSON	writes a clear and fluent , though quite undistinguished style , but it seems a pity that he should permit himself such oddities as `` impunately '' and `` presigeotus '' can the word be prestigious ?

		and such a hybrid as `` Constituant Assembly . ''

		One is grateful for the plain speech concerning the `` Germanomania '' of the years before the war .

		`` Even estimable medi - ocrities like Eucken were proclaimed original thinkers '' is a specimen .

Harrison S. Kerrick	PERSON	,
U. S. A. Double	PERSON	- day , Page ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Captain
Kerrick	PERSON	deals exclusively with the pres - ent state of our military establishment .

		He has written a book packed with information and details about the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, the
Coast Artillery	ORGANIZATION	, the
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	, the submarine defence of harbors ; he also has introduced a useful glossary of tech - nical terms .

		There is no doubt of his compre - hensiveness ; in the index , `` Wood , Major-General
Leonard	PERSON	, work in organizing training camps '' is immediately followed by `` Woods ,
Corporal Wes	ORGANIZATION	- ley H. , record national rifle competition . ''

		Captain
Kerrick	PERSON	is true to his service ; honor wherever honor is due .

		In a book of this scope there are of course bound to be occasional omissions ; for instance , there seems to be no list either of the number of ships authorized in recent years nor even a forecast of the scope of the new five-year building programme , although its general features must have become fairly clear by the time _ the book went to press .

		And an intelligent comparison of American warship designs with contemporary foreign ones would have been easily obtainable from one or other of the
Naval Annals	ORGANIZATION	and per - haps more illuminating than some of the other minutiae which Captain
Kerrick	PERSON	has included .

		But he includes infinitely more than he leaves out , and anyone who chooses to inform himself upon our actual military situation can well begin with his book .

		ENGLISH COMPOSITION AS A SOCIAL PROBLEM .

		By
Sterling Andrus Leonard	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Riverside Educational Monographs	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Houerhton Mifflin	LOCATION	; 70 cts .

		The classes of the old school were social in spite of pedagogical discouragement .

		But now profes - sors of education advocate the social group as the ideal unit of organization in the systematized process of adapting children to the environment of modern civilization .

		Here , for instance , is Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	offering arguments for allowing even the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 317 youngest students of English composition to work out their own salvation by finding and correcting one another 's faults and errors with the aid of only a small number of ex machina suggestions from teachers .

		Although he uses the cold vocab - ulary of pedagogy , he urges in common sense fashion that the pupils ' social instincts and inter - ests should provide them with motives and subjects for their practice in composition , and manifests the belief that , except for definitely few conven - tions such as those of grammatical form , matters of rhetoric can best be learned by ordinary school - children through communal discussion and solution of their own actual problems of expression .

		This theory provides for a complete , slow , and orderly natural training quite opposed to the cramming which was encouraged not many years ago .

		Per - haps Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	's modest little brown book is a sign that at least in the field of education the American mania for speed is becoming less violent .

		Certainly the children of the
United States	LOCATION	might with profit spend many leisurely hours in acquir - ing a mastery of the English tongue .

Thieme	PERSON	calls this abundant storehouse an essay ; but the essay will be passed over by the research student , not that he may not read it with profit , but that he will be more eager to examine so rich and so methodical an index .

		For this is an out and out bibliography , and it is not the first one Professor
Thieme	PERSON	has organized .

		Any student of modern French will agree with Professor
Gus	PERSON	- tave Lanson , whose introduction must not be left unread , that there is `` not a student of twenty nor a student of sixty whom one calls a professor , '' who has not found the `` Guide Bibliographique de la Litterature franchise de 1800 a
1906	DATE	'' authoritative .

		This bibliography guides one over an enormous field and not one route but several are provided .

		It classifies and edits all that has been written on French versification , first as to centuries , again specifically as to the year , with each entry duly annotated .

		Then to be more helpful there are analytic tables in which all matter relative to French versification from Accent to
Vers Libres	LOCATION	is accounted for .

		Chronological and alphabetical indexes further clear the way through this vast subject .

		Surely only the student of sixty , in - tensely intimate with the whole of French poetics from
1332	DATE	to
1913	DATE	, is able to test these elaborate tables .

		They are a scholar 's work for a scholar 's judgment .

		For the general reader the essay por - tion of this great summary is worth close study .

		Professor
Thieme	PERSON	remains the scholar in this as in the analytical index ; his attitude is detached and wholly formal .

		The American reader wishes that he were less so .

		There lurks in this subject a deep American interest , for French versification has yielded to a
Poe	PERSON	and to a Whitman influence , and an American in reading the essay wishes that Professor
Thieme	PERSON	were more than locally American , so that he might triumphantly show how French poets came , through this influence , to face about in their conception of poetry .

		But
Remy de Gour	PERSON	- mont has done this and his fine essay is indexed in its due place .

		The essay is now published as part of the volume `` Le Probleme du Style , '' in a recent edition of de
Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	's works .


GERMANY	LOCATION	, FROM
1815 TO 1852	DATE	.

		By Sir
Adolphus William Ward	PERSON	.


Cambridge Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Press ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The author traverses here a period compara - tively unfamiliar to most American readers ; but , as he has pointed out in his preface , an under - standing of the half - century of struggles and humiliations which followed the War of Liber - ation is a necessary preliminary to the proper appreciation of
Germany	LOCATION	's upward swing and expanding ambitions in recent years .

		It is grat - ifying to observe that the author 's point of view has not been affected by prejudices or passions engendered by the war .

		In this respect it con - trasts most pleasantly with the diatribes under the guise of history which
Professor Eduard Meyer of Berlin University	ORGANIZATION	has been publishing .

		The difficulty of writing the history of a country which was once a geographical term rather than a nation will be readily perceived .

		The author in his 550 pages of fairly detailed treatment has managed to preserve the proper perspective and focus the interest where it belongs .

		The revolution of
1848	DATE	-LRB-
Germany	LOCATION	's only revolution , and that an abortive one -RRB- is naturally given the greatest prominence .

		The author 's sympathies are inferentially on the liberal , democratic side , though his procedure is throughout objective .

		Literary and philosophical movements receive a fair share of attention ; less space is given to material progress .

		The continu - ation of the work will be awaited with interest .

		INTOLERANCE IN THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH , QUEEN OF
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		By
Arthur Jay Klein	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		In this volume Professor
Klein	PERSON	sketches the re - organization of the English church in the early years of the reign of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	and tells the story of its great conflict a generation later with its Catholic , Presbyterian , and Congregational oppo - nents .

		Of these three dissenting groups , the most important for the author 's purpose is the Roman Catholic ; and Professor
Klein	PERSON	recounts in some detail the efforts that Elizabethan statesmen made to win the devotees of the old church to the new forms of worship or at least to secure their loy - alty to the sovereign .

		The story of the
Elizabethan Establishment	ORGANIZATION	is one that has been told many times and from many points of view , and the author has contributed very little to the total of significant data ; he has , however , studied his facts from a somewhat novel viewpoint , as is indicated in the title of his work .

		Students of church history will find Professor
Klein	PERSON	's narrative and conclusions of considerable interest and value , but as a study of 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 5	DATE	intolerance his account is distinctly disappointing .

		The author concludes that Elizabethan statesmen were , after all , a rather tolerant set : their aim was to exact a minimum of conformity only , and to make it as easy as possible for tender con - sciences to adapt themselves to the new forms .

		Real intolerance is found chiefly among the groups that are commonly thought to have stood for lib - erty and democracy : the Presbyterians and , to a lesser degree , the Congregationalists .

		It is , indeed , true that the persecution of the time was carried on in the name of the national church ; but it seems clear that if the Catholics or the Puritans had gained control of the state during the years of conflict there would have been less toleration of dissenting opinion than there was under the Anglican regime .

		MECHANISMS OF CHARACTER FORMATION .

		By
William A. White	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		In giving the sub-title , `` An Introduction to Psychoanalysis '' to his volume , Dr. White indi - cates its trend .

		The volume presents in conven - ient form a survey of the Freudian principles .

		It does not make an original contribution , nor is the presentation distinctive ; it is adequate with - out being notable .

		There is a good deal of cita - tion and of rather unsystematic assembling of data from various sources .

		The book is addressed to the average reader and in its scope is well suited to his needs .

		But the time has come when more may reasonably be demanded of a fresh contribu - tion .

		To the mentally ripe reader the story of the Freudian theories thus presented , with their affil - iations to neurotic cases and their abrupt assump - tions and erotic implications , is unconvincing .

		It will be made less so only by a critical readjust - ment of the component principles of the system , and by an interpretation that does some of the work of assimilation for the reader .

		To many the Freudian territory is rather a forbidden country ; the expert traveller who can bring back a well - sustained interpretation of what may be observed in these foreign parts will find a genial reception .

		THE FIGHT FOR THE REPUBLIC .

		By
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.


Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	's is a well-written book and one of considerable interest , although it adds practically nothing to our knowledge of the Civil War .

		Of the thirty-three chapters all except three relate solely to military and naval matters .

		In the three non-military chapters brief mention is made of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's inauguration , of the emancipa - tion , and of the federal finances of the war period .

		Taking up first the good points of the book , one may say that the military descriptions are vivid and accurate , the maps and plans are clear and very useful , and the frequent quotations from first - hand accounts are well selected and are properly fitted into the narrative .

		The limitations of the work are , however , considerable .

		As the title in - dicates , it is a view of one side of the Civil War ; consequently little attention is given to the other side , which exists merely to furnish opposition now and then to the forces fighting for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's patriotism is as distinctly marked as | it would have been
twenty-five years ago	DATE	, and con - servatism is evident in his attitude toward new views and in his failure to make use of recent available historical material .

		It is hardly possible to write , in this day , a valuable history of the Civil War without devoting some attention to the non-military aspects of the period , but for Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	these matters evidently have little interest .

		For one who wishes to get a brief description of a battle or a campaign as seen from the
Union	ORGANIZATION	side , this work will serve well ; but he who wishes to read understandingly of the fight for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	must go elsewhere for example , to Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	for a more comprehensive account .

Gabriel Weis	PERSON	of

Ravenna	LOCATION	,
May 27 , 1821	DATE	, is the following note : Mem .

		FIRST EDITIONS .

		A Subscriber I am a book lover , but not an accomplished collector .

		Will you please enlighten me as to the delight that some people experience in obtaining first editions , 1st : What is a `` first edition ? ''

		2nd : Why is it any more to be desired than any other edition ?

		Is the delight in a first edition purely sentimen - tal , or is there likely to be some change in text so that it is different from subsequent editions ?

		I suspect that such an inquiry will shock some of your readers , but further understand that knowl - edge is the beginning of progress .

		A first edition is the first publication of a book .

		It is more desirable than other editions because it is printed under the author 's supervision .

		The de - light in its possession is not purely sentimental .

		Often it is different from subsequent editions .

		Some first editions have been suppressed , for one reason or another , by the author .

		Hawthorne ,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	are among those who did not like certain things in some of their first editions .

		The highest price ever paid for a book was
$ 50,000	MONEY	, which
Henry E. Huntington	PERSON	gave for his copy of the first edition of the
Bible	LOCATION	, which he obtained at the

		362 THE WAR FOR DEMOCRACY .

		Liberty has her compensations , even if , at times , she suffers a temporary eclipse .

		Cer - tainly not since the days of
1848	DATE	have her prospects seemed so bright or so assured as in the present hour .

		The Russian Revolution , even if its full splendor take a half-century for its complete revelation , is yet des - tined to mark a great epoch in the history of government .

		For whatever its dangers and its defects , it is still a challenge to the forces of compulsion ; it is still evidence that the mind of man retains , even amid the ero - sion of despotism , the great impulse to be free .

		The entrance of
America	LOCATION	into the war is not otherwise to be interpreted .

		The in - terruption of her commercial intercourse with
Europe	LOCATION	is less the cause than the occasion of her challenge .

		That which she demands is essentially that no bounds be set to the prog - ress of democratic government save the in - evitable limitation of human organization .

		She has refused to accept as final that yearn - ing after domination which was the char - acteristic of a meaner age .

		She stands four-square against the power which , mistak - ing comfort for happiness , has proclaimed its right to turn its back upon the guarantees that three centuries of political advance have painfully evolved .

		Slowly and not exult - ingly , almost obstinately but yet with deci - sion ,
America	LOCATION	has taken this path .

		It is one from which inevitably there can be no return - ing .

		History , it is very clear , will justify this determination .

		The motives which have un - derlain this policy are in full accord with the ethos of American institutions .

		The world can not fight for its enfranchisement unless
America	LOCATION	bears her due share of the conflict ; for that is the condition of her political exis - tence .

		She came into being as a challenge to a country which had forgotten , or did not choose to remember , the watchwords of lib - erty , and posterity has justified her splendid defiance .

		She did not shrink from the horrors of civil war , that she might register her con - tinued faith in freedom .

		Once more a call 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	has been sounded .

		She could not do other - wise than make answer to that call .

		But there is laid upon her , as there is laid upon every nation arrayed in the conflict against German ambition , a duty from which there can be no shrinking .

		That the war will eventually be won , no one can now doubt .

		What essentially we need is a vigorous self - criticism as the basis of reconstruction .

		Politically , industrially , socially , intellect - ually , we must set our house in order .

		We live in an age of readjustment .

		We have to secure the translation of the old watchwords into the language of a new time .

		Liberty , equality , fraternity these are barren things unless they are given the richness of a content in economic life .

		They can mean nothing save a vague aspiration unless we secure beyond peradventure for each American citizen a minimum condition of civilized existence .

		This , after all , is the greatest gift
America	LOCATION	can bring to the world , for history is the record of the influence of compelling analogies .

		We have in theory a political democracy .

		But it is an academic commonplace that political power is the handmaid of economic power , and an industrial democracy of a certainty we do not possess .


America	LOCATION	, in truth , has been too often a con - tradiction in terms .

		If she has remained true in spirit to her origins , she has often failed to give them an adequate physical expression .

		We can not be contented so long as the greater part of our citizens are engaged , day by day and year by year , in fighting , not the problems of the mind , but the problems of the body .

		The only guarantee of democracy is educa - tion , and the penumbra of education is thought .

		It is a hard and terrible fact that the economic conditions of American civiliza - tion give to only few of us the leisure which alone makes thought possible .

		It is even more pitiable that those to whom , for the most part , we turn for leadership have devoted them - selves less to this fundamental problem than to the innumerable and detailed episodes of those more dramatic events which are rarely of permanent consequence to the body politic .

		Our political life has become divorced from our national life simply because its content has failed to strike home to the root of na - tional discontent .

		We can not live on our traditions .

		The centre of political impor - tance is neither in the past nor in the present , but in the future .

		The Republican party is no more justified to-day because it produced Lincoln and Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	than the Demo - cratic party because General
Jackson	PERSON	and Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	have given effective expression to its ultimate ideals .

		The supreme need of the nation is thought , and thought does not mean tabulation .

		We may multiply to infinity our committees ; we may make new ministries ; we may draft new constitutions .

		But none of these things will answer the one question which is behind our hopes and our fears .

		What do we mean to make of
America	LOCATION	?

		Can we be content with her until she means in form and in substance to the humblest of her citizens what she meant to those who brought her into being ?

		We realize
America	LOCATION	the more , the more we love her ; but the basis of patriotism is economic justice .

		Nor is this less true of our intellectual life .

		Turn where we will , there is in no profession in
America	LOCATION	to-day , with the single exception of the law , a man whose work is destined to permanent importance .

		We have authorities on the innumerable minutiae of tariffs , taxa - tion , municipal trading , labor unions , and upon them all we can write our well-equipped monographs .

		That however does not conceal the fact that economics has lost its hold on the life we live .

		It is the same with history ; it is the same with sociology , with fiction , and with criticism .

		Our scholars and our men of letters have failed to realize that there is a new spirit abroad , and that the worth of our efforts depends upon their appreciation of it .

		What answer have they to the challenge of the new time ?

		In the grim perspective of life this issue has now been set .

		We are still searching , as the men of
Athens	LOCATION	searched in the time of
Pericles	LOCATION	, the secret of happiness .

		We know now , as it was then so keenly grasped , that the secret of happiness is freedom .

		But free - dom means a fearless confidence in inquiry , an estimate of fundamental right and fun - damental wrong .

		It is to this choice that
America	LOCATION	has been called .

		Two thousand five hundred years ago the greatest of all histor - ians wrote down in imperishable words the secret of national strength .

		`` The bravest , '' he said , `` are surely those who have the clear - est vision of what is before them , glory and danger alike , and yet notwithstanding , go forth to meet it . ''

		That , in truth , can alone be the watchword of our effort .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 337 ROMANTICISM AND THE LITTLE THEATRES .


Edwin Bjorkman	PERSON	has expressed most con - veniently the essential difference between real - ism and romanticism .

		`` Observation and imagination , '' he says in his introduction to Lord
Dunsany	PERSON	's Plays , `` are the basic prin - ciples of all poetry .

		It is impossible to con - ceive a poetical work from which one of them is wholly absent ... But as a rule we find one of them predominating , and from this one-sided emphasis the poetry of a period derives its character as realistic or idealistic . ''

		This furnishes a handy test which may be applied to all creative arts .

		If we take it with us into the theatre , we find realism rampant .

		Not only are a vast majority of the best modern plays highly realistic in theme and treatment , but most of the stage settings and all of the acting also are inspired more by observation than by imagination .

		This is no .

		new condition . ''

		It has obtained in the drama since
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's in - fluence was first felt ; in stagecraft , since
Antoine	PERSON	opened his Theatre Libre in
1887	DATE	; in acting , since the passing away of the genera - tion of the elder Booth .

		The causes of this age of realism have often been analyzed , and forward-looking critics have long foretold its obvious result a strong romantic revival .

		And yet , that romantic revival merely re - mains `` overdue . ''

		Such a revival , at a time when the most vigorous literary artists are expressing them - selves in the drama , would have far-reaching effects .

		It would reach not only all litera - ture , but also all art and all philosophy .

		Any important influence for romanticism in the drama must therefore be significant .

		If , however , we take Mr.
Bjorkman	PERSON	's con - venient test with us into any of the Little Theatres that are springing up in most un - expected places all over the country , there we find romanticism in the ascendancy .

		Granting at the very outset that the imag - ination that inspires them is sometimes very childish , still there is no doubt that it pre - dominates over their observation .

		Komanti - cism is a salient characteristic of the
Little Theatres	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is , in fact , the one vital , fun - damental distinction between them and the commercial playhouses , for , from an artistic point of view , the other , more obvious dif - ferences are matters more of form than of spirit .

		Among modern dramatists there is no greater romanticist than
Lord Dunsany	PERSON	, and during the past season the Little Theatres have produced more plays by him than by any other single author .

		Seven of his highly imaginative dramas have been produced three by the Neighborhood Players in
New York	LOCATION	, three by the travelling Portmanteau Theatre , and one by the Arts and Grafters of
Detroit	LOCATION	; while the American rights to an eighth
Dunsany	ORGANIZATION	play are joyfully announced by the
Vagabond Players	ORGANIZATION	of
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		Not only is this great romanticist the Little The - atres ' most popular playwright , but
Oliphant	PERSON	Down 's pure fantasy , `` The Maker of Dreams , '' has been their most popular play .

		To my knowledge it has been produced by five dif - ferent companies , and I am certain my rec - ord is not complete .

		The most popular dramatist and the most popular play might , of course , be the excep - tions proving a very different rule , but they are not .

		Just as nearly as possible half of the offerings of the Little Theatres have been romantic plays and half , realistic .

		Directors of the intimate playhouses think a great deal about a `` well-balanced programme '' -LRB- one hopes that it will not become their fetish -RRB- , for a balanced programme is their one great concession to the box-office .

		But and this is significant they make this concession by means of the slice-of-life playlets .

		They are as romantic as they dare to be , and then , for the sake of their patrons , they become super-realistic for a little while .

		From the first those successful pioneers , the
Washington	LOCATION	Square Players , adopted this pol - icy of sandwiching romantic and realistic plays .

		They have produced such splendid realistic pieces as `` The
Sugar House	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` Trifles , '' and `` The Clod , '' and also such purely romantic plays as `` The Magical City , '' `` The Death of Tintagiles , '' and `` Bushido . ''

		Their best and most successful bill consisted of
Susan Glaspell	PERSON	's `` Trifles '' ;
Lawrence Langner	PERSON	's pseudo-realistic skit , `` Another Way Out '' ; the Japanese masterpiece , `` Bushido , '' and the whimsical satire `` Altru - ism , '' from the German of
Karl Ettlinger	PERSON	.

		No bill could be a better example of a thor - oughly well-balanced programme .

		The dedi - catory bill at the new Arts and Crafts Theatre 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	in
Detroit	LOCATION	consisted of Lord
Dunsany	PERSON	's `` The Tents of the Arabs , '' and `` The Wonder Hat '' by
Kenneth Sawyer Goodman	PERSON	and
Ben Hecht	PERSON	, while `` two realistic plays gave variety and balance to the bill . ''

		So confessed their own historian in `` The Theatre Arts Magazine . ''

		The opening bill given in Mr.
George B. McCallum	PERSON	's Little Theatre ,
Northampton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, by the amateur division of the famous municipal players , was
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	's grim tragedy ``
Lithuania	LOCATION	, '' followed by `` The Maker of Dreams . ''

		Because it travels ,
Stuart Walker	PERSON	's Portmanteau Theatre has a wider influence than any local organization , and , as one might expect from a director who is also the author of `` Six Who Pass while the Lentils Boil '' and `` The Lady of the Weep - ing Willow Tree , '' Mr.
Walker	PERSON	's offerings are mainly of romantic plays .

		On the first page of his programme he says frankly that `` the audience is not witnessing a spectacle which matches pennies with nature '' ; nevertheless , even he , writing to Lord Dunsany about '' The Tents of the Arabs , '' acknowledged , `` I have several plays of the type in preparation and I have to be careful not to attempt too many . ''

		The desire here is plainly to produce roman - tic plays , but the desire is tempered by a belief in the public 's desire for realism .


Stuart Walker	PERSON	here speaks for the producers of many
Little Theatres	ORGANIZATION	.

		Those who know them , know that they are almost without ex - ception strong romanticists .

		If an increasing number of the Little The - atres were not paying their own way out of .

		their box-office receipts , we should be very skeptical of their ability to influence the drama in any way .

		Much as the dramatic artist may deplore a box-office standard , suc - cess on the stage , before an audience gathered up from out of the general public , is the final , inevitable test of any dramatic work .

		However glorious the conception , however fine the execution , the `` play-that-does-not act '' is a literary mongrel .

		Sheer beauty or startling novelty can not justify any stage ef - fect of scenery or lighting .

		No charm of body or of voice , no imagination , no sympathy can make great that acting which does not convince the groundlings .

		If , forsaking their ideals , the Little Theatres become commer - cial ventures , they will throw away the bet - ter part of their possible influence upon the drama in
America	LOCATION	; but , in the fine first mean - ing of the word , the more popular they be - come , the more potent their influence will be .

		It is just because they are beginning to com - pete successfully with the commercial the - atres that we may be hopeful of their ability to make their influence felt .

		What that influence will be seems fairly obvious .

		Their daring experiments with new dramatic forms , new effects of stagecraft , new conceptions of acting would never be at - tempted upon a commercial stage .

		The very production of such a play as
Cloyd Head	ORGANIZATION	's `` Grotesques , '' given as it was given in the
Chicago	LOCATION	Little Theatre last season , is a rev - olutionary event .

		No practical stage man - ager would have dreamed of such a produc - tion , but managers of the commercial theatre are watching these brave experiments .

		Al - ready half convinced that there are after all certain stage conventions that make their boasted room with the fourth wall removed quite ridiculous beside the facile realism of the moving pictures , the more astute of the managers are rather inclined to be receptive of the new ideas .

		Echoes of the popular suc - cess of productions by such directors as Rein - hardt ,
Bakst	LOCATION	,
William Poel	PERSON	,
Granville Barker	PERSON	, and
Gordon Craig	PERSON	have reached them , and the box-office success of plays of the sugar - coated romantic type of `` Rebecca of Sunny - brook Farm '' and `` Daddy Long Legs '' is a humbler and more comprehensible sign of popular appreciation of romanticism .

		At first , they pooh-poohed at the Little Theatres ; then , they tried to damn them as `` highbrow '' ; recently , their dean ,
David Belasco	PERSON	, has writ - ten scathingly `` to defend the stage and to protest against those desecrators of its best traditions . ''

		He says that `` the toy play - houses have multiplied alarmingly '' a tacit admission that they are charming audiences away from Mr.
Belasco	PERSON	's own theatres .

		Upon these audiences the influence of the
Little Theatres	ORGANIZATION	is exerted in creating that plasticity of mind necessary for the reception of new artistic forms .

		The public is a splen - did conservative in art and a creature of habit in its amusements .

		Accordingly , the only stage uplift work that counts is to give the greatest possible number of people a kindly acquaintance with the new plays and the new stagecraft .

		In doing this very work ,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 339 and doing it well , the Little Theatres are pre - paring the way for a revival of romanticism .

		Already a score of new playwrights have made their bow before the curtains of the intimate playhouses .

		Few of them are to be found in '' Who 's Who '' ; but most of them are young , and several of them hold forth real promise for the future .

		The best of them are boldly romantic ; some of them may become leaders in the revolt against the sa - tiety of realism in modern drama .

		Signs that foretell this revolt are not lacking .

		Having sliced all life with a microtome the older dramatists tire of such dissection .

		The younger men , since good realistic themes are not so numerous as one might think , have difficulty in discovering new specimens , and the more robust of them refuse to hack over old material .

		Following
Rostand	PERSON	and
Mae	PERSON	- terlinck , continental dramatists , especially in
Germany	LOCATION	, have been displaying strong roman - tic tendencies .

		So vigorous a realist as
Hauptmann	PERSON	has returned in his two latest plays to his earlier romantic vein , and many young poets are avowed disciples of
Hugo von Hofmannsthal	PERSON	.

		When the Irish dramatic movement burst upon us in all the glory of
Yeats	PERSON	and
Synge	PERSON	, it seemed that the long - expected romantic revival had come ; but the Irish dramatists , save only
Lord Dunsany	LOCATION	, have become Irish melodramatists .

		There have been , however , flashes of romanticism from other English-writing dramatists .

		Bar - rie , a most practical playwright , is always an out-and-out romanticist .

		Even
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	has written `` Androcles and the Lion , '' and Gals - worthy , `` The Little Man . ''

		Such plays as
Knoblauch	PERSON	's `` Kismet , ''
Laurence House	PERSON	- man 's `` Prunella , ''
Edward Sheldon	PERSON	's `` The Garden of Paradise , ''
Charles Rann Ken	PERSON	- nedy 's `` The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and
Parker	PERSON	's `` Pomander Walk '' are decidedly ro - mantic in subject and treatment .

		Modern dramatists are bold and expectant .

		They do not know what the future holds for their art , but , confident in their strong posi - tion , they are not afraid to experiment .

		Judging from the past , the Great War will stimulate their feeling for the romantic .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, the Little Theatres are laboratories of dramatic experiment .

		There we may look most confidently for further and more virile expressions of romanticism .

		WILLIAMS
HAYNES	PERSON	.

		LITERARY AFFAIRS IN
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The event of the last few weeks has been the appearance of the two final volumes -LRB- XII , XIII -RRB- of the ``
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature . ''

		They cover the Victorian Age .

		Living writers are excluded from considera - tion , but all but the most recent of the dead come in .

		There is even a page -LRB- not sym - pathetic , it is true -RRB- about
Richard Middleton	PERSON	, a minor poet of whom , I suppose ,
America	LOCATION	has not heard much .

		He had a disappointing life and killed himself ; but the pathos of his career does not make his poems worth much attention .

		They are fluent , pretty jingles about stars , roses , and dreams .

		All the same the chapter on `` Lesser Poets , '' in which he is mentioned , is one of the best in the volumes .

		It is by Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	.

		That vivacious and indefatigable old man has read everything , remembers everything , does n't care a snap for anyone 's opinion but his own , and writes an English which , if often slipshod , is at least amusing and personal .

		Most of the other professors do not write at all .

		They have a common style : a soporific flow of dull , abstract words , journalistic cliches , and dead met - aphors , the deadness of which is not disguised by `` literary '' attempts to elaborate them .

		These men nearly all talk sense .

		They do not make wild , irresponsible judgments -LRB- though they are mostly unsafe and hesitating about very modern authors -RRB- , and occasionally Pro- fessor
Grierson	PERSON	's excellent analysis of
Tenny	PERSON	- son 's art is an example they are quite acute .

		But two chapters at a time are quite enough , unless one has just risen from a long and re - freshing sleep .

		The plan of allocating the various chapters to different scholars was perhaps the only possible one for a work of this size .

		It leads , however , to some deplorable unevenness of quality , and occasionally to comic divergences of opinion .

		Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, for in - stance , as good as calls two of his colleagues fools quite unconsciously .

		It leads also to accidental omissions where authors fall be - tween two stools .

		The authority who deals with Irish writers does not mention
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, thinking that somebody else is doing so .

		Nor does the expert on the drama .

		The result is that , though a few lines are given to
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's essays , his comedies are never men - tioned .

		`` Box and Cox , '' `` The
Colleen Bawn	PERSON	, '' and a hundred less important produc - tions of our gruesome Victorian stage are dis - cussed and labelled ; '' The Importance of Be - ing
Earnest	LOCATION	, '' the best light comedy since
Sheridan	PERSON	, escapes notice altogether .

		Omis - 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	sions like these might have been rectified by more vigilant editing , but nothing could have made all the contributors attach the same importance to dates , and biographical and bibliographical details .

		In other words , the `` History '' is only intermittently good as `` reading matter '' and imperfect as a work of reference .

		Still , it remains the best thing of the kind that has been done ; and however one may grumble about its deficiencies , one would see oneself hanged before giving away one 's copy as a wedding-present .

		Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	is shortly to publish through
Chatto	PERSON	and Windus a volume en - titled `` Books and Persons Being Comments on a Past Epoch , 1908-11 . ''

		The books will contain a selection from the causeries Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	contributed in those years to the `` New Age , '' a weekly Socialist journal which had , and has , the merit of allowing its con - tributors completely free speech .

		The ar - ticles appeared over the signature of
Jacob Tonson	PERSON	the name , I need scarcely say , was that of the biggest seventeenth-eighteenth cen - tury publisher ,
Dryden	PERSON	's publisher and I do not think that their authorship has ever been formally admitted until now .

		Until the secret leaked out all the publishers , journalists , and novelists were going about with mysterious smirks , ostensibly disclaiming , but in fact sug - gesting , that they knew the wanted man .

		He was obviously a professional author with con - siderable sales ; he obviously knew everybody and overheard everything ; and his chief pleasures were to prick large bubbles and to belabor inviting backs .

		One never knew who was going to get it next .

		The candor with which Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	dis - cussed the production of literature was the candor of the writer of `` The Truth about an Author . ''

		But , addicted as he was to `` frank exposures , '' he was equally preoccupied with booming unrecognized authors .

		Not all his campaigns succeeded .

		For instance his at - tempts to induce
England	LOCATION	to read
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	had little observable effect .

		But he did more for
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	's reputation than any other English critic , though
Conrad	PERSON	had his faithful few from the start .


Jacob Tonson	PERSON	started by saying
Conrad	PERSON	was a great novel - ist ; went on saying it ; and ended by hearing everyone else repeat it .

		He also , at a time when the `` American Maupassant '' -LRB- q. v. press -RRB- had never been heard of here , did his best for 0 .

		Henry .

		The boom did not come at once ; but Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	was right in think - ing it would come ; and now , six years after - ward , 0 .

		Henry is flooding the bookstalls .

		What the sales of
O. Henry	ORGANIZATION	in the past six months have been I do not know , but he has become almost as popular as
Jack London	PERSON	.

		Fruit importers , motor-car merchants , and captains of tramp steamers are reading him .

		Now his `` Life '' has been published , and an author of whom until recently half the lit - erary critics in
London	LOCATION	had never heard is a stock subject of dinner-table conversation .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	has finished his life of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, which will appear shortly .


Opin	PERSON	- ions have differed about Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's equip - ment , but even a hostile critic would scarcely dare to deny his exceptional gift for describ - ing what he has seen .

		You have only to look at his collected essays and compare the papers on old authors with those on modern ones , to see where his greatest power lies .

		The former are interesting , amusing , informative ; the latter are unique .

		He has a genius for portraiture , and anyone who wants to know what various nineteenth century writers
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	and Lord de Tabley , for instance were like in the flesh , can get no - where so good an idea of them as from Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's books .

		His most elaborate portrait was that of his father in `` Father and Son , '' one of the best books of our generation ; but there is the same subtlety of analysis , the same refusal to shirk the truth , the same eye for facial and mental expression in them all .

		His previous short study of
Swinburne	LOCATION	's person - ality gave one a foretaste of the `` life , '' and it could not have been bettered in its kind .

		The limits of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's art are indicated when one says that he usually fails to con - vince when he feels called upon to be en - thusiastic .

		It is impossible , if I may say so , to imagine him in a state of intoxication .

		He knew
Swinburne	PERSON	for over thirty years , con - sorted with him in the days before the poet retreated into the suburban respectability of
The Pines	LOCATION	,
Putney	LOCATION	, and the protecting clutches of Watts-Dunton , and has collected from various octogenarians reminiscences of
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	's childhood and school days at
Eton	LOCATION	.

		The papers in his possession include a number of posthumous poems , on which he is to read a paper this month before the Bib - liographical Society .

		In what state these unpublished
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		are , I do not know .

		But the conception of Swin - burne as a person who poured poetry out without revising it is unfounded .

		It is true that he could write anywhere and that he was known to scribble dithyrambics in a room full of voluble people ; but , like every other poet worth anything , he did systematically tinker with his work .

		Shelley is another per - son about whom this delusion of absolute spontaneity is cb.erish.ed in spite of the gaps and asterisks in his unfinished works .

		But
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 341
Shelley	PERSON	was one of the most painstaking ar - tists that ever lived and became more and more laborious with time .

		Mr.
Roger Ing	PERSON	- pen 's new volume , `` Shelley in
England	LOCATION	, '' which contains many new Shelley letters and some new biographical `` facts '' -LRB- for example , that
Ariel	ORGANIZATION	once wore the buskin at the Wind - sor Theatre -RRB- , contains also facsimile reproduc - tions of pages from the notebook which , with a Sophocles , was in his pocket when he was drowned .

		The volume , water-stained and sprinkled still with
Mediterranean	LOCATION	sand , is in the possession of the poet 's family ; it contains a draft of `` Adonais '' so complex with its dele - tions and substitutions that it is in places impossible to make it out .

		Mr.
Ingpen	PERSON	, by the way , gives a summary of the life of
Shel	PERSON	- ley 's son , Sir
Percy Florence Shelley	PERSON	, whom many people still living remember , since he did not die until
1889	DATE	.

		His was a blameless career .

		He went to
Harrow	LOCATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, studied for the law , succeeded to the estates and title , shone in private theatricals , and was a member of the
Royal Yacht Squadron	ORGANIZATION	, showing his devotion to his father 's memory by christening his yacht `` Queen Mab . ''

		He ended his days as a constant attendant at the
Bournemouth Baptist Chapel	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was the son of
Shelley	PERSON	and the grandson of
Godwin	PERSON	and
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	; his step-nephew , the grandson of
Shelley	PERSON	and
Harriet	PERSON	, became an Anglican clergyman .

		This is what Nemesis does when she really gets going .

		Other interesting relics which have recently been made public are a number of extracts from
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's notebooks , which an anonymous but easily identifiable writer contributes to the `` Dublin Beview . ''

		Thomp - son 's piles of penny exercise-books were al - most his only personal property .

		He wrote all his poems in them , and if any more puz - zling manuscripts exist I should like to see them .

		May I be preserved , however , from having to edit them .

		Thompson would begin one poem at the end of a book and another at the beginning , and let them cross in the middle ; he would sprinkle twenty variants of the same stanza , line , or word over several pages ; and he simply hated writing things in their correct order .

		I spent a day over one of these books recently .

		In the end I dug out a poem .

		It had twenty stanzas or so , and only two , the first two , were in their right places .

		The others were not only hig - gledy-piggledy , but included several du - plicates and failed to include one or two pas - sages necessary to the sequence .

		One admires his editor more than ever .

		Disentangling his script must have been like deciphering masses of imperfect cuneiform inscriptions ; except that working on
Thompson	PERSON	does lead one to beautiful discoveries , while the upshot of a perusal of cuneiform is usually something like this : `` Hookinosor the Great King Set me Up in the Year when ` he ... commanded his Satraps ... to .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE
WILLIAM VAUGHN	PERSON	MOODY LECTURES at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	began on
April 5th	DATE	, when
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	spoke on Shake - speare 's fools and then , in the course of some supplementary proceedings , read a few of his own poems and commented on them .

		A large audience listened with interest and docility to a set essay on `` The Spirit of Touchstone in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, ' ' applauding well-known lines spoken by
Touchstone	ORGANIZATION	himself , by
Feste	ORGANIZATION	, by the Fool in `` Lear , '' and by Hamlet in the matter of Yorick .

		It then listened with still more interest and no less docility to Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	's own verses and to his extemporized comments both on these and on some later poetical developments .

		He pointed out that his own product had rhyme , rhythm , `` mys - tery , '' and other qualities not always con - spicuous in the newer poetry .

		Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	, he thought , might range him among the Victorians .

		Well , he was a Victorian .

		And he appeared well enough satisfied to be so .

		His declaration , however , seemed super - fluous , for
Miss Monroe	ORGANIZATION	has already classified him in print ; besides , there was his verse to speak for itself .

		But a friendly audience ap - plauded his Victorian rhymes and measures and derided an extreme bit of free verse which he quoted to exhibit the more modern manner .

		His successors in the course will bring a different tone and manner : after an interval , Mr.
Stephen Leacock	PERSON	, of
McGill University	ORGANIZATION	, will speak on `` The Mutability of the Forms of Literature , '' and
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	, of the `` Nation , '' on `` Standards of Taste . ''

		AN ENGLISH TRIBUTE TO AN AMERICAN AUTHOR -LRB- for we must still claim
Henry James	PERSON	as an American , since he remained such , in a legal sense at least , almost to the end of his life -RRB- has taken the form of a noble and life - like bust from the hand of the gifted English sculptor , Mr.
Derwent	PERSON	Wood .

		Commissioned originally by the novelist 's friend , compa - triot , and fellow-artist in another field , Mr. 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
April	DATE	19
John Sargent	PERSON	, the bust , in marble , was pur - chased by the
Chantry	PERSON	trustees for the Na - tional Gallery of British Art .

		In bronze it was presented to the author himself , and in bronze too it is in Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's possession .

		And now , finally , through the liberality of one hundred and fifty English admirers of our great stylist , a bronze replica has been placed in the
Chelsea Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chelsea had been Mr.
James	PERSON	's home of late years , and there he had died ; there , accordingly , among so many other memorials of
Chelsea	ORGANIZATION	celebrities in literature and art , his lasting monument in bronze , by a
Chelsea	ORGANIZATION	sculptor , has been erected .

		Supported by an onyx column , the bust confronts all who enter the large refer - ence and reading room of the library .

		A suitable inscription outlines his life and work and indicates that the memorial is the offer - ing of `` 150 Chelsea Folk in
1917	DATE	. ''

		One can not drop the subject without at least refer - ring to Mr.
Wood	PERSON	's splendid work in remodel - ling and restoring the shattered features of soldiers disfigured in battle .

		With the in - spiration of an artist and the zeal of a lover of his fellow-man , he has wrought wonders in modelling human clay , in addition to his achievements in shaping inanimate dust .

		BANCROFT THE POET has long been forgot - ten , and Bancroft the historian will some day be but a name , as indeed to many intelligent persons he is already .

		A late number of `` Smith College Studies in History '' contains the letters exchanged between
Bancroft	PERSON	and
Sparks	PERSON	in the years 1823-32 , edited by Pro- fessor
John Spencer Bassett	PERSON	.

		A few prefa - tory pages give an outline of both
Bancroft	PERSON	's and
Sparks	PERSON	's literary and other activities up to the time of
Bancroft	LOCATION	's first contributions to `` The North American Review , '' of which his friend became owner and editor in
1823	DATE	.

		A year earlier
Bancroft	PERSON	had published a thin volume of verse , and soon after that he had sent to
Edward Everett	PERSON	, then editor of the `` Review , '' an article on
Schiller	PERSON	's minor poems , with original translations of some of them .

		It may have been these modest essays in metre and rhyme that prompted
Jared Sparks	PERSON	, when he became editor , to solicit fur - ther similar exercises from the young writer .

		We find him writing to
Bancroft	LOCATION	in
1829	DATE	: `` I enclose a modern Greek ode , which I shall be much obliged if you will amuse yourself with translating into English verse ... It is intended to come into an article on mod - ern Greek literature .

		It will be a good exer - cise for you some morning before breakfast . ''

		The task assigned may not have been so try - ing to a before-breakfast condition of mind and body as the reading of an ancient Greek tragedy , a performance to which few classical scholars of our time are equal ; but it was sufficiently formidable to elicit from
Bancroft	LOCATION	a request to be excused .

		This entire collec - tion of letters is good reading , with a wide range of literary and biographic interest .

		Two USES OF BOOK-REVIEWS are interesting because of their contrast .

		In many sales - catalogues and other lists of books there may be found brief critical and usually commend - atory notices of some or all of the books named .

		Librarians are fond of placing these short extracts from current reviews under the titles in their monthly or yearly lists of ac - cessions , both as an aid to the reader and as a justification of the purchase of the works in question .

		In the latest number of the `` Monthly Bulletin '' of the
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh	ORGANIZATION	, an extension of this practice is found in the generous extracts printed by themselves in the first part of the issue .

		To one of Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	's books are devoted seven fine-print pages from a leading review ; and other works are honored with consider - able selections from similar articles .

		But it seems to have been left to the newly appointed head of the
Newton	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Free Library to find another use for such quotations from expert criticism .

		He reports that `` criticisms of rejected books are now kept on cards so that the reasons why a new volume was ex - cluded may be ascertained at any time .

		Reference to this list has already proved its value . ''

		If , following the analogy of a familiar legal maxim , we accept the principle that all books are good until they are proved bad , this preservation of condemnatory tes - timony might prove more useful than the fil - ing of eulogistic estimates .

		THE SPREAD OF CULTURE , of the Teutonic brand now known the world over as
Kultur	LOCATION	, has led to the anomalous result of curtailing the diffusion of knowledge .

		Paper for print - ing becomes scarcer every day , entailing a lessened output of reading matter , at that at a higher price .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	, in order to economize ship tonnage and reserve its use for the material necessities of life , reduces the permissible importation of paper to one-half its previous annual amount , while books and periodicals are shut out altogether .

		Our bet - ter magazines , which enjoy a considerable circulation in
England	LOCATION	, will suffer sadly from this ruling , and many of our publishers and authors , who profit by the English demand
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 343 for their books , will find their revenue ap - preciably diminished .

		Nor will the embargo on unrestricted paper-importation into Eng - land profit us in
America	LOCATION	to any perceptible extent , since already the domestic demand is in excess of the domestic supply .

		MR.
DREISER	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The winsome , elephantine condemnation of
America	LOCATION	, her life and art , by Mr.
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	in the `` Seven Arts '' was almost amusing .

		It was for all the world like the effervescent talk of an elder brother , now returned to
Warsaw	LOCATION	, his native village , after a generation of exile in the city .

		Imagine him on a hoosier holiday accosting Little Brother , whom he left years before in the straitened precincts of a Catholic home in the heart of Puritan-ridden
America	LOCATION	.

		He ,
Big Brother	ORGANIZATION	, has breathed the freer airs of the metropolis .

		He is possessed with the idea that , while he has been breaking moulds of custom , Little Brother and
Warsaw	LOCATION	are still set in the frigid forms of Puri - tanism .

		We may conceive Theodore discoursing in this wise : `` Alas , alas for art in
America	LOCATION	, since you ,
Little Brother	ORGANIZATION	, do n't believe in birth control . ''

		`` But I do ,
Theodore	PERSON	, I do , and all
Warsaw	LOCATION	practises it . ''

		`` And American colleges are defunct . ''

		`` Even a few ` professors are beginning to sus - pect that . ''

		`` And there are no houses of prostitution in
Warsaw	LOCATION	. ''

		`` No , but the Ancient Woman plies her trade . ''

		`` And
Anthony Comstockism	PERSON	thrives . ''

		`` Only in little old
New York	LOCATION	.

		Even I have read `
Homo Sapiens	PERSON	/ and your ` Genius ' is dis - cussed by
Ethel	PERSON	and Grace at the high school . ''

		` And the nude , the nude . ''

		` Is never so alluring as when properly covered . ''

		` Women are too much respected . ''

		` But not always too respectable . ''

		` The constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	is an idealistic fiasco , framed to line the pockets of privilege . ''

		`` Why , so Beard remarked , I believe , before I kicked myself out of college . ''

		By this time
Theodore	PERSON	is frothy .

		`` Men still believe in God . ''

		`` It 's an ancient failing .

		Do they serve Him ? ''

		Thereupon Big Brother turns away in disgust at the puerile complacency of his provincial brother .

		Theodore has forgotten that , in this age of intercommunication , our lives and communities are inseparably tangled , and that the spirit of change is pervasive .


Warsaw	LOCATION	, too , has her broken moulds , and vibrates to the same iron string of revolution as
New York	LOCATION	.

		And so I was almost amused at the confidence with which Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	made himself the spokes - man of his provincial constituents , and announced his anti-Victorianism with the unction of novelty .

		I found myself , as Little Brother , in accord with nearly all he said , but I somehow could not accept its spirit .

		There are two underlying delusions in Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's condemnation .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	has been called an elemental force .

		He accepts the epithet .

		If there is any one belief shadowed in his works , it is the pagan belief in a `` vast compulsion which has nothing to do with the individual desires or tastes or impulses of indi - viduals . ''

		He reduces life to this force and to unguided inner desire .

		He desires to tear away illusions and make
America	LOCATION	see these elements only .

		Would he have society reorganized about these elements ?

		Does he mean society to be pagan by imitating the ruthless force ; should so - ciety be amorphous ; should the prostitute be hon - ored , made a public benefactor ?

		Would art ad - vance more rapidly under these than under pres - ent conditions ?

		And again , is it more natural to be polygamous than monogamous ?

		Were the greatest artists polygamous ?

		Is it elemental to regard the vast compulsion as a ruthless force ?

		The first delusion that I wish Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	had destroyed for us is the delusion that he is elemen - tal , therefore simple , therefore clear .

		As a mat - ter of fact , he is not elemental , but unutterably complex .

		He is so complex that he has been unable to guide his impulses into some clear , un - derstandable , workable scheme of action ; which is the office of genius , I take it .

		He blasts away -LRB- while all of us stand by and applaud -RRB- the old conventions , customs , and illusions which no longer need blasting , and he offers in their place what ?

		A fancied belief that he has found the elements of life in vast compulsion and unguided inner desire .

		I assert that the provincial masses of
America	LOCATION	, whom Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	derides , have come as near to finding the naked truths of life as he himself .

		The other delusion which is everywhere implied in Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's paper is that American art in particular American literature is inferior to European because it is different .

		I regret that Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	falls into this too-common error .

		He does well to rage against
England	ORGANIZATION	's intellectual colonization of
America Emerson	LOCATION	and
Lowell	PERSON	did that before him .

		But would he substitute Russian and German colonization ?

		He seems to think
Emerson	PERSON	inferior to his disciple
Nietzsche	PERSON	.

		He seems to think
William James	PERSON	inferior to
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer .

		By what standard can
Dreiser	PERSON	place
Nietzsche	PERSON	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	above
Emerson	LOCATION	and
James	PERSON	?

		By no standard but the European .

		Does
Dreiser	PERSON	, in his ardent Americanism , try
America	LOCATION	and find her wanting according to European standards alone ?

		There is no greater fallacy than to judge one race 's art by standards created from another race 's art .

		America 's art is too English ?

		Yes .

		But can
America	LOCATION	's art become American by adhering to German standards ?

		Art is a race 's unfolding from within , not a grafting of adventi - tious growths from without .

		Suppose
America	LOCATION	's genius were moral , and suppose the greatest art should be the art of morality , would Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	have the good grace to be chagrined ?

		344 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	ANOTHER GERMAN APOLOGIST .

		ENGLAND : Its Political Organisation and De - velopment and the War against
Germany	LOCATION	.

		By
Eduard Meyer	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Helene S. White	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	:
Bitter & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		This book on
England	LOCATION	was written
two years ago	DATE	, during the first half-year of the great war , but none the less it runs true to form as an exposition of the current German views on all those topics with which it deals .

		It was written during that season of immod - erate exasperation that followed on the defeat at the
Marne	ORGANIZATION	, and that has lasted since that time .

		That such a volume of unstinted dis - praise , growing out of that preposterous dis - appointment , should still continue to reflect the national sentiment to-day is significant of the fact that the great war was , in effect , brought to a decision in the
fall of 1914	DATE	, and that nothing has occurred since that time to alter or offset the miscarriage then suffered by the warlike enterprise on which the Ger - man hopes converged .

		The closing months of
1914	DATE	probably mark the largest and most shocking disappointment known to the history of mankind .

		So also the volume is significant of that distemper of the intellect which over - took the intellectual classes of
Germany	LOCATION	at that juncture , and which has lasted since that time .

		The book is unbalanced and intemper - ate in all its appraisal of
England	LOCATION	and the English , as well as of
Germany	LOCATION	and the Ger - mans .

		There speaks through it an animus of uncontrolled ferocity , as of a trapped animal ; and yet it is to be noted that in all this it runs true to form .

		What has just been noted in characteriza - tion of Professor
Meyer	PERSON	's book marks a serious blemish , of course , but when all this is said , it still remains true that it is a book of ex - ceptional value as a presentation of the material which it handles .

		Professor
Meyer	PERSON	commands a large and highly significant range of information and he controls his material with all that swift and sure touch that marks the master of his craft .

		He knows , or perhaps rather he is informed about , the
United King	ORGANIZATION	- dom and its people ^ and circumstances so in - timately and comprehensively that what he has to say about it all is charged with in - formation and suggestion even when the animus of the argument departs farthest from the conventions of well-bred scholarship .

		The author 's exuberant bias of antipathy is to be deprecated , of course , but its effects are not altogether unfortunate .

		It serves to throw up into a needed light many infirmities of the case which commonly escape notice at the hands of those writers who see the pertinent facts only in a haze of somewhat stale com - placency .

		There is very much , substantially the whole , of Part I `` The Character of the English State '' that British subjects as well as students of British institutions would do well to take to heart without material abatement , however tartly , not to say spitefully , it is presented .

		The author has a quick eye for the infirmities as well as for the foibles of the British administrative machinery and its quasi-aristocratic personnel , even though he does at times make too much of the formal data bearing on any given point and is apt to undervalue the part played by legal fiction and dead letter .

		The analysis and presenta - tion is unsparing , but all the more veracious , in what it has to say of biased upper-class mismanagement and sordid muddling of all those affairs that touch the interest of under - lying , outlying , and dependent classes and communities under British jurisdiction , and the author does not hesitate to speak openly of that management of national affairs for pecuniary gain which the gentlemen-investors who guide the ship of state are wont to cover with a decent make-believe of serving the com - mon good .

		Tacit or explicit , there runs through all the discussion a contrasting of these British phe - nomena with the corresponding German ways and means of doing things , and always the comparison falls out in favor of the German case .

		That it does so is due to a tacit assump - tion which serves as major premise to the argument at all points ; with a naivete char - acteristic of his kind , the author goes on an axiomatic assumption that dynastic aggran - dizement is more commendable and more to the public advantage than the pecuniary gain of such a class of gentlemen-investors as con - trols the fortunes of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the apprehension of any outsider , of course , there is not much to choose , as touches the common good , between the warlike aggran - dizement of an imperial dynasty and the un - earned increase of pecuniary benefits that accrues to a ruling class of gentlemen-in - vestors .

		The nearest approach to serving the common good that is made by either of these contrasted national establishments and na - tional policies is a make-believe backed with just so much of concession to the public needs as will serve to keep popular discontent from rising to the point of revolt ; the material difference being that the committee of gentle - men-investors who rule the commonwealth under parliamentary auspices are habitually constrained to concede something more , being more readily accountable to their underlying community .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 345 This paramount ideal of dynastic aggran - dizement that hallows all German politics and throws it into contrast with the corresponding British phenomena , is set forth to this effect : The most important and most deeply rooted differ - ence lies in the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	idea of the state as it has been developed in its relation to the central author - ity , the sovereign ; of this the English , or we will say , the people of
Great Britain	LOCATION	have no conception .

		To us the state is the most indispensable as well as the highest requisite to our earthly existence , not with regard to our political welfare alone , but to the daily life and activity of the individual as well , uniting , as it does , the entire population dwelling within the limits of its jurisdiction in wholesome activity for the general good ; we therefore believe it to be worthy of , as well as entitled to , the entire devotion of every citizen , in honorable effort to further its purposes .

		All individualistic endeavor , of which there is no lack with us too , as well as the aspirations of those shattered foreign nationalities that are included within the boundaries of our state , must be unre - servedly subordinated to this lofty claim ... The state is of much higher importance than anyone of these individualistic groups , and eventually is of in - finitely more value than the sum of all the individ - uals within its jurisdiction ... -LRB- pp. 29-30 -RRB- This conception of the state ... is quite foreign to English thought , and to that of
America	LOCATION	as well -LRB- p. 31 -RRB- .

		Quite logically , what has happened to the English constitution and to English sentiment since the Stuarts forfeited the despotic rights of the crown is viewed by Professor
Meyer	PERSON	as a record of national decay , -LRB- pp. 7-15 . -RRB-

		The purpose of all this analysis and exposi - tion is to be found in its bearing on the merits of the present conflict between the German coalition and the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Here , again , the argument runs true to form .

		There is the customary apparatus of innuendo and devout falsification , familiar enough in the dip - lomatic arguments on both sides ; and there is the old familiar Pharisaical whine that `` this war has been forced upon us , '' also shared equally by the two parties in con - troversy .

		But all that belongs in the domain of diplomacy rather than in historical inquiry .

		To anyone who can see the lie of the land in some degree of detachment , it should be suffi - ciently patent that both parties to the conflict are on the defensive and that the war has been '' forced upon '' both alike by the circumstances of the case .

		Both are on the defensive , very much after the fashion of the legendary two cats of
Kilkenny	LOCATION	, who were moved by the obsession that there was one too many .

		The situation is simple enough , in its elements , if one will only take a dispassionate view of it .

		There is no longer room in the modern world for both parties ; because the two parties em - body two incompatible variants of the modern civilization , and the world is rapidly becoming too narrow for more than one .

		It is not that there is no room for all the several warring peoples ; there is , in fact , increasingly easy room for all of them to find a livelihood by help of the increasingly efficient modern in - dustrial arts .

		But there is no room for Im - perial
Germany	LOCATION	and its subservient allies in the same world with the democratic common - wealths of the French and English-speaking peoples , and the war is to decide between them .

		It is a conflict of institutions rather than of peoples , and it involves the fortunes of these peoples only as they contend for the one or the other institutional scheme the dynastic monarchy or-the democratic common - wealth .

		Professor
Meyer	PERSON	's book includes a Fore - word in which he speaks of the position taken by the American administration toward the belligerents .

		Here , again , the argument , which runs on the now historical `` Lusitania Episode , '' runs true to form .

		It embodies the singular hallucination which appears to beset all apologists for the German case , that be - cause both are disallowed by law and custom , therefore interference with neutral trade is as heinous an offence as the unprovoked kill - ing of neutral citizens .

		It is true , of course , that trespass and manslaughter both are illegal , but in all English-speaking countries the latter is held to be much the more shock - ing crime of the two .

		It is a distinction of this kind between illegal detention and search on the one hand and piracy with man - slaughter on the other hand that is account - able for the different attitude of the American administration toward the British as con - trasted with the German irregularities ; and it is this difference that has finally thrown the forces of the American republic into the scale against German imperialism .

		And it is this difference that still continues to be invisible to the patriotic German historians .

		THE CONTEMPORARY SHORT STORY , a Practical Manual .

		By
Harry T. Baker	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Those of us who take an interest in literary history will remember how particular literary forms at times seize hold of a country : in
Elizabethan England	LOCATION	, it was the verse drama ; in the
eighteenth century	DATE	, it was the essay ; in
Scandinavia	LOCATION	of a generation ago , it was the drama again .

		At present
America	LOCATION	is in 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	the grip of the short-story so thoroughly in its grip indeed that , in addition to all the important writers , nearly all the literate pop - ulation who are not writing movie scenarios are writing or are about to write short-stories .

		One reason for this is the general belief that this highly sophisticated and subtle art is a means for making money in spare time , and so one finds everybody , from the man who solicits insurance to the barber who sells hair - tonics , engaged in writing , or in taking courses in the writing of short-stories .

		Judg - ing from what appears in the magazines , one imagines that they get their efforts accepted .

		There is no doubt that the butcher , the baker , and the candlestick-maker are easily capable of producing the current short-stories with the aids now afforded night-school courses in `` How to Write Stories '' and such manuals as the one listed above .

		In the work of the real writers of to-day the short-story as often as not shows itself in the disguise of free verse or polyphonic prose , in which attire it has perhaps made the greatest appeal of all .

		Witness the success of
Edgar Lee Masters	ORGANIZATION	,
Eobert Frost	ORGANIZATION	,
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, and others who , in addition to giving their read - ers poetry , present a story , a character , or a piece of life with brevity and intensity , which after all is what a short-story really does .

		Apart from these interesting experiments , the short-story in
America	LOCATION	is at a low ebb .

		Magazine editors will probably say the blame rests with their readers .

		This may be so , but do people really read the long , dreary stories of from five to nine thousand words which the average American magazine editor pub - lishes ?

		Why a vivid people like the Amer - ican should be so dusty and dull in their short-stories is a lasting puzzle to the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean , who knows that
America	LOCATION	has produced a large proportion of the great short-stories of the world .

		I am not sure that Mr.
Edward O'Brien	PERSON	's `` Best Short Stories of the Year '' will not contribute their own share to the progressive decline of the short-story in Amer - ica , for he is creating standards which a real criticism should resolutely reject .

		Most of all the short-story suffers from that blight which affects all creative art in Amer - ica the want of intellectual freedom a want which saps the energy and withers up all but the most valiant and violent of creative spir - its .

		In general the result of this want is a low self-esteem , combined with angry opposi - tion to any kind of criticism .

		The truth ap - pears to be that the sum of human freedom is the same in all countries , leaving out those under foreign oppression .

		Freedom takes dif - ferent forms .

		In
America	LOCATION	it is a riotous political liberty , which encourages people to stake everything on the happiness of the pass - ing day and nothing at all on the chance of immortality .

		Many of the great personalities that in other countries naturally go into the arts or into intellectual pursuits , here plunge into business , for they vaguely feel that their energies would only be dissipated in the struggle for intellectual freedom .

		Some , of course , valiantly take the road and fight their fight .

		Others desert their country altogether , and show the curious spectacle of Americans honored among the greatest of the English novelists , and the greatest of the European painters .

		To return to the book of American short - stories .

		Perhaps Mr.
` Brien	PERSON	took upon him - self a task beyond the power of any single human being , and perhaps he did it as well as anyone could .

		The stories may indeed be the best published during the year , but the result is not much to the credit of
America	LOCATION	.

		A nation 's literature is not judged by mod - erately good writing ; it is judged by the best ; and the most that one can say of these stories , with one exception , is that they are up to a fair standard .

		Of the stories included , Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	picks out three as the best of the year .

		Of two of these , `` Ma 's Pretties , '' by
Francis Buz	PERSON	- zell , and `` The Lost Phoebe , '' by
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	, he says : `` If an Englishman sought for what is most characteristically American in the fiction of the year I would point with considerable pride to these two stories . ''

		One can only take it that Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	is either unacquainted with
England	LOCATION	or with a type of English writing that has been extant for fifty or sixty years .

		Of all the stories in the book `` Ma 's Pretties '' is probably the one that would seem least American to an Englishman , for not only does it deal with a people and a life that have their exact prototypes in any part of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, but the treatment of the story is essentially English in manner .

		It is of the method that was made successful by
George Eliot	PERSON	, the characters arriving at an experience through the management of homely incidents in themselves somewhat in - significant .

		It has become a very common method in
England	LOCATION	and Mr.
Buzzell	PERSON	does not use it with any distinctive success , one reason being possibly that the talent he displays is obviously a novel-writing talent and not a short-story talent at all .

		It is a mistake to suppose that the short-story has much rela - tion to the novel ; its place is somewhere be - tween the drama and the essay .

		Mr.
Buzzell	PERSON	's story shows that he has the potentiality of writ - ing a novel unusual in American literature .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 347 The story by
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	has sora - ?

		resemblance in content to `` Ma 's Pretties . ''

		Its end deals with an old man recalling his wife as she was in her girlhood .

		Do old men really ever sentimentalize over their lost youth ?

		Or is it one of the compensations of living that they do not look back at all ?

		Whether Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's psychology is wrong or right , however , his style is execrable .

		The form is poor ; the story is as verbose as if the author were anxious to get in as many words as possible ; but it gives the reader the thrill of real literature , for there went into the mak - ing of it that combination of heart and brain which makes the total experience part of the reader 's consciousness .

		Frankly , it is the only story in the book of which one can say this .

		`` Making Port , '' the story which Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	selects as the best of the year , and which he compares with the work of
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	, has little to commend it .

		The author is not even a skilful follower of Conrad he does not give the atmosphere of the sea , nor does he realize his characters with certainty or completeness .

		Another highly praised writer ,
Fannie Hurst	ORGANIZATION	, really has an odd distinction .

		Read - ing her stories is like looking at an example of savage art in a museum .

		It is inarticulate , but it has a queer life .

		The story given here is in a form that is not the oldest , but the most primitive form in literature .

		In its garrulous talk and its rambling dialogue , it recalls the comic relief of the ancient dram - atists .

		Mr.
` Brien	PERSON	praises these and other writers in the book in terms of the utmost extrava - gance and in language that is often utterly meaningless .

		We can not lay the blame for the stories at his door , but he alone is to blame for the Introduction and the Critical Summary .

		He scoffs at what he calls `` formal criticism '' and then proceeds to deliver him - self of the copy-book maxims of the criticism of the last hundred years .

		What does he mean by a sentence such as this ?

		`` No substance is of importance in fiction unless it is organic substance . ''

		What is `` organic substance '' anyway ?

		He writes : `` I have set myself the task of disengaging the essential human qual - ities in our contemporary fiction which may be called a criticism of life ... He is a passionate observer of human nature and has given realism a new method of characteriza - tion whereby suggestion and dialogue are sub - stituted for descriptive statement . ''

		Could not Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	have spared us these tag - ends of criticism ?

		`` The Contemporary Short Story '' was writ - ten , as the author frankly owns , to teach promising young writers , whether in or out of college , how to write stories that shall be marketable as well as artistic .

		There is no harm in telling writers about the system of weights and measures that obtains in their markets .

		But Mr.
Baker	PERSON	's drawback is that he has only one market in mind the market represented by the American magazines that * pay highest .

		`` It pays , therefore , '' he writes , `` to find out in advance what American ed - itors dislike .

		Based upon years of experience , this dislike will generally be found to rep - resent accurately the feeling of the average subscriber . ''

		It may pay in terms of cash to know what the average subscriber dislikes , but any knowledge that makes for timidity of invention is a calamity for the short-story writer .

		And when Mr.
Baker	PERSON	shows the promising student that editors dislike `` mor - bidity '' and `` unpleasant features , '' and dis - counts
Poe	PERSON	's `` Ligeia '' and
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's `` With - out Benefit of Clergy , '' he is trying to cramp the student 's invention .

		`` The Contemporary Short Story '' might help to raise the level of work appearing in the cheaper popular magazines but it would still leave the standard the one fixed by the average for magazines having huge circulations that is to say , it would leave it a commercial standard .

		But what is required is another standard alto - gether , not the raising of the commercial standard .

		A few editors might be induced to consider what discriminating minds ap - prove of .

		And
America	LOCATION	still has two or three magazines that would give a chance to `` Ligeia , '' although it is morbid , and to `` With - out Benefit of Clergy , '' although it deals with the `` unpleasant feature '' of an Aryan man of
Europe	LOCATION	marrying an Aryan maid of
India	LOCATION	.

		A few magazine editors could do a great deal to raise the level of the American short - story .

		They could at once eradicate two of the things that cause a part of the evil the wordiness and the commercial standarization of the story .

		By declining short-stories over three thousand words long and by refusing to pay more than a hundred dollars for any short-story , they could create a new standard and raise both the prestige of the short-story and of their magazines .

		They would then get the imaginative writers , and not the ex - ploiters of a commercial article .

		There is no reason why short-story writers in their style of living should go into competition with colored boxers and movie-actors .

		The com - piler of the `` Best Short Stories '' could help .

		By including in each yearly volume one of the great American short-stories one by
Poe	PERSON	, by
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, by
Bret Harte	PERSON	, or by
Henry James	PERSON	he would give a revelation that would be worth much criticism .

		Had he lived to see the publication of `` Creative Intelligence , '' a joint attack by eight pragmatists upon the received phil - osophical tradition , and a cooperative venture in the articulation of a new philosophy , he might have admitted his mistake .

		He might even have begun to fear for the Kantian dynasty , and have conceded at least the pos - sibility of philosophic rule crossing the seas and becoming democratic .

		For I take it for granted that he could not have dismissed `` Creative Intelligence , '' as he had other prag - matic literature , with an indulgent smile and a sally of wit .

		The assumption may be quite unwarranted .

		Possibly it is merely a reflection from the militant spirit of the eight authors .

		A phil - osophy of the saddle , galloping to solutions in daredevil fashion , waving its sombrero de - fiantly at traditional landmarks , is infectious .

		I shall , however , make no effort to establish the validity of the assumption .

		Nor would it be in place to attempt a defence of Prag - matism ; to undertake to show that it is more than a passing craze in the history of thought .

		It would not be difficult to show that this latest expression of the pragmatic movement is not just another book , or at best a volume which concerns a small professional group , but is , on the contrary , a document of vital interest to intelligent men and women gen - erally .

		The orthodox course in philosophy is a drama in three acts .

		In the first act the student is kidnapped by the professor and imprisoned in a cave .

		Communication with anything or anybody outside is demonstrated by the captor to be quite impossible .

		Between the student and the world he lately occupied obtrudes the impassable wall of subjectivity .

		With the aid of the bull 's eye supplied by the professor , every recess of the den is searched , but absolutely no way of escape is found .

		All this so-solid earth turns out to be '' appear - ance . ''

		Properly chastened , the novice is ready for the next step .

		The second act is given over to the dram - atic rescue of the prisoner .

		The professor and a few accomplices know of a subterranean passage !

		Through this they lead the way out of the cave .

		But , alas , there is no joy in the new freedom , for the world into which the student is released is not a living , appealing world .

		It is to the green earth whence he was snatched as paper flowers are to the rose .

		Hereupon follows the third act , in which the student gradually awakes .

		He discovers that there has been no real kidnapping and consequently no rescue ; that nothing indeed has happened , excepting that his credulity has been imposed upon .

		The conclusion of the drama depends upon the individual student 's sense of humor , but , at all events , there comes to be a hollow sound to the phrase , `` Philos - ophy , the guide of life . ''

		Against philosophy thus conceived as devo - tion to problems which no longer represent genuine and vital issues , this volume is a vig - orous and sustained protest .

		By precept and by example , it proposes the recovery of phil - osophy from `` chewing a historic cud long since reduced to woody fibre , or an apologetics for lost causes -LRB- lost to natural science -RRB- , or a scholastic , schematic formalism , '' and the transference of attention to questions which agitate contemporary life .

		Such a challenge is certain to receive wide endorsement and more especially from think - ing youth , which in unusually large numbers has been turning to philosophy for the light that has failed elsewhere .

		Living in an age which is obviously one of profound trans - formation , self-conscious as perhaps never be - fore , aspiring to take a worthy part in the inevitable readjustment of values , serious - minded men and women seek to know , as Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	says , `` what modifications and abandonments of intellectual inheritance are required by the newer industrial , political , and scientific movements .

		They want to know what these newer movements mean when translated into general ideas . ''

		If philosophy refuses to speak at this vital juncture , so much the worse for philosophy .

		`` Unless philosophy can mobilize itself sufficiently in this clarifica - tion and reduction of men 's thoughts , it is likely to get more and more sidetracked from the main currents of contemporary life . ''

		But also so much the worse for life .

		`` Philos - ophy is vision , imagination , and reflection . ''

		And while '' these functions apart from action , modify nothing and hence resolve nothing , '' still `` in a complicated and perverse world , ''
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 349 says Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	, `` action which is not in - formed with vision , imagination , and reflec - tion , is more likely to increase confusion and conflict than to straighten things out . ''

		We need then a recovery of philosophy .

		And philosophy recovers itself `` when it ceases to be a device for dealing with the problems of philosophers and becomes a method , cultivated by philosophers , for dealing with the problems of men . ''

		The words have the right ring , but what do they mean ?

		What is meant by defining philosophy as `` a method , cultivated by phi - losophers , for dealing with the problems of men '' ?

		Is the philosopher in possession of a unique and superior method -LRB- in the everyday sense of the word -RRB- of solving problems al - ready dealt with by scientists , politicians , edu - cators , plumbers , dressmakers , and whom not ?

		Or does the term `` method '' rather have refer - ence to the working presuppositions adopted , the questions ruled out as dead issues and the problems thought worthy of consideration ?

		If so , is the task of philosophy limited merely to the translation of contemporary problems into the form of general ideas , or is it the aim of the philosopher to arrive at a solution , and one not obtainable under the limitations of spe - cialized investigation ?

		If the latter , is the test of correctness of method found in the nature of the conclusion ?

		that is to say , in so far as `` philosophy ... becomes a method , cul - tivated by philosophers , for dealing with the problems of men , '' do philosophical idealism and realism disappear ?

		I confess that I found myself saying `` yes '' and `` no '' to all these questions .

		The point is not of slight importance , espe - cially in the case of a philosophy like
Pragma	PERSON	- tism , which is in perpetual danger of vitiation through adoption as a popular intellect - ual fad .

		If the rumor is correct that the joint authors were unable to agree on a plat - form of principles , we can not blame them for declining to proffer such a platform , but one may , with good grace , refuse to accept as a substitute such indefinite and ambiguous statements as the following : The consensus presented lies primarily in outlook , in conviction of what is most likely to be fruitful in method of approach .

		As the title page suggests , the volume presents a unity in attitude rather than an uniformity in results .

		For such statements veil the fact that `` unity in attitude '' is agreement in certain beliefs ; that there is no unity in attitude uberhaupt .

		I may be wrong , but at all events , I am con - vinced that if the eight authors had not de - liberately refused to decide what exactly the `` unity in attitude '' amounted to before they endeavored `` to embody the common attitude in application to specific fields of inquiry which have been historically associated with philosophy , '' the book would not have ap - peared as it stands .

		It is , nevertheless , as a cooperative endeavor in the interest of a common conviction that the volume is significant .

		And this common conviction is that the `` courageously inventive individual as the bearer of a .

		creatively em - ployed mind , '' does in a genuine sense deter - mine the quality of future experience .

		The various chapters of the book are intended as demonstrations of this truth in the fields of philosophy , logic , mathematics , science , psy - chology , economics , morality , aesthetics , and religion .

		Everywhere the fixed , static , me - chanical conception of the subject is chal - lenged and a developing , evolving , enlarging conception substituted for it .

		The goal of life is not mechanical efficiency but `` the use of intelligence to liberate and liberalize ac - tion . ''

		Thus , philosophy is not the art of solving puzzles once and for all given as the philosophical problems .

		It is mind function - ing comprehensively but characteristically , projecting new and more complex ends thus freeing man at once from routine and from caprice .

		-LRB- Chapter One , Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	. -RRB-

		So too , man 's striving for `` economic goods '' is not a search for the greatest total of what is eternally satisfactory , but a pushing on to new forms of satisfaction .

		`` It is not a desire for recurrent satisfactions of a determinate type , but an interest in the active develop - ment of inexperienced and indeterminate pos - sibilities . ''

		-LRB- Chapter Six , Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	. -RRB-

		In the same way , the moral life does not consist in conforming to unalterable standards some - how established .

		`` The process of moral de - liberation , evaluation , judgment , and choice is itself essential .

		In this process are born the concepts and standards good and right , and likewise the moral self which utters the judgment . ''

		Both the objects considered and the moral self are enlarged when conflicting values are weighed against one another in the moral situation .

		It is literally a new self in a new world that delivers the moral judgment .

		-LRB- Chapter Seven , Mr.
Tufts	PERSON	. -RRB-

		Space permit - ting , the remaining chapters would yield sim - ilar results .

		A timely message , this .

		There is much in these days to encourage the belief that man is helpless in the fell grip of circumstance or at the mercy of a blind will to live .

		The doctrine of predestination did not die ; it changed its skin ; it became godless .

		Here is a 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	philosophy that dares to attack mechanism , dares to assert that mind is not a helpless spectator of events but a creator of them .

		All the more one must regret that the mean - ing of this important term is not made more clear .

		In the first chapter , creative intelli - gence is the function of forecasting `` what is desirable and undesirable in future possibil - ities , and contriving ingeniously in behalf of imagined good . ''

		Man does not act in a vacuum , but in an environment of auspicious and menacing changes .

		Participate he must , and to his weal or woe .

		`` The secret of suc - cess '' says Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	, '' that is , of the great - est attainable success is for the organic response to cast in its lot with present auspic - ious changes to strengthen them and thus to avert the consequences flowing from occur - rences of ill-omen . ''

		And this `` use of the given or finished to anticipate the consequence of processes going on , '' is what is meant by creative intelligence .

		I do not understand creative intelligence to mean the same thing in the sixth chapter .

		There Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	undertakes to show that the generally accepted economic theory , namely , that the desire for economic goods is a search for the largest sum of pleasure , is not true .

		The acceptance of new commodities , commod - ities the satisfaction-value of which is un - known , proves that men do actually move from one level of satisfaction to another .

		`` For the egoism of man , '' he pertinently says , `` is no fixed and unalterable fact . ''

		Life is not a matter of accounting , of balancing the known satisfaction of the new commodity against the known satisfaction to be replaced by it .

		The comparison is constructive , cre - ative , resulting in a changed level of interest and experience .

		The novelty of things ap - peals as novelty , and a `` spontaneous con - structive interest stands more or less con - stantly ready in us to go out to meet it and possess it . ''

		Perhaps all this sounds much like the cre - ative intelligence of the first chapter .

		But when read with other passages the identity is far from certain , for the progress from one standard of life to another appears then to be the result of a half - blind push or pull from without .

		`` From some source beyond the scope and nature of the earlier function a suggestion or an impulsion has come by which the agent has endeavored to move for - ward . ''

		There `` is a certain original bent or constitutive character of human nature a predisposition , an elan vital perhaps , which we must recognize as nothing less than per - fectly general and comprehensive finding ex - pression in inventive life and likewise in the readiness with which the individual meets a new commodity half way and gives it op - portunity to become for him , if it can , a new necessity and the source of a new type of satisfaction . ''

		For Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	, the exercise of creative intelligence means , `` to imagine a future which is the projection of the desirable in the present , and to invent the instrumental - ities of its realization '' ; for Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	, it means being urged into an unknown future , albeit excited and hopeful , and in retrospect to pronounce the new state on the whole better than the old .

		It would be interesting to compare the cre - ative intelligences just considered with others to be found in the book for example , with the creative intelligence Mr.
Brown	PERSON	finds at work in the field of mathematics , which ap - pears to be of a third species .

		But for fear that the criticism may be interpreted as a desire for mere verbal consistency , I return to Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	for a moment .

		In my judgment , he completely fails to cross swords with the economic theory he combats , and he fails just because his use of creative intelligence is not Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	's .

		His whole discussion of changes in labor conditions is individualistic .

		In a given labor market , the least capable pro- ducers could make both ends meet at the prevailing price only by ignoring all but the severely impersonal aspects of the process .

		Taking these costs as a base , other more capable or more fortunate producers may have been able to make additional expenditures of the sort in question , charging these perhaps to `` welfare '' account .

		The law then intervenes , mak - ing labor in effect more expensive for all ... The old basic labor cost thus becomes obsolete .

		Granting that such a procedure illustrates creative intelligence , what economist would agree to recognize it as a typical example ?

		Even the plain man has heard too much of collective bargaining , of collective coercion , to accept such an interpretation of a change in conditions of labor .

		The `` economic interpre - tation '' does not hold that the individual life of So and So is determined by economic in - terests , but that the mass of men is so moved , and Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	nowhere attempts to show that collective coercion is constructive com - parison .

		I think he would have tried to do so , and perhaps have succeeded in doing so , had he defined creative intelligence as it is found in the first chapter .

		The very attempt would have added to the value of a very sug - gestive chapter .

		That the meaning of intelligence is a living philosophical problem is shown by Mr.
Bode	PERSON	's chapter on the nature of consciousness .

		In the light of the wide interest in psychology ,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 351 the layman will : be surprised to learn that psychology is in danger of going into bank - ruptcy .

		The discussion is of too technical a character for consideration here , but the gist of it is that , unless the study of behavior is substituted for introspection , psychology must give up all claim to being a science .

		But when consciousness is regarded as a form of behavior , it differs from other forms in that it is essentially experimental .

		All conscious situations are situations in which `` the pos - sibilities of a subsequent moment are em - bodied in them as a positive quality . ''

		I am compelled to leave this tempting chapter with - out saying more because I can not say enough .

		But those who seek an argument for the be - havioristic concept of creative intelligence , presented with an honest recognition of diffi - culties to be met and an appreciation of the snares of language , will find it in this thought - ful study .

		If other chapters must be even more briefly noticed , this is to carry no implications re - garding their value .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's `` Reforma - tion of Logic '' is a difficult polemic addressed to the profession , while the intelligent reader will find Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's `` Intelligence and Math - ematics '' an interesting treatment of a sub - ject which in most hands would have turned out far otherwise .

		I regret most of all the necessity of omitting a criticism of Mr.
Mead	PERSON	's illuminating paper on scientific method .

		The privilege of reading a philosophical discussion based on breadth of information and at once profound and original in thought , catholic in spirit , and clear in presentation is rare indeed .

		It should serve as an antidote to the muddle - headed obscurantism which of late has shown more and more of a tendency to call science to account , and it should serve likewise to check the arrogance of those whom a little science has rendered blind to the unknown vast .

		Imagine a rocket shot into the
night	TIME	, there bursting into a tapestry of rich , scintillating color .

		Imagine the sparkling fabric to vibrate , showing now one charming pictorial form and now another , illuminating the face of the beholder and lifting up his soul .

		Im - agine the spectacle suddenly to go out , leaving you with a beautiful memory and a new sense of darkness .

		You have my experience in reading the last chapter of `` Creative
Intel	ORGANIZATION	- ligence . ''

		Mr.
Kallen	PERSON	's intention is to distinguish be - tween philosophy , art , and religion as regards the relation of value and existence .

		There is a resemblance and a difference : they agree in being dissatisfied with things as they are ; they differ in what they propose to do about it .

		In philosophy and religion , the mind confronts the experiences of death and obstruction , of manifoldness , change and materiality , and denies them , as
Peter	PERSON	denied Jesus .

		The visible world , being not as we want it , we imagine an unseen one that satisfies our want , declaring the visible one an illusion by its side .

		So we work a radical sub - stitution of desiderates for actualities , of ideals for facts , of values for existences .

		In art , on the other hand , and only in art , we have the acknowledgment of an actual re - lation between these contrasting pairs , such that values get themselves realized in exis - tence .

		Art alone operates as in fact to convert their oppugnance into identity .

		Intrinsically , its whole purpose and technique consists of transmutation of values into existences , in the incarnation , the realiza - tion of values .

		Or , in a word , `` philosophy imaginatively abolishes existence in behalf of value , art realizes value in existence , religion tends to control and to escape the environment which exists by means of the environment which is postulated . ''

		These citations , however , represent an over - simplification of the chapter , and there 's the rub .

		Through the recognition that compen - satory ideals grow out of concrete life and react upon it , the author blurs the distinc - tion carefully set up between art on the one hand and philosophy and religion on the other .

		The roots of philosophy as of religion `` reach deep in the soil of events , '' and its issues have `` fruitage in events made over by its being . ''

		Moreover , under a careful read - ing of the various definitions found in the chapter , philosophy and religion tend to fuse , and the illustrations offered testify to the union .

		On one page , for example ,
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	is a religion , on another it is a philos - ophy ; while Christianity is `` philosophy oper - ating as a religion . ''

		I do n't know why Mr.
Kallen	PERSON	should hold to his meanings if he does not want to , and I am not saying that he should want to .

		But as long as he finds it fun to play hide and seek in the manner of this chapter , he makes it easy for the reader to carry off a phrase and leave the message .

		Mr.
Kallen	PERSON	has a message to deliver a message indicative of insight , originality , and courage .

		Why should we not have it ?

		And so it becomes difficult , once more , to discover just what the pragmatic movement implies .

		Possibly the difference between philosophy , religion , and art is to be found not in the espousal or rejection of compensatory ideals , nor in the presence or absence of an ambition to see life transformed , but rather in the nature of the compensatory 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	ideals believed in and the proposed method of their realization .

		In that case the difference between Plato and Pragmatism would be just that kind of difference .

		By neglecting any such possibility , by arguing on the assumption that compensatory ideals are necessarily transcendental , by thinking of the relation of life and compensatory ideals as static , by speaking for and against them as forces trans - formative of life , the real issue namely , what he conceives to be the bearing of philosophy , religion , and art upon contemporary living problems is clouded and confused .

		In the light of the widespread appeal which religion has been making to the `` pragmatic attitude , '' ambiguity at this point is regret - table .

		Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	refers to the fact that pragmatic philosophy has been `` thought to provide a new species of sanctions , a new mode of apologetics , for certain religious ideas whose standing has been threatened . ''

		But we are left to guess whether the hope was a vain hope .

		In the chapter on the moral life , Mr.
Tufts	PERSON	bows politely to religion , but the thing happens so suddenly that one is uncer - tain whether the greeting was purely formal or a sign of friendliness .

		I am not , of course , ' insisting that Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	and Mr.
Tufts	PERSON	should have expressed themselves on the ques - tion of religion ; they had other things to do .

		I am recording the fact that the rest of the book does not remove the uncertainty with which I leave Mr.
Kallen	PERSON	's discussion .

		And if the apostles of clearness are willing to be unclear , where shall we turn in our confu - sion ?

		The last pages of the book return to its opening thought : the recovery of philosophy .

		The plea for philosophy as `` a program to execute rather than a metaphysic to rest in '' is the right word , unless it is merely another expression of the prevalent nervousness to `` make good . ''

		Philosophy may bake no bread and escape just criticism , but we have a right to demand the assistance of her vision in our effort to refashion the ordinary weeds of life into a dress more becoming to life 's dignity and worth .

		Keeping this demand before us , the study of the philosophers will cease to be a trip through a menagerie of intellectual freaks , and will become instead an adventure in discovery the discovery of the rise and evolution of the dominant concepts and pre - suppositions of our time .

		So used , philosophy , as
William James	PERSON	said , `` rouses us from our native dogmatic slumber and breaks up our caked prejudices . ''

		A new vision then be - comes possible .

		There is no other poet writing in English to-day who can compare with
James Stephens	PERSON	, at his best , for sheer power and purity of lyric speech .

		He is a born singer , gifted with the voice , as well as with the vision , of the essential poet , singing as the lark sings , or the linnet , spontaneously , impulsively ; and , in his longer , more sustained flights , like `` A Prelude and a Song , '' he soars skyward in ascending circles , drenching the air with his delicious music .

		Add to this strictly phys - ical endowment for how does the poet 's voice differ in mechanism from that of any other singer ?

		the richness and range of his imaginative expression , enabling him to pass from the grandiose to the grotesque and back again often , indeed , to combine the two in happy strokes of naive audacity that bring Deity itself into intimate , familiar contact with the homeliest aspects of life , the humblest powers of human conception .

		Add also an extraordinary variety of philosophic mood and temper , turning with lightning thrust from tenderness to indignation , from pity and commiseration to harsh , biting wit , and sav - age , sardonic humor to childish cruelty , even , when his deep-seated demand for beauty is thwarted by some spectacle of ugliness .

		Add , finally , his profound Celtic sensitive - ness to the fresh spiritual charm and glamour of nature his fondness , amounting to adora - tion , for trees , brooks , rivers , birds , hedges , flowers , clouds , hills , sky , the green earth and one will begin to have some perception of the significance of
James Stephens	PERSON	poet , seer , rhapsode , cosmic humorist .


Blake	PERSON	,
Shel	PERSON	- ley , the Elizabethans he is akin to all these , and all have their share in him as lover of man , lover of the soul , lover of liberty , lover of love and loveliness .

		It would be too much to expect to find in poems of the precise character of those that compose Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	's latest book , `` Green Branches , '' commemorative poems of an elegiac rather than of a pure lyric cast or inspiration all the qualities we have enu - merated , a complete display of his poetic range and power .

		No poet depends more upon utter freedom of impulse and inspira - tion ; and even in such a poem as `` Spring in
Ireland	LOCATION	:
1916	DATE	, '' where his sympathy is so
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 353 clearly stirred to its depths by the fate of the young leaders of the
Dublin	LOCATION	insurrec - tion , there is felt the constraint imposed upon him by the formal requirements of the sub - ject the pattern set for one whose gift is essentially that of improvisation .

		But if we miss much that we are in the habit of look - ing for in his work the humor , the whim - sicality , the vision that visualizes the most remote tracts of time and space , and , above all , the amazing quality of his mind we find , on the other hand , in high degree , cer - tain other traits that we have come to regard as characteristic , such as his passionate love and observation of nature , and the peculiar fluting timbre of his voice .

		The voice , here , in particular , is of a purity and perfection that has seldom , if ever , been surpassed in any earlier work : and those who found in `` A Prelude and a Song '' that prothalamion of the poet soul in its nuptial flight toward the upper regions of innocent joy and ecstasy , with the meditative music of its sylvan re - frain : Arouse , arouse , Among the leaves I sing my pleasant song a haunting memory of Spenser and the Golden Age , will recover this once more in such lines as the following , whose mood and mode surely no other English lyrist of our day could compass , with equal power of ten - der and magical suggestion : Fragrance and beauty come in with the green , The ragged bushes put on sweet attire , The birds forget how chill the airs have been , The clouds bloom out again and move in fire ; Blue is the dawn of day , calm is the lake , And merry sounds are fitful in the morn ; In covert deep the young blackbirds awake , They shake their wings and sing upon the morn .

		By nature much more highly gifted than Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	who , only through the subtlest sophistications of his profoundly refined and sophisticated art , could , even in his youth , achieve the fine , careless effect of complete lyric abandonment , Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	must now stand unchallenged as the leading poetic representative of
Ireland	LOCATION	to-day .

		This is par - ticularly true since Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	has assumed new `` responsibilities '' in his verse , which has become the vehicle , of his dreams no longer , but of his reflections .

		MacDonagh ,
Plunkett	PERSON	, and
Pearse	PERSON	, whose tragic deaths have given them a poetic prestige that their work itself , subjected to any serious critical - test , would scarcely warrant , could hardly have hoped to rival , had they lived , the author of `` Songs from the Clay '' and `` The Hill of Vision . ''

		Indeed , we can think of no other contempo - rary Irish poet who may , for a moment , be mentioned with either Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	or Mr.
Ste	PERSON	- phens , unless possibly it be Mr.
Padraic Colum	PERSON	, and he is of a very different cast and calibre from these two .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, at his best , is or was a heroic poet , the heroic poet of
Ireland	LOCATION	in our day , reviving the legendary material of the past and extracting new sym - bolic significance from it for the present .

		Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	, through all the fibre of his lyric spirit , is a philosophical poet , and Irish , on the whole , only in the externals of his style .

		Mr.
Colum	PERSON	, on the other hand , is preeminently a popular poet , deriving his surest inspiration from the life of the Irish people to-day , but frequently lifting this local material to a level of general human significance , through his ability to invest it with a note of ideal beauty and tenderness .

		There are numerous exam - ples of this power in his recent book , `` Wild Earth and Other Poems , '' but nowhere else , perhaps , is it seen quite so successfully dis - played , as in `` A Cradle Song , '' which has already begun to find its predestined way into anthologies .

		Mr.
Colum	PERSON	is very happy , too , in his adaptations from the Irish , as in the piece entitled `` I Shall Not Die for Thee '' a curiously close Celtic equivalent of Wither 's famous `` Shall I Wasting in Despair ? ''

		It begins : woman , shapely as the swan , On your account shall I not die : The men you 've claimed a trivial clan Were less than I. 1 ask me shall I die for these For blossom-teeth and scarlet lips ?

		And shall that delicate swan shape Bring my eclipse ?

		Well-shaped the breasts and smooth the skin , The cheeks are fair , the tresses free And yet I shall not suffer death God over me .

		I also like the neatly turned portrait of `` A Poor Scholar of the Forties '' : My eyelids red and heavy are , With bending o ` er the smould ` ring peat .

		I know the ^ Eneid now by heart , My
Virgil	PERSON	read in cold and heat , In loneliness and hunger smart .

		And I know Homer , too , I ween , As other poets know
Ossian	PERSON	.

		Not at all neat on the contrary , quite ostentatiously careless and dishevelled in a manner that borrows much from the old Byronic mood of the past is the portrait that Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	, poet and novelist , paints of himself , nearly full-length , in his new book , `` Amores . ''

		Here the objective artist 's trained powers of analysis are brought sharply to bear upon his own subjective ex - periences , in what tends at times to become almost an agony of scrupulous self-revela - tion .

		The title of the book may prove some - what misleading , so I hasten to say that it is not of women alone that this poet is `` amor - 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	ous , ' - but of life itself , and of every sensa - tion it can afford him even such a sensation as sheer physical contact with the outside of books : I can always linger over the huddled books on the stalls , Always gladden my amorous fingers with the touch of their leaves , Always kneel in courtship to the shelves in the door - ways , where falls The shadow , always offer myself to one mistress , who always receives .

		At the same time there is , as it were , a cer - tain protest on the poet 's part against this sensuousness of appeal the precipitation on nearly every page of sombre spiritual con - flict as the poet seeks to wrench his soul free from earth to range a purer ether , rigorously recording his failures at every step , in the exalted mood of a mediaeval mystic .

		With the novelist 's analytical insight , in this poet , go also his dramatic feeling and that faculty of vivid visualization , either by the image or by the epithet rarely by the phrase which has been carried over into poetry to-day under the name of '' Imagism . ''

		Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	is an Imagist one of the reg - ular contributors to the Imagist anthology and he has , without question , a high degree of verbal evocative power .

		In him , however , as in his fellows , we are conscious at times of the intellect that is , fancy striving to under - take the work of the imagination , and of an effect missed through the very effort to render it more completely effective .

		Compare , for example , the following picture of
spring	DATE	, with that already quoted from Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	, and see which it is that most perfectly realizes the special mood of the moment the one that is content merely to suggest , with selected de - tail and lightest touch , or that which crowds the line in the effort to compass all : This
spring	DATE	as it comes bursts up in bonfires green , Wild puffing of emerald trees , and flame-filled bushes , Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between Where the wood fumes up and the watery , flicker - ing rushes .

		I am amazed at this
spring	DATE	, this conflagration Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth , this blaze Of growing , and sparks that puff in wild gyration , Faces of people streaming across my gaze .

		And I , what fountain of fire am I among This leaping combustion of
spring	DATE	?

		My spirit is tossed About like a shadow buffeted in the throng Of flames , a shadow that 's gone astray , and is lost .

		Like all Imagists , Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	underesti - mates the fundamental importance of music as an imaginative element in poetry .

		There is , it would seem , a voluntary harshness in much of his verse , which comes rough-cast from the mould with an almost ostentatious abstention from any attempt to finish and refine it .

		This is the more to be regretted since he has a natural feeling for musical form and the most successful pieces in the present volume are those in which he has most subdued the initial rugosities of his expression .

		One can - not help feeling that much of this modern mistrust of beauty in verse is merely another manifestation of Puritanism , and that in Mr.
Lawrence	PERSON	's case it is one with the general atti - tude of rebellion against the allure of the senses , so strongly felt yet so profoundly re - pudiated , which we have already noted .

		The strain of impassioned spiritual pro- test which sounds , with a difference , in the poetry of both Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	and Mr.
Law	PERSON	- rence as indeed it does in nearly all recent English verse finds its feminine counterpart in the expression of Miss
Irene Rutherford McLeod	PERSON	.

		The author of '' Swords for Life '' lacks , however , like most women poets , though we get a touch of it in
Anna Wick	PERSON	- ham and
Frances Cornford	PERSON	the robust sensuous temperament of her masculine con - temporaries , which enables them , in their de - gree , and with varying responsiveness , to find compensation for the conditions of mortal existence in the beauty of nature , the joy of sensation , the temporary intoxication of the moment that passes .

		She either feels and sees less , or else is less attentive to things seen and felt .

		Hence results a certain thinness in her verse , which only at rare moments achieves complete imaginative expression .

		For the rest , it rises mainly by sheer force of rhetoric and moral seriousness , and though it is often eloquent and always singularly noble , generous , thoughtful , and high-spirited , it fails in the main to become effective as art .

		In the days of
Henry II	PERSON	, when the English were laying the foundation of their control in
Ireland	LOCATION	, Gerald the Welshman , an ecclesiastic with the instincts of the modern reporter , ac - companied one of the expeditions to the
Green Isle	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the many interesting things that he had to report on his return was this , that four Irish prophets had assured their people that
Ireland	LOCATION	would not be conquered before the eve of Judgment Day .

		More than seven hundred years have passed since this prophecy was uttered , and thus far very little has hap -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 355 pened to discredit the prophets .


Ireland	LOCATION	is , indeed , governed to a large extent by alien officials , but the Irish people remain uncon - quered .

		There have been many attempts on the part of the Irish to cast off what they regard as the English yoke , but most of these have been local uprisings or the vain efforts of ambitious leaders who miscalculated the chances of suc - cess .

		Three times , however , there have been rebellions which have been almost national in extent : in
1641	DATE	,
1689	DATE	, and
1798	DATE	.

		If we count the
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	revolt of
last year	DATE	, the number will be four ; but it is not likely that the events of Easter ,
1916	DATE	will bulk very large in Irish history .

		The story of
Ireland	LOCATION	's struggle against the predominant partner in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	has been told many times and by many writers .

		And yet no one has thus far pro- duced a truly reliable and satisfactory history of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Most excellent work has been done for some of the periods of Irish history , but the general accounts , while often very enter - taining , are invariably disappointing .

		Among the many virtues that a historian must possess is the ability to study and present his evidence in a sane , dispassionate manner ; his emotions must not be allowed to becloud his judgment .

		A German historian once said that history should be written in anger , and his advice appears to have found wide acceptance among Irish writers .

		A student of history who comes to his task with the conviction that all that the English have done in
Ireland	LOCATION	has been evil will find it difficult to sift truth from error and to give the proper emphasis to facts and events .

		On the other hand , English writers too often have failed to appreciate the fact that the English methods of government in
Ireland	LOCATION	have usually been unintelligent and frequently unjust .

		And with such widely differing view-points , the results will inevit - ably show great difference .

		I am glad to say , however , that in recent years a historian has appeared in
Ireland	LOCATION	to whom these criticisms do not apply .

		For more than thirty years Mr.
Richard Bagwell	PERSON	, an Irish barrister and politician of ability and influence , has made the study of Irish his - torical sources his chief occupation .

		In
1885	DATE	he published the first two volumes of his ``
Ireland	LOCATION	under the Tudors , '' which a later volume carried to completion .

		Mr.
Bagwell	PERSON	next proceeded to write the history of `` Ire - land under the Stuarts , '' two volumes of which appeared in
1909	DATE	.

		Now a third volume has come from the press , which apparently completes the work that the author set out to do .

		Mr.
Bagwell	PERSON	prefaced his study of the Tudor period with chapters on the early his - tory of his native land ; in his six volumes he has , therefore , given us a detailed .

		account of the life and growth and struggles and heroic deeds of the Irish people from the com - ing of the Northmen in the eighth or ninth century to the battle of the
Boyne	LOCATION	in
1690	DATE	.

		There still remains the long story of two cen - turies to study and write ; but as Mr.
Bagwell	PERSON	has already completed his seventy-sixth year , it is likely that he may prefer to close his career as a historian with the present volume .

		Though Irish by birth , Mr.
Bagwell	PERSON	is probably of Anglo-Irish stock .

		In politics he is a Unionist of the more positive type .

		This fact is , of course , sufficient to render his work unacceptable to a large part of the reading public in
Ireland	LOCATION	; for in spite of his almost painful effort to do justice to both sides in the controversies of
Britain	LOCATION	, it is quite clear that Mr.
Bagwell	PERSON	regards the union of
Ireland	LOCATION	with
England	LOCATION	as one that is necessary to both coun - tries .

		Critics generally have , however , found much to praise in Mr.
Bagwell	PERSON	's histories .

		His evident fairness , his judicial attitude , his restraint in drawing conclusions and in fram - ing statements have been remarked upon by many reviewers .

		For his literary style there is very little to be said : it is clear but prosy and bald .

		After having detailed the mis - government of
Berkeley	LOCATION	's administration he remarks : `` The corrupt administration of
Berkeley	LOCATION	and
Leighton	PERSON	could not be called a success '' ; the statement is clear but scarcely vivid .

		Occasionally he allows himself the use of an exclamation point , but only when the need of emphasis seems very great .

		The present volume begins with the restora - tion of Charles II and closes with the defeat of the
Stuart	PERSON	forces by
William III	PERSON	at the battle of the
Boyne	LOCATION	.

		The story of the restora - tion in its Irish phase is told in some detail , and an effort is made to show what its prob - lems were and who contributed most to their solution .

		In the background lies the rebellion of
1641	DATE	with its direful consequences in the confiscation of Irish lands ; perhaps in no other work can be found a more satisfactory statement of the great difficulties that the king 's representatives had to contend with in the matter of these lands .

		Great injustice was done to the native population in the process of settlement , but the author shows clearly that it was difficult , perhaps impos - sible , at the time to devise any plan of settle - ment that would not lead to injustice .

		During the thirty years covered by Mr.
Bagwell	PERSON	's narrative , five men governed Ire - land as Lord-Lieutenants ; but of these only two ,
Ormonde	PERSON	and Tyrconnel , are of any 356 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	particular importance .

		Ormonde was loyal to the English crown ; Tyrconnel was not .

		In his dealings with the Catholic hierarchy Or - monde appears to have aimed at justice and leniency .

		Tyrconnel , on the other hand , made use of his power to further Catholic interests , with the result that the Protestant minority was panic stricken .

		It is evident that
Tyr	ORGANIZATION	- connel 's policy was in a large degree respon - sible for the sorrows that came upon the Irish people in the following century .

		Nearly one-half of the volume is devoted to the revolution of
1689	DATE	in its Irish aspects .

		The story of the siege of
Londonderry	LOCATION	is told with all the necessary fulness of detail , but without any attempt to bring out the dramatic possibilities of the episode .

		Earlier writers have emphasized the heroism of the defense ; Mr.
Bagwell	PERSON	calls attention to the weakness of the attack .

		At one time , he tells us , `` the besieging army was then under 3000 men , and not one musket in ten was serviceable , so that they had to entrench themselves against the attacks of the garrison . ''

		At the same time he gladly admits that the men of
Derry	LOCATION	showed wonderful heroism , but it was shown in fighting want and famine , and not on the field against the half-armed forces of
King James	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps the most important chapter in the volume is that which deals with the Irish parliament of
1689	DATE	.

		This body has fre - quently been characterized as a liberal assem - bly with a most tolerant spirit , which was shown in the effort to find some means by which all the three churches in
Ireland	LOCATION	might be given freedom of worship .

		But Mr.
Bag	PERSON	- well 's account shows clearly that the question of the land was far more interesting than that of religion .

		`` The members .

		were squabbling for estates instead of preparing to resist the
Prince of Orange	ORGANIZATION	, dividing the bear 's skin before they had killed the bear . ''

		Further - more , the attainder of
2400	DATE	Protestants did not promise very much for religious tolera - tion .

		The parliament was a failure ; it had met in the hopes of being able to cut all connection with
England	LOCATION	except the bond of a common king ; and an attempt was made to repeal Poynings 's law , but
King James	PERSON	would hear of no independent
Ireland	LOCATION	and inter - posed his veto .

		The act of attainder may be justified as proper revenge for what the Irish Catholics had suffered earlier at the hands of the Protestants , but it was impolitic to say the least .

		For when the Protestants returned to power after the downfall of the Stuart cause , it was with fear in their hearts ; and to secure their position , their lives , and their property , they passed the notorious penal laws , which reduced the native population to the state of helots .

		It is often difficult to determine where to place the blame for the evils that have befallen the Irish people , but in most cases the impartial historian is likely to find that all the various elements that have found homes on Irish soil have had their share in the undoing of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		If a competent novelist portrays a boy of another race than yours in a country you have never seen , you will recognize your own boyhood and find in the fictitious adventures the counterpart of the scenes which you and your fellows enacted or dreamed of enacting .

		The commonplace that human nature is alike the world over is a commonplace because it is true ; another truth which can not be worn thin by repetition is that the skilful story - teller makes everything that his characters do seem as real , as natural as if the reader had done it or witnessed it himself .

		These generalities apply to stories of adults ,
Robin	PERSON	- son Crusoe ,
Henry Esmond	PERSON	, or Ulysses .

		Be - tween children in stories and in life there is a much closer resemblance ; they have not de - veloped into the diversities of experience and character which divide grown people .

		You , madam , may be puzzled or offended by the mature thoughts and actions of
Emma Bo	PERSON	- vary or Diana of the Crossways ; as little girls you would have played together with your dolls in alternations of strife and affection , just like other little girls , and the wisest stu - dent of child psychology could not have guessed how each of you would develop or what special form of educational modified milk your unfolding natures required .

		I do not understand immediately
Richard Fever	PERSON	- el 's father or the aristocratic egoist , Sir
Willoughby Patterne	PERSON	; I have to take on faith
Meredith	PERSON	's expositions of the men and his descriptions of a kind of society in which I have never lived .

		But I understand at once the incendiary exploit of the boy Eichard and the devotion of Cross jay to
Clara Middle	LOCATION	- ton .

		I have been there and I know .

		So that every author who draws a boy lays himself open to a world full of critics , all of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 357 whom , except the unhappy few who never had a childhood or have forgotten it , are qualified to judge the veracity of his portrait .

		I am sure that Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	's two series of `` car - toons , '' `` When a Feller Needs a Friend '' and `` The Days of Real Sport , '' those humanely humorous pictures of the kids we were brought up with , would appeal instantly , even without a translation of the American boy - talk , to Nexo , the Danish novelist .

		For
Nexo	PERSON	's beautiful story of the boyhood of `` Pelle the Conqueror '' shows that he remembers what boys do and that he knows how to remind us of what we too remember but have not the selective imagination to recall and revivify .

		We are confident of our response to the boy - hood of
Pelle	LOCATION	, though we have no first-hand knowledge of Danish peasant life .

		And if the first part of `` Pelle the Conqueror '' seems even finer than the other parts of that masterpiece , one reason may be that
Pelle	PERSON	's struggles in manhood are in a world which is in many re - spects alien from ours , whereas the boy never for a moment steps out of the light of our familiar dawn .

		It is , therefore , not as a literary critic fret - ting over details of technique and style , nor as a world-worn cosmopolite who has lived among all sorts and conditions of men , but as a simple provincial American reader that I pronounce judgment on two boys in recent fiction .

		One is Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	's `` Men - del '' ; the other is ``
Brian Banaker	PERSON	, '' whose autobiography is `` faithfully set down '' by Mr.
W. B. Trites	PERSON	.

		Let us dispose of the bad boy first .

		The
Juvenile Delinquency Court	ORGANIZATION	has to deal not with
Brian Banaker	PERSON	but with his recorder , Mr.
Trites	PERSON	.

		The only thing boyish about this alleged autobiography of a boy is the imma - turity of the author .


Brian Banaker	PERSON	never existed .

		He is represented as the son of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	millionaires , born in
1873	DATE	and married on the last page at the age of twenty - four .

		The marriage must have been happy , because the girl ,
Marcelle	PERSON	, never existed , either , and so no harm was done .

		Perhaps a real woman might appear to a real boy of twenty-four as the author says
Marcelle	PERSON	ap - peared to
Brian	PERSON	, `` like an exquisite moon - light dream . ''

		But it takes a human being to see a dream .

		In this contact of unrealities moonshine embraces moonlight .

		A few years ago Mr.
Trites	PERSON	announced him - self as in revolt against the timidities of American fiction .

		His circular about him - self was young and swaggering , but its direct promises sounded sincere and were in part substantiated by the promising qualities of two novels , of one of which , called , I think , `` John Cave , '' I retain a favorable though hazy impression .

		Mr.
Trites	PERSON	's literary hero is , or was ,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	, about whom he wrote an emotional article .

		He went to
England	LOCATION	in a state of defiant despair of current American literature .

		I do not know what he has done between that challenging flight and the ap - pearance of the present volume .

		I hoped that he would smash through the weak reti - cences of the American novel and join with some of the younger Englishmen in giving to our fiction that tingling , naked sense of life which informs the best novels of con - tinental
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The fulfilment of that hope is not to be found in work so false as ``
Brian Banaker	PERSON	's Autobiography . ''

		To justify the foregoing condemnation I submit one episode .

		At the age of twelve
Brian	PERSON	resolves to get drunk .

		`` All afternoon I was silent and grave , thinking of the strange experience that lay before me , and that even - ing , with a corkscrew in my hand and ` Frankenstein ' under my arm , I mounted to my rooms to begin my orgy ... Filling a glass with red wine , I asked myself if ever before a boy like me had embarked in this deliberate manner on so great a deed as get - ting drunk ? ''

		The answer is that there never was a boy like you .

		There have no doubt been boys who in secret imitation of their bibulous elders tasted alcohol and made them - selves ingloriously sick ; but betchaboots they never indulged in any such solemn self - ques - tioning about the deliberation with which they embarked upon the thrilling adventure .

		It may be that such a boy as
Brian	PERSON	would have been if he had ever been born and had lived to his present hypothetical age , forty - four , might have written , or dictated to Mr.
Trites	PERSON	, such a fatuous autobiography ; that therefore the book is true to character .

		But a wise literary adviser would have recom - mended a psychopathic examination out of consideration for his friend and would have suppressed the record out of consideration for his own literary ambitions .

		Our good boy is Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's `` Mendel . ''

		His parents are Jews from
Austrian Poland	LOCATION	who live in the harsh poverty of the
London	LOCATION	slums .


Mendel	PERSON	has genius and becomes a suc - cessful painter .

		He is not the greatest painter in
England	LOCATION	, pushed to the summit by a too facile biographer ; he is moderately , humanly successful , and that is one reason you be - lieve in him .

		He struggles , fails , loses here , gains there .

		He has wilful forward-reaching intelligence and at the same times baffling lim - itations of circumstance and temperament .

		You need have no first-hand knowledge of the intimate life of Jewish proletarians ; you 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	need never have seen a
London	LOCATION	studio ; you are simply sure that
Mendel	PERSON	is true , that so and no otherwise he was born , endowed with talent , burdened with failings , that his en - counters with living persons and actual things must have fallen out as they did .

		Pictures by modern Jews of their own people , such as
Zangwill	PERSON	's tales of the Ghetto and some excellent stories of the
East Side of New York	LOCATION	, by
Abraham Cahan	PERSON	and others , often have the effect of special pleading in behalf of the race .

		They not only appeal to your sympathies by their pathos and ro - mance and humor but seem to urge a little argumentatively the theme : `` Hath not a Jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ? ''

		This is not always an artistic de - fect , because without swerving from fealty to nature , fiction may be legitimately reen - forced by any high emotional purpose .

		Scott 's local and racial patriotism , his eager - ness to celebrate the virtues of Scottish noble and commoner , did not detract from his nar - rative power , but on the contrary was a source of added vitality , an enthusiasm which inspired and redeemed stories that were slug - gishly composed .

		Some of the great Eussian stories are all the more poignant because they contentiously expose the wounds of the peas - ant .

		Nevertheless
Mendel	PERSON	's character is the more convincing because it is not drawn from a pro-Hebraic point of view and because the
Gentile	PERSON	characters are drawn with impartial fidelity .

		Logan the Scotsman moves through the story , as free , independent , and self-as - sertive as
Mendel	PERSON	himself .

		The English girl ,
Morrison	PERSON	, over whose reluctant passion Men - del 's hot nature blunders to conquest , is as strongly conceived as
Mendel	PERSON	's mother , who , with century-old wisdom in her eyes , watches uncomprehendingly the growth of her modern son .

		Mendel is interesting as a person , as an ar - tist , as a Jew in that order .

		A more highly specialized study of the Jew as
Jew	ORGANIZATION	is `` The Chosen People , '' by Mr.
Sidney L. Nyburg	PERSON	.

		The grouping of these two books together is a matter of the reviewer 's convenience , and it is perhaps unfair to compare them .

		But since they lie together let us be odious for a moment .

		Mendel is an artist ; the hero of `` The Chosen People '' is a rabbi .

		To me an artist and art talk are more interesting than a minister and religious talk .

		Moreover , Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	is a master of phrasing ; he has the poetic sense of words , the sense of beauty .

		Mr.
Nyburg	PERSON	often falls into flat phrases ; he tolerates the continued union of old verbal associates that ought to be weary of each other .

		With that much of dispraise , let me hasten to pull Mr.
Nyburg	PERSON	's story out of the shadow of its greater contemporary .

		For it deserves the light .

		And it can stand it .

		I have seen few modern American stories so earnest , direct , free from palaver and sen - timentality .

		The popular rabbi of a fash - ionable synagogue in
Baltimore	LOCATION	is involved in two contests , one between his loyalty to
Juda	PERSON	- ism and his love for a Gentile woman , the other between the rich Jews of his congrega - tion , the employing class , and the poor Jews of the wage-earning class .

		Both contests are human and dramatic , and the fine young fel - low who was caught in them is worth know - ing .

		The problems of the Jew in
America	LOCATION	are presented but not expounded .

		There is no trace of a desire on the author 's part to justify the Jew to the
Gentile	LOCATION	reader .

		Here he is , in his strength and his weakness , with his fine idealism , with his commercial vul - garity , neither adorable nor detestable , but intensely interesting .

		I hope Mr.
Nyburg	PERSON	will give us more stories of a race that has always offered rich dramatic material .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		SEA WARFARE .

		By
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	.

		Double - day , Page ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		So much unmitigated nonsense has been written about Rudyard Kipling in recent years that his latest collection comes almost like a challenge .

		It is fashionable to-day to speak of `` when Kipling was at his best , '' with the implication that his later work is sheer senility , and
Mulvaney	PERSON	,
Ortheris	PERSON	, and Learoyd are scoffed at as impossible creatures , neither types nor individuals , by those who nevertheless can not think of Kipling without those Soldiers Three of his .

		The fact is that as he created in fiction characters that , whether or not they ever existed in the British army , have lived and do live in the hearts of men , so now in journalism he has pictured the
Jutland	LOCATION	Fight so well that those who read may never forget it .

		If a youngster had written `` Sea Warfare , '' he would already be a made man .

		It is better than `` Sealed Orders . ''

		With access to men and records that is his by right of merit , he has described the men of the modern navy `` because of the love that he bore them , scriving them clearly , '' and no other account , either of the men or the battles , has ap - proached his in clarity or value .

		Only one Amer - ican writer has so far laid his finger on the secret by which Kipling may be understood .

		In a recent article Mr.
Will Irwin	PERSON	discussed the cleavage in the British race between
Norman	PERSON	blood and
Saxon	PERSON	a cleavage that very few understand but that is very illuminating .

		Rudyard Kipling is clear
Saxon	PERSON	, of the old sweet-smelling
Saxon	PERSON	earth .

		He sees and writes from the
Saxon	LOCATION	point of view .

		His Norman-blooded officers are seen from be -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 359 neath ; - we are never allowed to be on terms with them ; those characters of his that we know at all intimately are
Saxon	PERSON	to a man , and his rare her - oines are
Saxon	ORGANIZATION	.

		He shows us
England	LOCATION	and the English from the point of view of the conquered who absorbed their conquerors , and
India	LOCATION	through his kindly spectacles frets a little beneath the Nor - man heel .

		His Gadsbys and officers of that stamp are true
Norman	PERSON	; his Saxons mingle much more with the natives .

		That is why the covenanted class in
India	LOCATION	quite candidly does n't like him .

		In his most recent book he has given us again the purely
Saxon	PERSON	viewpoint , writing as a brother when he writes of Grimsby fishermen .

		On the other hand , his officers -LRB- and the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	with its rigorous caste rule is practically all Norman on the upper deck -RRB- are admirable at a little distance .

		If we study them as our own officers , to be obeyed and allowed full elbow-room even in submarines , we get them in true perspective at once .

		It is not that
Kip	PERSON	- ling does not understand the officers , for he knows them better than most of them know themselves ; but that he sees them with the eyes of the lower deck , as surely and consistently as he writes of them with the pen of a master .

		LYRICS FROM THE CHINESE .

		By
Helen Wad	PERSON	-
dell	ORGANIZATION	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		To our recent importations of ancient poetry from distant lands , we are now adding several volumes of Chinese verse .

		One of the first of these , and by far the best that the reviewer has seen , is `` Lyrics from the Chinese , '' by
Helen Waddell	PERSON	; she claims to be little more than a trans - lator , but in reality has considerably greater abil - ity than that unpoetical term might indicate .

		In attempting to give a correct impression of these un - usual lyrics one is tempted to say at one moment that they are reminiscent of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, at another of
Stevenson	PERSON	, at another of
Emily Dick	PERSON	- inson ; none of these apparently incongruous statements would be exact , though all have some shadow of basis , for the impression that above all these poems give us is one of absolute indi - viduality , of something quite original and appeal - ing .

		The songs included in this volume are some of them probably among the oldest in existence .

		This is one of the latest of them , having been written in 675 B. C .

		How extraordinarily modern it all is : I would have gone to my lord in his need , Have galloped there all the way , But this is a matter concerns the
State	ORGANIZATION	, And I , being a woman , must stay .

		I watched them leaving the palace yard , In carriage and robe of state .

		I would have gone by the hills and the fords ; I know they will come too late .

		I may walk in the garden and gather Lilies of mother-of-pearl .

		I had a plan would have saved the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		But mine are the thoughts of a girl .

		The Elder Statesmen sit on the mats , And wrangle through half the day ; A hundred plans they have drafted and dropped , And mine was the only way .

		No doubt the critics are sincere when they say that `` simplicity '' is the main note of these lyrics .

		They only show themselves extremely unsensitive to those very subtleties of thought which are so much prized to-day in criticism .

		It is n't that the verses of Miss
Waddell	PERSON	say one thing and mean another , only that they mean a great deal more than they ever say in so many words .

		Here is a very simple example ; almost any reader would be able to elab - orate the idea further in his own mind : How say they that the Ho is wide , When I could ford it if I tried ?

		How say they Sung is far away , When I can see it every day ?

		Yet must indeed the Ho be deep , When I have never dared to leap ; And since I am content to stay , Sung must indeed be far away .

		It is far easier for the critic to attribute simple - mindedness to an author than to himself .

		But the easy way is not always the true way .

		One does n't mean by this that the verses in this book hold great messages or present to us portentous riddles , only that it becomes tiresome to hear them naively described as pleasant fancies unaffectedly set down .

		They are far more than that .

		They give a splen - did impression of color and action , not by em - ploying any mystic or impressionistic methods , but by virtue of direct , terse , and vivid descrip - tion .

		They have in them the spark of truth , the attractiveness of reality .

		OUR FIRST WAR IN

		Scribner ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Some seventy years ago ,
Henderson Yoakum	PERSON	produced a `` History of
Texas	LOCATION	'' that has formed the basis of every subsequent account of that inter - esting commonwealth .

		Some three years ago , Mr.
George Lockhart Rives	PERSON	published his epochal work on `` The
United States	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	, 1821-1848 . ''

		The vanguard of Mr.
Rives	PERSON	's popularizers , not to mention the plagiarists , has already appeared .

		Prominent among the former group is Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	.

		In his preface , Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	duly acknowledges his indebtedness to his scholarly predecessor , and fre - quently reiterates his obligation in the succeeding pages .

		There are a few acknowledgments to other well-known sources , such as Grant 's `` Memoirs , '' the monumental `` American Nation , '' Folk 's Diary , and the volumes of
Semmes	LOCATION	,
Kendall	PERSON	,
Hughes	LOCATION	, Con - nelly , and
Ballentine	PERSON	.

		The author makes no claim to originality , and duly acknowledges his indebted - ness to others .

		His frankness invites careful perusal .

		In the first five chapters , comprising more than a fourth of the book , Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	attempts with indifferent success to sketch the history of our
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Obviously he is here summarizing other volumes , including those of his chief source , rather than giving his own well-digested conclusions .

		It would be difficult to give such a digest within the limit of eleven thousand words .

		As it is , he makes many slips in chronology and fact , to say noth - ing of interpretation , in attempting the summary .

		Yet he does mention names and events that may arouse the casual reader to further search ; and in an occasional passage , such as that describing the fall of the
Alamo	LOCATION	, or the battle of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	, 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 19	DATE	approaches vividness of narration .

		The remainder of the book treats of the war itself .

		In this , the author 's own militia experience and the events of the moment , lead him to give his story a prac - tical turn .

		The various battles are described at length , with details regarding numbers , accoutre - ment , munitions , and service which suggest pres - ent-day comparisons .

		His account is fair to the Mexican contestants , and he makes no effort to conceal the utter political and military demoraliza - tion on their part that served to obscure the unpre - paredness of the Americans .

		He uses his data to emphasize our present situation .

		From this stand - point his volume smacks more of militarism than of sympathy for a deluded but high-spirited op - ponent .

		Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	devoutly hopes there will never be a second war with
Mexico	LOCATION	, but in this instance his pen has done little to promote that good understanding between the two peoples by which alone war can be avoided .

		BERNARD SHAW : THE MAN AND THE MASK .

		By
Eichard Burton	PERSON	.

		Holt ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		If
Hector Malone	PERSON	were to come to life , the first job he would tackle would be the justification of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		He would understand the need and feel the possibility .

		Hector would never be fooled by his creator he would divine the vestryman under the revolutionary ; and he would not be satisfied until he had introduced the vestryman to a wide public .

		His special task would be to take the sting and menace out of his master 's message by translating it into the terms of a traditional idealism .

		He would feel that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's par - ticular idealism had more claim on his respect after he had shown that it was rather like
Ruskin	PERSON	's or
Blake	PERSON	's ; it would have , you see , a literary back - ground .

		And he would feel the need of making Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	completely acceptable in order that he might himself accept him .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	has here undertaken the task of making Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	accept - able to an audience presumably more or less shocked by Shavian antics and not yet accustomed to blunt speaking .

		Always moderate and correct himself , Mr.
Burton	PERSON	has made
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, too , moderate and correct after a fashion .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's violence is after all , his interpreter implies , largely a violence of language .

		To see him as he really is , a good-hearted and relatively conservative man by no means bent on standing institutions on end , you have only to interpret his whimsical explosive - ness of epithet in the language of an immemorial humanitarianism ; and Mr.
Burton	PERSON	is expert at finding less exciting equivalents .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	ev - idently feels that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has wrestled with lan - guage in vain , for , though he admires his athletic prose and quotes it freely , he is never content to let Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	explain himself .

		Throughout the book nothing so tempts him to explication as the obvious , and he expands and comments on the epigrams with a platform fulness .

		But '' he has written a thoroughgoing book of a sort : he gives you the man , the playwright , the social thinker , and so on , all quite unexceptionably .

		In short , it is precisely the sort of book that should help to introduce
Shaw	PERSON	to an audience that he has never taken the trouble to address .

$ 2.50	MONEY	a year `` I stopped reading the ` better class ' magazines some years ago because I found them rather sad .

		When analyzed , their superiority consists only of the quality of the paper on which they are printed ; consequently I retired to the ` popular ' regions , where people at least know what a story is , though they may not worry them - selves about its intellectuality .

		At times I have loolced into the ` different ' magazines only to find that they are the concoctions of epigrammatic children and intellectual incompetents little groups of serious ihinlcers .

		`` But at last we have a magazine The Seven Arts !

		I feel in my bones that your secret motto is art for the people 's sake , and not art for art 's sake .

		I am sure thousands of people will be delighted with your publi - cation .

		More power to you ! ''

		412 A
Programme	ORGANIZATION	for Pacifists At this moment pacifism is bankrupt , Not only have all its efforts to stop the war in
Europe	LOCATION	failed ; they have failed even more signally to prevent the
United States	LOCATION	from entering the war .

		It may be true that the failure is due to the selfishness , blood-lust , and stupidity of those engaged in war , but it is even more true that pacifism is itself not with - out a share in the responsibility for failure .

		It has been guilty of the greatest sin of any endeavor the sin of unintelligence .

		Intelli - gence would have required effective union for the most thoroughgoing application of all pacifist force , but pacifists have been scattered in unrelated and uncoordinated societies , de - voted to no particular ends .

		Intelligence would have required foresight as to the prob - able course of events , and a careful plan of action toward a given end in the light of this foresight , but pacifism has lived from day to day and from hand to mouth .

		Intelligence would have required a radical and thorough - going understanding of the causes of war , and an effort to extirpate them , but pacifism has devoted itself to the removal of symp - toms .

		Concretely , the ineffectuality of pacifism consists in the multiplicity and over - lapping of organizations and purposes , the substitution of sentimentality and exhortation for intelligence and directive action , the irrel - evance of pacifist activities to the governing forces in the institutions they are trying to modify .

		These have shown themselves some - times as a confusion of means with ends , sometimes as a complete absence of the realiza - tion of means , and always as the lack of a fundamental study of the motives which pacifism seeks to liberate and those it seeks to redirect .

		I am myself a pacifist .

		I am clear that war is as avoidable as it is undesirable .

		But I am clear also that pacifism will never succeed in abolishing war by the methods that have been and still are in vogue .

		For this reason I have found it impossible to align myself actively with any pacifist organization .

		Now that the immediate purposes of pacifism have failed , 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	and the alternative is either silence or a searching of the heart , it seems to me that the opportunity for a searching of the pacifist heart should not be neglected , that the time has come to take account of stock , and per - haps to begin operations anew .

		For nobody can deny the validity of the pacifist goal .

		It is the pacifist means that is discredited , and the most pressing need is the discovery of means means most effective toward the at - tainment of that goal .

		The first and fundamental change for pacifism to undertake is a change in the char - acter of organization .

		The war against war can not be conducted anarchically any more than any other war .

		Unity , discipline , the execution of a plan are as essential to the achievement of permanent peace as to the conduct of war .

		Pacifist organizations must be integrated , and separate and specific tasks assigned to the constituent groups .

		Perhaps the first thing to do is to realize what the organization must avoid doing .

		It must avoid trying to stop this war .

		We are in , even as
Europe	LOCATION	is in , and until the issues are fought out to a finish the possibility of any - thing like permanent peace is out of the ques - tion .

		Stopping the war now would only mean beginning to prepare for the next one .

		It is more fundamental to insist that the war shall be fought out to the end that permanent peace shall be secured .

		And it is of par - amount importance to keep the character and conditions of this end constantly before the public mind , never to allow the country or the world to forget that we are sending our youngest and best into battle , that their chil - dren and their children 's children shall never again need to go .

		The conditions for the realization of such an end are democracy and spontaneity within the states , and a court of justice with adequate police powers above the states .

		Peace can be surer when the selfishness of dynasties , the illusions of sects , the greed of capitalism are deprived of their power to work secretly and to command men without accountability ; but it can acquire permanence only if those war - released instincts and energies of men which the drab and hard life of our industrial civilization suppresses can be provided with adequate channels for creative action , other than war .

		It is for the pacifist to endeavor that the organization of the state for the con - duct of war shall at the same time be an - organization for the security of peace ; to seek the democratization of industry , the education and enfranchisement of labor , and the regula - tion of capital .

		The pacifist should consider with alarm the fact that leaders of organized labor have used their great power to discour - age strikes during the period of war , while the government has had to declare its forceful re - fusal to pay capital more than a just profit .

		The pacifist should seek to influence both cap - ital and labor toward a cooperative and profit - sharing reorganization of industry , in which the efforts of men will be those of a team playing a game , and not of a team drawing a load at the crack of a whip .

		For this reason the pacifist should not op - pose conscription .

		Conscription is just and `` democratic '' in that it puts equal liabilities upon all men , but the pacifist must insist that the conscription shall apply not only to the military endeavor of the nation , but to the more fundamental endeavors without which the military are impotent .

		Service in any army , no matter how `` democratic , '' can not but make for servility .

		It is a special service , unrelated to the needs of the daily life in peace times , and leads to no unity of sentiment concerning the conduct of life through a participation in the common indispensable ac - tivities of daily living .

		Universal service in those activities in the fields where grain is grown , in the mines where coal is dug , in the uncharted lands where roads are built , in the factories where clothing is made can bring the classes of society together through partic - ipation in the common necessary experiences of civilized men .

		The pacifist should insist that conscription should mean this kind of service , and should mean it always and for women no less than for men .

		And in matters of the relation between the state and its allies , the pacifist should urge `` pitiless publicity . ''

		Publicity mobilizes public opinion , is the force of `` democratic control . ''

		It implies , most of all , that opposi - tion and difference of opinion shall not be and may not be muzzled .

		The experiences of all peoples at war show that the unification of purpose , the centralization of effort , and the necessary devotion to the conduct of war tend to develop narrowness of outlook and in - tolerance of differences .

		In
England	LOCATION	, the liberties of the people have been abrogated , free speech suspended ; and there is no assur - ance , de facto , that the end of the war will
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 379 see them restored .

		These are safeguards of peace , and already in this country , since the declaration of a state of war , noted scholars have been dismissed from their posts because of their independence of thought , and many men and women have been made the victims of official persecution for uttering their dif - ferences of opinion .

		The pacifist must set himself the task of guarding these liberties , for they are the foundations of peace and the conditions of successful effort in war .

		With the propagation of these essentials within the state , and of the programme of the League to Enforce Peace for the establish - ment of a free yet effective basis for the con - servation of peace between states , pacifism can serve its end best .

		Students of history who appreciate the character and force of human nature are well aware that the best and least restrictive harnessings of impulse can not prevent the recurrence of disputes tending naturally to develop into warfare .

		To pre - vent an appeal to force itself requires force , and the difference between a policeman and a bandit lies merely in the social sanction which sustains the force of the one and con - demns that of the other .

		Both may compel peace , but only the policeman can do so per - manently and responsibly .

		The programme of the
League to Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	should there - fore be adopted by all persons , private or corporate , that really want peace to endure .

		By defending liberty against the menace of over-organization , by seeking to establish economic even more than political democracy within states , and both as between states , by expounding and urging the organization of an international court with effective police power , an integrated and organized pacifism may work to some purpose and redeem itself from the shame into which it has fallen .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		The Senility of the Short-Story When one says that the short-story is on its last legs one may well appear to be court - ing the reputation of a voice in the wilderness to the point of perversity and absurdity .

		Everywhere , it would seem , such a prophecy must be confounded by the flaring covers on the news-stands .

		Yet it is precisely because the short-story was never more widely cur - rent that it begins to show the surest signs of degeneration .

		I do not say this because the short-story ministers to the mob .

		That might have been to its credit .

		I say it because the short-story ministers to the mob in its most capricious and hedonistic mood , and because the short-story is now produced by `` the mob of gentlemen who write with ease . ''

		The history of literature is , from one point of view , the history of the slow decay of genres when they have passed from the masters to the mob of servile imitators who have the receipt without the inspiration .

		I do not mean to imply that these genres sink down in eternal ruin .

		They simply lie fallow .

		Some master , in an age that has for - gotten `` the mob of gentlemen , '' regenerates the form .

		But all genres , particularly those of a highly wrought technique , must lie fal - low for a time after small men have toyed with some great formal innovation of a master .

		Pope 's satires , with their astonish - ing finish but obvious mannerisms , were sub - jected to an unjust depreciation , from which even now they have not altogether recovered , because the middle decades of the eighteenth century were sated by the shrill voices of his clever imitators , who had the receipt but not the inspiration .

		Tennyson developed a mar - vellously rich but a peculiarly self-conscious blank-verse .

		Open
Stedman	PERSON	's `` Victorian Anthology , '' and read at random among the scores of perfectly proper and cloying
Tenny	PERSON	- sonians .

		Then you will see why the master complained that Most can raise the flowers now , For all have got the seed .

		And some are pretty enough , And some are poor indeed ; And now again the people Call it but a weed .

		Most of the exaggerated depreciation of
Tennyson	LOCATION	to-day is but the result of the self - indulgence of the Tennysonians .

		It is a story of endless variations and analogues .

		Never , after his callow years , did Byron stoop to Byronism ; but his followers seldom rose above it .

		So
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	, moved to ill-temper over the din of little voices , sneered and fulminated at
Byron	LOCATION	.

		Now there never was a form or genre that had a more highly wrought technique than the 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	short-story .

		Its chief masters , men like
Poe	PERSON	and de Maupassant , are really virtuosi more than artists .

		Its technique is so much less difficult than that of the essay that high-school teachers find it facile material for their students .

		Nothing is more insidiously easy in
America	LOCATION	to-day than to become a popular teacher with the short-story as your medium .

		It is so much easier to write than the essay and so much more obviously attractive that hundreds of grub-streeters supply an artific - ially stimulated demand , obtuse undergrad - uate students of composition plunge their teachers into a premature literary dyspepsia , hundreds of languid and day-dreaming women make it possible for quack teachers to earn with private classes a plausible semblance of an honest living .

		But the demand for the short-story is , I repeat , an artificially stimulated demand .

		We do not want the short-story we think we want it .

		In our healthier moments we con - demn our modern speed mania .

		In our healthier moments we desire the literature of cool reflection .

		The very technique of the short-story is pathological , and titillates our nerves in our pathological moments .

		The short-story is the blood kinsman of the quick - lunch , the vaudeville , and the joy-ride .

		It is the supreme art-form of those who believe in the philosophy of quick-results .

		Why is its technique pathological ?

		In the first place , its unity is abnormally artificial and intense .

		Turn even to the high-water mark of the short-story ,
Poe	PERSON	's `` Fall of the
House of Usher	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Every group of vowel sounds , every word-connotation , every descriptive and nar - rative atom is concentrated on that crescendo of nameless fear that makes the story seizing .

		It is well that we have had masters to do this for us .

		But is it well that we should gorge ourselves on a genre in which unity has be - come an obsession ?

		Consider also the pop - ular habit of truncating the short-story violently at the climax .

		Seldom are we healed by a denouement in which we may find a katharsis , in which we are allowed to realize that terror and pity or inex - tinguishable laughter have purged our souls .

		Consider , thirdly , the rapid action of the short-story .

		Life is made to whirl by , as we read , like the walls of a subway .

		Yet reality shows us that only at rare moments , even in the twentieth century , do men live like this .

		What , we might like to ask , is the significance of the lives of these puppets who are swept by us with frenzied haste ?

		Ah , but this is an irrelevant question .

		The inces - sant readers of the short-story are sufferers from that same nervous irritability which marks alike the capitalist and the labor-agita - tor when they cry , `` For Gawd 's sake let 's do something . ''

		Tell an undergraduate or his father , 1he tired business man , that because the short - story is popular it is doomed .

		Say that the technique is pathological whether the content be tragic , morbid , comic , or sentimental .

		Warn your hearer that the short-story is the patent-medicine of contemporary art , which serves but to make the disorders of the age more deep-seated while it brings its factitious recreation .

		Point out that it is the literature not of healthy exhilaration but of feverish excitement .

		You are pretty sure to cause a smile if your auditor happens to have a shred of the rare virtue of patience .

		You will become noted as a literary soap-boxer .

		It is so easy , in an age of drift , to seize upon fash - ions that pass in the
night	TIME	as eternal verities .

		But he who has any literary perspective at all will remember the time not long past when the public insisted on the leisurely `` three - decker '' novel whose demise Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	celebrated with his characteristic superficial - ity , the novel that threw its light into every cranny of human character , that paused again and again to reflect upon life genially or wist - fully or acridly .

		The student of literature will remember that half a century before the `` three-decker , ''
Kobert Southey	PERSON	, an excellent prose-writer and a lover of mellow prose , poured out reams of perfunctory verse because the public had an inordinate appetite for rather sentimental narrative poems of huge dimensions about an oriental Thalaba the Destroyer or a
Roderick	PERSON	, the Last of the Goths .

		Let the provincial reader who thinks the nervous quick-step of modern journalistic prose the only manner that could ever have been widely popular open De Quincey 's essay on style .

		There he will find to his amazement a man who himself wrote plesiosaurian sentences protesting against a public and a corps of popular journalists who doted on periodic sentences that uncoiled their enormous proportions like boa constrictors .

		Seldom has the short-story , even in its prime in the last half of the nineteenth cen - tury , attained to high seriousness .

		And
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 381 to-day there are few of its practitioners , whether their content be healthy or unhealthy , gay or sad , whose attitude toward life is not more or less vitiated by some tinge of the triv - iality , the egocentric mania , the commercial - ism , or the mere virtuosity that contaminate all petty or casual artists .

		The depths of our age , beneath a phantom surface of intermit - tent and delirious gaiety , cry out for a deeper art .

		There never was an age that was really in more deadly earnest , never an age more full of unorganized religious zeal .

		The inter - national agony , the national bewilderments , the fearful social injustices , the heart-beat of our epical life these can neither be described nor interpreted by the trivial and the hasty .

		The short-story is but a more delicate mani - festation of that universal fever that has bankrupted mankind , and from which our deepest instincts of self-preservation urge us with tremendous pressure to arouse ourselves .

		From the depths , the most naive and the most sophisticated of our readers yearn for new prophets like
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Ruskin	PERSON	, who came too soon .

		We would turn gladly from the prettily suggestive to the earnestly and beau - tifully explicit .

		We would be relieved to give up the contemplation of morbidly perfected miniatures for impetuous Rubens-like pan - orama with large perspectives .

		If a great artist would take subjects like '' Poverty , '' '' ` Immigration , '' `` Violence and the Labor Movement , '' and treat them with thorough - ness and eloquence in a form compounded of historical narrative and reflective essay , if he could unite in himself the dialectic of meta - physics with its concern over fundamental principles , the sense of the picturesque tempered by a sense of moral horror , an Emersonian or , better , a Fichtean fervor to edify , he would express the aspiration of the world to-day , he would be our supreme artist .

		How passionately the public desires such an art is shown by the wide sale of books that approach this ideal in content and in form .

		We may attach , too , something more than a sinister significance to the public crav - ing for the pseudo-propagandist American drama which traffics insincerely with social questions .

		The audiences which crowd the theatres may be prurient , yet their impulses can be readily sublimated by an art equally vivid , but more sober and more reflective .

		Such an art is sure to come .

		When such a deeply popular longing is so widespread , the artist already lies in the womb of the com - munity .

		For the supreme artist is not one who concerns himself with `` originality , '' at least not self-consciously .

		The self-conscious search for originality leads only to the rococo and the morbid .

		The great artist is so moved with a conviction that is extra-individual , the conviction of his community in its most spacious moods , in its most magnificent hopes , that he loses himself in these to save himself .

		Whatever may be the content of the short - story , its technique has grown more and more self-conscious .

		And self - consciousness is the mortal foe of true originality .

		We may take comfort in the very fact that the short-story teems to-day on our news-stands .

		This is sure evidence of its garrulous senility .

		And the senility of the short-story augurs the sounds of voices more sonorous , the early appearance of a larger art .

ELLSWORTH CORY	PERSON	.

		Literary Affairs in
France	LOCATION	-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the
early autumn of 1913	DATE	, I spent some weeks at
Castres	LOCATION	, an ancient town in
Upper Languedoc	LOCATION	, the very centre of the region where lived and moved
Eugenie	PERSON	and
Maurice de Guerin	PERSON	, who , it will be remembered , were first brought to the attention of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American literary public by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	in his `` Essays on Criticism . ''

		While there , I made the acquaintance of a young professor Abbe
Emile Barthes	PERSON	of the Catholic The - ological seminary of
Albi	PERSON	.

		The next year and less than three months before the war broke out , I received the following letter from the Abbe , who is perhaps the best authority on the famous de
Guerin	PERSON	brother and sister : The general title of my volumes will be , '' CEuvres de Maurice et d ` Eugenie tie Guerin . ''

		My work grows little by little .

		I am having type-written the last pages of the unpublished material which I have col - lected and which will be ready in a few days .

		I hope during the coming long vacation to get the man - uscript in such shape as to be able to put the first volume in the hands of the printer .

		It will be de - voted to Eugenie de Gu6rin and her dear friend ,
Louise de Bayne	PERSON	, whom
Maurice	ORGANIZATION	wished at one time to marry , and will be entitled , `` Kayssac et le Cayla , '' the names of the country-seats belonging respectively to the de
Bayne	PERSON	and the de Guerin families .

		Of all the volumes which I have under way , this is the one I prefer , for it contains the exquisite history of a friendship between two superior young women .

		It is perhaps unique and I shall be much surprised if posterity does not ratify my judgment .

		As regards 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	my `` finds , '' they have been quite numerous and important .

		There was a time
last autumn	DATE	when man - uscripts arrived in my study almost daily .

		I can not tell you how much pleasure I have found in collecting and arranging these poor yellow sheets .

		Nor do I think that I am at the end of my discoveries , and I hope that the months of
August	DATE	and
September	DATE	will be favorable for my researches .

		I then trust I may be permitted to collate with the printed version , the manuscript of the famous `` Cahier Vert '' of Maurice .

		But this revision will doubtless not give me anything very new , for
M. Trebutien	PERSON	, the first editor of the Guerin writings , made only unimportant suppressions .

		During my stay in
Castres	LOCATION	, I saw Abbe Barthes twice and spent an afternoon in run - ning over some of these manuscripts .

		There is no question that he has an interesting mass of unpublished material .

		I recall a letter by the boy
Maurice	PERSON	to his father , written from the
Lyeee de Toulouse	ORGANIZATION	a few days after he had begun the study of Greek , the French being in Greek characters , `` in order to show thee , '' the child writes naively , `` what prog - ress I am making in the classics . ''

		There were also one or two letters from
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	to
Eugenie	PERSON	and to
M. Trebutien	PERSON	, that to
Eugenie	PERSON	being in rather lame French , if I am not mistaken .

		At that time I had not read the articles by
Comte de Colleville	ORGANIZATION	which had appeared a year or two before in the `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	'' and which have since come out in book form `` Un Cahier Inedit du Journal d ` Eugenie de Guerin '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Mercure de
France	LOCATION	, 2 fr . -RRB-

		.

		These articles bring to the surface a rather shady side of the always somewhat mysterious marriage `` it was happy , '' says
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, mistakenly which Maurice contracted toward the end of his life .

		The revelations contained in the book confirm my fears that a good Catholic like Abbe
Barthes	PERSON	can not edit a perfectly trustworthy edition of the works of the de Guerins .

		Eugenie was too candid and Maur - ice strayed too far from the fold for a strict churchman to tell the whole story of their lives and to print the exact text of their writ - ings .

		When the Abbe
Barthes	PERSON	spoke to me of the manuscripts which he had collected , I asked him immediately if he had succeeded in find - ing the `` Cahier Vert , '' for which I myself have hunted up and down
France	LOCATION	more than once and which was supposed to be irretriev - ably lost .

		I was not a little surprised , there - fore , when he answered me rather guardedly that `` he thought he knew where it was . ''

		It will be noted that in his letter given above , written only a few months after I saw him , it is no longer a matter of finding the manu - script .

		He now `` trusts to be permitted to collate it . ''

		It is now pretty clear to me , espe - cially after the de
Colleville	LOCATION	revelations , that the descendants of
Maurice	ORGANIZATION	's friends in
Brit	LOCATION	- tany , where he spent many months of his life , and the descendants on his brother 's side still living at the old home ,
Le Cayla	LOCATION	, near
Cordes	LOCATION	, have been keeping from the public eye parts of the `` Cahier Vert '' and of
Eugenie	PERSON	's even more famous `` Journal . ''

		It would be a most interesting contribution to
Guerinana	LOCATION	to have these two documents printed in full , but the same reasons which caused M. Trebutien to indulge in suppres - sions will probably prevail also with Abbe Barthes , if he ever brings out his edition .

		He was called to the colors when the war came , and though I have made repeated efforts to get into communication with him , I have not succeeded .

		If he has `` disappeared , '' it is to be hoped that Comte de
Colleville	LOCATION	, or some equally independent writer , will take over the papers at
Castres	LOCATION	and give to the world a really complete and reliable edition of the works of this talented brother and sister , with biographical sketches which will also be com - plete and reliable .

		Though
Henri Barckhausen	PERSON	, a distinguished professor of the
University	ORGANIZATION	of
Bordeaux	LOCATION	, died some time ago , his official biography -LRB- Bor - deaux : Gounouilhou , 3 f r. -RRB- , by Professor
Paul Courteault	PERSON	, has only just appeared .

		All ad - mirers of
Montesquieu	LOCATION	know what
M. Barck	PERSON	- hausen did for the fame of this favorite son of
Guyenne	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is one of my pleasantest memories of literary
France	LOCATION	to have seen him years ago buried in this labor in his big house , bursting with books and manuscripts , in the Cours de 1
` Aquitaine	LOCATION	, where he always welcomed an American , for , as
M. Courteault	PERSON	says , `` he was proud of the esteem which this work had won for him in the
United States	LOCATION	, with whose scholars he had many delightful relations . ''

		This interest in
America	LOCATION	began in
M. Barckhausen	ORGANIZATION	's early manhood when he wrote for the `` Nouvelle Revue de Theologie '' three articles on
Theodore Parker	PERSON	.

		Still another
Bordeaux	LOCATION	professor calls for a word here .


M. Raymond Thamin	PERSON	, president of the university , tells in his new book , `` L'Universite et la Guerre '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, 2 fr . -RRB-

		, of the part taken in this war by the teachers and the college boys of
France	LOCATION	.

		The part has been a heroic one , and this book is among the best war books I have seen .

		It has very little to say of the material side of the contest and very much to say of the moral side , and should be read by all who wish to know the spirit in which
France	LOCATION	has made war .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 383 Very different from Professor Barck * liausen 's interest in us is that which
M. Gabriel Alphaud	PERSON	shows in his `` L ` Action Allemande aux Etats-Unis '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Payot , 5 fr . -RRB-

		.

		A member of the staff of `` Le Temps , '' but now at the front , he visited
America	LOCATION	in
1915	DATE	, and this book is the result of that visit .

		I have not seen in English anything which gives in such detail the disastrous German campaign in the
United States	LOCATION	during the first year of the war , when the attempt was made to bring over American public opinion to the side of
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		That such a solid vol - ume 500 pages in length and 5 francs in price should not only find a publisher at
Paris	LOCATION	in these hard times , but should reach a second edition , shows how interested
France	LOCATION	has been all along in our friendship .

		The same interest in
America	LOCATION	is seen also in
M. Joseph Reinach	PERSON	's new volume , the eighth in the series of `` Les Commentaires de Polybe '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Fasquelle , 3 fr .

		50 -RRB- , which extends from
June	DATE	to the end of
August 1916	DATE	.

		These brief , incisive `` Figaro '' articles , `` with a snap - per at the end , '' contain frequent references to President
Wilson	PERSON	, critical but friendly , written of course before we declared war .

		But perhaps the most timely and significant topic presented is
M. Reinach	PERSON	's reiteration three times in this volume and twice in earlier vol - umes of the series of the assertion that `` when the peace comes , the Allies must refuse to treat with the Hohenzollerns , '' an excellent idea which has been growing in strength ever since
M. Yves Guyot	PERSON	launched it for the first time , if I am not mistaken , in an article in the `` North American Review , ''
1914	DATE	.

		M.
Joseph Reinach	PERSON	's chief reason for tak - ing this ground is his opinion that `` the
Kaiser	PERSON	is the author of the war , '' and it is this same phrase , `` Les Auteurs de la Guerre de
1914	DATE	, '' which
M. Ernest Daudet	PERSON	has taken as the general title for his latest volumes `` Bis - marck '' and `` Guillaume II et Frangois -
Joseph	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Attinger	PERSON	, 3 fr .

		50 each -RRB- .

		A third volume in the series , `` Les Complices , '' is under way .

		The first of these volumes begins with `` the distant causes of the war , '' dating them back as far as the epoch of the French Revolution , and then comes down to the fall , in
1890	DATE	, of `` the Iron Chancellor , the arch preparer of the war of
1914	DATE	. ''

		The second volume , devoted to the present
Kaiser	PERSON	and
Francis Joseph	PERSON	, especially the former , brings the story to
August 1914	DATE	and the present war , `` which might have been easily prevented if
William II	PERSON	had wished to do so . ''

		Many of the same topics treated by
M. Daudet	PERSON	come up in `` L'Eternelle Allemagne '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Colin , 4 fr . -RRB-

		, by Professor
Victor Berard	PERSON	, of the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, an author - ity on international European history and politics , especially of the
Near East	LOCATION	.

		Pro- fessor
Berard	PERSON	sketches with a masterly hand the rise and fall of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's work , and ar - rives at much the same conclusions as
M. Daudet	PERSON	, likening the
Kaiser	PERSON	to Shylock , `` whom no judge of
Venice	LOCATION	could check in de - manding what he declared to be his right . ''

		Just what these rights are , at least the economic ones and this is the field where
Germany	LOCATION	complained that `` she had no place in the sun '' is stated by Professor
Henri Hauser	PERSON	, of
Dijon University	ORGANIZATION	, in `` Les Meth - odes Allemandes d ` Expansion Econcmique '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Colin	LOCATION	, 3 fr .

		50 -RRB- .

		The present volume is a new and revised edition of this book , which was first published in the
autumn of 1915	DATE	.

		The spirit in which it is written is re - vealed in these words of the author , where he refers to
Germany	LOCATION	's business methods before the war : `` We are now more convinced than ever that in full peace
Germany	LOCATION	was making war on the world with peaceful arms . ''

		And here is his conclusion : `` When the peace comes , it is an idle dream to suppose that we can boycott
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But it is the duty of the Entente to place
Germany	LOCATION	in such a posi - tion that she can not do harm and to see that she practises loyal methods in international commercial relations . ''

		In connection with all these books should be read at least three by that prolific Polish - French author ,
M. Teodor de Wyzewa	PERSON	, who has just died .

		They give a good idea of how
Germany	LOCATION	and the Germans looked to a man who was not by birth a Frenchman .

		`` L'Art et les Moeurs chez les Allemands '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Perrin	LOCATION	, 3 fr .

		50 -RRB- is well summed up in these words of the author : `` Though the original edition of this book was written a quarter of a century ago , I vaguely foresaw then what the Germans and
Germany	LOCATION	would be in
1914	DATE	. ''

		`` La Nouvelle Allemagne , '' in two volumes , issued by the same publisher , has just ap - peared .

		M. de
Wyzewa	LOCATION	, who was on the regu - lar staff of the `` Revue des Deux Mondes '' and `` Le Temps , '' and who wrote on foreign sub - jects , generally of a literary or semi-political nature , has brought together here some of his best contributions to those periodicals , re - stricting the choice however to German topics .

		Among these is a review of Mr.
Eric F. Wood	PERSON	's excellent `` Note Book of an Attache , '' which M. de Wyzewa pronounces one of the best of the war books .

April 20 , 1917	DATE	.

		384 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	CASUAL , COMMENT THE WAY IN WHICH AMERICA MEETS THE CHALLENGE OF THE WAR will be a test of the maturity and the responsibility of our dem - ocracy .

		To hamper or set back the develop - ment of social democracy at home while fight - ing for democratic principles abroad would be a tragic confession of inadequacy .

		We are faced with difficult and delicate problems of readjustment , and even from the point of view of simple expediency and group effi - ciency , it would be folly not to lessen so far as possible the obvious sources of friction .

		If labor surrenders the right to strike , we must see to it that the benefit is not reaped by the profiteer .

		If wages are fixed by the government , so must be the takings of capital .

		If we are to be able to exert our full force and engage the support of the whole people , we must begin by an equitable adjustment of the burdens of war and encourage every plan that promises to extend the scope of the co - operative spirit among the various groups of the citizenry .

		There will be honest and wide divergence of opinion as to how we ought to approach the problems of internal organization and international policy , and the most searching test of our maturity will be the success with which we oppose tolerance to the action of the herd instinct .

		An effort to regiment opinion or to penalize unpopular views would be a disastrous blunder .

		Let us not disgrace ourselves by repeating the mis - take that
England	LOCATION	made in the case of Ber - trand
Russell	PERSON	.

		Unfortunately , it is impossible to ignore the fact that such a tendency has already shown itself , especially in the univer - sities , where opinion should be most free .

		Teachers whose opinions were felt to be `` dangerous '' have been dismissed , and a mild reign of terror instituted among their col - leagues .

		If liberal opinion is content to set such cases down to individual stupidity , we shall be drifting into dangerous waters indeed .


STEPHEN LEACOCK	PERSON	, AS A LECTURER ON LIT - ERATURE , brings an attractive personality and a likable manner .

		This whimsical stalwart from
McGill University	ORGANIZATION	delivered on
April 19th	DATE	, at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, the second of the
William Vaughn Moody	ORGANIZATION	lectures : `` The Mutability of Literary Forms . ''

		After duly touching on the odd duality involved in a synchronous service to political economy and to humor , he revealed the sea of literature as a welter of chops and changes , teased by the winds of relativity .

		It was an hour and a half of challenging assertions and of accom - modating retractions .

		The speaker did not profess to be determinative , but only sugges - tive .

		Forms came and went ; taste and opinion fluctuated .

		The epic had passed ; the novel might follow .

		Shakespeare was put in his place ; the classics were handled with scant deference .

		Their survival seemed to have de - pended upon the vested interests of `` pundits '' -LRB- those professorially committed in early life to the support of the Established -RRB- rather than upon the loyal interest of
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's `` passionate few . ''

		One gathered that , in the end , a limited number of basic principles ex - isted and that due regard for these might help a piece of literature to outface the vicissitudes of time and the freakishness of `` taste . ''

		A simple and direct appeal to the persisting realities of nature and of human nature of - fered the likeliest line .

		Mr.
Leacock	PERSON	did not finish by reading from his own works : instead , he made a manly and touching reference to the ordeal through which his own country , and now ours , is passing ; and he closed with a fitting allusion to the man in memory of whom the lectures at
Mandel Hall	ORGANIZATION	were under - taken .

		THE INTEREST IN MILITARY DRILL , which has received such stimulus within the past year , has called forth a number of manuals de - signed to assist the inexperienced in their pre - liminary efforts .

		Of these the `` one best book , '' or to avoid invidiousness , the best - known and most comprehensive , is the `` Man - ual of Military Training , '' by Captain
James A. Moss	PERSON	-LRB-
Banta Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
Menasha	LOCATION	.

		Wis. -RRB- .

		It fulfils its author 's purpose of explaining `` everything pertaining to the instruction of the Company '' even to the in - clusion of physical exercises , map reading , vis - ibility , and small patrol and outpost problems , in connection with which the volume contains a large - and a small-scale map .

		It is well sup - plied with diagrams and an index .

		Of a slightly different scope is `` An Officer 's Note - book , '' by Captain
Ralph M. Parker	PERSON	.

		It in - cludes a number of preliminary remarks on Courts-martial , etc. , omitted in Captain
Moss	PERSON	's volume .

		Most recent of all is `` The
Plattsburg	LOCATION	Manual , '' by
Lieutenants Ellis	PERSON	and
Garey	PERSON	-LRB- Century -RRB- .

		The authors , like Captain
Parker	PERSON	, have taken part in the instruction at
Plattsburg	LOCATION	.

		The book , despite its title , will prove valuable rather to those who may un - dergo , or have charge of , instruction else - where than at
Plattsburg	LOCATION	, since much of the material in the book is orally drummed into the heads of the `` attendants '' during the weeks at the camp .

		Bolles ,
Jones	PERSON	, and Up - ham 's `` A Soldier 's Catechism '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	.

		Page -RRB- covers a great deal of ground in simple
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 385 form .


Marshall	PERSON	and
Simon	PERSON	ds 's `` A Military Primer '' -LRB-
Miller Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and Captain
Andrews	PERSON	's `` Fundamentals of Military Service '' are both recognized texts .

		The official War Depart - ment manuals are at present in great demand and difficult to secure .

		They should be or - dered early by individuals or organizations requiring them in quantities .

		Inexperienced purchasers of the `` Infantry Drill Regula - tions '' staple diet for all elementary training should make sure that the various loose - leaf `` War Department changes '' up to No .

		18 are included in their copies .

		The paper - bound edition is appropriate for individual use ; for libraries the cloth-bound edition at a slightly higher price would of course be more appropriate .

		There is also a special illustrated , indexed , and annotated edition de - signed to smooth the beginner 's path .

		The `` Small Arm Firing Manual '' is at present particularly difficult to obtain and , except for the most formal instruction , the cheaper `` U. S. Marine Corps Score Book and Rifle - man 's Instructor , '' with blank recording targets , is fully adequate for elementary pur - poses .

		A step beyond the elementary man - uals come `` Small Problems for Infantry , '' by Captain
A. W. Bjornstad	PERSON	, and `` Studies in Minor Tactics , '' both issued by the press of the
Army Service	ORGANIZATION	Schools at
Fort Leaven	LOCATION	- worth ,
Kansas	LOCATION	.

		Bond and
MacDonough	PERSON	's `` Technique of Modern Tactics '' is the stand - ard work in that field .

		A selection of these books might prove useful to the library of any town where a military organization was in process of formation .


ALFRED KREYMBORG	PERSON	, EXEMPLAR OF BREVITY IN VERSE , paused in
Chicago	LOCATION	the other day , on his way westward , to speak before a little group in the Fine Arts Building on `` What Others Mean to Me . ''

		When it is recalled that Mr.
Kreymborg	PERSON	is the editor of `` Others '' and the compiler of the `` Others Anthology , '' it will readily be inferred that he dealt in his `` lecture-reading '' with his own contributors .

		These were impartially taken up in alphabet - ical order ; nor did the speaker dwell unduly on the letter K. Indeed , a few more `` Mush - rooms '' than he gave would have been relished .

		The poems read and commented upon were many , but brief .

		The shortest had but two lines ; several had but five or six ; only a few had more than twenty .

		And they all pos - sessed `` character '' ; it was an evening of in - cessant prods and twinges .

		Toward the end , under questionings , Mr.
Kreymborg	PERSON	acknowl - edged that his people were less occupied with propaganda than with personality , being more intent on expressing themselves than on bet - tering the world .

		He also acknowledged or confessed that they were more concerned with technique than with sincerity .

		Mr.
Kreymborg	PERSON	not only spoke frankly , but read well .

		One came away feeling that perhaps , after all , a long poem really was a mistake , if not an impossibility .

		WAR AND LITERATURE , other than `` White Books '' and `` Green Books '' and similar offi - cial products of the pen , with the daily news - paper reports from the front and the occasional less ephemeral chronicle of military operations , go not well together .

		Neverthe - less there is no cause to fear that , in this country at least , the coming months will wit - ness any silencing of letters -LRB- nor , indeed , of laws -RRB- amid the clash of arms .

		Our entrance into the world conflict even presents itself to many publishers as not an unredeemed evil , since the resultant falling-off in certain branches of the book-trade will be at least partly balanced by increased activity in others .

		Democracy and patriotism and the conservation of resources will make good themes for writers , not to mention the stir - ring battle narrative or the moving hospital story or the inspiriting war poem such as the past two years have given us in profusion .

		It would , of course , be cold-blooded and alto - gether abominable to count on this sort of literature as an assured and profitable by - product of the war ; but its very probable if not inevitable production will help to tide over the hard times ahead .

		At any rate , it is reassuring to read in `` The Publishers ' Weekly '' that `` the publishing trade in gen - eral , while facing the war seriously , are dis - posed to believe ... that their business and the business of bookselling will not be affected disastrously by the war , and book - sellers who have been alert to respond to the re-awakened spirit of patriotism , find that their sales in new directions promise to off - set in large measure any drop in the interest in books in general .

		The book-trade in
America	LOCATION	has never enjoyed such elation of prosperity that there is likely to be a sharp contrast in circumstances through the adver - sity of war . ''

		Pertinent also is this from the same source : `` We are the richest nation and have the richest citizenry of all countries , and by the more modern and sounder methods of taxation , taxes will be levied in increasing proportion on excessive wealth and abnormal profits .

		This will somewhat relieve the situa - tion as far as books are concerned , for exces - sive prices and profits have not been a fea - ture of either the publishing or bookselling trades . ''

		Mon article de la

		THE BASIS OF PEACE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		There has been sent to me , bearing the label of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace	ORGANIZATION	, quite the most remarkable and statesmanlike book that I have ever seen on the subject of war and peace .

		It is entitled , `` The Basis of Durable Peace , '' and the writer uses the pseudonym ,
Cos	ORGANIZATION	- mos .

		May I , through your columns , urge that the identity of this author be made known for the satisfaction of his countrymen ?

		In my judgment , this little book makes as important , as persuasive , and as statesmanlike an argument for the better international organization of the world as did the papers contributed by
Hamilton	LOCATION	,
Madison	PERSON	, and Jay under the title of `` The Federalist '' for the adoption of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is a great pity that the authorship of this book should not be known .

		The writer is , in my judgment , an American , but that we had in the
United States	LOCATION	any man of such accurate knowl - edge , broad vision , and constructive international statesmanship was quite unsuspected , at least by me .

		I am told that among those who have been suggested as the possible authors of the book are
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	,
Elihu Root	PERSON	,
Joseph H. Choate	PERSON	,
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	,
John Bassett Moore	PERSON	, Da - vid
Jayne Hill	PERSON	, and
Robert Lansing	PERSON	.

		I think I find in the book itself reason to believe that no one of those named is the writer , but , if so , then who is Cosmos ?

		The book seems to me likely to become as famous as the letters of
Junius	PERSON	, and the curiosity of some of us is piqued by the anonymity of the author .

T. R. THAYER	PERSON	.

		POETRY AS A SPOKEN ART .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		With a great portion of
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	's conclu - sions in `` Poetry as a Spoken Art , '' in your issue of
January 28	DATE	, I am in perfect accord .

		There can be no doubt that poetry is primarily an appeal to the ear , not the eye , and that it existed a long time before writing came into use .

		The connection between poetry and music is , in fact , much closer than she has indicated .

		It is curious , therefore , that she does not see how completely this disproves some of the things for which she has so stoutly contended .

		I think I do not misrepresent her , though I can not at the moment refer to book and page , in imagining her to have asserted that vers libre is not founded on rhythm but cadence .

		In THE DIAL she says : `` While it may dispense with rhyme , and must dispense with metre , it retains that essential to all poetry : Rhythm . ''

		Certainly rhythm is the one essential element of poetry , but rhythm , as applicable to poetry , and metre are identical , so far as I can see , with time in music .

		All are the measure of movement of sound , and all imply a regular beat .

		The rhythm of vers libre is the rhythm of prose , an entirely different thing .

		In good prose there is a balance and symmetry of word and phrase , but there is no uniform move - ment , no exact measure or true rhythm .

		When therefore she says that `` this does not affect its substance in the least , '' she must mean that it does not affect the thought .

		Certainly , it entirely destroys the form which seems to be the fundamental difference between poetry and prose , as in almost all cases the thought can be more adequately given in prose than in poetry .

		The poet sacrifices this full and clear expression for a musical effect , which is lost in vers libre .

		But again : If the thought or substance is the only thing worth preserving , how can it be true that reading it aloud `` is an absolute condition of comprehen - sion '' ?

		And if there are few who know how to read , the number of people who can appreciate vers libre must be very limited .

		I belong to this unhappy minority , never having heard it read well .

		I must confess also that I have not been impressed with its `` substance , '' but I have seemed to see in most of it a great overstrain shall I say of per - spiring metaphors ?

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 387 International Dubieties A LEAGUE TO ENFORCE PEACE .

		By
Robert Goldsmith	PERSON	.

		AMERICAN WORLD POLICIES .

		By
Walter E. Weyl	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The League to
Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	is unfortu - nate in its protagonists .

		The idea is put forth as the hope of a liberal world , yet its stoutest supporters in this country are public men to whom we never in our wildest imag - ination credit a liberal idea .

		Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's ad - vocacy alone should be enough to prejudice any liberal pose , and now comes President
Lowell	PERSON	in an introduction to a popular expo - sition of the
League	ORGANIZATION	's programme by one
Robert Goldsmith	PERSON	.

		This book will prove a further handicap to the liberal propaganda .

		It is an unusually thin mess of intellectual porridge .

		The dreadfulness of war is treated as jauntily and morally as is the imprac - ticable idealism of the pacifists .

		The book slides along from easy platitude to easy plati - tude , without any genuine criticism or even analysis of the idea it professes to expound .

		The tone is of presenting with assurance something accepted by the wise , to be made herewith interesting and palatable to the vul - gar .

		The book is one of the most vicious examples of weak academic discussion , where you draw your propositions sterilely out of other propositions , without reference either to facts or probabilities .

		And it is not even a good piece of scholastic reasoning .

		Now that the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	has committed the country ostensibly to aiding in the estab - lishment of such a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, nothing is so much needed as a thorough analysis and airing of the entire programme , with all its implications and contingencies .

		Yet `` lib - erals '' apparently feel that the idea is so ob - vious that it carries itself .

		They imply that it is only against the attacks of those who are less liberal than they that the idea needs defence .

		But it is actually the more lib - eral in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	who feel the profoundest misgivings at the idea of an in - ternational order founded on universal mili - tarism .

		There is no longer any need of proving to anybody that the hope of the world demands some kind of international order .

		The question becomes , Shall it be this kind ?

		The democratic radical feels that this particular scheme has seeds in it so sinister that peace would be imperilled , and not en - sured , by any such premature coalescence of the nations .

		He feels the glamour which the President has thrown around the idea to be false and misplaced .

		And the way in which his partisans have failed to meet this radical protest is largely responsible for the apathy with which the country still regards his whole programme of internationalization .

		The idea hangs upon the agreement of the leagued nations to coerce back to peace , with all their military and economic means , any nation which goes to war without first sub - mitting its dispute to arbitration .

		In other words , the
League	ORGANIZATION	is an economic and mili - tary alliance of all against each .

		The tinder - lying belief is , of course , that peace will be permanently maintained through the fear each nation would feel of challenging the en - tire force of the others .

		But was not this the theory upon which armaments were piled up and the European armed truce of
1871	DATE	-
1914	DATE	maintained ?

		The present war should be a lesson to any mind which believes that international order can be based on the con - solidation of power so strong that none will dare attack it .

		The collapse of the
League	ORGANIZATION	would be followed automatically by exactly what followed the collapse of the armed truce a world-war .

		Indeed , such a League to Enforce Peace might better be called a League to Ensure a World - War .

		For every war which a recalcitrant nation precipitated would , by the terms of the
League	ORGANIZATION	, become a world-war .

		Would this consideration nec - essarily stay the hand of any ambitious , pow - erful , and dissatisfied people who knew that arbitration could not give them what they wanted ?

		The present war was made possible not only by the armed truce , but by the sys - tem of secret understandings between nations .

		What is to guarantee that the
League	ORGANIZATION	, when it takes up arms to enforce peace on a single rebel state , will not find itself opposed by two or even three powerful allies ?

		The League would then be ineffective , and would merely have thrown the world into another horrible cataclysm .

		But the idea contains other fatal flaws .

		It does not involve the enforcement of arbitral decisions .

		If the disputing nations are not satisfied with the award , they may take to arms , and the
League	ORGANIZATION	will allow them to fight it out alone .

		What would be easier than for a nation deceitfully to submit to arbitration , refuse the award , and attack its rival in per - fect immunity ?

		The enforcement of peace would then be bankrupt , though the whole world might be affected by the conflict .

		The League , moreover , could not afford to limit armaments .

		One certain effect would be to rivet huge navies and universal armies on every country .

		For the
League	ORGANIZATION	, to terrorize every member , must be strong .

		Each com - ponent nation would have to be strong up to the limit of its military power , in order that there might be a clear preponderance of 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	strength against any challenge .

		Similarly , the governments must be powerful , or the
League	ORGANIZATION	will be weak .

		This means that ultra - democratic or revolutionary movements must be suppressed .

		The members of the
League	ORGANIZATION	would need tacitly to guarantee one another 's governments .

		President
Lowell	PERSON	defends the League as a vigilance committee of the na - tions .

		But surely this is an absurd analogy .

		The procedure in a lawless community is not , first , for all persons solemnly to agree to sub - mit to arbitration all their personal differ - ences and to suffer coercion by all the others if any of them breaks the peace , and , sec - ondly , for all the members of the community , having pledged themselves , to arm to the teeth and sit around waiting for somebody to start something .

		Yet this would be an exact analogy to the proposed
League of Peace	ORGANIZATION	.

		Persons who could ever be brought to agree to any such mutual coercion , could be brought easily to agree to submit to constituted cen - tral authority .

		The world that was ready for a League to
Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	would be ready for a genuine international government .

		The na - tions would be ready to disarm and put all coercive power into a small international po - lice force .

		This proposed League is no more the first feasible , opportunist step toward in - ternational order than any such preposterous pact of frontiersmen is the first step toward community government .

		The competence of the official partisans of the League in this country can be judged from the fact that Mr.
Goldsmith	PERSON	never so much as mentions any of these objections to the idea .

		It is refreshing to read Dr.
Weyl	PERSON	, who accepts the idea that there must be a machin - ery of force like the League to Enforce Peace , but who admits that `` in the immediate future we are likely to have not a true league of peace but rather a league of temporarily sat - isfied powers , seeking their group-interest in the status quo and pursuing their common aims at the expense of excluded nations in much the same spirit in which a single nation now pursues its separate interest . ''

		Our en - trance into the war then , one would say , be - comes a joining of such a genuine vigilance committee of satisfied power .

		The mistake lies in idealizing this action as anything else than the business of restoring order .

		It is not the League ; it is not even the approach to a League .

		The future is dark and dubi - ous .

		Dr.
Weyl	PERSON	's tone accords with this per - plexity .

		It has a unique suggestiveness in its careful analysis of all the preparatory work necessary to get the world into a state where it can even think of a fruitful league of nations .

		War , he says , results from the com - petition of rapidly expanding industrial na - tions who require access to large agricultural areas in order to keep their populations alive .

		These populations can only be maintained by exchanging their industrial products for raw materials .

		There ensues , therefore , a fierce competition for markets and colonies .

		Mod - ern warfare will only be abated as this com - petition is changed into cooperation , as the rate of population diminishes , as agriculture is stimulated at home , as the distribution of wealth within the country is made just .

		He argues that the problem of war is one of domestic economy .

		The incentives to im - perialism which breeds war arise when surplus capital , which should be absorbed in improvement at home , seeks the enormous profits of virgin countries where labor may be exploited .

		Absorb this capital in social re - form , encourage agriculture , spread birth control , and you lessen the imperialistic crav - ing .

		Make commerce inviolable in war , declare free trade in all colonies , pool your separate national financial interests in inter - national syndicates for the development of backward countries , and you will have dimin - ished the chances of the collision of national interests .

		This would be international jus - tice .

		No nation could any longer feel that it was denied its place in the sun .

		Dr.
Weyl	PERSON	's book suggests a mind fully con - scious of the complexity of the international problem , and desirous of finding a way out through realities , and not by means of an intellectual trick .

		The most impressive thing in his book is the analysis of imperialist forces , the sense he conveys of the vast sweep of the great modern populations in their push toward subsistence .

		He searches honestly for `` antidotes to imperialism '' and has no smug `` liberal '' illusions about the beneficence of a `` liberal '' imperialism .

		This critical an - alysis is more valuable than anything he does specifically for American enlightenment .

		The difficulties of the technique of our contribu - tion to internationalism remain unsolved .

		And Dr.
Weyl	PERSON	is not the most skilful of writ - ters .

		He has a confusing way of pushing a proposition back into the water again after he has brought it safe to land .

		And his philosophy of war is inadequate to explain why
Germany	LOCATION	is at war , though it might ex - plain why
England	LOCATION	is .

		But his approach to the problem is absolutely sound and right .

		These are the emphases and these the issues that should be first in our minds .

		The way to the
League	ORGANIZATION	must be through international justice .

		The `` antidotes to imperialism '' must precede the mischievous intellectualisms of a
League to Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	.

		11 -RRB- 1 THE DIAL 389 The
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	in * Poetry THE NEW POETRY .

		An Anthology .

		Edited by
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	and
Alice Corbin Henderson	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	. -RRB-

		While in some respects `` The New Poetry '' is the best American anthology in many years if not the best to date in other respects it is very disappointing .

		There are two types of anthology : the comprehensive , which aims to embrace all that is typical of the period chosen or all that is important in it ; and the highly selective , which -LRB- guided of course by a fallible personal taste -RRB- aims at a small rep - resentation of the best .

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	's an - thology is of the first class rather than of the second , which , in the present reviewer 's opinion , is a mistake at the outset ; and a second mistake lies in the fact that while ap - parently comprehensive it is very imperfectly so .

		It is fairly comprehensive as regards American poets , but makes lamentable omis - sions as regards the English .

		Not only are such poets as
Masefield	ORGANIZATION	,
Brooke	PERSON	,
Gibson	PERSON	,
Hodg	PERSON	- son ,
Flint	LOCATION	,
Lawrence	PERSON	, de la Mare , and Bottom - ley very scantily and often poorly represented by comparison with our native poets ; but , what is worse , the work of
Lascelles Abercrom	PERSON	- bie -LRB- considered by both
Brooke	PERSON	and
Gibson	PERSON	the most significant poet in
England	LOCATION	to - day -RRB- , of
James Elroy Flecker	PERSON	, and of
William H. Davies	PERSON	, is omitted entirely .

		And it can not be argued that these poets are not sufficiently modernist ; one can find plenty of verse by American poets here included which is a great deal more old-fashioned , and certainly , in point of merit , in no way comparable .

		Aber - crombie may not write in free verse , but in the intellectual and emotional sense he is as modern as a poet can be .

		In short , the faults which have for four years been conspicuous in Miss
Monroe	PERSON	's mag - azine of verse are again conspicuous here .

		The policy of `` Poetry '' has been unfortu - nately provincial in tone ; toward all that she has felt no sympathy with
Miss Monroe	PERSON	has manifested too frequently a cocksure intol - erance .

		In one of the first issues of `` Poetry '' -LRB-
1912	DATE	-RRB- an article appeared which maintained that at the moment no poetry worthy of serious consideration was being written in
England	LOCATION	.

		If one remembers that at this time
Masefield	PERSON	's `` Dauber '' had just appeared in `` The English Review '' -LRB- following his other two narratives -RRB- , that the first volume of `` Georgian Poetry '' was being arranged , and that , in general ,
Masefield	PERSON	,
Brooke	PERSON	,
Gibson	PERSON	,
Abercrombie	ORGANIZATION	, de la Mare , and
Davies	PERSON	were doing their best work , one at once perceives in
Miss Monroe	LOCATION	the kind of limitation against which one must be on guard .

		These English poets were easily ignored they were far away , they had no hearing in
America	LOCATION	.

		At the same time our very numerous American poets , particularly those of the
Middle West	LOCATION	, and those who manifested that moderate de - gree of radicalism of which the essentially con - ventional Miss
Monroe	PERSON	was capable , were coming in for garlands the bad and the good alike .

		Throughout , the editors of `` Poetry '' have displayed an amazing lack of discrimina - tion both as regards aesthetics and ideas .

		So extraordinarily have they mixed bad with good , mediocre with brilliant , that , in the last analysis , they have stood , in any appreciable degree , for little or nothing .

		These remarks are almost equally applicable to the anthology which
Miss Monroe	ORGANIZATION	has now compiled .

		`` The New Poetry '' is , to begin with , astonishingly copious .

		Barring the sig - nal omissions mentioned above , it offers a taste of almost everything .

		It is only when one turns to this or that individual poet that one discovers how shabbily many of them are rep - resented even , too ,
Miss Monroe	PERSON	's own favor - ites .

		How is one to explain the fact that none of Vachel
Lindsay	PERSON	's moon poems is included , while that ephemeral jingle , `` General
William Booth	PERSON	, '' leads his group ?


Amy Lowell	PERSON	, too , though amply , is poorly represented .

		If `` Patterns '' had to be included ,
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	should at least have been prompted to elimi - nate that famously ludicrous line , And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me , but better still would it have been to omit `` Patterns '' altogether , and to include the many finer things
Miss Lowell	PERSON	has written : `` Sister Clotilde , '' for example , and `` Vernal Equinox '' ; or , if one desires free verse to be more frankly prose , `` The Crossroads . ''

		And so it is throughout .

		We find
Brooke	PERSON	's war sonnets , two of which are admittedly good , but not his `` Clouds , '' or `` Town and Country , '' or `` Dust '' ; we are given only second-grade
Frost	ORGANIZATION	, both lyric and narrative ; we are given not one of
Gibson	PERSON	's typical psy - chological studies but his very inferior , if not actually bathetic , war lyrics instead .

		Hodg - son 's `` Song of Honour , '' `` The Bull , '' and `` Eve '' are not here , nor
Flint	LOCATION	's `` Malady , '' nor
Masefield	PERSON	's `` Biography , '' nor
Fletcher	PERSON	's `` Green Symphony , '' nor `` White Symphony , '' nor
Eliot	PERSON	's `` Prufrock , '' nor
Robinson	PERSON	's ``
Ben Jonson	PERSON	Entertains a Man from Strat - ford . ''

		.

		.

		But why go on ?

		It could be done indefinitely .

		It seems almost as if Miss
Monroe	PERSON	had a peculiar instinct for choosing a poet 's second-best .

		What is the secret of this ?

		Is it merely bad taste ?

		Partly , of course , if not largely ; 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	but there is also , further , the fact that
Miss Monroe	PERSON	has tried desperately to live up to her title -LRB- in so far as it represents an idea -RRB- and at the same time to those canons of poetry which are more enduring .

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	does not realize of course how much of a tradition - alist she is ethically and emotionally ; in at least a part of the aesthetic field , she is really a traditionalist , and in consequence as much of the `` old '' as of the `` new '' is here repre - sented , and , on the whole , with the same strange unevenness of taste .

		The result , as all these remarks have been implying , is a per - formance singularly confusing and inconsist - ent , singularly lacking in tone or character .

		It is neither old nor new , good nor bad , selec - tive nor comprehensive .

		It devotes twenty pages to Pound -LRB- who leads in point of space -RRB- and none to
Abercrombie	LOCATION	; sixteen to
Lindsay	PERSON	and Masters ; five to
Masefield	PERSON	; six to
Gibson	PERSON	; while such poets as
Fletcher	PERSON	,
Robinson	PERSON	, and
Frost	ORGANIZATION	trail far behind
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	in space al - lotted far behind the editress herself .

		Are these ratings to be taken literally ?

		Is the amount of space granted a poet totally uncon - nected with his relative importance ?

		And why , if this anthology is intended to disclose only the `` new '' in poetry -LRB- in
Miss Monroe	LOCATION	's sense -RRB- does it contain the distinctly tradi - tional work of
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	, the punctilious lyrics of
John Hall Wheelock	PERSON	,
Joyce Kilmer	PERSON	,
Louis Untermeyer	PERSON	, and many less well-known but almost equally adroit makers of verses pleasantly conventional ?

		Why have the more acid and powerful of the Spoon Eiver daguerreotypes been omitted along with the more magical ?

		The only an - swer is that
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, if she is really a radical at all , is chiefly so as regards form ; as regards the material of poetry -LRB- and to any genuine well-wisher of poetry this is the im - portant thing -RRB- , ` she suffers from many of the curious inhibitions , for the most part moral , which played havoc with the Victorians .

		The truth must not be told when it is disagreeable or subversive .

		One 's outlook on life must accord with the proprieties .

		Above all , one should be a somewhat sentimental idealist anthropocentric , deist , panpsychist , or what not , but never , by any chance , a detached or fearless observer .

		Frost can not give us his `` Home Burial '' here , nor Masters his `` Arabel , '' or `` In the Cage , '' nor
Brooke	PERSON	his `` Libido . ''

		Realism is pardonable in
Miss Monroe	LOCATION	's eyes only if it is decorative .

		In short ,
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, like many another anthologist , has willed the good and achieved the evil .

		An anthology of the new poetry which shall be equally fair to English and American poets , to realists and romanticists , is much to be desired .

		But a tangle of per - sonal predilections , biases , editorial neces - sities , dimly seen ideals , and half-resisted nepotisms and the reverse , has proved too much for the editor .

		And the result is a dis - appointing half-success a provoking half - failure .

		CONRAD
AIKEN	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mittel-Europa CENTRAL
EUROPE	LOCATION	.

		By
Friedrich Naumann	PERSON	.

		Translated from the German by
Christabel M. Meredith	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Alfred A. Knopf	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	. -RRB-

		It has been a part of the fate of
Friedrich Naumann	PERSON	to serve as the champion of lost causes .

		It is a role to which he brings both valor and optimism , finding comfort appar - ently in the discovery that worthy objects have been gained by the fight even for lost causes .

		If the cause to which he has now at - tached himself should fare no better than some of the others , at least his optimism is admirable .

		The central thesis of his book is the necessity for consolidating and rendering permanent the union between
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, brought about by the pres - sure of war .

		The programme he sketches may seem out of proportion with the grandiose dreams of empire which are popularly sup - posed to have launched
Germany	LOCATION	upon war .

		But
Naumann	PERSON	might answer that the union he proposes is no more than a beginning for the Central European superstate which fills his vision .

		The Austro-German coalition is to serve as a nucleus , a centre of gravitation , so to speak , to which are to be attracted `` all nations which belong neither to the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
French Western Alliance	ORGANIZATION	nor to the Russian Empire . ''

		The author is quite naturally reticent as to the nations that might ul - timately be expected to come into the group .

		At times the confines of the ancient German Empire seem to float before his vision , as when he reminds his readers that its frontiers ex - tended to the terrain now occupied by the French and German armies .

		But of course the cardinal interest lies in the East or , rather , in the South-East .

		If events there , during and after the war , were to assume the most favorable complexion , the results would al - most coincide with the aims attributed to
Germany	LOCATION	by
M. Andre Cheradame	PERSON	in his sug - gestive book , `` The Pan-German Plot Un - masked . ''

		If the war , says
M. Cheradame	PERSON	, should prove to be a `` drawn game , ''
Germany	LOCATION	would be ready to sacrifice almost everything else for the sake of her gigantic scheme em - braced in the formula , `` From
Hamburg	LOCATION	to the
Persian Gulf	LOCATION	. ''

		The realization of her
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 391 dream of controlling
Austria	LOCATION	,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	would indeed provide an unassailable foundation for future world-power and world - domination .

		But
Naumann	PERSON	insists again and again that it is futile to talk of any such future develop - ments until the first step toward the estab - lishment of the Central European superstate the welding of
Germany	LOCATION	and Austria-Hun - gary has been undertaken .

		Such a step is absolutely indispensable if
Germany	LOCATION	is to preserve her independence side by side with the three great world states
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Standing alone , she could not hope to escape the danger of coining under the influence either of Eng - land or of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		And even the Central European superstate , under the most favor - able conditions of organization , could scarcely aspire to more than fourth rank .

		It must be understood from the outset that this whole project differs completely from the old Pan-German idea of forming `` a purely German state , extending from the
North Sea	LOCATION	to
Trieste	LOCATION	, the German port '' an idea that involved uniting those parts of Austria-Hun - gary in which the German population pre - dominates with the German Empire .


Central Europe	LOCATION	is to be an international state , com - prising all the different peoples and races now living under Austro-Hungarian rule .

		But have not the centrifugal tendencies in
Austria	LOCATION	been threatening for years to bring about the disruption of the empire ?

		Is the accession of the Prussian spirit likely to diminish the danger ?

		Has , indeed , the `` Prusso-German Empire , '' as
Naumann	ORGANIZATION	himself calls it , been more successful in the treatment of subject races than the Magyars themselves ?

		To an - swer this question , it is sufficient to mention the Poles and the
Danes	PERSON	and the inhabitants of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	.

		But
Naumann	PERSON	is convinced that the Germans are eminently teachable ; they will speedily learn `` the great art of managing men , sympathy with others , and the power to enter into their nature and aims . ''

		In short , he cheerfully takes it for granted that the raven will equip himself with snow-white plumage overnight .

		It is with the same facile optimism that he faces the problem of German Anti-Semitism , rendered more acute as it would be by the large Jewish population in
Austria	LOCATION	, and the equally menacing problem of the preponderance of Catholic influence in the Central European superstate .

		Indeed , the author seems to feel quite confident that the mere sound of the magical watchword `` Mid -
Europe	LOCATION	, '' and the mere thought of the advan - tages to be gained , may be counted upon to act as a centripetal force sufficient to counter - act all disruptive tendencies .

		It is somewhat more to the purpose , when he lays stress on the principle that the author - ity of the new superstate will have to confine itself exclusively to the economic and military spheres and to the conduct of foreign affairs , leaving all ecclesiastical , educational , and linguistic problems , together with the whole internal administration , in the hands of the separate states .

		It is to take its beginning in associations of syndicates and trades unions , in uniform customs regulations aiming at the gradual establishment of free trade within the frontiers of
Central Europe	LOCATION	.

		A Mid-Eu - ropean parliament , which is ultimately to be evolved , will have powers of final decision in economic and tariff matters ; and the military partnership which is postulated by this economic union , will also have to find constitu - tional expression .

		But otherwise all existing state and crown rights are to remain intact .

		As compared with the old German empire of pre-Napoleonic days , the cardinal differ - ence of the new superstate will consist in the shifting of the centre of gravity from Aus - tria to
Germany	LOCATION	a process which was in - stigated and made possible by the temporary separation of
Prussia	LOCATION	from
Austria	LOCATION	which
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	achieved through the war of
1866	DATE	.

		The author does not seem troubled by any great doubt that
Austria	LOCATION	will readily swallow this bitter pill with a suitable sugar-coating , such as he has himself tried to provide by many flattering observations .

		At any rate , it is quite evident that it is the `` Prusso-Ger - man '' spirit which he looks upon as the panacea for evils and dangers , and as the mighty force that will weld
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	into one powerful whole , able to hold its own against the other great political constellations or superstates .

		Here we have reached the point that is of the great - est interest to the general reader .

		The great reviving draught , then , is to con - sist in the infusion of the German economic spirit of militaristic state socialism .

		The author copiously sanctions this designation : If our opponents like to label this intrinsic con - nection between the work of war and peace as `` Ger - man militarism , '' we can only regard this as reason - able , for Prussian military discipline influences us all in actual fact , from the captain of industry to the maker of earth-works .

		A shudder is sure to creep over many a reader with Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins as the author unfolds his vision of the German state which is in rapid process of develop - ment `` not merely an industrial state , but an organized state . ''

		When the ideal has reached its consummation , there will no longer be any overlapping or unnecessary competi - tion , no waste of effort or of materials .

		Even now , the private employer of the old type is 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	fast becoming `` the free directing employee of a society which produces steel or yarn or sugar or spirits . ''

		In another generation , we shall see before us `` the whole scheme of a powerful industry with its domestic regula - tions and its divisions of labor / ' based on a system of state syndicates , and `` almost as logically thought out as a textbook of gram - mar. '' We shall have before our eyes , in fact , a nation consisting exclusively of officials and employees , an organization of all citizens , ex - tending downward pyramid-wise from the apex of central government , each individual being occupied with his allotted share of the prescribed routine of work .

		What a blessing it was that the war brought martial law into force , which made it possible `` to carry out in a few months what would otherwise have needed a lifetime of discussions : the declara - tion that all necessary stocks were State prop - erty , and the substitution of public officials and
Government	ORGANIZATION	companies for private trade .

		State Socialism made giant strides forward in a single night ! ''

		What could not be made of
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, if this `` German economic creed '' were extended to its dominions by `` speeding up those who are lingering in the old habits of work , so that they approximate to the labor rhythm of the progressive . ''

		Above all , `` what might not the Hungarians do with their land !

		... Mid-Europe would be assured of an independent food-sup - ply ! ''

		`` We are a uniform nation , '' the author ex - claims admiringly , `` magnificently uniform in this method of organizing our daily life and work .

		Primary schools , universal conscrip - tion , police , science and socialistic propaganda have all worked together to this end . ''

		Yes , there can be no doubt , it is truly `` magnifi - cent , '' this gigantic mechanism , this huge machinery of overwhelming vastness and power , grinding out what ?

		The omnipo - tence of the state and the annihilation of the individual soul !

		It is possible to clip a row of trees into shape , so that they form a tall hedge , straight and square , with contours of faultless geometrical regularity ; and such hedges may occasionally be useful enough for certain purposes .

		But what would the land - scape , what would creative Nature be without the solitary gnarled giants that grow in the woodlands , where and how they list !

		`` Math - ematical , '' `` logical , '' `` scientific '' are epithets which the author loves to bestow on German life and work in all its forms .

		`` Into every - thing , '' he writes , `` there enters to-day less of the lucky spirit of invention than of patient , educated industry . ''

		But might not the time come soon enough , when the Germans would thank God on their knees for one ounce of that `` lucky spirit of invention '' or , let us say , of individual initiative ?

		The author is , of course , perfectly aware that other nations view this magnificent mech - anism of state socialism without envy .

		`` In educated circles in
Paris	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	, '' he says , `` they feel a mixture of pity , fear , re - spect and aversion towards this German type .

		Even if they could produce the same thing there , they would not wish to do so , for they have no desire for this disciplined soul ; they do not desire it , because it would be the death and the surrender of the individual soul . ''

		Oderint dum metuant !

		He is confident that nothing will stop or deflect the course of this development : after the war , he says , `` for - eigners will talk even more than before about German economic militarism , but we are con - vinced the enforced transformation of the war period will not suit us badly . ''

		For the war itself , he avers , has greatly confirmed the German people `` in this , our German method . ''

		And then he goes on to say : From the very first days , this war , which had been forced upon us , was regarded as a necessary and quite universal duty and task which must be per - formed .

		Every one looked to those in responsible positions for a planned organization reaching even to the smallest details ... The war was really only a continuation of our previous life with other tools , but based on the same methods .

		This , again , is true .

		It is only too true .

		It is tragically true .

		When , by the pressure of a button in
Berlin	LOCATION	, the gigantic machinery , each component part of which consists of a human being , was set in motion , there was no hitch in its working no hesitation , no stop - ping to think of any questions of right and wrong .

		The human gramophones , released by the same pressure of the same button , obediently shrieked out the words provided by the record , as we can hear it in
Naumann	ORGANIZATION	's own case `` purely a war of defence , '' `` un - desired and diplomatically unprepared , '' `` forced upon us , '' `` giant states rising to crush us , '' and so on .

		And , with this vocifer - ous accompaniment , the Leviathan moved forward , working destruction all over
Europe	LOCATION	, and inflicting untold misery upon mankind , such as it had never known before .

		Nor is there any hope , according to
Nau	ORGANIZATION	- mann 's views , for better things in the future .

		`` It is not to be supposed that , at the con - clusion of the war , the long jubilee years of an everlasting peace will begin . ''

		There will be fresh problems , leading to '' disillusion - ments which will express themselves in ex - cessive armaments . ''

		The future `` will be even more concerned with phenomena on this grand scale . ''

		The moment the present war comes to an end .

		preparation will have to 1917J THE DIAL 393 begin for the next war not only by arma - ments , but also by the storage of grain and raw materials on a scale hitherto undreamed of .

		The system of fortified trenches will be - come a permanent institution .

		If
France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	had built such trenches instead of fortresses , the German advance of
1914	DATE	might never have been possible .

		There will thus come into existence a new system of `` Roman and Chinese walls , made out of earth and barbed wire . ''

		One of them will stretch from the Lower Rhine to the Alps , another from
Courland	LOCATION	to either the right or the left of
Roumania	LOCATION	; whether there will be a third ditch , running from
West to East	LOCATION	, and separating
Germany	LOCATION	from
Austria	LOCATION	, will depend on whether
Central Europe	LOCATION	is to become a reality .

		Naumann does not leave us in any doubt that these will be Chinese walls in spirit as well as in name .

		He admits that , in the days after the war .

		the countries outside those two par - allel barbed - wire ditches will be `` as good as closed to the German traveler . ''

		But he paints an alluring picture of the numerous and manifold attractions that are to be found inside the barriers , and then dismisses his reader with an encouraging `` Well , a pleasant journey ! ''

		Naumann 's vision of the future thus gives short shrift to all `` dreamers '' who would like to see mankind move heaven and earth in order to make this most terrible war the last war .

		That time , he insists , is not yet .

		Until the `` United States of the World '' have been evolved , together with a fundamental law for an
International Court of Arbitration	ORGANIZATION	, `` what remains but to put it to the test of blood , how highly each nation who makes a claim , is in a position to value it ? ''

		The only comfort he has to offer is his conviction that the ``
Feder	PERSON	- ated States of
Central Europe	LOCATION	'' will form a first step on the long and blood-stained road toward the `` United States of the World . ''

		The idea that
Central Europe	LOCATION	might be es - tablished in the form of a republic is curtly dismissed as `` unhistorical '' ; the treaties call - ing it into existence will have to `` bear the signature of the German Emperor , the Aus - trian Emperor and the King of
Hungary	LOCATION	. ''

		Of course , the Russian revolution was not dreamed of when
Naumann	PERSON	wrote his book .

		History had not yet begun to walk in seven - league boots , as a German socialist said the other day .

		We can not predict with absolute certainty whether the superstate of
Central Europe	LOCATION	, as conceived by
Naumann	ORGANIZATION	, will still be within the sphere of the possible when his - tory has reached the next station on its road , or whether it will belong to the limbo of lost causes .

		But if the latter should be the case , it will not be because there was not a strong majority of his countrymen in favor of
Nau	ORGANIZATION	- mann 's views .

		His book , which has had the good fortune of finding a translator whose version reads like an English original , is in - dispensable to all who would form a concrete idea of the present working of the German mind , and it is a mine of information for everyone who wishes to gain an insight into the intricate problems of German economics and politics at the hand of a guide who has them at his fingers ' ends , and who is imbued with a living knowledge of German history .

SAMUEL BUTLER	PERSON	: a Critical Study .

		By
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	.

Stecker	PERSON	. -RRB-


SAMUEL BUTLER	PERSON	; author of Erewhon : the man and his work .

		By
John F. Harris	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		For thirteen years after his death
Samuel Butler	PERSON	's memory was not honored with any criticism of more than thirty pages .

		There were a few magazine articles , mostly laud - atory , and introductions by various hands to reprints of his works .

		During this period he was becoming gradually known to a wider and wider public .

		Then , in
1915	DATE	, came Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's study , followed a year later by Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's larger volume about the satirist two books which supplement each other in satisfying manner , Mr.
Harris	PERSON	dealing more in facts , Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	in theories .

		Butler always held that glory after death was better than glory in life , because the former was not such a bother to the man who was glorified .

		Indeed , he cared very little about glory , one way _ or the other , so long as it did not scare `` nice '' people away from his books , and so prevent his spirit from liv - ing through them with what life they had .

		Life through the living was what Butler wanted , not empty reputation or a name to be juggled with by cultured critics .

		And his wholesome influence was working while the cultured critics thought him dead and for - gotten .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's book , however , stirred some of the hostile reviewers into activity .

		No doubt they were of the same breed as their Victorian predecessors who kept Butler down by a conspiracy of silence .

		Annoyed at his resurrection , they determined to finish him off once and for all by saying that his satire was out of date and that , as `` one of our charlatans '' -LRB- Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, presumably -RRB- admired him so much , he must evidently be damned .

		One .

		by way of a coup de grace , announced 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	that
Butler	PERSON	was in no respect superior to the author of `` Pinafore , '' a judgment which Butler would have welcomed after having been compared by admirers with
Meredith	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is no reason why
Butler	PERSON	's satire should be out of date any more than Swift 's .

		Both were directed mainly against priggishness and hypocrisy , and English re - viewers should be the last to pretend that these interesting vices were confined to the reign of
Victoria	LOCATION	.

		You might have supposed , seeing how these reviewers attacked Butler , that Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	had overpraised him ; this was not the case .

		They simply emphasized points like the com - parison with
Gilbert	PERSON	, which Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	had himself already made .

		I fear that Mr.
Can	PERSON	- nan was so much in sympathy with
Butler	PERSON	's point of view as to become overcritical of it , for he has praised Butler only grudgingly and condescendingly ; and it is as a corrective of this slighting attitude toward Butler that I wish to consider Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's volume .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	does more than correct wrong impressions : he furnishes a good bibliography , gives a clear idea of what
Butler	PERSON	's different books are like , for those who have not read them , quotes freely and interestingly from
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's writings and from writings about him .

		But his principal service is to back
Butler	PERSON	's valuation of himself , his idea of his own character , against all his critics .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	, attempting to read between the lines , to search out the secret doubts and fears , may have gone deeper into
Butler	PERSON	's soul ; yet in assuming so superior an attitude he missed , or passed over too lightly , the peculiar excel - lence of
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's wisdom .

		According to
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's picture of himself , which Mr.
Harris	PERSON	adopts , he was a man who tried to be himself and himself only .

		He never worried about his soul 's salvation , had no desire to soar into unearthly realms or to swim in sentiment , never wanted to be like Shakespeare or anyone else whom he did not resemble .

		He resisted all attempts to make either himself or others conform to ways of believing which were not natural and reason - able to them , and he attacked hypocrisy wherever he found it .

		He never hunted for a subject , never forced his imagination , and though he never scamped a job once it was begun , he never undertook it until it actually bothered him into writing to get it off his mind .

		Among the things which bothered him , two stand out above all the others : Darwinism and the
Anglican Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	holds that they bothered him so much as to be ob - sessions .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	, desiring to find nothing unreasonable in Butler , will not admit that
Butler	PERSON	was afraid of
Darwin	PERSON	or that
Darwin	PERSON	became an obsession ; about the church he is more reticent , content to point out that the satirist was brought up under extremely un - pleasant conditions , and that his revolt and attempt to free others were only natural .

		Few will deny that the church did obsess .

		Butler most of his life .

		The quantity of naughty wit , of innuendo , of brilliant logic , , which he used against it shows how uncom - fortable it made him feel .

		Even his fiction is in part a polemic against the Anglican orthodoxy .

		It might almost be said that the church was the first cause of his writing , the central object of his satire .

		Whether for ill or for good , the early Victorian church was an obsession with him which would not down , and with whose spectre he continued battling long after the institution had chanced profoundly .

		Butler 's animosity toward
Darwin	PERSON	and the Darwinists may , as Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	says , have been the result of another obsession , but this is only half the story .

		Butler had a theory different from
Darwin	PERSON	's to advance and the reputations of older naturalists than
Darwin	PERSON	to uphold .

		He was defending free will in the natural order against a determinism as stupidly and superstitiously guarded by its high priests , the Darwinists , as religious dogma had ever been .

		From our present posi - tion ,
Butler	PERSON	's theories seem to have been much nearer right than those of many of the con - temporary scientists who would have nothing to do with him .

		Butler had never gone in for research , nor did he use the usual scientific jargon ; and though it is perfectly plain that people are just as capable of drawing false conclusions after rigorous scientific training as they were before , most scientists would rather be misled by one of the initiated than put on the right track by an outsider .

		The neglect to which he was treated probably made Butler more insistent than he would otherwise have been .

		He wanted sensible crit - icism for his theories , and he got little enough , .

		even after his death .

		In this respect Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	is as bad as
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries , refusing to find any value in him as biologist or philosopher .

		Again , in dealing with
Butler	PERSON	's minor en - thusiasms , hobbies , and paradoxical fancies , .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	shows his understanding of the man , but not of the work .

		Butler , as he says , , missed a lot of the ordinary man 's easy satis - faction with life by his very gift of humor ; it would not allow him to be carried away except by an overwhelming force such as
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's music .

		Butler was scarcely ever
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 395 able to put faith in the things which his age trusted .

		He was never an appreciator , a booster of reputations and fashions .

		As he could not live without setting his energy to some task , and as it would have been too cruel a self-mockery to build something sub - stantial which he knew would eventually have to be destroyed , he lavished much care on jokes , which no one would be apt to take seri - ously .

		In this he was like a man who , be - lieving that the world is soon to end , might touild card houses and sand castles with more affection than if they were granite .

		Butler 's undoubted genius and his habit of keeping close to experience often brought it about that these jokes turned out to be of more endur - ing stuff than their maker expected , and if they stood the rigorous searchings to which his mind subjected everything it touched , he - came to believe in them .

		Furthermore , as Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	fails to see and as Mr.
Harris	PERSON	points out , these ideas and theories of
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's were not isolated products of a wild imagination , but were arranged in his mind in orderly relation , registered , so to speak , in terms of one another .

		Though many and different sub - jects bothered him into taking them up , the literature which he produced was singularly pure , whole , and relevant .

		From the point of view of his humor -LRB- and his genius was evidently at its best when it was humorous -RRB- ,
Butler	PERSON	's incapacity for aver - age illusions was a great help .

		If he had been able to join other men in backing one of their institutions , or if he could have tried to become an institution himself , as
Darwin	PERSON	liad , he might well have lost the best part of his humor .

		This calamity could not befall him while he ran steadfastly counter to his age .

		As long as he had no following to hood - wink , he had no cause to pretend solemnity or infallibility .

		He knew the blessedness of being in the minority .

		Like Mr.
Higgs	PERSON	, `` Erewhon 's '' discoverer , if
Butler	PERSON	returned to lis country to find Butlerism rampant , he would disown it and slip away .

		He preferred to be the light-hearted leaven , not the heavy loaf .

		In his unwearied opposition to his age But - ler might have been compared to a man who refuses to join his country 's army at a time when joining the army is considered the thing to do .

		`` If all Erewhonians were like you , '' says the recruiting sergeant , `` there would soon be no Erewhon . ''

		`` Ah , '' says the man , `` but they 're not . ''

		And he might have added as a second thought : `` If all the world were like me , there would be no need for any army . ''

		Thus Butler had two lines of defence for his point of view : it was not accepted any - way , and if by any miracle it should come to be accepted , there would no longer be any need for the institutions which it attacked .

		As a practical demonstration of his point of view working in life ,
Butler	PERSON	wrote his novel , `` The Way of All Flesh . ''

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	praises it unreservedly ; Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	shows discrimination of a rather theoretical sort by objecting that the thesis damages the art .

		Most people , however , do not read for art exclusively .

		Some may prefer the irony of the book , and some the kindliness .

		Others will be most impressed by
Ernest	PERSON	's counter-conver - sion from the oppressive orthodoxy of his fathers to
Butler	PERSON	's religion of `` grace , '' which Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	explains so clearly .

		Surely all must quicken at the presence of
Ernest	LOCATION	's
Aunt Alethea	LOCATION	,
Butler	PERSON	's ideal of all a woman ought to be .

		One may use the occasion of this English version of a sheaf of studies by Dr.
Jung	PERSON	to consider , in the terms of its findings , the point of view which sustains the whole .

		Freud and Freudian interpretations have become familiar and contested issues .

		Whether the principles which they posit express a keen insight into the frailities of the human , all too human soul , or constitute a libel upon its fair name is the tangible point of discussion ; truly this question injects a moral criterion , which may have its place in the application the sentence but hardly belongs in the appraisal of evidence and the reaching of a verdict , which is a matter for the court of logic alone .

		If the Freudian interpretation of human motives and the mechanisms of their intricate relations is sound , it is just as valu - able whether its statement is pleasant or un - pleasant , fit to print for the family reading or only for the physician 's private office .

		Moreover , the `` case of Freud , '' as a personal trial of the merits of an individual , is of far slighter consequence than the trial of his principles , however natural it may be to con - fuse the two in the popular hearing of a cause celebre .

		Of the followers of
Freud	LOCATION	, none has con - tributed more to enlarge aiid extend the scope of the `` school '' than Dr.
C. G. Jung	PERSON	, formerly 396 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	of the
University of Zurich	ORGANIZATION	.

		He in turn has his following ; and as German writers are fond of calling every moderately congenial group a `` school , '' we read of the
Vienna	LOCATION	school and the
Zurich	LOCATION	school .

		At this distance local distinctions are unimportant .

		What is characteristic of Dr.
Jung	PERSON	is his broader con - ception of the scope of the Freudian inter - pretation .

		More particularly he declines to accept the sex-motif as the only , if yet the standard , type of desire , and expands it to a libido , which embraces all that is ardently wished and makes its appeal to the fun - damental motive forces of the human will .

		Adler likewise an independent Freudian has much to say of the desire of power as a rival of love in the human soul and an equal cause of its undoing ; while Jung passes from the crudely egoistic expressions to include the larger adjustments for happiness that go into a rounded life-history , and in their hazards sow the seeds of `` nervous '' tragedy .

		Yet , we speak freely of , and frankly encourage , a per - sonal ambition , and realize though more vaguely the rights of the individual to the pursuit of happiness ; so that these channels of desire -LRB- and their disastrous thwartings -RRB- are not beset by the restraints and resistances that condemn the career of sex to a secretive and troubled expression ; nor do they root so deeply in the organic soil of passion .

		Pos - sibly they borrow their energies from the overflow of the natural ardor of man , and in their artificial horticultural blossoms disguise , while yet they glorify , the ideals of mankind .

		Jung parallels the libido with the Bergsonian , poetized elan vital the animated source of the desire for rich and full living , with a history as ancient and as various as that which biology confers upon all its creatures .

		As a volume , these `` Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology '' record the successive steps of Jung 's interests .

		They begin with engaging or puzzling `` case histories , '' include an analysis of so-called `` occult '' phenomena , in which the adolescent subject blossoms forth in seances , answers questions of sitters , com - munes with spirits , and impersonates distin - guished departed if uninspiring voices from the beyond .

		The subject also is detected in fraud .

		Here the one clue is hysteria , and the analyst of hysteria must be keen to recognize human motives as they approach the abnor - mal , in a measure that constitutes almost an independent clinical sense .

		The intense per - sonalization of hysteria , the readiness with which imaginings are projected into realities , the craving for interest , all these make a cul - ture-bed for neurosis .

		But most cases of entanglement of motive which warp and twist the mind as an instrument of adjustment are not so simple .

		Unlike murder they will not out ; but like the sense of guilt , they trouble and produce unrest .

		Dr.
Jung	PERSON	devised the psycho-analytic method of the association to meet this situation .

		The or - dinary person will react with an association to an average list of common words with a degree of regularity that while variable can be statistically predicted .

		But let there be introduced some clue-words with which an emotional effect is involved , and there arises a hesitation , a resistance that lengthens the reaction and sets the mind to disguising what might be a revelation .

		Bring these several clue-words together , and you have the skeleton of the plot , which is likewise the skeleton in the closet , often unsuspected .

		Dr.
Jung	PERSON	gives many pages of curves of reaction-times , in which these resisted reactions tower above their ordinary fellows , like the skyscrapers in the
New York	LOCATION	vista .

		Follow the clue , inspire confidence , and you get a confession , and with this psychic cathartic the troubled spirit is purged .

		Conflict is the clue to all such situations ; the conflict of private long - ing and public achievement , of suppressed desire and the stern realities of existence .

		Despite this , the normal person achieves a unified personality that emerges by shedding what is irrelevant , unseemly , or impossible and developing what is approved ; outwardly we all are our chastened or at least censored selves .

		Inwardly we may be a sea of trouble .

		The conflict is between the conscious and the subconscious strivings , those that get a chance for expression , and those for which normally repression is the fate .

		The psycho-analyst reveals how the other half lives ; to many this is merely a slumming expedition ; to others it is the most precious kind of psychol - ogizing .

		When the conflict is strong , it becomes a feud , and personality a divided house .

		Such is hysteria , which in the end produces the alternating personalities that represent the faulty and difficult maturing of a self , usually of the adolescent type .

		As maturing is so largely a sex matter and the concerns of sex stand focal to the intimate circle of being , the psycho-analyst is prone to chercher la femme , and finds what he seeks .

		In this search the dream is the most alert assistant .

		For the dream is uncensored and itself devel - ops a plot and invents incidents .

		These have one meaning according to the acknowledged pattern of the censored mind , but quite another when read in terms of the subcon - sciously suppressed meanings .

		The exper - imental association is meagre and limited ;
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 397 but the dream is a product as rich as life itself .

		Thus you set free the process of sym - bolism , which roams from allegory to mys - ticism , from obscenity to mythology , from cryptic utterances to delirium .

		Through such thinking , to the extreme Freudian , runs a dual code , with one meaning at the surface and a running commentary in the forbidden realm .

		To unravel the cypher leads to the discovery of the Freudian mechanisms .

		These can not be discussed ; but the conception of a neurosis as a faulty maturing -LRB- on the basis of hereditary disposition -RRB- leads to a special emphasis upon the stages of growth when a declaration of independence is essential .

		Hystericals are persons that mature weakly , imperfectly , inadequately ; in a critical sense only the few put away childish things and become properly adult .

		This too long and too strong assertion of the infantile habit of mind plays its part in neurosis .

		The overdoing of home-ties makes for persons who never learn to stand alone .

		More particularly the psychology of the father as the forcible expres - sion of authority has a dismal responsibility .

		In the relations of daughter to father , of son to mother ,
Jung	PERSON	traces the seeds of mal-ad - justment and discontent ; the father pattern becomes an obstacle to the daughter when confronted with suitors , and even her own mother stands as a rival in the suit for paternal favor .

		The development of this theme -LRB- as well as the emphasis on sex notions in young children -RRB- has estranged more readers otherwise attracted to Jung than any other single position .

		Yet the emphasis is essential to his view .

		Here as well as else - where he makes a transition to the cosmic application of his theme .

		Mythology is a Freudian parable ; the CEdipus complex may be read only in its light .

		Neurotic imaginings and disguising romanticism in a sensitive and educated mind work after the manner of the racial myth .

		The Freudian psychology attempts a gen - eric view of the conditions of psychic living .

		It finds a critical expression in the manner in which it divides men and projects new bound - aries among the varieties of personality .

		James made an epochal division of men when he distinguished the tough-minded from the tender-minded ;
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	speaks of
Apollon	LOCATION	- ians and Dionysians ; others see the world of character ranged in classic and romantic camps , in material and aesthetic , in concrete and abstract groups .

		Jung speaks of the extraverted and the introverted ; both occur in pathological form ; but the hysterical intro - versions , which depreciate the external actual - ities and substitute for them the self-centred projections of an intangible world of desire , contribute the interesting vagaries for the psycho-analyst 's art .

		Values positive and negative lie here ; the dreamer , the system - maker , the poet , the mystic are of a nature all compact ; and this element of the romantic , sentimental creature misnamed homo sapiens demands an outlet , which the neurotic seeks in a perverted satisfaction .

		The tough - minded , matter-of-fact realist has a fairly straight road to travel ; his satisfactions are as simple as his desires , and a Weltanschauung is a superfluous piece of baggage .

		The tender - minded wander in a network of invitation and temptation , and an uncharted jungle lures them on .

		Theirs is the neurotic hazard ; and the libido makes strange converts .

		Diverse as are these renderings of the Freudian theme in Dr.
Jung	PERSON	's arrangement , they are not more so than his analytical psy - chology , which Jung as yet has not fashioned into an articulate system .

		But there is enough here to show a distinct psychological trend .

		`` Neurosis is a tearing in two of the inner self . ''

		It is the wreckage that shows the risks of the high seas .

		For each it is the struggle to express and to suppress ; for each it is the reconciliation that makes a solution , its faulty attainment that makes a tragedy .

		For the many , the motif is that of sex , for this alone is sufficiently saturated with desire , has an adequate hold upon the mainsprings of being .

		The few may sublimate it by carrying the same source of vital energy to new fields ; if successful , the mind achieves the finest products of the spirit set free , of spiritual conquest and noble living .

		Even the sensual expressing sensual things , and the crude folk expressing crude things , live the life of con - tented adjustment .

		But spiritual unrest breeds neuroses and makes the moral problems of to-day .

		It seems a pertinent psychological reminder of the baser side of living , which
Freud	ORGANIZATION	posits , to reflect that the horrors of murder , rape , and pillage are perpetrated in these days by persons who , a few years ago , were at home in a body of tender-minded citizens .

		If this too is a form of the libido , with the subconscious thinly buried by the resistances of outward conformity , the posi - tion of Freud becomes less of a libel upon mankind .

		But last as first ,
Freud	PERSON	and Jung and their , kind must be considered for the illumination they contribute to the study of human motives .

		Content and form are only abstractly separable .

		One may wish that the Freudian ideas had been contributed by men more alive to the varied springs of action in refined persons , more sympathetic with the delicate products of intellectual insight , less 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	absorbed in the revolting aspects of a degen - erate humanity .

		But the facts stand .

		The abnormal has given the clue to the interpreta - tion of the normal , and brings with it much of the mud that attaches to deep-sea dredg - ings .

		When the psychologists of the future stand a little away from the canvas , they will interpret the composition more truly ; and the casual critic will be less offended by the details and more concerned with the meaning of the whole .

		The reaction from Freudianism is justified ; so will be the return to it under clearer conditions .

		Underworld Decorum THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A SUPER-TRAMP .

		By
William H. Davies	PERSON	.

		Prefaced by
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

$ 2.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		That Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	should have consented to supply Mr.
Davies	PERSON	with something in the nature of a testimonial is a sufficient witness to the amazing geniality of his spirit .

		His preface is to be taken as a pure tour de force of the imagination .

		How could it be any - thing else ?

		How could
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and a Supertramp be expected to understand each other ?

		To appreciate the full extent of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's magnanimity , you have only , indeed , to consider the total economic depravity of Mr.
Davies	PERSON	his professional indolence , his unabashed sponging , his complete innocence of the modern superstition that a man ought to support himself as a passport to the re - spect of his fellows .

		If Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	chose to overlook these vagaries , it can only be be - cause he was persuaded that Mr.
Davies	PERSON	really is a poet and therefore worth attending to .

		Whether he is worth attending to in prose , however , is distinctly debatable , and I should think Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	must have felt some doubts about the matter himself .

		He calls the book unique .

		Certainly , it is unique in our time , but I should imagine that the aspiration un - derlying it is so far from being unique that it represents fairly well the private ambi - tion of half the writing population that never sees its work in print .

		The aspiration is clearly to be literary , and timelessly literary at that .

		The book is a standing reproach to our casual , colloquial assaults upon the dig - nity of the printed page .

		`` These pudent pages , '' says Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, `` are unstained with the frightful language , the debased dialect , of the fictitious proletarians of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	and other genteel writers . ''

		So they are .

		There is about them an unimaginable propriety ; they are rounded or squared with a meticulous precision that denotes an active conscience .

		Mr.
Davies	PERSON	understands with a profound and instinctive completeness that yearning for rhetorical chastity which at - taches the masses to melodrama the sole surviving literary form in which elegance is cultivated as an art .

		He might be described as the
Lincoln J. Carter	PERSON	of trampdom .


Josiah Flynt	PERSON	, if we are to believe
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, was afflicted with something of the same itch for verbal propriety , which suggests that we have to do with a phenomenon that ought to be of interest to literary psychologists .

		I have intimated that the flavor of `` The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp '' is exqui - sitely archaic .

		Not at all in the finessing and calculated manner of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	, but natur - ally and unconsciously archaic .

		And the ideas are quite to match .

		No proletarian lust for intellectual novelty makes a patchwork of Mr.
Davies	PERSON	's pages ; he is utterly incapable of .

		the characteristic modern vulgarity of wishing to appear modern .

		This singular staleness Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	finds decidedly refreshing .

		It is the penalty he pays for being himself so aggres - sively and uncompromisingly new .

		Only an over-sophisticated public , rendered neurotic and irritable by the futile struggle to keep up with the exasperating flux of things , will be able to enjoy the freshness of this confes - sion .

		To those who have a natural and healthy indifference to books , it will seem simply a rather colorless record of adventures in search of food and change .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	stresses the fact that we have to do with a book that is admirably moral , ex - cept from the economic point of view .

		That hardly seems strange to me .

		It is due to the accident that Mr.
Davies	PERSON	's reading stopped short of the dangerous modern period and embraced only the books that were written when there was still such a thing as literary decorum in the world and authors prided themselves on a decent reserve .

		This was what may be called the dualistic period of the English tradition , which Mr.
Davies	PERSON	ex - hibits in its perfection .

		His code is simple : he keeps practice and precept in separate com - partments , quite as they should be kept if a man values a quiet mind .

		This enables him to offer us precept uncontaminated by prac - tice , requires no very violent accommodation , and accounts perfectly for the high moralistic tone that pervades the book .

		Nothing that Mr.
Davies	PERSON	has to tell us is very shocking , to be sure , only the commonplaces of trampdom , but the copy-book maxim follows pat upon every delinquency , and the sinner by acknowl - edging his sin shows the most flattering defer - ence possible to the conventions and the respectabilities .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 399 Life was full of a number of things for Mr.
Davies	PERSON	during the period of his wander - ings .

		Besides the incidental prickings of con - science , he was troubled , when his mood was low , by the fear that he was overloading his mind with experiences he should never be able to record .

		So far as one can see , there was absolutely nothing to justify this fear : his account of his life is circumstantial and suggests documentation .

		We have his origins and the minor perversities of his childhood , for he was a spirited lad not persuaded of the sacredness of private property .

		We have his apprenticeship in
Bristol	LOCATION	and his reflections on embarking for
America	LOCATION	, lured by grandiose dreams of the new freedom and a desire to see the skyscrapers on the lower end of Man -
hattan Island	LOCATION	.

		Luck was with him from the first , for no sooner had he arrived than he fell in with an experienced gentleman-ad - venturer , who unfolded to him the secret of free travel and free entertainment in the new world .

		Thus he was able to devote his entire time to touring our broad land and reflecting on the amazing altruism of the natives .

		The savoir vivre of tramps may differ slightly from that of gentlemen , but it seems to call for much the same buoyancy , tact , and lat - itude -LRB- in practice only -RRB- of moral adjustments .

		It would seem to be plain that where buoy - ancy and tact are in evidence , the public at least in
America	LOCATION	will not withhold its cakes and ale .

		Mr.
Davies	PERSON	, indeed , often suffered from surfeit , especially a surfeit of dainties , and he can write about this incidental incon - venience of the tramp 's life with genuine feeling .

		On the whole , however , the life suited him down to the ground , and I should advise those who doubt that a poet is infin - itely better equipped than any millionaire to support the burdens of leisure to read the idyllic chapter devoted to a
summer	DATE	outing on
Long Island	LOCATION	.

		Unless life in
Russia	LOCATION	is vastly different from life in the
United States	LOCATION	,
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	has been guilty of filling our minds with sham ro - mances of the road .

		Gorky 's tramps flee complexity and find outside of society some - thing of the simplicity for which they yearn .

		What Mr.
Davies	PERSON	shows us on almost every page is the depressing complexity of a life that requires a special and highly developed technique , a technique quite as varied and difficult to master as that of most trades .

		Rid - ing the rods , for example , is certainly no child 's play , and yet that is only the least of the special dexterities and aptitudes re - quired of the successful tramp .

		On the social side , a knack for popular psychology never of course comes amiss , and only a sense sharp - ened by years of life in the underworld would enable a man to cope with the mysterious affiliations of finance and justice that Mr.
Davies	PERSON	encountered in the jails of our
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		The details of fights and lynchings are set down in prose of an unimaginable placid - ity , and even the loss of a foot in a railway accident does not tempt Mr.
Davies	PERSON	to raise his voice .

		Mr.
Davies	PERSON	is now an established poet , who no longer has to hawk his verses from door to door .

		His reputation , indeed , is considerable , and it may seem unfair to consider his first book of prose quite apart from .

		his poetry .

		But if `` The Autobiography of a Super - Tramp '' has special interest , it is precisely because it shows how completely an unfamiliar medium may refract and distort the image of himself which a writer would convey .

		It is another lesson in sticking to one 's last .

Heinrich Heine	PERSON	POEMS OF
HEINRICH HEINE	PERSON	.

		Three Hundred and Twenty-five Poems Selected and Translated by
Louis Untermeyer	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The test of every creation is the validity of the picture it evokes of the man who wrought it .

		Nothing in
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's paint - ings interests us quite so much as Rembrandt ; the
Fifth Symphony	ORGANIZATION	drives the listener back to
Beethoven	LOCATION	; the bitter beauty of
Heine	LOCATION	's lyrics dissolves into a portrait of that arrest - ing phenomenon , the melancholy Jew ,
Hein	PERSON	- rich
Heine	LOCATION	.

		And as an authentic translator is almost equally a creative artist , we seek to reconstruct him from the elements that compose his work .

		Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	truly dis - closes himself as
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's Doppelgdnger in this volume , which serves at once as a monument to himself and to him whose poetry he pre - sents in English .

		One hesitates to say `` trans - lates '' ;
Grub Street	ORGANIZATION	has made the word odious .

		It has been declared that a good translation is like rare wine poured from one bottle into another without the loss of a single drop .

		For myself , I do not think it can be done ; I am content with the connoisseur who de - cants skilfully and refrains from adding water .

		With Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's Heine I feel that , though the bottle may not be full , it is all grape .

		The automaton who gets his learning by the semesterful and at the end of four years re - ceives a mental equilibrator in the form of a few letters of the alphabet attached to the end of his name is conscious of the precise 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	time and place of his introduction to the gods .

		It was as a Freshman under Smith that he first assisted in the autopsy on Shakespeare ; as a Junior , with
Brown	PERSON	as entrepreneur , he beheld Goethe pirouette be - hind the footlights .

		Others of us are less fortunate ; beginnings are vague like the rec - ollections of childhood , and our appreciation and love of the gods is permeative and with - out definite boundaries .

		So I do not remem - ber when I did not know
Heine	PERSON	, even though my capital may have been but a stanza or a winged word .

		But his spirit came to me truly through
Schumann	PERSON	.

		For a hundred years
Heine	PERSON	has proved an irresistible temptation to song writers ; his lyrics all but set themselves to music .

		I have a vague recollection of somebody with a pas - sion for collecting useless information com - piling a list of some 900 musical settings for `` Du bist wie eine
Blume	PERSON	, '' and that was ten or twenty years ago .

		But compared with the quality of the lyrics themselves the compo - ser 's work usually proves banal ; writers of indifferent music are less likely to suffer from indecent exposure if they stick to inferior texts , for exalted words tend to disclose their nakedness .

		A Franz , a
Schumann	ORGANIZATION	coupled with
Heine	ORGANIZATION	exemplifies the true union de - scribed as `` perfect music set to noble words . ''

		Schumann is
Heine	PERSON	rewritten in terms of an - other art .

		The burst of
spring	DATE	in his con - ception of `` Im wunderschonen
Monat	PERSON	Mai '' and the poignant tragedy of his exquisitely simple musical duplication of ``
Lieb Lieb	PERSON	- chen , leg 's Handchen '' are such authentic counterparts of the poems -LRB- to choose but two from the jewel casket -RRB- , that I can not but feel that the baffling search for a standard by which to appraise the present version of the lyrics discloses none more trying than this music .

		The brilliance of Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's achievement is not dulled by the test ; his English blends into
Schumann	PERSON	as nicely as
Schumann	PERSON	's music encompasses the German translations of
Burns	PERSON	.

		Heine 's simplicity is a trap for the unwary ; it is that of the bland conjurer who rolls up his sleeves to prove the impossibility of con - cealing a card .

		That simplicity is the art that conceals art and can be reproduced only by one who is a poet in his own right , re - sponsive to the same medium and claiming the same racial background .

		It took a Jew - ish poet to translate the Jewish poet .

		It is so amazing that the task has been performed at all that , rather than chide Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	for occasional liberties as in `` The Pilgrim - age to Kevlaar '' and `` The Lesson '' one con - gratulates him upon his pronounced success in not having had to take more .

		In many of the poems the impish ``
Donna Clara	PERSON	'' is a good example he has translated almost literally and preserved the cadence which con - tributes so vitally to the effect .

		Comment on the volume would be inad - equate without reference to Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's scholarly -LRB- not academic -RRB- preface which , ex - cept for its failure to praise the translator , constitutes the best possible review of the work .

		So good is it that we forgive the writer for his reference to `` the balance '' of the poems a violation of the rule laid down by
Bryant	PERSON	when editor of the `` Evening Post '' and an `` abomination , '' according to
Richard Grant White	PERSON	and the printer for his occasional in - souciance in sprinkling diaereses on the Ger - man first lines .

		Butte ,
Montana	LOCATION	, returns to the map ;
Mary MacLane	PERSON	has written another book .

		`` Is it like the first ? ''

		you will ask .

		It is .

		`` Is it as good or as bad ? ''

		It is .

		It is also named nearer to the heart 's de - sire of the author .

		`` The Story of
Mary MacLane	PERSON	, '' dating some twelve years back , had its title imposed from without .

		But `` I ,
Mary MacLane	PERSON	, '' the book of to-day , has surely been named from within .

		One to whom editorial chance gave the op - portunity of making public the first picture and the first biographical sketch of
Butte	ORGANIZATION	's egoistic young sibyl could scarcely remain indifferent to her latest fluttering of leaves ; old associations must be allowed to count .

		The new book , like the other , consists of a series of set-pieces strewn over a palpitating field of passional protoplasm , just as king - crabs and quahaugs and jellyfish and other odd forms of life are strewn over the tide - bared mudflats of
Long Island	LOCATION	.

		The pal - pitant protoplasm , being constant , may be taken for granted ; so one naturally fixes his attention on the set-pieces .

		Such things as ornamented the earlier book things like `` I Await the Devil 's Coming , '' the famous `` Litany '' and the `` Gray Dawn '' are duly succeeded by similar creations , such as the `` Cold Boiled Potato , '' the `` Helliad , '' the rhapsody on
Keats	PERSON	, and the extraordinarily ingenious , fantastic , and poignant chapter on the visits of `` My Soul . ''

		The best of these
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 401 jeux d' artifice show unmistakably the gains in experience and in skill made during the intervening years ; they are rather better in themselves and rather better adjusted to their background .

		Yes , the web now spun by the
Arachne	PERSON	of the
Copper Hills	ORGANIZATION	is somewhat finer than the first one , and somewhat more delicate even when indelicate .

		As for the
Mary MacLane	PERSON	of
1917	DATE	, she is essentially the same creature as in
1905	DATE	.

		The comet has returned , after many years in the dark void , - with as much incandescence and momentum as ever .

		In a chronological re - view of the many
Mary MacLanes	PERSON	, for `` Introspection '' has wrapped our adven - turer in a '' Winding Sheet , '' we are told through what spaces the comet has journeyed during these years -LRB- and others -RRB- , and we learn something of the various bodies not always celestial past which it has hurtled .

		And to-day the skyey voyager sits `` here this midnight in a neat blue chair in this Butte ,
Montana	LOCATION	, '' with all the old hamperings still holding and all the old hankerings still unappeased , and pauses to consider her own representative quality .

		She is conscious of a legion of women of the same `` psychic breed , '' who `` may be sitting lonely in neat red or neat blue or neat gray or neat any-colored chairs '' in
Wichita	LOCATION	, or
South Bend	LOCATION	, or
Waco	LOCATION	, or La Crosse , or in some other of many places , `` each waiting , waiting always wait - ing all her life not hopeful and passionate like Eighteen , but patient or blasphemous or scornful or volcanic like Early-Thirty : ... each more or less roundly hating '' her Waco or
Wichita	LOCATION	, or whatever other place : `` and each beset by hot unquiet human - nesses inside her and an old yearn of sex and the blood warring with myriad minute tenets dating from civilization 's dawn-times . ''

		One may read the newer
Mary MacLane	PERSON	and feel , after all these years , save for a touch of impatience over a problem that re - mains static , but little change of sentiment toward her .

		One is conscious , as before , of an admiring wonder at the power of her un - tamable and unclassifiable `` call '' to write , and at the amazing fashion in which , as a unique source of primary energy , she spins litera - ture out of her very inner self ; and one re - tains -LRB- whether impatience supervene or no -RRB- a disposition , while viewing the temerarious disclosures of this very special soul , to be a little tender and a little sorry .

		But perhaps
Mary MacLane	PERSON	, world-weary and world - hardened , would not greatly thank one for being either .

		NOTES ON NEW FICTION In `` Aurora the Magnificent , '' by
Gertrude Hall	PERSON	-LRB- Century ;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , the reader finds himself in
Florence	LOCATION	, consorting with the sophisticated
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American colony .


Aurora	LOCATION	, with a maiden friend , descends on the American consul , wanting said he to his wife `` Everything quite frankly every - thing .

		They have grown tired of their hotel ; they speak nothing but English and do n't know a soul .

		They came to find out from me how to go about getting a house and servants , horses and carriages ... '' `` Did they think that was a part of a consul 's duty ? ''

		commented his wife .

		`` They did n't think .

		They cast themselves on the breast of a fellow-countryman .

		They caught at a plank . ''

		Thus having descended on the consul ,
Aurora	LOCATION	pro- ceeds to make herself the most conspicuous person in the story .

		She is the `` real thing , '' in `` United States , '' a jolly , blooming goddess of liberty , who , by grace of dimples , an unforgettable smile , and faith in God , finds her primitive idiom , her rib - poking humor , and her childlike innocence of con - vention accepted by the cultivated Florentines ; the most fastidious and morbidly cynical aesthete of them all elopes with her .

		People who frankly enjoy love-mazes will like this story ; it is written with grace and simplicity , and an honest insight into the thoughts and experiences with which most folk most of the time are engrossed .

		Those who yearn for light on the vaster perplexities of the human struggle en masse , might as well pass it by .

		There is a certain type of mind inclined to de - vour greedily the species of fiction in which the characters talk `` naturally . ''

		Smart conversation , flippant wit , brilliant epigram , it rejects , fearing and distrusting such dangerous and irritating con - diments .

		A simple mental diet is preferred , one that edifies but does not unduly stimulate .

		Alas , that cleverness and sobriety so seldom meet and mingle .

		It is , of course , wise and right to prefer the meat and ` taters of literature to a prolonged feast of syllabub sallies .

		It is also human to yearn for a dash of humor , a grain of common sense to aid in the digestion of portentous prob - lems set forth in the form of fiction .

		`` The Lifted Veil , '' by
Basil King	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 1.40	MONEY	-RRB- , is not ex - actly a `` problem '' novel .

		It has , however , a pur - pose : it treats of sin .

		We know that in the first chapter .

		A veiled lady , suffering from remorse , visits a polite and mystified clergyman , explains that she is the sort of woman `` called a sinner , '' and adds : `` You know what that means ? ''

		He says he does .

		To and fro , round and round , in and out , up and down , over and over , sin is batted , upheld , excused , condemned , forgiven , discussed over tea cups and at dinner tables and almost anywhere .

		Sometimes we are astonished , but we are never allowed to be shocked .

		A spade is not too much of a spade , and white cotton gloves are worn when handling delicate subjects .

		We are sorry for the hero .

		He preached earnestly to everybody and everybody told him how good he was even - the heroine , and she said `` extraordinarily good . ''

		He bore the infliction of goodness patiently , until he could stand no more , and in desperation , he cried 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	to all the world that he was but a man like other men .

		`` Hush ! ''

		said everybody .

		The plot is not new .

		The clergyman fell in love with the sinner ; she was touched ; she preferred , however , a man she could not trample on .

		We did not find the man of her choice attractive , but we liked Mary Gal - loway .

		She did her duty as a matter of course and talked but little .

		A harmless book , carelessly constructed , somewhat verbose , and arriving no - where in particular .

		Says
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	in his Foreword to `` In a Little Town '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- : `` A village is simply a quiet street in the big city of the world .

		Quaint , sweet happenings take place in the avenues most thronged , and desperate events come about in sleepy lanes .

		People are people , chance is chance . ''

		The promise is not fulfilled .

		The stories contain excellent material , hastily handled .

		These cheerful , ordinary , humanly vulgar folk fail to arouse interest because their creator writes of them but not for them .

		They are crude snapshots rather than artistic photographs .

		`` And This is Marriage '' strikes the highest note .

		In `` Pain '' there is power and pathos in spite of the lack of terseness and simplicity .

		There is humor of a kind .

		It is unnecessary to comment upon it .

		After reading the first chapter of Mr.
Alfred Tressider Sheppard	PERSON	's `` The Rise of Ledgar Dun - stan , '' the reviewer said to herself , here is another leisurely chronicle of an Englishman , told in the customary realistic fashion , introducing the usual misunderstood , supersensitive child who develops great ability .

		Not so .


Ledgar Dunstan	PERSON	did not awake to find himself famous .

		He was detached .

		He despised religion .

		Morbid things attracted him ; he was fascinated by sin , though he made no experiments in sowing wild oats .

		He liked `` dead things . ''

		He wrote with some success , and his marriage , at the close of the book , appeared to please him .

		He met queer people more or less interesting .

		He was content to watch them and to speculate concerning life , death , and love .

		He had no fixed opinions .

		Other characters , however , suffered from an idee fixe , what may be called the Anti-Christ motif , on which they discourse at length .

		In brief , this is
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's prophecy of a `` world-war , after which arose a man , who should hold the attention of the world for nine years ... and another figure would arise , who should reconstruct society after the upheaval .

		There you have Anti-Christ , and possibly the Second Coming . ''

		Is Ledgar Dunstan to be the Anti-Christ in the second book ?

		The author promises us that we may continue the adventures of this vacillating gentle - man in a volume entitled `` The Quest of Ledgar Dunstan . ''

		This also leaves one at sea as to whether the hero is to take part in the European conflict , to shirk and fail , to await the
Second Coming	ORGANIZATION	, or to continue to be a detached spectator .

		So absorbed is Mr.
Sheppard	PERSON	in this Anti-Christ motif that Ledgar becomes more and more blurred in outline as the book proceeds .

		Frankly , it is a bit puzzling .

		Nevertheless , let us hope that the sequel may fulfil the promise of what seems to be the author 's first book .

		It is interesting and has merit .

Kathleen Norris	PERSON	's latest work , `` The Undertow . ''

		Vague recollections of the
Elsie Books	ORGANIZATION	float through our minds as we read .

		But the moral now is , `` Be poor and you 'll be happy . ''

		The undertow of social strivings , the burning of the valuables , and the new and tender life in a garage might have been made fairly readable if Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	had retained the freshness and vigor of her earlier writings .

		But it is all as flat and stale as yesterday 's beer .

		Even the characters hardly live .

		They move vaguely across the screen in the all-too-well-known progress of their lives .

		If Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	wishes to do any more moral tales , she must make them more vivid and alive or her readers will fly for relief to the latest detective story .

Zephine Humphrey	PERSON	has written a very charming , if somewhat illogical , book in `` Grail Fire . ''

		The theme is the spiritual struggle and development of a man and the woman he loves .

		His father 's pas - sionate love of beauty and his mother 's stern Pur - itanism give him a peculiar temperament , which finds its complete satisfaction in the
Catholic Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author develops this idea so fully that it sounds rather illogical when she attempts to prove that the hero 's church is the only one for the whole world , which obviously con - tains many puritanical mothers and pagan fathers .

		The love between the hero and the heroine develops from a tender boy-and-girl romance to the full - blown love of man and woman , which through reli - gion is exalted to a mystical and wholly spiritual union .

		Miss
Humphrey	PERSON	handles this theme , on the whole , very beautifully .

		Although `` Grail Fire '' may be a bit too idealistic for the average mortal , we predict that all the sixteen-year-olds in the land will find it absolutely true to life .

		The new novel by
Louis Dodge	PERSON	, `` Children of the Desert '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is a work of in - tense concentration and elimination .

		The bare story is told of a woman 's enforced misfortune , of her concealment from her husband of her past life , and of the husband 's consequent disillusion - ment and ruin .

		Into it the author has introduced but little that is extraneous , and still more un - usual , but little that is purely sentimental .

		That little is to be deplored , as well as the looseness of style , which is inconsistent with the clear-cut outlines of the story .

		But one finds reason for rejoicing in a novel so full of truthful evaluation , and of the real stuff of story-telling .

		It is grim , almost sordid in spots ; but it is , after all , real .

		The setting is the Mexican border ; the woman ,
Sylvia	PERSON	, `` a daughter of the desert a bit of that jetsam which the
Rio Grande	ORGANIZATION	leaves upon its arid banks as it journeys stealthily to the sea '' ; the man ,
Harboro	PERSON	, an honest , hard-working sort with sensibilities above his conventionality of outlook ; the tragedy , the conflict between his deep if some - what conventional nobility , and his wife 's wan - dering affections .

		That
Harboro	PERSON	and
Sylvia	PERSON	are inherently and eternally one does not appear to them until after the occurrence of the ultimate tragedy , and it is doubtful after all if that con -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 403 viction could have overridden the sense of injury and the inevitable suspicions of the future .

		Here is the point at which the author shows his strength , in refusing to turn aside from truth to character for the sake of a speciously happy ending .

		He has shown in this latest novel an underlying strength and determination that ought to carry him a long way , and that should also lead him to overcome the looseness of writing that is such a blot upon his careful structure .

		There is a certain sentimental intimacy that some authors affect in relation to their characters that is more repulsive than the most outspoken lan - guage of your Fieldings or your Smolletts .

		Cosmo
Hamilton	PERSON	, in ``
Joan	PERSON	and the Babies and I '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1	MONEY	-RRB- , taking on the guise of a middle - aged seeker after matrimony an author remarks , `` A pencil , a block , and sincerity that 's all I needed for my job '' ; but the result of this sincerity closely resembles the production of the famous movie - queen who `` projected her very soul upon the screen '' and proved it to be a thing of slight edi - fication .

		Were there only the possibility of his being insincere , one might more easily forgive this master of the protracted brevity in which `` I was hers , and she was mine , and that was all . ''

		Con - demned by his own confession , he stands as an exemplar of that lack of reticence or lack of frankness , it is hard to say which that is the be - setting sin of American literature .

		Red-bloodedness is not the prevailing fault of modern fiction .

		The average would-be thriller is , on the contrary , of the order of `` The Tiger 's Coat , '' by
Elizabeth Dejeans	PERSON	-LRB- Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , which is a rather lifeless affair of good promise and of weak fulfilment .

		The fact is that modern authors , like modern playwrights , afraid of alienating the sympathies of their public , have a consequent horror of depraved heroines or of heroes that lack the sensibilities of an eighteenth century female , and turn out `` sensational '' novels incapable of turning the hair of a ten-year-old .


Marie Ogilvie	PERSON	bears as much resemblance to a household cat as to the tiger which advertises the book , and the story itself may be described as a series of anticlimaxes .

		The hero of `` The Highwayman , '' by
H. C. Bailey	PERSON	-LRB- Button ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is of the type that the
Baroness Orczy	PERSON	delights in drawing imperturb - able , expressionless , of an ironical turn of mind , and possessed of depths which a woman 's charm alone can stir .

		In the generation of
Harry Boyce	PERSON	these qualities cried out for adventure and ro - mance , for it was also the generation of the `` good '' Queen
Anne	PERSON	, of the Pretender , and of the great Duke of
Marlborough	LOCATION	.

		With all these did our hero have dealings , but more especially was he lured by the charms of the wayward
Alison	PERSON	, whom fate and the impulse of a moment had given him to wife .

		No common pair was this , and no com - mon tale is Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	's .

		The author is evidently well acquainted with the work of the novelists and the playwrights of the eighteenth century , and his wit is more after the manner of Fielding or of
Wycherley	PERSON	than of the later and the modern historical sentimentalists .

		`` The Highwayman '' is a good brisk story for those not too squeamish .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS CICERO : A Sketch of His Life and Works .

		By
Hannis Taylor	PERSON	.

		McClurg ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Hannis Taylor	PERSON	is well known as a consti - tutional lawyer and a writer of scholarly stand - ing on the English and American constitutions and related subjects .

		It was in recognition of such standing that he served the country for a time , under appointment of President
Cleveland	LOCATION	, as Minister Plenipotentiary to
Spain	LOCATION	; for we do occasionally fill such positions with men of con - spicuous fitness for the work to be done .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	was educated on the broad lines which were a little more generally in vogue in his younger days than at present , and so his studies in the modern foliage and fruitage of constitutional law are based on a considerable knowledge of the roots of this tree , lying back in the mould of Greek and Roman antiquity .

		No really educated student of law fails of an interest in
Cicero	LOCATION	, and to Mr.
Tay	PERSON	- lor the great orator and statesman of the expiring Roman republic has always been one of the su - premely attractive figures of the ancient Mediter - ranean world .

		But no man can study
Cicero	PERSON	apart from
Rome	LOCATION	, and so he has made his book , as indi - cated by its secondary title , `` a commentary on the Roman constitution and Roman public life . ''

		The last 150 pages of the volume are given to an ex - tensive collection of noteworthy quotations from
Cicero	LOCATION	's writings , the original text followed in each case by an English rendering .

		There are thus three aspects of Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's work to be consid - ered : his appreciation of
Cicero	PERSON	as a man , his presentation of the Roman constitution , and the adequacy of his `` anthology '' of quotations .

		In dealing with
Cicero	PERSON	as a man , Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	writes from an entirely sympathetic point of view , yield - ing in no particular to the Drumann-Mommsen assault , which is now very generally regarded as having injured the fame of two eminent German historians far more than that of
Cicero	LOCATION	.

		What appeals most strongly to Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	in
Cicero	LOCATION	's life and writings is the moral element , to which , of course , he concedes a genuine sincerity , while admitting the occasional failure of the philosopher to hold his life up to the level of his creed .

		One feels a more appreciative sympathy in that respect after reading the touching correspondence with
Servius Sulpicius Rufus	ORGANIZATION	which followed the death of
Cicero	PERSON	's beloved daughter ,
Tullia	LOCATION	, in which the ability and duty to bear up manfully under afflic - tion was in question .

		These two letters ought to find a place in full in any life of
Cicero	LOCATION	, but Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	quotes only a brief fragment from each .

		One can not read far into the private correspond - ence of
Cicero	PERSON	without conviction of his intense `` humanness , '' in the most modern connotation of the term , as well as his statelier Roman human - itas .

		As to
Cicero	PERSON	's moral position , Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's main thesis is that `` when the great orator laid down the dexterous arts of the advocate and as - sumed the stern moral and patriotic duties of the statesman , he at the same time put aside the quibbling skepticism of the Academy for the lofty precepts of the new world-religion known as stoi - 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	cism , by which the jurists of
Rome	LOCATION	became com - pletely enthralled . ''

		Objectors may quote largely from
Cicero	LOCATION	himself in opposition to this , but they will hardly succeed in showing that it did not represent the deeper tendencies of
Cicero	ORGANIZATION	's mind .

		It need not be said , and the author of course does not say , that
Cicero	PERSON	was the man to work out and adhere to a complete and self - consistent philosoph - ical platform .

		There were interesting and impor - tant characteristics in
Cicero	LOCATION	's life which receive little or no attention at Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's hands , but it was only to be expected that his particular point of view would determine his selection and em - phasis .

		He did not commit himself to an exhaus - tive treatment of the subject .

		As `` a commentary on the Roman constitution , '' the book is not ade - quate .

		Of course it is illuminating in what it attempts , but the title would naturally lead one to expect much more than one finds .

		One may read it through with all care and still have no adequate theoretical conception of the Roman constitution as a whole , no complete , detailed knowledge of even any single one of its various parts , and no very clear idea of its practical administration .

		Much of it will hardly yield its meaning to the reader who has not gone pretty deeply into the subject in the works of other writers .

		In view of Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's other achievements in constitutional-his - tory writing , one is forced to the view that the sub - title in this case was chosen without due reflection as to what it would seem to promise , and that there was no real intention to give anything like a com - plete presentation of the Roman constitutional system .

		The Ciceronian `` anthology '' with which the book closes was a project so well worth while that it should have been based upon a very thor - ough and independent rereading of
Cicero	LOCATION	's entire works .

		As it stands , much of the material has been picked up from secondary sources , with a certain amount of annoying and unnecessary repetition , and displaying various grades of skill , or want of skill , in translation .

		Still , one will not open these selections at any point without proof that he is in contact with an alert , noble , and versatile mind , occupying itself with the problems not of the moment but of all times and of all men .

		CAMPAIGN DIARY OF A FRENCH OFFICER .

		By
Sous-Lieutenant Rene Nicholas	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		If we are to believe the author , this book was jotted down page by page on troop trains , in coun - try inns , in the trenches , and partly also perhaps on a hospital cot .

		An intrusive friend explains , half apologetically , in the preface , that it is with - out those literary flourishes that it would have been so easy to add apres coup .

		Such spiritual obtuseness is worse than immorality .

		If the French do not soon learn that their magnificent tradition is in danger of becoming bankrupt through sheer triviality , their literature will cease to interest the rest of the world .

		To polish sen - tences in which one speaks of the most intimate abominations of slaughter and of the continuing nightmare of life in a country bursting with corpses and filled with insanity and disease , is a task for romantic children perhaps but not for men .

		Happily
Rene Nicholas	PERSON	was better inspired ; his book is everywhere simple , frank , humane .

		He gives you a bit of the war as the man in the trenches sees it , not the disillusioned and weary veteran , but the recruit filled with the traditional French idea of glory and devotion to his country .

		M.
Nicholas	PERSON	began his campaigning in the mud of Champagne , and his diary traces his adventures up to
May 9 , 1915	DATE	, when he fell , seriously wounded , between the French and the German lines during the
Artois	PERSON	offensive .

		The account of this terrible adventure , when he found himself shot down in the cross-fire of the two armies and had to drag himself inch by inch toward a shell crater , into which he tumbled to wait , with other wretches , until the coming of the dark , gives one a fresh sense of the degree to which this war has made the horrible commonplace .

		One can not suppose that
M. Nich	PERSON	- olas 's experience or his fortitude is at all unusual .

		Such daily horrors must be the very stuff of life to thousands .

		To read of them , thus calmly set down ^ is to realize once more what an adaptable creature man is and to be filled with wonder that the mere threat of hell should have tortured his imagination for ages .

		THE HUMAN DRIFT .

		By
Jack London	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.


Jack London	PERSON	was consistently the man of action .

		That is given both positive and negative proof in `` The Human Drift . ''

		The bulk of the book is taken up by five sketches of adventures in which the author figures as the hero .

		Where he is con - cerned , adventure never has to come all the way ; quite the contrary , indeed , for so great is his appe - tite for it that he seeks it wherever it may still be found in
Quito	LOCATION	,
Ecuador	LOCATION	, or the
South Sea Islands	LOCATION	.

		A sailor on a big ocean liner is not a sailor to him .

		He must know how to sail a oinall boat along the
Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	and up its rivers before
London	LOCATION	will grant him recognition .

		Again , not for him the malodorous gasoline car to tour
California	LOCATION	, but four horses and a light rig .

		If the horses have to be trained to pull together and taught not to bite each other or kick or sit down on the harness at hairpin turns in the road well , so much the better .

		While reading these tales , it is brought fully home to one what a multum in parvo his life was a pitiful short - ness packed full by his boyish eagerness .

		The article which lends its name to the book is a short essay on economics , and
London	LOCATION	does just what you would expect from a man of his type .

		He produces his figures and expects them to be final , when , as a matter of fact , figures are most deceitful , as many statisticians have learned to their sorrow .

		Moreover , he settles the whole ques - tion summarily .

		In twenty-seven pages he dis - poses of the wanderings of the human race on the earth , the question of the population 's press - ing against the subsistence line , and of the earth 's becoming too cold for human existence .

		He adopts the theory of Malthus quite uncritically .

		In specu - lating on the end of the world ,
London	LOCATION	introduces
Spencer	PERSON	's theory of alternate eras of Evolution and Dissolution into his short discussion , and here he is finally led to evolve and give us his personal
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 405 philosophy .

		`` In eternity which is beyond our comprehension , the particular evolution of that solar satellite we call the ` Earth ' occupied but a slight fraction of time .

		And of that fraction of time man occupies but a small portion ... For us who live , no worse can happen than has hap - pened to the earliest drifts of man ... There is nothing terrible about it .

		With
Richard Hovey	PERSON	, when he faced his death , we can say : ` Behold !

		I have lived ! '

		And with another and greater one , we can lay ourselves down with a will .

		The one drop of living , the one taste of being , has been good ; and perhaps our greatest achievement will be that we dreamed immortality , even though we failed to realise it . ''

		Thus
London	LOCATION	portrays him - self : the man of action , the lover of adventure , the self-made philosopher , who is not afraid of danger or death .

		BUDDHA AND THE GOSPEL OF BUDDHISM .

		By
Ananda Coomaraswamy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Putnam 's ;
$ 3.75	MONEY	.

		Ever since the foundation of the science of com - parative religions , scholars have turned with especial interest to the religious history of
India	LOCATION	.

		We now have many valuable works describing the religions of that country in a scholarly fashion , but the book before us is not one of them .

		In fact , there is nothing scholarly about this book ; as a contribution to scientific knowledge , it is nil .

		Its accounts of the legendary life of
Gautama	LOCATION	and his teaching , the discussions of the contemporary religious systems of
India	LOCATION	and of the later devel - opments of Buddhism , as well as the concluding chapters on Buddhist art , are all a hotch-potch of quotations from modern scholars .

		Whole pages are copied word for word from
Oldenberg	PERSON	and the
Rhys Davids	PERSON	, while even the `` Encyclopaedia Britannica '' is freely drawn upon .

		If one wishes to get a general view of Buddhism , he will do better to turn to any popular manual , say the one by Mrs.
Rhys Davids	PERSON	in the `` Home University Library , '' which is far better than the present work , and only costs one-seventh as much .

		But the author frankly admits that his work is not designed as `` an addition to our already over - burdened libraries of information , but as a definite contribution to the philosophy of life . ''

		It is not as a scholar , but as a missionary that he writes this book for us , and the book is confessedly a work of propaganda .

		As an argument for Buddhism , it is not particularly convincing , but for people who like that kind of thing , it may be just the kind of thing they like .

		But the mere fact that such books make their appearance and even suc - ceed in attracting a certain amount of attention is in itself profoundly significant : it illustrates in a striking manner a tendency of our civiliza - tion .

		Parallels between
Rome	LOCATION	in the centuries immediately preceding and following the birth of Christ , and western
Europe	LOCATION	in the nine - teenth and twentieth centuries are by no means lacking .

		The old Roman social organization had broken down , and then as now men were eagerly seeking a new one .

		Many of the faults of our present civilization were not lacking then : the imperialism and war , the enormous fortunes , the idle and sometimes vicious upper classes , the wide divergence between the upper and lower classes , the frequent divorces , the immigration of large numbers of foreigners .

		In fine , the semi-anarchy of the two epochs has frequently been commented upon .

		In their religious history , the two periods are just as much alike .

		In
Rome	LOCATION	the traditional beliefs had been pretty generally discarded .

		Some people , such as the Stoics , tried to `` modernize '' the old religion ; others , such as the Epicureans , took refuge in a materialistic philosophy .

		Neo - Platonism and Gnosticism became widely popular , each showing startling resemblances to modern
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		And finally new religions were imported wholesale ; Oriental cults , such as those of
Isis	ORGANIZATION	, Attis and Adonis , Mithraism and Judaism , all found converts ; then as now , Buddhism was offered as a solution of the religious problem .

		But none of these was destined to a great success .

		The religion which finally won the Roman world was not a foreign cult nor an esoteric philosophy , but Christianity , which , during the first two centuries of its existence , resembled the Socialist Party more than any other modern organization .

		Of course , the early Christians always showed themselves will - ing to borrow freely from these other religions and philosophies : some of the
Fathers	ORGANIZATION	, such as
Origen	LOCATION	, were closer to the Neo-Platonists than to the Gospels , it seems ; Gnosticism entered the church with St.
Paul	PERSON	, `` the greatest of the Gnostics '' -LRB- Reitzenstein -RRB- ; the first generation of Christians adopted rites of baptism and a sacra - mental meal from contemporary cults ; even in the
Gospel of John	ORGANIZATION	we find the Greek idea of immortality invoked to explain statements of Jesus in regard to the material and earthly Mes - sianic Kingdom which he expected .

		But in spite of all of this syncretism , Christianity never was a foreign cult ; it was and remained a religion of the Roman Empire and for the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	it was only after the Reformation that the Ger - manic races really found themselves at home in it .

		In the
Christianity of Augustine	ORGANIZATION	we find the final working out of the religious genius of the Roman people , not a foreign cult to which they had turned .

		Perhaps this religious development of Imperial
Rome	LOCATION	may have a lesson for us to-day .

		He would indeed be rash who prophesied as to the religious future of our country , but we may at least hope that now as then religious chaos will ultimately come to an end .

		It is safe to say , moreover , that when this does come about , it will not be through the acceptance of some ready-made religion from
Europe	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	, or
Africa	LOCATION	, but through the gradual creation of a religion on our part , just as one was created out of the life-blood of the people of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is hard to see a brilliant future for Buddhism in
America	LOCATION	.

		ENGLAND 'S WORLD EMPIRE .

		Some Reflections upon its Growth and Policy .

		By
Alfred Hoyt Granger	PERSON	.

		Open Court ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` The one object of this book '' says its author toward the end , `` is to call the attention of its readers to what has been
Great Britain	LOCATION	's policy towards foreign nationalities for the past three hundred years , to urge caution before deciding to 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 3	DATE	irrevocably tie ourselves up to her or to any one power . ''

		England 's imperial policy , strong and successful , but not over-scrupulous , is instruc - tively sketched , and a word of warning is inciden - tally uttered against espousing any cause supported by despotic
Kussia	LOCATION	.

		Also it is asserted that we `` have been most severe in our treatment of German infringements of international law . ''

		All this and much else show the temper of the book which is intended to be , and generally is , fair and open-minded and chary of expression of per - sonal bias .

		But important history has been mak - ing in the short time since it was written , and its well-meant caution comes too late .

		Therefore it is to be valued rather as a survey of the past than as a warning to which this country can now give heed in shaping its future course .

		Certain English war articles , now suppressed by the gov - ernment , are appended .

		THE GOLDEN VERSES OP PYTHAGORAS .

		By
Fabre	PERSON	d'Olivet .

		Done into English by
Nayan Louise Redfield	ORGANIZATION	.

		Putnam ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Fabre d'Olivet died in
1825	DATE	.

		At no time have orthodox scholars taken him and his attempts to recover what is called the ancient wisdom seriously .

		His theories , however , have been popularized by
M. Edouard Schurer	PERSON	in his cinematic survey of religions , `` Les Grands Inities , '' and have had considerable success .

		For readers of English who prefer to take
Fabre	PERSON	d'Olivet in his own version ,
Miss Redfield	PERSON	translated some years ago his prin - cipal work , `` The Hermeneutic Interpretation of the Origin of the Social State of Man , '' and she now gives us the present volume with its imposing title , `` The Golden Verses of Pythagoras Explained and Rendered into French and Preceded by a Discourse on the Essence and Form of Poetry among the Principal Peoples of the
Earth	LOCATION	. ''

		His translation of the verses proper into what he calls `` eumolpiques , '' unrhymed alexandrines with alternate masculine and feminine endings , has not yet revolutionized French poetry as he hoped .

		His erudition is indeed `` disconcerting . ''

		We are disap - pointed that he does not settle once and for all the question of why Pythagoras advised his dis - ciples to abstain from beans , though he does tell us that the sage himself was never a prig about it , and made at least a show of tasting not beans alone but even meat and wine when they were set before him .

		We may gather from this that the taboo was not meant to be taken literally .

		Ac - cording to
Fabre	PERSON	d'Olivet the ancients hid their unearthly knowledge about life and the gods from all but the initiate , veiling it in words of double meaning , in symbols and allegories , that it might not fall into the hands of fools and knaves .

		He excuses himself for trying to reveal these mysteries on the ground that secrecy is no longer necessary ; skepticism being so general in the modern world and fools and knaves so sure they know all there is to know that , no matter how plainly stated , knowledge escapes them .

		BRIEFER , MEXTION Mr. 0 .


W. Smith	PERSON	, in his `` Trout Lore '' -LRB- Stokes ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , differs from most recent writers on trout fish - ing in giving much attention to the less conven - tional methods , such as fishing at night , baiting with worms and with grasshoppers , and fishing with a deeply sunken fly .

		In discussing these , he defends his sportsmanship in a way that almost suggests a guilty conscience , and sometimes he is not quite happy in his argument .

		`` That one method of fishing is in itself more sportsmanlike than an - other is a fallacy , '' is a rash statement unless well qualified .

		The remark that when using a spinner `` Wherever the battle is fought , it usually ends in the angler 's favor '' would be equally true of taking trout with shotgun or net .

		But the ethics of fish - ing is a matter of spirit rather than of set rule , and no one who reads the whole book , especially the concluding chapters on `` The Empty Creel and the Full '' and `` The Fascination of Trout Fish - ing , '' will be likely to question that the author is a sportsman at heart .

		Why , then , does the gentle - man protest so much ?

		An interesting feature of the book is the classification of trout according to habitat .

		In the chapter on `` The Trout in the Pan '' are some promising recipes for brook-side cooking that tempt to experiment this
spring	DATE	.

		`` Human Welfare Work in
Chicago	LOCATION	'' will be a valuable handbook for those interested in gaining a bird 's - eye view of the many activities which a modern city carries on for the benefit of its family .

		No doubt the American city yet lacks many of those municipal qualities which make urban life abroad so attractive , but the foundations are being laid for a future which will be far more cosmopol - itan than the average citizen realizes .

		It is not until one comes upon the full list of municipal activities , as in such a volume as the present , that the scope and significance of that future are pos - sible of realization .

		The volume is edited by
Colonel H. C. Carbaugh	PERSON	, of the South Park Com - mission , and contains chapters on the following aspects of civic life : art , compiled by the editor ; music , by
Karleton Hackett	PERSON	; public schools , by
John D. Shoop	PERSON	; the public library , by
Henry E. Legler	PERSON	; parks and boulevards , by
J. F. Neil	PERSON	: pub - lic recreation , by
John R. Richards	PERSON	, and summaries of philanthropic work , the work of religious or - ganizations , and neighborhood work .

		The volume contains much statistical information and is amply illustrated .

		The essays of
William James	PERSON	are so stimulating that it is well to make them readily available in attractive form .

		The little volume , `` On Vital Reserves , '' contains the `` Energies of Men , '' `` which discusses the relation between the mental output and the reservoir of supply , as it is drawn upon by the stimuli of interest and excitement .

		With this essay is included the `` Gospel of Relaxation '' from the `` Talks to Teachers , '' which shows that mere absorption of energy leads to tension rather than efficiency , and that the human machine must have vents as well as periods of release .

		Both statements are models of expression .

		They de - serve the wider circulation which , in this form , they promise to attain .

		I then asked him how he knew that , to which he said ` no matter , the thing is so ! '


Gouverneur Morris	PERSON	held in the Convention that if the right of suffrage were given to all freemen the government would undoubtedly become an aris - tocracy , since it would put it in the power of men whose business created numerous dependents .

		Dr.
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	also spoke on the subject .

		He observed that in time of war a country owed much to the lower class of citizens .

		Our late war was an instance of what they could suffer and per - form .

		The New Republic says : `` Here is a human being who has brought to the consideration of the war an intellect of extraordinary scrupu - lousness , an imagination penetrated with con - sciousness of human values , a broad and serious sense of responsibility , a complete emancipa - tion from personal motives and a complete in - dependence of class and party and creed ... To read ` Why Men Fight ' with any sympathy is to be entranced by the honesty , the con - centration , the intelligence , the equilibrium of its author ... The principles of democracy and liberty are absolutely his principles . ''

MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	A Record of One Year 's Personal Experience With The
British Expeditionary Force	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	BOULOGNE THE SOMME 1916-17 With an Account of the Imprisonment , Trial and Death of
Edith Cavell	PERSON	At a meeting held in honor of
Edith Cavell	PERSON	, in
Steinert Hall	PERSON	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Dec. 11 , 1915	DATE	, it was decided that an ``
Edith Cavell	PERSON	Nurse from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	'' should be offered to the Eng - lish
Government	ORGANIZATION	, to serve with the British Ex - peditionary
Force	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	, for the duration of the war .

		Money was promptly subscribed , and
Miss Alice Fitzgerald	PERSON	was chosen , and the spirit in which she is carrying out her mission , and something of what that spirit means to her wounded in
France	LOCATION	, may be inferred from the following record .

		These brief extracts from her letters to members of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	and to other friends in
America	LOCATION	and in
France	LOCATION	, tell us little of what she feels .

		Their unconscious - ness makes them the more telling .

		It gives them , as we believe the reader will inevitably feel , a place heroic as it is humble , among the first-hand documents of the war .

		In the courageous , self-forgetful , truth-loving life of
Edith Cavell	PERSON	we meet , with an extraordi - nary sense of intimacy , a woman so beautiful of soul that I want every teacher in the land and every child in school to hear the story of her sacrifice .

John E. Eob	PERSON	- inson 447 NOTES AND NEWS 450 LIST OF NEW BOOKS .

		452 CASUAL , COMMENT THE OFFICIAL APOLOGISTS OF
GERMANY	LOCATION	1TOUJ the beginning of the war have been the intel - lectuals , especially the historians and the philosophers .

		The historians , indeed , have revealed themselves as simple pamphleteers , incapable of crossing the national frontiers or of thinking except in terms of Kultur , and the net result of their zeal has been to dis - credit the whole caste of learned soothsayers in the eyes of the common man .

		An exhibi - tion of futility so nai 've and conducted on so gigantic a scale could not but have its effect on scholars throughout the world .

		It has clearly put them on the defensive and sub - jected them to general suspicion .

		THE DIAL prints elsewhere in the present issue a letter from Professor
McLaughlin	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, outlining a plan for utilizing dur - ing the war the special training and skill of American historians .

		Here is a chance for scholarship to recover its prestige .

		If Amer - ica is to learn to think internationally , it will have need of just such orientation as the his - torians and students of government are best equipped to supply .

		What we shall all need to learn is to think in terms of the democratic problem throughout the world , for it is becom - ing clearer as the war goes on that our only hope of substituting a really durable peace for the armed truce of the past lies in extend - ing indefinitely the scope of popular control .

		THE QUESTION OF TEMPO IN PUBLIC SPEAK - ING came up , through the medium of contrast and comparison , at the meeting held in the Auditorium , early this month , to welcome the French commission .

		The honors went to the French themselves .

		Too many American speakers employ a largo a slow progress from word to word and from sentence to sentence ; and at least three of them , at this meeting , fell too easily at times into a kind of elegiac drawl .

		The effect of this deliberate method is sometimes that of trying for a greater emphasis than the subject-matter de - mands , sometimes that of addressing a body of slow-working minds with an elementary indulgence , and sometimes that of lingering for the encouragement of applause .

		It is often easy enough to travel ahead of an `` orator , '' and when his auditory can finish his sentences for him before he finishes them 422 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	for himself , the effect of this on his effects is prejudicial .

		Nobody , however , was able to travel ahead of
M. Viviani	PERSON	, the principal speaker of the evening : but not because he spoke in a language which no more than one in twenty of those present was acquainted with .

		His tempo throughout was a fluent allegretto ; his drive , his elan communicated itself to all , and a state of emotional fusion and unity was reached almost at once and was maintained throughout .

		His personal impact , despite the barrier of language , was felt in its full force .

		If he had spoken more slowly , a few more people might have understood him better , but fewer would have felt him so well .

		Toward the end of the evening
General Joffre	ORGANIZATION	, after repeated urgings , spoke half a dozen sentences , of course in French , and followed them with a deprecatory gesture , as if to say : `` There , that is the best I can do . ''

		But what he did was perfectly au fait .

		He addressed us with composure , with preci - sion , without either hurrying or lagging , with a native Gallic sense for style and form , and communicated a feeling that an immense re - serve power was stowed within .

		The French showed us , in a double demonstration , both how well they could fight and how well they could speak .

		A QUAINT MANIFESTATION OF EDITORIAL ETHICS crops out in the latest issue of `` The Little Review . ''

		It is in connection with a `` vers libre contest , '' this being the issue in which the awards are made .

		There was a regularly constituted board of judges three people sufficiently competent and sufficiently well known in their field ; but the editor has chosen to indulge in some disclosures as to the lack of unanimity amongst her aids and even in some pointed animadversions on their tastes and preferences .

		Of the first choice of one of them , she says : `` What is there in the ` subtle depth of thought ' ?

		Almost every kind of person in the world has had this thought .

		And what is there in the treatment to make it poetry ? ''

		And the poem itself follows .

		Of the two chosen for prizes by another judge , she observes : `` These two poems are pretty awful '' and she prints them , with the authors ' names , as before .

		The third judge plumped for a pair of .

		others `` provided
Richard Aldington	PERSON	wrote them ; otherwise not ... If he wrote them they are authentic as well as lovely ; but if he did not , so flagrant an imitation ought not to be encouraged . ''

		A perfectly sound position to take .

		Here again the poems follow and they are under a name not
Aldington 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Query : has the judge , whose name is given too , ex - actly made a friend ?

		Then comes , of course , a succession of poems approved by the editor but ignored by her helpers ... If such a system spreads , the embarrassments and even perils of judgeship will grow .

		Hereafter few may care to serve as judges , except under stipulations designed to afford some protec - tion .

		And as for the poor poets themselves , such treatment should act to keep them out of `` contests '' altogether .


ARMENIA	LOCATION	'S POETRY , like its literature in general , has undergone a remarkable develop - ment since the literary revival that took place among the Armenians in the eighteenth cen - tury .

		This development is the more notable because of the lack of anything like Armenian national unity .

		At present the Armenian poets , so far as they have survived the atrocities of the time , are singing dirges rather than pasans , lamentations rather than love songs .

		From
Miss Alice Stone Black	ORGANIZATION	- well 's `` Armenian Poems '' let a brief example be taken in illustration .

		It is from `` The Starving , '' by
Siamanto	PERSON	.

		There is no harvest , no harvester , no sower and no earth to plow .

		Hungry oxen bellow mournfully .

		Vegetation is dying with the flowers .

		The plow in the corner of the barn awaits the new and never-returning
spring	DATE	.

		The cock crows no more .

		The dawn , it seems , like the blood of my race , has sunk into the depth of the earth .

		Is it any wonder that the children in
Armenia	LOCATION	play `` To die or not to die , '' even as the chil - dren in happier lands play `` He loves me , loves me not '' ?

		STANDARDS OF TASTE , a subject now in vogue , received an additional airing at
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, when
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, closed the series of Wil - liam
Vaughn Moody	ORGANIZATION	lectures with a well - studied paper on that topic .

		Mr.
More	PERSON	thought clearly and spoke clearly all with a kind of trim , sec adequacy .

		He based him - self squarely on
Coleridge	PERSON	and stressed par - ticularly the quality of permanency as a criterion for determining a classic .

		Then , dipping back more decisively into antiquity , he instituted a long parallel between Homer and
Virgil	PERSON	.

		`` A very scholarly lecture , '' an undergraduate was heard to say , as the au - dience filed out ; but the comment was spoken in such a tone of quasi-protest -LRB- or at least , of resignation -RRB- as to make it doubtful whether the `` scholarly '' was greatly appreciated or desired in the younger scholastic circles .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 423 `` Jean-Christophe '' : An Epic of Humanity Imagine yourself in a salon adorned by a gathering of choice spirits exhibiting the last degree of refinement .

		Here you may admire the impeccably dressed gentleman , a Greek god in evening dress ; there the beautifully waxed mustaches of the man leaning against the piano .

		Art can go no further .

		Yet the women are still more exquisite .

		You hold your breath in the presence of all this loveli - ness .

		When your ecstasy has been gathering speed for some little time , you are suddenly startled by a noise .

		The door is burst open and in walks a nonchalantly whistling fellow he might be a lumberman with firm step and confident air , looks about uncon - cernedly for a moment or two , says , `` Excuse me , I made a mistake , '' and walks out again , slamming the door after him .

		You have had time to get a good look at him , enough to as - certain that he is a man .

		And the rest ?

		Ninnies .

		This roughly defines the relation of
Romain Eolland	PERSON	with his ' ' Jean-Christophe '' to most of his contemporaries in the world of French letters .

		When you are fresh from the ten volumes of `` Jean-Christophe '' you have read them without a halt in rapid succession and make mental notes of comparison with some of the best that the rest of recent French literature has to offer , you find it difficult to repress an impatient outburst .

		In the en - thusiasm of the moment you berate your - self for your hitherto zealous worship of the idols .

		Of course you have a sneaking realization of the fact that you are allowing your critical judgment to go napping , but you resent being mixed up with any charge of mere sobriety .

		You want to berate yourself ; you take a fierce pleasure in making firewood of your beautifully carved idols , as did Jean -
Christophe	PERSON	himself during his `` Revolt '' with the hallowed idols of musical tradition .

		You have found a real man where you hoped only to make the acquaintance of an artist you had not experienced a similar misadventure since parting company with
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and are so intoxicated with the find that the mere artistry of the rest seems rather an imperti - nence .

		This feeling that Rollaiid gives us in ''
Jean	PERSON	- Christophe '' is as unique as it is simple and direct .

		To enjoy an imaginative work of un - usually sustained conception with sheer aes - thetic delight and at the end of it all to exalt the man that animates the artist above the artist himself in few monuments of litera - ture are we impelled to this .

		It is not an ac - cident that
Rolland	PERSON	has written a `` Life of Tolstoy . ''

		Tolstoy and he are kindred spirits .

		But whereas in Tolstoy the love of humanity is tinctured on the one hand by a stern , impa - tient indictment of the causers of misery , on the other by a mystical idealization of the poor and the humble of spirit ,
Rolland	PERSON	's love of humanity has never anything intemperate or maudlin about it .

		It is shot through with a sublime reasonableness , a truly Gallic clar - ity of vision , a temper ever controlled by an irony now censorious , now playful , now tinged with pathos .

		Irony is the quality we always look for in a great French writer its forms are protean .

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	and Maupassant are perhaps the virtuosos of modern French irony , and it is instructive to contrast their use of it with that of
Rolland	PERSON	.

		The writer of `` Le Crime de
Sylvestre Bonnard	PERSON	, '' `` L'Isle des Pin - gouins , '' `` Thai 's , '' and `` Les Dieux ont Soif '' runs through a considerably nuanced gamut of ironies , from the ineffably tender to the savage .

		But in all these nuances I find the same essential hopelessness , the same stoically pessimistic stare into the fathomless void ; the gentle smile and the savage leer are strangely akin .

		There is no malice in this irony of
Anatole France	LOCATION	, but it does not brace you ; it teaches you indifference .

		As for Maupassant , who can be misled by his polish of phrase and anecdotal finish of structure into blindness to the snarl , the aggressive or inhibited con - tempt of his irony ?

		Some day it will be pos - sible in our critical analyses to express these and other types of irony in terms of sex sub - limation .

		Even now one can more than guess the sadistic strain in
Maupassant	LOCATION	's irony .

		Rolland is clearly more normal , more buoyant .

		His irony , though plentiful enough , is the sauce of the discourse , never the meat .

		It frankly rebukes the hero with a slap on the shoulder or slyly nudges the reader at the expense of
Rolland	ORGANIZATION	's creations , but it never stands in the way of your faith .

		It does not 424 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	poison idealism with its ridicule ; on the con - trary , it encourages it by clearing the atmos - phere .

		Irony is by no means the essence of
Rolland	ORGANIZATION	's art , but it is on that account all the more symptomatic of his spirit .

		I have said that
Holland	ORGANIZATION	's love of human - ity is neither intemperate nor maudlin .

		His idealism does not crane its neck cloudward , leaving the actual world of men and women shivering at its feet ; nor does it hug the world with a sloppy sentimentalism .

		There are many passages of `` Jean-Christophe '' that in their clean , fervid idealism are anticipatory of the essays in `` Au-dessus de la Melee , '' but these are precisely not the passages that seem to me to be most convincingly indicative of
Rolland	ORGANIZATION	's intense humanity .

		There can be no doubt in them of his sincerity .

		They are eloquent .

		Moreover ,
Holland	ORGANIZATION	's instinctive good taste and humor prevent him from fall - ing into any semblance of the dreary twaddle that disfigures so much of , say , `` The Kingdom of God is within you . ''

		For all that , he is not at his best when frankly and rhetorically idealistic .

		I get an uncomfortable feeling of whipping myself on and of marching at the head of columns .

		The truth is that
Rolland	PERSON	is so human in his narrative and analysis of character that one wonders why his humanity yearned to express itself in more abstract form as well .

		We are reminded that the art - ist , like every other human being , mistrusts his strongest weapon .

		The loftiest idealism rays out , by some mysterious process of im - plication , from
Rolland	PERSON	's handling of the most vulgar and commonplace scenes and char - acters .

		His , or his hero 's , `` impure '' impulses are somehow cleaner than the rectitude of others .

		What is the secret of this intense humanity of
Rolland	ORGANIZATION	's art ?

		The answer may not be easy to give .

		Or let us say rather that it is too easy to give , that it seems trivial .

		Rolland loves humanity so well that he has the pa - tience and the audacity to see life as it is .

		Many idealists love humanity , provided we allow them to define it as an adumbration of themselves , their own personal virtues and desires , projected into a future .

		They love the vision .

		Rolland loves the vision , too , but meanwhile he also loves the poor flesh and blood that will one day make the vision in - carnate .

		He has the true artist 's respect for his material .

		In speaking of
Rolland	ORGANIZATION	's patience in de - picting life as it is , I am far from wishing to imply that he is one of the item-listing tribe begotten of Zola .

		Those who delight in min - iature accuracy stained in plenty of local color will find him a decidedly impatient craftsman .

		The atmosphere of locality and outward circumstance is deftly enough cre - ated where
Rolland	PERSON	so wills it , but it is truly remarkable how little of it either he or his reader wills in the course of the huge epic .

		`` Jean-Christophe '' is preeminently a study of human hearts , of human hearts lovingly and patiently disclosed .

		The more uninteresting to external gaze , the less dramatic his man or woman , the more warmly glows
Rolland	PERSON	7 s heart as he draws the picture .

		I know of no characters in fiction that seem so tenuous in outline , so devoid of content , as some of those that he lures us with irresistibly .

		Charcoal sketches that pulse with warmth .

		Think of
Louisa	LOCATION	, the mother of Jean -
Christophe	PERSON	.

		Now
Louisa	PERSON	is one of those good , patient , ignorant women that we would prob - ably not waste more than a moment 's thought on if we knew them in the world we live in .

		Mothers of heroes are not generally interest - ing , still less so , good mothers .

		Why , then , do we love
Louisa	LOCATION	?

		And think of the magic of the good , serene old
Gottfried	PERSON	, the brother of
Louisa	LOCATION	.

		If I were to give you a brief sum - mary of what he is and thinks and does , what little he does , you would yawn ap - prehensively with fear of the oppressive dul - ness of the good .

		But
Gottfried	PERSON	is sturdy for all his humility and goodness .

		You look him in the eye , and somehow you begin to feel very small .

		A Tolstoyan conception a Ger - man version of Artzibasheff ' s
Ivan Lande	PERSON	, only far more lovable .


Schulz	PERSON	, the obscure music-lover who reveals Jean-Christophe to himself , is an even greater favorite of mine .

		There is absolutely nothing to relieve his unabashed goodness ; by all the canons of modern realistic art he should inspire nothing but disgust .

		Again
Rolland	PERSON	fools you .

		You may be heroically cynical in real life , but in the land of `` Jean-Christophe '' you can no more escape hugging the old man to your heart than an iron bar can help leaping to the magnet .

		And what shall we say of
Sabine	LOCATION	, the lovely , silent , pensive , dainty-footed Sabine , one of those pathetic girls -LRB- she is a widow , but her youth entitles her to the priv - ilege of girlhood -RRB- who are made to live a
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 425 sweet , lingering life only to die and make us grieve ?

		She , at least , is not so very `` good '' ; she comes within a hair 's breadth of yielding to temptation , of depriving Jean -
Christophe	PERSON	of his youthful innocence .

		`` Good , '' you say as you rub your hands , ``
Holland	LOCATION	has some consideration for us , after all . ''

		But I warn you that Sabine is endlessly good in spite of , or because of , or quite apart from it all it does n't really matter what .

		view you take of it .

		For
Holland	PERSON	knows what we all dimly know but what only one in a thousand will admit -LRB- woe to morality if we gave way ! -RRB-

		that men and women are not good and bad by virtue of what they do , but by virtue of what they are .

		Oh , sweet heresy !

		Once we have it flashed upon us , who can rob us of it ?

		At least in
Ada	ORGANIZATION	, the vulgar wench , have we not an unlovable bit of humanity ?

		No .

		I , at least , like her , or perhaps I like her only because Jean-Christophe loves her for a spell .

		It would be safer to say that I like her because
Holland	PERSON	will have it so
Holland	LOCATION	, who , for all I know , detests her .

		Nowhere is the mystery of
Holland	LOCATION	's human art more subtly shown than in
Antoinette	LOCATION	, the heroine of the volume that bears her name .

		Antoinette is made to be loved and to love , but it is her destiny to sublimate all her pas - sion , all her instincts , into the spirit of end - less self-sacrifice .

		As she toils and scrimps and suffers to give her weak , neurotic brother entry into the larger life , she brushes against the world 's muck , but her inner self seems ever to move apart in a cloistered garden scented with the fragrance of rare flowers .

		It is impossible to convey in a few words a sense of the peculiar loveliness of this adorable girl .

		There are other pure maidens in literature who compel adoration , but few , if any , haunt us with so tender , so poignant a feeling of frustration .

		She is our mingled yearning and self-pity objectified into beauty .

		Hence she is at one and the same time remote from and inexpressibly near to us .

		Wherever we turn in `` Jean-Christophe , '' we are confronted by some cranny of our soul .

		The cheap coquetry of
Colette	LOCATION	, the vol - canic and moody passion of
Francoise	PERSON	, the dark , flaming soul of
Emmanuel	PERSON	, the seething , ice-girt passion of
Anna	PERSON	, the wistful wayward - ness of
Jacqueline	PERSON	, the gentle Goethean seren - ity of
Grazia Buontempi	PERSON	-LRB- is not the melody of the name a symbol ? -RRB-

		, the youthful egotism of
Aurora	LOCATION	and
Georges	PERSON	in love these and much besides are our very selves , actual or imagined .

		Everywhere a few strokes of the pen , and a warm , luminous individuality stands close to us .

		Nowhere a complication of plot or a stage overcrowded with characters , but always the surge of life loving , hating , aspiring .

		And through it all unfolds the soul of Jean -
Christophe	PERSON	himself , the musical genius ,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	reincarnated in the present .

		No greater error can be committed than to assert with
P. Seippel	PERSON	-LRB- `` Remain
Holland	LOCATION	, I ` Honmie et 1 ` CEuvre '' -RRB- that `` Jean-Christophe '' is not for those who do not love music .

		Those who love music will drink deepest in the joys of
Holland	LOCATION	's epic , but , aside from certain pages of musical criticism in `` La Foire sur la Place '' -LRB- ffisthetically the weakest volume of the series , though thoroughly absorbing -RRB- , there is little that requires more than a bare tolerance of music , if tolerance is all the reader can sincerely give .

		The passionate , striving temperament of the hero carries all before it .

		What matters it whether we can enter into the technicalities of his musical career ?

		Such a sum of life-force , of unswerv - ingly sincere living and yearning , needs no label to make it real .

		Jean-Christophe is ting - ling flesh and blood at every step in his sufferings and joys , in his triumph and de - feat , in his tempestuous youth and serene old age .

		But he is also a symbol of absolute sin - cerity in life and art ; and herein
Holland	LOCATION	has attempted a herculean task to merge the humanly real , pitfalls and all , with the ideal .

		In the first four volumes and in `` Le Buisson Ardent , ''
Holland	PERSON	has eminently succeeded .

		Elsewhere Jean-Christophe seems often on the point of dissolving into an ideal abstraction , into the passive carrier of
Holland	LOCATION	's aesthetic and humanitarian message .

		At such times he is all force and light and colorless .

		I would give much if
Holland	LOCATION	could have induced him - self to dispense with the critical discussions of French music , literature , and life that make up so much of `` La Foire sur la Place '' and `` Dans la Maison . ''

		I would he had saved them for another setting , for we can not afford to miss them .

		Jean-Christophe is the impulsive , creative , universal side of
Holland	LOCATION	's temperament .

		But there is also a reflective , critical , ironical side that needed expression , a subtler , more char - acteristically Gallic spirit .


Olivier Jeannin	PERSON	is the friend and counterfoil of
Christophe	PERSON	.

		He represents the purest ideals of French art 426 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	and thought , but , Hamlet-like , he is crippled by his doubts and scruples .

		I get a curious feeling that
Eolland	ORGANIZATION	has left him a torso , that he has incorporated in him certain more in - timate elements of his own personality but has not been able to clothe him in all the flesh and blood he had originally intended .

		Holland fights shy of something .

		He wraps Olivier in a wistful haze that even his bosom friend
Christophe	PERSON	can not altogether penetrate .

		At times the symbolic wins the upper hand over the human .

		And
Olivier	PERSON	can not hold
Jacque	PERSON	- line 's love .

		1 mentioned
Eolland	ORGANIZATION	's audacity .

		Many artists have sought evil in their heroes and heroines and set it by the side of their good .

		Many have pictured the waywardness of fate with a detached wonder .

		But they generally put a `` but '' between the good and the evil , between the ideal and the actual .

		Holland 's audacity leads him , and with unerring psy - chologic instinct , to put an `` and '' between them .

		Jean-Christophe lives with the com - moii-souled
Ada	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is no conflict in his soul ; he merely breaks off all relations in a moment of revulsion .

		Olivier 's friendship for
Christophe	PERSON	is of the very warmest .

		When Olivier marries , he drifts away from his friend with a strange rapidity .

		Emmanuel hates
Christophe	PERSON	.

		And his love for
Chris	PERSON	- tophe is the same emotional current , differ - ently colored .

		Jacqueline loves her son to distraction , but she suddenly loses interest in him .

		If you have been fed up on the rela - tively conventional psychology of most real - ists , you may not feel altogether at home in some of
Holland	LOCATION	's arbitrary-looking conflicts of will .

		By and by you realize that you are not asked to fit the patterns that you have brought with you .

		You are walking in the strange path of life and had better see and be silent .

		Of the style , of the thousand and one ob - servations on life , nationality , art , and pol - itics , of the structure of the work , of its aesthetic and ethical ideals of these and other aspects of `` Jean-Christophe '' I shall say nothing .

		The virile and loving human note vibrating from end to end of the great prose epic is its strongest bid for immortality .

		If critics grant Franch letters light but deny it warmth , let them be silenced by '' Jean-Chris -
EDWARD SAPIR	PERSON	.

		Poetry from the Trenches War poetry written by `` civilians '' is de - testable stuff vague , would-be heroic rhet - oric , vast sentimentalities about situations whereof the poet is utterly ignorant .

		The present war has produced only too much of this crapulous imbecility , this hysterical hypocrisy ; but also it has produced a little , just a very little fine gold from those who have endured the sensations they try to inter - pret in their poetry .

		And this poetry comes from men who are just `` common soldiers , '' for in this war for the first time perhaps in history the common soldier has become ar - ticulate .

		Historians and poets of the last two cen - turies invariably looked at war from the standpoint of the general staff ; the ordinary soldier existed merely to `` perform prodigies of valor '' or to die , resisting to the last .

		Sol - diers still do this and more , but for the first time we are hearing something of the feelings and thoughts of these anonymous thousands upon whom falls so much of the burden of warfare .

		We read in our histories and novels of what
Ney	PERSON	did , of what manoeuvres
Napoleon	PERSON	used , of
Picton	LOCATION	's charge at
Waterloo	LOCATION	;
Gibbon	PERSON	expatiates at length on the heroic conduct of Trajan and censures every emperor who was not a marauding freebooter .

		But what does
Gibbon	PERSON	know or care about the Roman legion - ary ?

		What do the historians really tell us about the soldiers of
Wellington	LOCATION	and Bona - parte ?

		Practically nothing , save a few lauda - tive generalities .

		And so the poems in
Frederic Manning	PERSON	's `` Eidola , '' the poems which come out of his days and nights in the trenches , are poig - nantly interesting , , the cries and consolations of a tortured soul .

		We read these poems with flushed cheeks and pity and admiration , pity for the utter stupidity of mankind which has created such a hell , and admiration for a soul in hell , which yet does not forget God and beauty and love .

		O God of sorrows , Whose feet come softly thro ' the dews , Stoop thou unto us For we die so thou livest , Our hearts the cups of thy vintage .

		And the lips of no man uttereth love , Suffering even for love 's sake .

		And so we leave Mr.
Manning	PERSON	's vicariously heroic patriotic verse and his delicately turned love lyrics to read again and again the pas - sionate and ironic and bitter things he has to tell us about reality , about real war .

		Not
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 427 that imagination has left him ; the poet who sang - so exquisitely of Persephone and De - meter has not forgotten them remembering beauty even in hell .

		He praises Aphrodite of the golden cymbals : Roaring our songs in estaminets With our hands hungry for life again .

		And when the transport wagons pass him on the moonlit road they are beautiful to him `` as the horses of Hippolytus carven on some antique frieze . ''

		In the shell-reft Bois de Mametz he remem - bers
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	and her delicate daughter : Men have marred thee , O Mother :
Autumn	DATE	hath now no tawny and gilded leaves ; Nor murmuring among sleepy boughs ; But stark and writhen as a woman ravished , With twisted , tortured limbs , Are Mametz woods .

		Hath not thy child ,
Persephone	LOCATION	, tall men , Yea , even all the children of the earth , Bringing her tribute ?

		But the reapers sing not in thy wheat-fields : Tall sheaves wait ungarnered , Though swallows are shrilling in the skies .

		I , too , mar beauty by tearing out pieces of these poems , though even these fragments should prove that Mr.
Manning	PERSON	has produced poetry here which is stern and true yet beau - tiful .

		Let anyone read `` The Choosers '' or `` The Sign '' or `` The Trenches '' and remain unmoved if he can .

		For we have now some - thing which is a touchstone to prove what dross are the works which hitherto have passed as expressive of men 's souls in this new , mon - strous torture .

		There is irony and perhaps a little satire here and there ; the poet is not afraid of truth .

		He can tell us how the rats run over the maimed , dislocated corpses and fragments of corpses ; how , `` naked as Greeks , '' the soldiers are `` killing the lice '' in their shirts ; and in `` Grotesques '' he has rendered the ghastly dis - comfort of a noisy , smoky billet : We , Sitting with streaming eyes in the acrid smoke , That murks our foul damp billet , Chant , bitterly with raucous voices As a choir of frogs In hideous irony , our patriotic songs .

		And yet in another poem : I would sing thy face Sitting here in the firelight ; Mid the senseless noise of guns Comes it as a flower between the flames .

		Perhaps it would not be a bad thing for the world generally if it sang a few less of its `` patriotic songs '' and a few more of Mr.
Man	PERSON	- ning 's and his like if there be any .

		In speaking of these poems one feels a sort of incoherence , a desire to go somewhere alone and weep .

		Praise is indeed somewhat of an impertinence in these matters , for praise or blame can now matter very little to Mr.
Man	PERSON	- ning .

		And from this feeling also one refrains from any technical criticism , even from utter - ing a whoop of joy that so delicate a scholar and so sincere a poet has been converted to vers libre .

		For the present one only desires that people who love poetry should read Mr.
Manning	PERSON	's book ; presently , when one feels less poignantly and ardently about these things , there may be a time for calm apprecia - tion and reflective criticism .

		HISTORIANS AND THE WAR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		On
April 29	DATE	and 30 , some fifteen teachers and Avriters of history met in
Washington	LOCATION	to con - sider the problem of what they and their fellows can do for the country in time of war .

		After thorough discussion , it was decided to choose a small body of men to be known as a
National Board for Historical Service	ORGANIZATION	, to have its head - quarters at
Washington	LOCATION	, and to be charged with the duty of helping to bring into useful opera - tion , in the present emergency , the intelligence and skill of the historical workers of the country .

		The board is an entirely voluntary and unofficial organization , but it hopes to elicit the cooperation of all interested persons and to secure from them advice and suggestion .

		While not presuming the slightest authority or any right to direct or to com - mandeer the historians or the students of history , it believes that it will be able to suggest plans of work , and possibly even of organization , to workers in various localities .

		At all events , a central exchange for collecting ideas and furnish - ing information can scarcely fail to be of consid - erable value .

		The board is composed of the following persons :
Victor S. Clark	PERSON	,
Robert D. W. Connor	PERSON	,
Carl R. Fish	PERSON	,
Charles D. Hazen	PERSON	,
Charles H. Hull	PERSON	,
Gaillard Hunt	PERSON	,
Waldo G. Leland	PERSON	,
James T. Shotwell	PERSON	, and
Frederick J. Turner	PERSON	.

		The ad - dress of the secretary , Mr.
Leland	PERSON	, is 133 Wood - ward Building ,
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C .

		At first sight it may not appear very evident that men whose labors are devoted to past events can be of much service in a task like that now confronting us .

		But at the very least the gov - ernment ought to be informed that there is a large number of trained men anxious and willing to do anything which their training fits them for .

		It is not impossible that the government will call to its service historical experts ; they may be asked to furnish information and possibly advice , and they may thus help in solving the complicated problems lying beneath the war and the peace 428 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	which will come some time .

		If the government does not require such assistance , at least the his - torians will be ready to do what they can , and even to stand and wait may be also to serve .

		Moreover , those historical workers who are thor - oughly convinced that the war is just may well use their knowledge and their skill in writing and speaking to keep the people informed and to help in creating what they believe is a sound and whole - some public opinion ; even those of us who have kept pace with the war 's passing phases and have watched the
United States	LOCATION	being gradually drawn in , need occasional refreshment of our memories and are aided by exposition .

		If the
United States	LOCATION	make no entangling promises to the allied nations , we shall all need , nevertheless , some knowledge of the historical background of a score and more of problems which are to perplex the treaty-makers when the day of peace comes .

		How many of us know properly the historical background of the
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	problem , of the Balkan problem in its manifold divisions , of the Polish problem , of the Turkish problem , and many others which we should know if we are to be an internationally minded people ?

		How many of us could trace the checkered career of even the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine ?

		Those who know the use which has been made in
England	LOCATION	of the knowledge of the historians , will of course readily see what duties lie before their brethren in
America	LOCATION	.

		The historical student and worker , even if not prepared to write one of the many pamphlets or small popular books , which will probably be produced on some cooperative basis , can do some - thing for the historians of the future by gathering material and thus helping to bring together the documents which will enable later workers to un - derstand the activity and the psychology of the American people in the trying days that are now just gone and in those that lie before us .

		Assist - ance of this character may be given to libraries and historical societies .

		Women 's clubs and sim - ilar bodies can be aided by bibliographical refer - ence-lists and by lectures .

		In short , it is a plain duty of the historical worker , even though engaged in nothing that might by some be stigmatized as propaganda , to help in quickening the intelligence of the people and in furnishing them with reliable facts .

		Perhaps few of us are able entirely to disentangle our scientific historical fibres from our swelling patriotic muscles , but most of us can try .

		To instruct a people in the way they should go is a dangerous task ; to no one does it seem more dangerous than to a believer in democracy who has studied the facts lying behind the European war ; but this war must be fought out in our own in - telligences as well as on the field of battle , and to drift along without discussion and contempla - tion , satisfying ourselves with only the knowledge that money is being spent and blood spilt , is to surrender the principles and the functions of democracy itself .

		There will be enough said and written by those that have not studied ; so the ruminations of even those who have considered and are accustomed to deal with historical movements may not be amiss .

		Most of us believe that this war must establish some grounds of hope for a lasting peace ; we shall have little patience with a patched-up truce such as has come from peace congresses in the past , which were chiefly engaged in satisfying territorial claims or recognizing the influence and
august	DATE	authorities of princelings .

		And if any prospects of decent and reliable human intercourse lie before the nations of the world , all of us can help to make the prospect more real by keeping clear and clean our national and our humane desire for friendliness and honesty , and by making clear , also , the historical basis of the con - flict and the forces which have caused us to throw ourselves into the combat .

		STANDARDS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The quest of standards has been occupying Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	of late , in the pages of '' Scribner 's . ''

		Obviously standards are singularly elusive ; one is left to infer that they are on the point of extinction .

		The new generation our energetic generation fills Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	with dismay : it is iconoclastic , undisciplined , self - regarding , violent ; it is given to discussing the weightiest and most intimate of subjects quite casually , even in print .

		Nothing is sacrosanct to those who are devoid of taste , taste being , in Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's view , `` con - formity to standards crystallized from formula ; already worked out . ''

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	has formed himself on the French tradition ; he loves above all smoothness and neatness ; he is on the side of order and discipline .

		He has no difficulty in see - ing the peculiar excellence of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's work .

		That work is all very well of course so far as it goes , but why should n't it have occurred to so alert a mind as Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's to ask whether it really goes far enough ?

		His indictment of the moderns would look a great deal more impressive , I think , if he had proved , or at least tried to prove , that the standards he admires are adequate .

		As a matter of fact , our life has changed considerably of late in political and industrial organization , and it is only natural to expect literature to reflect that change .

		Only the most superficial view certainly would expect to see no change in standards , and no one would accuse Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	of being super - ficial .

		But there is no denying that he is rather out of touch with the life about him he seems to dislike it cordially and his view is cloistered and partial .

		A great many young Americans feel that there is falseness as well as shallowness in some of Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's standards ; they are heartily tired of drawing-room elegance ; and some of them are tired of French neatness , too .

		The Russian tradi - tion seems to many of these younger men to offer a truer and a deeper way of expression , as well as an infinitely fresher one .

		For Russian power and sincerity they would not be willing to trade any amount of smoothness and neatness .

RUSSIA	LOCATION	'S MESSAGE .

		By
William English Wall	PERSON	- ing .

		-LRB-
Alfred A. Knopf	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		With war , revolution .

		It is in this way that events have shaped themselves in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The Eusso-Turkish War resulted in the aboli - tion of serfdom -LRB- 1861 -RRB- ; the
Eusso	LOCATION	- Japanese War brought popular uprisings and strikes and a Constitution -LRB-
1905	DATE	-RRB- .

		And now , with the European War , has come the birth of Russian democracy .

		In the decade that fol - lowed the Constitutional Manifesto of
1905	DATE	, the bureaucratic tyrants of
Eussia	LOCATION	strove to emasculate the national Duma of all power , and practically succeeded in nullifying the Constitution .

		The government came back ; reaction was again the order of the day , and once more the intellectuals of
Eussia	LOCATION	had to resume the bitter struggle against a political system that reached every phase of the na - tional life and left everywhere its baneful , deadening influence .

		At the opening of the European War the world was presented with the strange spectacle of the foremost autoc - racy of
Europe	LOCATION	fighting in alliance with '' two great democracies .

		To many republicans there was something disquieting and even sin - ister in this alliance ; but those who were far - sighted and optimistic saw most buoyant possibilities in the new alignment .

		They knew that autocracy could thrive only in isolation ; it could not survive such a union .

		And to - day their hopes have been realized in the birth of a new Eussia .

		The news of the Eussian Eevolution came with such startling suddenness that , to many in
America	LOCATION	, it seemed as if freedom , full - formed , had been born overnight .

		For the mo - ment , in the great rejoicing over the miracle , the bitter memory of old Eussia was forgot - ten , and the slow , agonizing years of struggle for political liberty were cancelled .

		Per - haps it is not always well to keep alive in the heart the hatred for evils that , with the new dawn , become like the insubstantial dreams of a faded and troubled night .

		But the mind rejects the reality of new creations until it has compassed them and sought out all their relations .

		We must know old Eussia to grasp the new .

		Without this knowledge of the past we can neither comprehend the momentous change that has come over
Eussia	LOCATION	in our own day , nor interpret the problems which , in the future , will confront that country newly con - ceived in liberty .

		It is this need which the two books before us will help to fill .

		Korn - ilov 's history and Mr.
Walling	PERSON	's animated account of revolutionary strivings depict the historic and social antecedents of the present events in
Eussia	LOCATION	in a manner to give substance and actuality to our vague and incomplete idea of the Eussian Eevolution .

		They rep - resent the tide of liberal opinion rising slowly but with ever-gathering force in the attempt to batter down the iron wall of the bureau - cracy .

		The narratives do not , of course , in - clude the most recent developments , but they never fail to meet the broader , more general expectations of readers keenly alive to the new significance of
Eussia	LOCATION	in the light of present events .

		Kornilov 's '' History of Modern Eussia '' is an outstanding work .

		Taking as its basis the best studies of Eussian social and political development ,
Kluchevsky	PERSON	's `` Survey of
Eus	ORGANIZATION	- sian History '' and
Miliukov	ORGANIZATION	's `` History of Eussian Culture , ' ' it is a lucid , dispassionate , discreetly documented and thoroughly reliable survey of the history of Eussia in the nine - teenth century .

		The translation was capably done by Mr.
Kaun	PERSON	, who continues the illumi - nating narrative in a series of excellent chap - ters on the reign of
Nicholas II	PERSON	.

		Kornilov 's viewpoint is best expressed in his own words : `` For the historian , the subject of history is always man , human society , people . ''

		He proceeds to give a well-knit account of the development of culture and socio-political life in
Eussia	LOCATION	.

		The clash of economic and polit - ical forces , the unrelenting struggle of liberal ideas to humanize an autocratic state , these things , and not battles and biographies , are the theme of the social historian ,
Kornilov	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Walling	PERSON	's unsparing arraignment of the dark forces in
Eussia	LOCATION	, originally published in
1908	DATE	, is now reissued with some unaccount - able omissions and the complete disappearance of the index , as well as of a number of illus - trations .

		But in any form , Mr.
Walling	PERSON	's book commands attention .

		It offers more than a candid and fervent exposure of the sufferings of the Eussian masses : peasants , proletarians , intelligentsia , and subject na - tionalities .

		It shows also the liberating forces at work to bring the new day and to make clear
Eussia	LOCATION	's message to the world .

		When he wrote this book , Mr.
Walling	PERSON	had no pa - tience with half-way measures for reform in
Eussia	LOCATION	.

		As an ardent radical he decries , for example ,
Miliukov	ORGANIZATION	's policy of compromise , of watchful waiting .

		For a long time Mil - iukov was distrusted by many of the socialists of
Eussia	LOCATION	.

		They feared that he was a con - firmed parliamentarian and , while altogether 430 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	unselfish , a political trimmer who had proved unfaithful to the promise of his early radical - ism .

		They could have no sympathy with the transformation of a virgin theorist into a shrewd , level-headed , practical leader of a bal - anced and enlightened progressivism .

		But events have proved the wisdom of
Miliukov	ORGANIZATION	's methods .

		The course of Russian history was fun - damentally determined by very palpable forces , so that its stages are clearly marked .

		There was , first of all , the necessity of con - quering the whole of the vast Russian plain that extends in an almost unbroken sweep from the western frontiers across
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	and
Western Asia	LOCATION	.

		The first period , then , is one of conquest , of a slow , obstinate , bitterly contended diffusion over the seem - ingly illimitable stretches .

		And when all but the outlying portions of the great plain were conquered , there came the equally grim ne - cessity of uniting the broad territories into one nation .

		The unremitting efforts to keep the enormous structure from disintegrating , from falling back into its component parts , resulted in a relentless autocracy .

		Because of these facts , there never existed in
Russia	LOCATION	an equilibrium between the growth of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	and internal development .

		Social and political organization had to wait until the whole of the vast plain was brougnt under the rule of one Tsar .

		For the purpose of secur - ing outward adhesion ,
Peter	PERSON	the Great de - vised , after a foreign model , the complex structure of the bureaucratic machine .

		Throughout three centuries
Russia	LOCATION	was held in the rivets of a complicated and fearfully elaborate organization , highly efficient on paper , but completely incapable of coping with great national crises .

		The bureaucracy was never adjusted to native conditions ; its efficiency lay in its repressive power .

		The next stage of Russian history dates from the beginning of the conscious attempt to divest the body politic of this stifling and bureau - cratic autocracy .

		Here was a necessity with which
Peter	PERSON	the Great had not reckoned .

		The recognition of this need ushered in a period of relentless struggle for constitutional lib - erty .

		The revolutionary strivings of the Russian intelligentsia were influenced to a marked ex - tent by the economic and social philosophy of the
West	LOCATION	.

		But it was not long before Rus - sian radicalism assumed a peculiarly national complexion .

		The attempt was to reconcile Western socialism with the Russian form of communism one which looked to the ultimate founding of a socialized republic under which the people would inherit their land .

		Neither a change of dynasty nor a political upheaval would suffice .

		It is not surprising , therefore , that the radical elements of
Russia	LOCATION	regard the recent revolution with lukewarm sentiments and not too fervent spirits .

		Engineered by a coalition of the moderate and progressive elements in the
Duma	ORGANIZATION	, the political shift of
March , 1917	DATE	, is only a faint fulfilment of the high hopes of the Russian revolutionists .

		But the far-sighted among them realize that the downfall of the autocracy has made it possible to take up the Herculean task of shaping the destinies of
Russia	LOCATION	after the pattern of their communistic design .

		It is said that
Napoleon	PERSON	once uttered the cryptic prophecy : `` The whole of
Europe	LOCATION	will be either Cossack or Republican . ''

		Should
Russia	LOCATION	succeed in building a socialized republic , with commu - nistic management of its vast areas and na - tional ownership of the tremendous resources soon to be uncovered , then the whole of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope may yet be Cossack but not in
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon 's sense of the word .

		The most unsatisfactory aspect of the in - ternational position of the
United States	LOCATION	in the decade preceding the outbreak of the world war in
1914	DATE	was the tension with
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Prior to
1905	DATE	relations between the Jap - anese and American peoples were exception - ally cordial .

		The part taken by the
United States	LOCATION	in bringing the island empire into in - tercourse with the world was freely acknowl - edged ; her liberal attitude as to indemnities , tariff , and extraterritoriality was gratefully remembered .

		The Empire 's commercial re - lations were closer with the
United States	LOCATION	than with any European country .

		In the Russo-Japanese conflict of 1904-05 the sym - pathy of the American people was clearly on the Japanese side .

		New circumstances after the Peace of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, however , placed this tradition of friendliness in jeopardy .

		The Japanese bearing of self-confidence , while easily ex - plicable , was sometimes offensive , and tended to cool American enthusiasm .

		Repeated manifestations of aggressive disposition in
China	LOCATION	created distrust .

		Growing rivalry for trade advantages in the
Pacific	LOCATION	helped to cause
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 431 alienation .

		Most serious of all , the rights of Japanese immigrants in the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast states were brought into serious controversy first by local acts intended to exclude Ori - entals from the common schools , and later by state-wide measures designed to keep them from , becoming owners of land .

		These discriminatory measures were prompted by the rapid increase of Japanese immigration .

		In
1900	DATE	there were in the coast states only some eighteen thousand persons of Japanese descent .

		But about
1903	DATE	a heavy influx set in .

		Laborers , shopkeepers , and even capitalists came by the thousands , until the Far West seemed in danger of being sad - dled with a race problem comparable with * that which vexes the South .

		Led by organ - ized labor , the people set up loud demand for relief .

		In
1907	DATE	a tentative settlement was reached in a `` gentleman 's agreement , '' whereby the Tokio authorities promised to withhold passports from laborers bound for the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Within two years the number of Japanese entering the country was reduced to one-tenth of its former propor - tions ; and in
1911	DATE	the Japanese government signified its intention to maintain the new policy .

		So far as actual Japanese immigra - tion was concerned , there ceased to be a `` Jap - anese problem . ''

		A real problem , none the less , remained .

		For at bottom the matter in controversy was nothing less than the right of subjects of the
Mikado	LOCATION	to migrate to the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast states and there to enjoy the same opportu - nities and privileges that are enjoyed under similar circumstances by immigrants from other civilized countries .

		For the time being , and by a purely informal arrangement ,
Japan	LOCATION	had agreed to use her official influence to prevent the settlement of her subjects on American soil .

		But the agreement was re - vocable at any time , and she had in no wise assented to any legislation or policy stigma - tizing the Japanese as an inferior , or even a `` different , '' people .

		Fundamentally , the issue between the two countries is economic ; that is to say , it springs from immigration , trade , and territorial in - terests which bring the powers in cpntact in both eastern and western hemispheres .

		It has also important racial and psychological aspects , and it is these that are taken up in Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	's `` The Japanese Invasion . ''

		Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	writes from seven years ' residence in
Japan	LOCATION	as a teacher in a mission college in
Sendai	LOCATION	.

		He believes that the danger of armed conflict between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	is a real one , and he seeks to show the seriousness of the situation , not after the manner of an alarmist , but by a sober analy - sis of the psychological factors that are in - volved .

		His essential contention is that , after all temporary means of evasion and postpone - ment have been exhausted , the
United States	LOCATION	must face two alternatives about equally dis - agreeable .

		Either she must definitely exclude the Japanese and incur the wrath of a proud and warlike people , or she must admit them and resign herself to the presence of a mass of inhabitants who are but partially assim - ilable .

		The most valuable portions of Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	's book are chapters discussing the attitude in various sections of the
United States	LOCATION	toward Japanese residents , the reaction of the Jap - anese to American economic conditions , the organization and solidarity of Japanese im - migrants , and the problem of intermarriage .

		It is pointed out that the readjustments which Japanese in this country are compelled to make are far greater than those which are expected of Americans who go to the Orient .

		Even missionaries or merchants who reside in the Orient for decades are regarded as foreigners , and there is no effort to compel them to denationalize themselves .

		Japanese immigrants , on the contrary , are under the necessity of conforming to American stand - ards because they are competitors in our economic life .

		`` To the extent that they live in their own groups and retain their native customs , they are not only criticized , but their economic opportunities are lessened .

		In order to succeed they must make themselves as much like Americans as possible . ''

		But this raises grave difficulty , because the Japanese and American traits and aptitudes , if not actually incompatible , are widely divergent ; and the lower classes , which furnish most of the emi - grants , are the least fitted to make the neces - sary adjustment .

		The conclusion is that while the conditions of economic life require sub - stantial assimilation of Japanese immigrants , such assimilation is practically impossible .

		A brief discussion of the problem of intermar - riage shows further how great are the ob - stacles .

		The first step toward a solution of the Jap - anese problem , in Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	's opinion , must be a willingness on the part of both Japanese and Americans to recognize frankly the racial factors involved .

		The Japanese are not looked upon in the
United States	LOCATION	in the same way as Europeans , and probably never will be , because they are not Europeans and can not be made such .

		Eace prejudice can never be wholly overcome .

		But it can be worn down bv constant association under favorable con - 432 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	ditions .

		The author therefore urges that both nations be made to see the importance of `` a strict limitation of the problem by bringing about the mingling of the people of the
Bast	PERSON	and West only under circumstances most favorable to a proper appreciation of each other 's essential character . ''

		The Japanese must be made to appreciate the wisdom of permitting only the best representatives of their race to come to
America	LOCATION	.

		Americans , on their part , must gradually rise above the petty provincialism which makes them un - willing to recognize true worth in men of dif - ferent race .

		Solution on these lines , the author freely admits , will be slow .

		The
United States	LOCATION	has , in reality , two Jap - anese problems .

		One that of which Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	writes arises from Japanese immi - gration , actual or threatened ; the other springs from the clash between the Open Door policy of
John Hay	PERSON	and Japanese ambitions in
China	LOCATION	.

		It is of the latter that Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Cormick	PERSON	writes in his `` Menace of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		This book is , in effect , an excoriation of
American Far Eastern	ORGANIZATION	policy in the last six or seven years , and especially since the inaugu - ration of President
Wilson	PERSON	in
1913	DATE	.

		Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	pronounces our recent policy in the Orient `` half-hearted and irresolute . ''

		Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	heaps upon it every respectable epithet of objurgation .

		The
Wilson Admin	PERSON	- istration , he asserts , was from the outset hope - lessly provincial ; and when , much too late , it was aroused to the importance of happen - ings in
Europe	LOCATION	and on the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, it per - sisted in deliberately ignoring the
Pacific	LOCATION	, where in reality all the great problems of the future centre .

		The
LaFollette Seamen	ORGANIZATION	's Act swept the American merchant marine from the western ocean ; withdrawal of the
United States	LOCATION	from the six-power loans to
China	LOCATION	meant renunciation of guiding influence ; un - protesting acceptance of the altered situation arising from the Japanese demands upon
China	LOCATION	in
1915	DATE	was tantamount to an abdica - tion of guardianship ; the acme of weakness was reached in the proposal to abandon
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Next to the
United States	LOCATION	herself , the na - tion that will profit most by the present war , says Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	, is
Japan	LOCATION	; and the whole burden of the book is that the cardinal fea - ture of future world politics will be the con - flict of these two powers .

		Our only line of escape from worse sacrifices , hu - miliations , and dishonors is to rout
Japan	LOCATION	from the position of her monstrous assumptions as the monitor of
China	LOCATION	and the nations in
East Asia	LOCATION	.

		If , after ignoring the loss of our rights in
China	LOCATION	, the present American policy of drifting should continue ,
Japan	LOCATION	's great reason for war against us would not be
China	LOCATION	.

		It would be that of the imposition of Japanese and Asiatic colonization upon the shores of the
Pacific	LOCATION	generally .

		Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	writes as one who sees all things red .

		Many of his assertions are too sweeping , and his conclusions are sometimes palpably unsound .

		With due allowance for journalistic dash and patriotic fervor , his book can be read profitably .

		It contains a good deal of interesting information on the ins and outs of world diplomacy since the Russo-Japanese war .

		It is , however , almost wholly lacking in documentary citations , and the careful student will often be uncertain what to accept at face value and what to discount .

Eacial Basis of European History	ORGANIZATION	.

$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		There arose in
Germany	LOCATION	after the
Franco	LOCATION	- Prussian War a hypothesis concerning civil - ization which had its ostensible beginning in
Gobineau	LOCATION	and its actual beginnings in the central egotism which animates individuals and groups alike .

		Gobineau was at great pains to exhibit the existence of inequalities among the races of men .

		His exhibition was salutary in view of the confusion of external equality , which was what the democratic pro- gramme demanded in
Europe	LOCATION	, with internal similarity , which is an impossible absurdity .

		From the conception of the inequalities in the human race to the conception that one 's own race is a superior race , the step is easy and unconscious .

		And when one 's own race hap - pens to be organized in a state that hereto - fore had been a negligible factor in the achievements of European civilization , and that state emerges victorious in warfare and begins and executes a programme of social betterment , scientific investigation , military organization , and economic development that makes it soon a rival of the foremost of the great states of
Europe	LOCATION	, it becomes very nat - ural and simple to identify the race organ - ized into such a state with the paragon of mankind , the chosen people predestined by divine providence to spread its light over the whole world .

		This form of arrogance is not new in the history of civilization : the Greeks - had it ; the Jews had it ; it was not lacking in the mid - Victorian thinking of the English .

		But it never attained the height of romantic magniloquence that it had among the Ger - mans .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 433 An amusing sociological romance by a ren - egade Englishman named
Houston Stewart Chamberlain	PERSON	, under the title `` The Founda - tions of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' divided the world into two classes the things that he liked , which he called good , and the things that he disliked , which he called evil .

		All the things that he called good were attributed to the Teutonic people , blond , tall , strong , whose Nordic ancestors had conquered the darker aborigines of
Europe	LOCATION	and endowed them with all the excellences
Europe	LOCATION	possesses .

		The German emperor is said to have bought thirty thousand copies of this book and to have dis - tributed them as widely as possible .

		I do not know whether it was one of the imperial copies that came to blond , blue-eyed Mr.
Madison Grant	PERSON	, but his own book on the pas - sing of the great race echoes the absurdities of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Madison Grant	PERSON	, like Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	, feels that the excellences of civilization are the effect of the operations of the Nordic peoples , the excellences of civilization being those things that Mr.
Grant	PERSON	likes better than other things .

		He thinks also that the blonds are disappearing from the world , and he thinks it is a pity .

		Incidentally , his book is full of statements which show that all the great beginnings and the large achievements of European culture were made by the Alpine and
Mediterranean	LOCATION	stocks .

		But that , of course , is irrelevant to the sentiment which animates the book , and which Mr.
Henry Fair	PERSON	- field
Osborn	PERSON	, in a brief introduction , appears to share .

		The sentiment generates assump - tions from which Mr.
Grant	PERSON	draws a lesson for
America	LOCATION	.

		In these assumptions , he makes use of a good deal of mythology concerning the competition of races , and he imagines that American blonds are going to be swamped by the darker immigrants .

		He thinks , on the whole , that the superior is absorbed by the inferior stock .

		In any such mixture the surviving traits will be determined by competition between the lowest and most primitive elements and the specialized traits of the Nordic man .

		His stature , his light-colored eyes , his fair skin , his blond hair , his straight nose , his splendid fighting and moral qualities , will have little part in the resultant of the mixture ... From this point of view of race it were better described as the `` survival of the unfit . ''

		Moral : Restrict immigration and compel blonds to breed .

		The publisher 's announcement heralds this stuff as an entirely new and original recast - ing of history on a purely scientific basis .

		This may be so , but if it is , the science is so pure that it is altogether imperceptible .

		An Idol of the Parnassians EDGAR
ALLAN POE	PERSON	.

		By
Hanns Heinz Ewers	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	; 60 cts . -RRB-

		During the past generation a particular type of aesthete has made himself familiar in the English-speaking world a manifestation just as likely to be American as British .

		Such an individual selects some continental
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean celebrity in the arts one reasonably dis - tant not only in point of space but in point of time and idealizes and emotionalizes him in unstinted measure .

		The reverse process a like treatment given an American by some continental European has not been common , but it has been known : Whitman has been magnified in
Paris	LOCATION	;
Emerson	LOCATION	has been cel - ebrated by the chief of Belgian mystics ; and now an enthusiastic young German has come to do as much for
Poe	PERSON	.


Herr Ewers	PERSON	is a Teutonic cosmopolite , and his book a brief matter of fifty - five pages has been translated , with moderate success , by
Adele Lewisohn	PERSON	, who represents her author as
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's most sympathetic interpreter : intel - lectual kinsmen , she calls them .

		Yet the ultimate advantage rests with
Ewers	PERSON	, it ap - pears ; for he `` has gone beyond
Poe	PERSON	because to him was revealed the mystery of sex , '' while to
Poe	PERSON	`` sex always was a sealed book . ''

		However ,
Poe	PERSON	's latest commentator and `` wor - shipper '' finds plenty of a cogent nature to say on other grounds .


Herr Ewers	PERSON	sends forth his work from the
Alhambra	LOCATION	.

		On his opening page the foun - tains babble and the nightingales sing from out the laurels .

		On his last page the
night	TIME	- ingales are still warbling ; and through the intervening spaces the author himself sings and sings rather `` wildly well '' a somewhat more than `` mortal melody . ''

		It is impas - sioned ; it is unboundedly generous .

		It is elegiac too .

		For
Poe	PERSON	such is his plaint never knew the
Alhambra	LOCATION	.

		This privilege was allowed
Washington Irving	PERSON	, `` that model of English conventionality , '' who was able to dream at will under the magic spell of the
Alhambra	LOCATION	moonshine .

		What might not
Poe	PERSON	have done in the same environment ?

		And what did he do what did he have to do in bleak and empty
America	LOCATION	?

		He drank .

		The Dionysiac state which might have been reached so hap - pily under one set of conditions had to be reached most unhappily and disastrously un - der another .

		Only thus could the poet , as he was situated , `` create new art values . ''

		What is the artist ?

		The artist , says
Herr Ewers	PERSON	, is the first explorer .

		The eternal land of our longing lies dreamily before us in grey THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	misty clouds .

		There is no beauty , as
Poe	PERSON	himself says , quoting Lord
Bacon	PERSON	, without some strangeness ; or , as glossed by
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, some unexpectedness , some novelty .

		The artist is the man whose tormenting de - sires are so great that he `` must emerge from the realm which we know . ''

		He enters first ; then come the hordes of investigators and sur - veyors the `` land registrars and rent col - lectors , '' as our author disdainfully calls them .

		And what gives entrance ?

		The so - called poisons , narcotics , are as potent as other means to lead us beyond the threshold of the unconscious .

		If one succeeds in getting a foothold in this other world , and has the native capacity for profiting by a state of ecstasy , he creates a new work of art , and is , in the noblest sense , an artist .

		And such , believes
Herr Ewers	PERSON	, was
Poe	PERSON	in excelsis .

		Yet no intoxicant in the world , he goes on to say , can develop in a man qualities which he does not possess .

		Thus `` the Griswolds and the Ingrams could take any amount of wine , could smoke any amount of opium , could eat any amount of hashish ; nevertheless they would be unable to create works of art . ''

		One wonders just where our author , in his fiery zeal , would place certain other of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's American critics of the
New England	LOCATION	tradi - tion , or near it ; the eminent essayist who called him the `` jingle man '' ; the eminent novelist who spoke of his `` very valueless verses . ''

		But
Herr Ewers	PERSON	ranges himself promptly with the European commentators : with
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, who calls
Poe	PERSON	a genius among various American talents one who , because he was `` fantastically inhuman , a con - scious artist doing strange things with strange materials , '' has failed to make many realize how fine , how rare was the beauty which an anticipator of
Verlaine	PERSON	and of Mallarme he brought into the world ; and with
Baudelaire	PERSON	, who said , when accused of imitating Poe : Savez-vous pourquoi j ` ai si patiemment traduit Poef Parce qu'il me ressemblait .

		La premiere fois que j ` ai ouvert un livre < le lui , j ` ai vu avec epouvante et ravissement , non seulement des sujets reves par moi , mais des phrases , pensees par moi , et ecrites par lui , vingt ans auparavent .

		Again
Poe	PERSON	the anticipator .

		Yes ,
Poe	PERSON	reached the Dionysiac ecstasy through wine and opium rather than through the melodious , moonlit gardens of the Al - hambra ; yet all the same , says his present commentator , he knew very well what he was about .

		He retained full consciousness of the nature of his `` art brought forth by intoxica - tion '' ; he was always capable of emphasizing the meaning and the importance of technique ; he kept a clear recognition of the Parnassian principles of art in their broadest meaning , and was ever able to demonstrate with power the high value of the inner rhythm of all poetry .


Poe	PERSON	's well-known dissection of `` The Raven '' disconcerts his follower not at all .

		He had created `` a work of art so clean , so finished , that he could risk such a step . ''

		He could well afford to speak with `` such candor '' of literary labor , of the craftsman 's work .

		We may learn from
Poe	PERSON	that `` godlike intox - ication alone does not create an absolute work of art , that ... the despised technique , the reflection and polishing , the weighing and filing , are quite as indispensable for its per - fection . ''

		In consequence , ``
Poe	PERSON	's value as a poet has not at any time been greater than in our own . ''

		Well , what is to be done ?

		What force majeure will make the Anglo-Saxon world ac - cept outside valuations of its poets against its will ?

		What power can make
England	LOCATION	feel and appraise
Byron	PERSON	as the Continent feels and appraises him ?

		What expenditure of worshipful eloquence will cause
America	LOCATION	to value
Poe	PERSON	as he is valued to-day by certain critics of
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	?

		We know , better than any foreigner can tell us , the shades of value involved in the moulding of English words into English sentences .

		We know better than any outside enthusiast , rapt in art for art 's sake , the value of the spiritual pabulum available for us in a given career and in its general message .

		We have our own particular scent for the detrimental , for the slightly meretricious .

		We do not exactly warm to
Herr Ewers	PERSON	when he declares himself happy in being a German , because `` Ger - many 's great men were permitted to be im - moral that is , not quite as moral as the good middle class and the priests '' ; or when he adds that the German knows that
Goethe	PERSON	`` was not so very moral , '' yet `` does not take that fact too much to heart . ''

		Nor do we quite rise to our author when he announces that `` later investigation '' has rehabilitated
Byron	PERSON	, so that he can now be accepted as `` moral '' and there - fore be read by the hypocritical English .

		Nor do we relish his prophecy that Oscar Wilde will presently be put through the same process .

		Nor do we quite apprehend how
Poe	PERSON	's one personal failing , or weakness , should cause him to be dragged so summarily into
Herr Ewers	PERSON	's improvised court of `` moral - ity . ''

		Poe assuredly was , as our author him - self is made to declare , `` a gentleman from top to toe , '' albeit a peculiarly unfortunate one ; and we are not at all certain that this new friend of his whom , the more we linger on him , the less , on general grounds , we like has made the misfortune of our poet and gentleman appreciably less .

		`` The Celt and the World '' is not a study of Celtic history , nor is it an estimate of Celtic achievement : it is an essay on European development from an unusual angle from the angle of a student who remains rather aloof from the achievements of the two Im - perial branches of the Teutonic stock the German and the Anglo-Saxon .

		Mr.
Leslie	PERSON	's ideal of European union is one from which
Europe	LOCATION	seems to have decisively departed a union under the Presidency of Pope and Emperor .

		He would have
Europe	LOCATION	subscribe to a secular Athanasian creed in which this declaration would be made with emphasis : `` Not three Emperors but one Emperor . ''

		He aims at showing us history by lightning flashes : `` When European nations partook of the apple of discord they threw the core to
Ireland	LOCATION	, whose children 's teeth were set on edge thereby . ''

		The book has epigrams a - plenty .

		Many are excellent ; notably the one that brings the Renaissance and the
Reforma	PERSON	- tion together `` The children of the Church ate nakedly of the tree of beauty , and in hor - ror of the
Rome	LOCATION	of the
Borgia	PERSON	and the Medici the northern folk made themselves the breeches of Puritanism . ''

		A few of the epi - grams are strained .

		Of
Barbarossa	ORGANIZATION	, who died an Aryan death in the field against the Mo - hammedan , he says : `` He would have been surprised had he wakened recently to find himself probably a Pasha and the Ottomans indistinct from the Ottonides . ''

		Mr.
Leslie	PERSON	shows another power besides that of epigram - making ; many pages in the book , notably the last ones , have real eloquence .

		Like too many Celtophobes and Celtophiles , Mr.
Leslie	PERSON	is disposed to look on the Celt as a creature in the inane .

		After all , the Celt had and has an environment , geographical , economic , and institutional , and this environ - ment has reacted upon his character .

		Are not many of the social and mental qualities of the Irish Celt due to the fact that the Irish population remained in the pastoral stage at a time when other West European peoples had become peasants in the true sense tillers of the soil ?

		And was not such a condition due to the fact that
Ireland	LOCATION	was poor as a grain - growing and rich as a grazing country ?

		Her geographical position meant isolation and isolation meant military unpreparedness .

		The Normans overran
Ireland	LOCATION	, not because the Teutonic mixture made the Normans a con - quering race , not because the Irish Celts were destined never to conquer , but because the man in armor with the lance in his hands and the castle behind him represented the best munitioning of his day .

		The isolated Irish Celt still fought in his saffron tunic with the sword or spear in his hand .

		But as soon as the Irish Celts took up the new armaments , they beat the Normans back and this the Teutonic Saxons failed to do .

		It would have been worth Mr.
Leslie	PERSON	's while to devote some paragraphs to `` The Wars of Turlough , '' that heroic piece of clan history which relates how Turlough O'Brien expelled the Normans from
Thomond	LOCATION	, his ancient patrimony .

		But unless the Celt wishes to remain a bundle of abstract qualities to outsiders , he will have to write his own history , showing his struggle for a culture and a competence and his own manful fight in a world becoming increasingly Teutonic .

		And , in addition , he will have to make a more complete presenta - tion of his life in literature .

		When these things are done , we shall find fewer intriguing phrases about the Celt .

		Then maybe the Teutons will find that he is a man and a brother even an elder brother .

		`` The Celt and the World '' has to do with the world just as much as it has to do with the Celt .

		It has to do with the world which , for Mr.
Leslie	PERSON	, is
Europe	LOCATION	, `` Aryaland , '' an Arya - land whose existence has always been threat - ened by great and dangerous
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Now that the dominant Aryan people , the Teutonic , are wasting themselves in fratricidal conflict , the menace of
Asia	LOCATION	becomes more positive , more immediate .

		That is the thesis of `` The Celt and the World . ''

		Mr.
Leslie	PERSON	sees in the various actions of the world war a supreme plot : a struggle to determine which of the two branches of the Teutonic family is to rule the waterways of a planet that is more ocean than land .

		The world will rest long and well after such striving , for it can afford an epic only once in a millennium .

		We should have liked to find in `` The Celt and the World '' a chapter or two more .

		One on the re-discovery in
Europe	LOCATION	of the Celtic language and literature would have been very much in place .

		Did not the names of d `
Arbois de Jourainville	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	, of
Nigra	ORGANIZATION	and
Ascoli	ORGANIZATION	in
Italy	LOCATION	, and of
Zeuss	LOCATION	,
Zimmer	PERSON	, Win - disch , and
Kuno Meyer	PERSON	in
Germany	LOCATION	move Mr.
Leslie	PERSON	?

		Zeuss 's `` Grammatica Celtica , '' published in
1853	DATE	, laid the foundations for Celtic scholarship , and the great
John ` Don	PERSON	- ovan wrote of its author : ``
Ireland	LOCATION	ought not to think of him without gratitude , for the 436 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	Irish nation has had no nobler gift bestowed upon it by any continental author for cen - turies back than the work which he has written on its language . ''

		The names of
Zimmer	PERSON	,
Windisch	PERSON	, and
Kuno Meyer	PERSON	have been more reverenced for the past twenty years in Ire - land than the names of any other foreigners .

		Indeed ,
Kuno Meyer	PERSON	was treated as a royal personage during his visits to the country .

		The acknowledgments which the German scholars made of
Europe	LOCATION	's debt to Irish cul - ture went a long way to set up a resistant to anti-German feeling on one side of the
Irish Sea	LOCATION	.

		While `` The Celt and the World '' has much to do with what is past , the fact that an Irish publisher has initiated a series of lives of '' Irishmen of To-day '' is a reminder that Ire - land 's strongest interest is in what is here and now .

		The latest pair of biographies have for their subjects
George W. Russell	PERSON	-LRB- `` A.E. '' -RRB- and
George Moore	PERSON	.

		`` A.E. '' is the greatest and most hopeful figure in modern
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		He essays no less than the creation of a new social order .


Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	and
John Ruskin	PERSON	made some such attempt in the Eng - land of two generations ago .

		But neither
Carlyle	PERSON	nor
Ruskin	PERSON	had his hands upon the practical thing , and in
England	LOCATION	of two gen - erations ago the mould was so fixed that it was impossible to break it up .

		`` A.E. 's '' hands are on the practical thing .

		And in
Ireland	LOCATION	there are many moulds , all little and some of them cracked , and it is possible to break a few of them up .

		`` A.E. '' is a poet , a painter , and an economist .

		But he is first and last a mystic , and for him men are actually children of God .

		Why should the children of God be degraded and enslaved by stupid economic conditions ?

		`` A.E. '' has left his meditations to discover an economic state that would be less degrading and less enslaving .

		He has become the prophet of cooperation , and not only the prophet of the movement but one of its actual directors .

		`` A.E. '' has his hands on the plough that is turning up a new and prosperous furrow in the old soil of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The account of his activities presented here is written by one who also has his hands on the plough .


Darrell Figgis	PERSON	's monograph is not detached : its great value is that it has come out of actual communings with `` A.E. '' and out of the writer 's own meditations on the problem of Irish reconstruction .

		It was a good thought to get a woman to write her version of
George Moore	PERSON	.

		It is probably truer than a man 's would have been , for
George Moore	PERSON	is a ladies ' man in the sense that some women can understand him better than any man could .

		Miss
Mitchell	PERSON	's witty biography makes a delightful portrait of that much-studied man .

		One of the most delightful things in the portrait is that she makes very little of the much-advertised wicked features .

		She refuses to take them seriously .

		She sees her hero as a fundamen - tally respectable , fundamentally pious West of
Ireland	LOCATION	gentleman .

		He has not got through with a certain boyish naughtiness , but he is good at heart and in soul .

		A kindly and considerate
George Moore	PERSON	!

		'T is a new por - trait indeed , but his friends and what living author has more friends ?

		will be delighted to possess it .

		Perhaps they have already sus - pected that the blond hair and the pink cheeks were the outward and visible signs of a not too guileful soul .

		The essays collected in this volume are an - other such warning , aimed to show that the attempt to translate such a `` plenitude of power '' into action has in fact not been in - variably successful .

		Not always has victory lain with the state when such an exercise of power on its part has brought it into real conflict with fundamental aims , beliefs , or loyalties of great bodies of earnest men joined together in societates by the very cohesive force of these common aspirations or ideals .

		The struggle then becomes in reality a com - petition for the loyalty and support of the same individuals , members at once of the societas and of the societas societatum which we call the state .

		Such individuals are then likely to find themselves in somewhat the em - barrassing position of a mediaeval English feudal tenant whose immediate overlord had revolted against the king ; and a decision in favor of the state now is no more a foregone conclusion than was one for the king eight centuries ago .

		If these things are historical facts , then any satisfactory theory of sov - ereignty must reckon with them .

		That they
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 437 are facts , Mr.
Laski	PERSON	proceeds with a sure hand to show .

		His examples are in the main drawn , as one might expect , from the modern history of the relations between states and churches .

		The first is the case of the Disruption of the
Scottish Church	ORGANIZATION	in
1843	DATE	.

		The Scottish Pres - byterians , it is true , were in the beginning wholly committed to the ecclesiastical abso - lutism of
Calvin	PERSON	, but before the sixteenth cen - tury was out the exigencies of the case had driven them to the later Presbyterian theory of the two kingdoms .

		`` There are , '' declared
Melville	PERSON	, `` two kings and two kingdoms in
Scotland	LOCATION	, that is King James the head of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, and there is Christ Jesus the King of the Church . ''

		This Mr.
Laski	PERSON	truly regards as `` the special contribution of Pres - byterianism to the theory of political free - dom . ''

		The theory lost none of its force in the centuries following .

		Its vitality is vividly illustrated by the compromise reached by Wil - liam Ill 's commissioner and the moderator of the first
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	after the Rev - olution and followed ever since , under which , at the end of each
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, a day is by agreement appointed for the meeting of the next year , by the Eoyal Commissioner `` in the name of the king , '' and by the moder - ator `` in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . ''

		The incompatibility of this theory with that of the absolutism of the state is the explana - tion of the Disruption of
1843	DATE	.

		Dr.
Chalmers	PERSON	and his followers were , in the words of the author , `` fighting a State which had taken over bodily the principles and ideals of the mediaeval theocracy . ''

		`` The real head and centre of the whole problem was thus the theory of parliamentary sovereignty . ''

		It is impossible , after following Mr.
Laski	PERSON	's clear and convincing account of the crisis , to escape his explanation of its cause .

		The chapters on the political theory of the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	and of the Catholic Re - vival of the nineteenth century are both sympathetic and keen , and they are the best chapters in the book .

		A key to the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	is to be found in
Newman	PERSON	's frank avowal in the `` Apologia , '' where he describes his
Conti	PERSON	- nental tour of 1832-3 .

		It was the success of the Liberal cause which fretted me inwardly .

		I became fierce against its instruments and its manifestations .

		A French vessel was at
Algiers	LOCATION	; I would not even look at the tri - colour .

		On my return , though forced to stop twenty - four hours at
Paris	LOCATION	, I kept indoors the whole time , and all that I saw of that beautiful city was what I saw from the Diligence .

		`` The State . ''

		says Mr.
Laski	PERSON	, `` had become non-Anglican , or , as they -LSB- the Tractarians -RSB- would have said , non-Christian , and they could not submit to a reform they knew to be inevitable at the hands of men whose doctrines they abhorred ... It is clearly against a presumed supremacy of the
State	ORGANIZATION	over the Church that protest is made ; and it is this which constitutes the key to the political theory of Tractarianism . ''

		Against the theory that the Church `` is bound by the law of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and its ministers ... bound to conform to that law , '' the Tractarians as - serted the inherent rights of the church as a society of believers .

		Perforce they realized , as Mr.
Laski	PERSON	says , `` that the time for a world - church had passed away , '' and thus they were driven to a definition of the church and found `` that to define its identity was to assert its exclusiveness . ''

		`` The whole foundation of Tractarianism , '' he acutely remarks , lies in the fact `` that the body of believers can no longer be identified with the nation as a whole . ''

		The Reformation had decided the battle in favor of the state , but to the Tractarians this se - cured for it `` rather independence than sov - ereignty , '' and all assertions of sovereignty , `` the
Church	ORGANIZATION	could still , and does still chal - lenge . ''

		`` We might not hold ... for ourselves that the
State	ORGANIZATION	is a church-maker as the
Earl of Warwick	ORGANIZATION	was a kingmaker , '' wrote
Gladstone	PERSON	in
1844	DATE	.

		`` Tractarianism is essen - tially the plea of the corporate body which is distinct from
the State	ORGANIZATION	to a separate and free existence . ''

		For Catholics the problem was practically the same as for Tractarians , but the difficulty was increased many-fold , on one side by the recollection in
England	LOCATION	of the Counter-Re - formation , and on the other by the growth of ultramontanism and an apparent revival of the claims of the medieval Papacy .

		A liberal Catholic like Lord
Acton	PERSON	might indeed regard the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	in Eng - land as virtually `` a voluntary and dissenting sect , '' but the legitimate demands of English Catholics for religious freedom and the re - moval of the intolerable disabilities retained by English bigotry were undoubtedly made immeasurably more difficult of attainment by the Catholic reaction , and it could not have been otherwise .

		It seems a little too strong to say in this connection that `` Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	was fighting a shadow . ''

		It was the great misfortune of English Catholics that while fighting for their rights against one Austinian sovereign they were forced to acknowledge another .

		The main portion of the book closes with a comparison of the theories of
Bismarck	LOCATION	and De Maistre .

		438 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	Where De Maistre discusses the
Papacy	LOCATION	,
Bismarck	PERSON	is discussing the German Empire .

		Otherwise , at bottom , the thought is essentially the same ... Each saw in a world of individualisation the guar - antee of disruption and evolved a theory to secure its suppression ... Each saw truth as one and therefore doubted the Tightness of a sovereignty that was either fallible or divisible .

		The Appendix contains two notes , on the relation of sovereignty to federalism and to centralization .

		Throughout , the style is as incisive and clear as the temper is judicial , and everywhere sympathy is combined with a rare detachment .

		These discussions have a real unity .

		They are so many illustrations of the failure of Austinianism to meet the facts of life .

		In the older attacks on this theory the approach was usually made from the rights of the in - dividual alone .

		Here the advance is through the rights of individuals in combination ; through a recognition of the existence in the resulting group of a personality real in the English , even if not in the Roman , sense a personality , moreover , which owes none of this reality to the creation or even to the assent of the state ; and , finally , through the assertion of the right , inhering in this group personal - ity , to its own life and to the performance of the functions necessary and incident to that life a right which the state has not given and may not take away .

		The influence of
Gierke	PERSON	,
Maitland	PERSON	, and
Figgis	PERSON	is apparent .

		The inability of Austinianism to withstand such an assault is becoming more obvious every day .

		It is an atomistic theory applic - able only in vacuo , and out of touch with reality ; a theory which presupposes a chasm between the governor and the governed whose existence every development of representative institutions tends further to disprove .

		It may be a little premature here to discuss the positive side of Mr.
Laski	PERSON	's political theory , as he promises `` a more constructive discussion '' for future publication , but an ob - servation or two may be risked .

		The true meaning of sovereignty , he says , lies `` not in the coercive power possessed by its in - strument , but in the fused good-will for which it stands ... Law clearly is not a com - mand .

		It is simply a rule of convenience .

		Its goodness consists in its consequences .

		It has to prove itself ... The will of the
State	ORGANIZATION	obtains pre-eminence over the wills of other groups exactly to the point where it is interpreted with sufficient wisdom to obtain general acceptance , and no further .

		It is a will to some extent competing with other wills , and Darwin-wise , surviving only by its ability to cope with its environment ... Your sovereign obtains what obedience he can , and it seems to be admitted that the judgment , or the conscience , of men , is in truth the actual arbiter of events ... The sov - ereignty of the
State	ORGANIZATION	will pass , as the divine right of kings has had its day .

		It has been no more than a sword forged in one of the mightiest of political conflicts .

		It has been a victorious sword but it must be replaced by newer weapons . ''

		The societas may thus be recognized as a person with rights , and the newer and more vivid recognition of this must greatly influ - ence political philosophy , but the real ques - tion of importance in the future is likely to be whether these juristische Personen merely take their places as subjects of the state beside natural persons , or whether we must now consider the latter as completely merged in the former , with no residue of personality with which a superior power could be in direct relation .

		Are we returning entirely to the feudal idea of mediacy , or shall we still have a place left in our system for Unmittelbarkeit ?

		for an individual unconnected with these groups , if such an individual can be imag - ined ?

		This theory teaches us that the in - dividual 's relations to the state may not be immediate .

		The important question is : Must it not ?

		Can we never again speak of `` Man versus the State '' ; must we think only of `` the Group versus the State '' ?

		Have we already passed , as
Maitland	PERSON	predicted we might , from status , through contract , to some - thing beyond ?

		Mr.
Laski	PERSON	has not explicitly dealt with these things , but in his view the individual seems still to be seen lurking behind the cor - poration if not advancing beside it .

		He is still `` the actual arbiter of events . ''

		Thus the group will is a medium , but the actual outcome in a contest of other group wills with that of the state must at bottom be determined by the deliberate choice of in - dividuals whose hearts are torn between the conflicting demands of their immediate societas and of the societas sociatatum .

		In the last analysis , then , Mr.
Laski	PERSON	's seems a theory , in its reaction against absolutism , lean - ing markedly toward philosophic pluralism if not political individualism ; and of individ - ualism Huxley long ago remarked , `` An - archy ... is the logical outcome . ''

		Such an outcome if inevitable would be fatal , not because theoretical anarchy is evil , but only because it is untrue to the facts of everyday life .

		The outcome , however , is not quite in - evitable , because the individual here posited may not be the individual in isolation , a sort of political
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, of whom Hobbes and
Locke	PERSON	had a vision , standing shivering 011 the threshold of the state , or even of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 439 society , while he weighed in his mind the terms on which he might come in a concep - tion of the individual which , it is much to be feared , did not entirely disappear along with the compact theory .

		Rather , our individ - ual seems to be , as
T. H. Green	PERSON	says , `` a self - determining subject , conscious of itself as one among other such subjects , and of its relation to them as making it what it is . ''

		He may , therefore , without danger , be admitted to have inherent rights , and rights even against the state , for `` a right ... to act un - socially , to act otherwise than as belonging to a society of which each member keeps the exercise of his powers within the limits nec - essary to the like exercise by all the members , is a contradiction . ''

		For such an individ - ual , `` under certain conditions there might be a duty of resistance to sovereign power . ''

		If so , it is hard to see any guide for him other than his own private judgment as to the social or unsocial nature of his resistance .

		And , it should be added , the norms of individual morality as interpreted by private judgment must also be the guide , and the sole guide , for state as well as for individual action , or the abyss will yawn for us as it already yawns for others .

		But , on the other hand , as Mr.
Barker	PERSON	has lately cautioned us , `` the
State	ORGANIZATION	and its institu - tions are with us , and we must make the best of them '' ; it `` will still remain a necessary adjusting force '' ; and the mind will not with - out a struggle throw away entirely occasional dreams of a synthesis wide and deep enough to embrace both the rights of the individual , which we dare not deny , and the majesty of the great Commonwealth , which claims the allegiance of us all .

		A perfect theory would do both , but none such has ever been found .

		All alike have been partial and transitory because they but reflected political conditions which were local or temporary .

		Certainly Austinianism , the real child of despotism , is the very last of these that we could safely ac - cept .

		There may be comfort , or there may be discouragement , in the thought that civiliza - tion has gone on for centuries with this world - old question constantly under debate in some sphere or other but never settled the ques - tion of free-will and determinism .

		`` Politics , as a science , is not older than astronomy ; but though the subject-matter of the latter is vastly less complex than that of the former , the theory of the moon 's motions is not quite settled yet . ''

		`` I am apt ... to enter - tain a suspicion , '' confesses
Hume	PERSON	, `` that the world is still too young to fix many general truths in politics , which will remain true to the latest posterity . ''

		In a period of wide and growing interest in the drama , like the present , it is natural that all sorts of experiments should be made .

		Most of these bristling shoots and suckers will doubtless be pruned away by time , but some of them may develop into vigorous fruit-bear - ing branches ; and whether they do so or not , their existence is evidence of vitality in the parent tree .

		Some of the most interesting of these experiments deal with the one-act play .

		Mrs.
Lee	PERSON	and Mr.
Knoblauch	PERSON	, for instance , have tried in different ways to unify a group of one-act plays .

		Mrs.
Lee	PERSON	's idea is that out of the popularity of one-act plays there may be developed a new dramatic form , more flexible and more ex - pressive of modern life than the long play which tells a single story , and related to the Shakespearean play as the symphony is re - lated to the fugue .

		`` Why , '' she asks , `` should there not be such a thing as a Symphony Play , a play made up of one-act plays three or four of them , or even five ... so re - lated in color and tone and progressive mean - ing that together they would form a perfect whole ? ''

		The theme which she has chosen is the power of sympathy or sympathetic un - derstanding .

		This is presented in four plays , entirely distinct in setting and characters , but resembling one another in that all are unreal and strongly flavored with a rather saccharine sentiment .

		In each the central figure is a gentle person of overflowing sym - pathy .

		The second and third pieces , `` The Mother '' and `` The Brother , '' are better than the rest ; but none of them shows unusual power .

		By the time the reader has finished the last , he will feel decidedly nauseated , un - less his appetite for candy is sturdier than mine .

		Mrs.
Lee	PERSON	's idea of a new dramatic form may turn out to be fruitful ; but she is ap - parently not the person to prove its value .

		A much more successful experiment in the same direction is Mr.
Edward Knoblauch	PERSON	's `` My Lady 's Dress . ''

		-LRB- On the ground of his birth we may claim Mr.
Knoblauch	PERSON	as an American , though he has lived mostly 440 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	abroad . -RRB-

		In this , no less than seven little plays are included within the `` frame '' prov - ided by the first and last scenes .

		These short pieces range in scene from
London	LOCATION	to
Siberia	LOCATION	, and in time from
1660	DATE	to the present .

		They are related by the fact that they are parts of a dream , presenting incidents connected with the materials , making , or marketing of the dress ; on the stage , also , by the fact that the chief roles in each are played by the lead - ing actors in the '' frame '' scenes .

		The play thus gives to these actors an unusual oppor - tunity to prove their versatility , and to the audience an unusual opportunity to enjoy it .

		This no doubt contributed to the success of the play in the theatre ; but it has more sub - stantial merits .

		The little plays are remark - ably compact and skilfully constructed ; and their moods , varying from lively comedy through pathos to tragedy , are so arranged as to heighten each other by contrast , and also to lead up to an effective climax in the two - scene piece in Act III .

		The play furnishes much stronger evidence of the value of Mrs.
Lee	PERSON	's idea than she has been able to present herself , and in composition it apparently ante - dates `` The Symphony Play '' by about two years .

		After all , it is the man who has thor - oughly learned his trade who can afford to make experiments .

		Mr.
Knoblauch	PERSON	had al - ready proved himself a successful pioneer in `` Kismet '' and `` Milestones , '' and his future work will be worth watching .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's `` Plays of the Natural and Supernatural '' are experiments in closet drama , frankly intended merely for reading .

		Of the seven one-act plays , only two the first and the last could possibly be presented on the stage .

		The last , `` Old Ragpicker , '' is a vigorously drawn sketch of an old derelict whose mind has nearly gone .

		There is no action , but the central figure has both pathos and power ; in the hands of a great actor it would be profoundly impressive .

		But the first piece , `` The Girl in the Coffin , '' is dram - atically by far the best thing in the volume .

		With slight modifications and cuts , it would go admirably in the theatre .

		The scene is the parlor of a workingman 's house , where the daughter lies in her coffin .

		The admirably realistic talk of the neighbor-women gives us the exposition ; they suspect a reason for the girl 's death which the family wish to conceal , and they have come to the house to see what they can find out , and also to persuade the father ,
William Magnet	PERSON	, to address a meeting of striking factory workers .

		His influence is needed to assure the success of the strike .

		He not only refuses them but invites them to leave the house .

		His talk with the old housekeeper shows that he knows the cause of his daughter 's death , but is agonized by the thought that he can not find out who is the guilty man .

		At last his friend
John Ferguson	PERSON	, a famous strike leader who has come to the town to take charge of the strike , persuades him to put aside his grief and wrath and speak to the workers .

		During this scene the audience slowly perceives that
Ferguson	PERSON	is the lover responsible for the girl 's death the man whom Magnet 's sole desire is to kill .

		Magnet himself ,
Ferguson	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Littig	PERSON	, the old woman who alone has had the confidence of the dying girl and keeps it , are all powerfully and vividly drawn .

		The reader does not sympathize with
Ferguson	PERSON	, as Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	seems to intend that he should , but this only increases the terrible ironic force of the play .

		The four plays of the supernatural , and one , `` The Light in the Window , '' which has no supernatural element , all make use of a device which , so far as I know , is new even in closet drama , and which is a source of fatal weak - ness .

		From speech to speech , Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	shifts his scene ; with one speech we are in a comfortable drawing room ; with the next , on the street outside listening to the talk of passers-by .

		Or with one speech we may be in Mrs.
Dela	PERSON	van 's kitchen , with the next in the front yard , and with the next on the engine of the fast mail , a hundred miles away .

		As a group these plays , even for reading , are not successful .

		They deal for the most part with material not really dramatic , and the kaleido - scopic shifts of scene are a weariness to the mind .

		Yet none of them is quite devoid of power , and two , `` The Blue Sphere '' and `` In the Dark , '' have considerable imaginative ap - peal .

		These five plays invite , and to some ex - tent deserve , ridicule ; but however cheaply they are estimated , a volume which contains `` Old Ragpicker '' and `` The Girl in the Coffin '' is not negligible .

		Mrs.
Aldis	PERSON	's `` Plays for Small Stages '' were written for one of the most successful of our small amateur theatres , `` The Playhouse '' at Lake Forest ,
Illinois	LOCATION	, and acted there by an amateur company .

		The short preface by the author contains some excellent hints for ama - teurs .

		`` We generally try to give our audience something they have not heard before , and seek plays in which the expressed word , the mental attitude and the interplay of char - acter are of more importance than the phys - ical action .

		Here if anywhere , although such - plays may seem difficult , lies the amateur 's opportunity . ''

		The plays illustrate this prin - ciple ; they all depend mainly on character interest .

		Two , `` The Drama Class of
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 441 Tankaha '' and '' ` Temperament , '' are lively burlesques .

		`` Mrs.
Pat	PERSON	and the Law '' is a comedy of low life , on rather conventional lines .

		The others , '' Extreme Unction '' and `` The Letter , '' are serious character studies .

		Perhaps they are all more remarkable for promise than for accomplishment , but they are written with sincerity and gusto and are well worth reading .

		`` Extreme Unction , '' in which a doctor administers an unusual kind of consolation to a dying girl of the streets , is the strongest .

		In `` The Letter '' an interest - ing situation is spoiled by a weak and tricky conclusion .

		Whatever the shortcomings of such plays , this kind of amateur experimenta - tion in which along with plenty of fun there is a serious attempt to present and interpret character , offers much hope for the future of our drama .

		Cleverer and a good deal more superficial are the one-act plays in Mr.
Percival Wilde	PERSON	's second volume , `` Confessional . ''

		They are gen - erally well-constructed and briskly written ; but they are likely to owe their point to a falsifying of human nature .

		In `` Confes - sional , '' for instance , the
Baldwins	LOCATION	, mother , daughter , and son , are waiting for Mr.
Bald	PERSON	- win 's return from an interview with his em - ployer , a bank president who has just been detected in peculation .

		They fear that Mr.
Baldwin	PERSON	may be involved .

		When he returns and tells them that he has just refused an offer of
$ 100,000	MONEY	to save his employer by keeping still forgetting one or two things at the trial they all criticize him for not taking the money , and he , a man proud of his integrity , admits that he has refused it merely for fear of their censure !

		He has practically decided to take it when another bank president prov - identially appears and offers him a position , saying that
Baldwin	PERSON	's former employer , in despair of corrupting him , has confessed .

		In `` The Villain of the Piece '' and `` A Question of Morality '' the characters are just as unreal , though the latter is saved by the fact that it is not much more than a bit of fooling and by the cleverness of its dialogue .

		The other plays , tainted to a less degree by the same unreality , are dramatically weaker .

		In his preface Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	sums up his theory as fol - lows : `` A single effect ... an instanta - neous arrest of attention , a continued grasp , and relinquishment only after the curtain has fallen ... crisis interpreted by emo - tion . ''

		This ideal is excellent as far as it goes , and Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	often realizes it ; but there is something lacking in the theory as in the plays .

		What that something is can be seen by anyone who will read `` According to Dar - win , '' which is perhaps Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	's nearest approach to reality , and then Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's `` The Girl in the Coffin '' or Mrs.
Aldis	PERSON	's `` Extreme Unction . ''

		Without real human character a first-rate one-act play is as im - possible as a first-rate play of any kind .

		Some time ago , in reviewing Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	's first vol - ume of plays in THE DIAL , I pointed out this defect ; it is more conspicuous in `` Confes - sional '' than in the earlier volume .

		Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	, in his preface , is very severe upon closet drama , but the most extravagantly unactable of Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's plays has this sense of reality in character which Mr.
Wilde	PERSON	's plays lack , and without which the wittiest and best con - structed piece is but a tinkling cymbal .

		Kipling 's new volume of short-stories is the first work of fiction that he has published in nearly seven years .

		I had promised myself to approach it as if I did not know the author , as if it were an unheralded wonder to be discov - ered and enjoyed , or a book unimportant in itself , to be dismissed and forgotten .

		I wanted to avoid the wearisomely familiar question whether Kipling had not ceased to be at his best before he was forty .

		But the question refuses to be warded off .

		Well then , one an - swer is that he is his own only rival ; the good qualities of these stories are peculiar to his genius .

		For thirty years his special mastery , powerfully announced at the brilliant begin - ning , has remained exclusively his , and no one else has surpassed him or even learned fairly to resemble him in kind .

		The best stories in this volume are Kipling all over .

		And I do not mean `` all over again . ''

		It is only the poorer stories that seem repetitive , and the earlier exemplars which they recall to the reader 's memory are not the best of the great young Kipling .

		One of the poems which serve as epilogues to the stories is called `` The Fabulists . ''

		It - begins : When all the world would have a matter hid ,
Since Truth	ORGANIZATION	is seldom friend to any crowd , Men write in fable , as old Aesop did , Jesting at that which none will name aloud .

		And this they needs must do , or it will fall Unless they please they are - not heard at all .

		Kipling has been a fabulist since the earliest Indian tales in which Hindoos uttered the parabolic wisdom of the
East	LOCATION	.

		And in many of his stories , laid in the East or the West 442 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 17	DATE	or in no-man 's - land , the concealed theme is a political argument .

		The first story in the present volume , `` As Easy as
A. B. C.	PERSON	, '' is a prophetic fable , forecasting in pseudo-scien - tific terms the time described in `` With the Night Mail , '' when the air shall be full of ships and the world shall be controlled by strange new physical forces .

		The point of the fable seems to be the failure of the Peo - ple , the death of Democracy , and the enfeeble - ment of the race .

		This pessimistic vision , in contrast with Wells 's triumphantly demo - cratic futures , is a sign , deeper than any de - cline of invention or narrative art , of the passing of
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's youth .

		Though one should not bear too heavily on the theme of a fanciful tale , the fabulist avowedly veils in his fiction what he conceives to be an intel - lectual Truth , , and it is fair to consider the point of Kipling 's parable in and for itself .

		So considered , that point , that idea , marks the development or the degeneration of
Kip	PERSON	- ling from the democratic interpreter of all manner of men , white , yellow , and brown , through a period of truculent imperialism , to the conservatism of premature senility .

		`` Senility '' is a permissible word only in relation to
Kipling	LOCATION	's social ideas and only against the memory of his youth , of the amaz - ing ` nineties when he was the god of all the other young men in the world and we vainly strove to catch the secret of his power .

		His old vigor ^ of phrase is undiminished , both the vigor which is beauty and the vigor which is brutality .

		He still has the trick of making all his characters , boys and men , even women , shoot rough , snappy Kiplingese phrases , which instead of having the effect of untruth to a diversity of creatures , somehow seem natural and give them all a blustering vital - ity .

		The energetic prose is still there , an un - attainable model for a generation of writers who have been encouraged to put `` punch '' into their style .

		The verse is not unattainable ; since
Kip	PERSON	- ling taught us how , any of us could have done it .

		The necromantic line is lacking .

		One poem is effective .

		It follows a crudely comic story called `` The Honors of War '' in which some young officers engage in sophomoric horse-play ; it is not funny and it is not meant to be funny , for the poem that fills the silence after that rowdy laughter has ceased turns it all to poignant tragedy : `` These were our children who died for our lands ; they were dear in our sight . ''

		I have been teased by a question which I can not answer ; perhaps it is unanswerable , but it is none the less interesting .

		Is an artist born with just so many strokes in him ?

		If he matures early , as Kipling did , and bunches his hits in his twenties and thirties , does he draw on an initially limited number of strokes , exhaust an inborn , predetermined amount of energy ?

		Is that an explanation of the fact , or a way of putting the fact , that some men become `` written out , '' others spread their real strokes over a long life , others begin late and maintain their highest level of achievement into old age ?

		The poets usually begin young ; certainly if a man has not written good verses before he is thirty he may be sure that his hand is not meant for the lyre .

		Writers of prose may begin late .

		The case of
William De Morgan	ORGANIZATION	was so ex - ceptional that journalists took pleasure in adding to his years , to make him , as they would say , `` more unique . ''

		That normal , steady craftsman , Troll ope , was about forty when he published `` The Warden , '' which was not his first novel but was the first to show the qualities which remained characteristic of him to the end .


Joseph Conrad	PERSON	was well over thirty before he began `` Almayer 's Folly . ''

		Until then , as he charmingly says in `` A Personal Record , '' `` the ambition of being an author had never turned up among those gracious imaginary existences one creates fondly for oneself at times in the stillness and immobility of a day dream . ''

		In the twenty years since the `` in - explicable event '' of his first book the weath - ered seaman , who left the sea to enter upon what he calls `` the career of the most unlit - erary of writers , '' has come to be acknowl - edged , acclaimed by his fellow artists as the chief figure in contemporaneous English prose .

		The form is prose .

		`` The Shadow Line '' is simply the story of the terrible experience of a young captain ; his first command , a fever-stricken ship , is becalmed ; when she staggers into port , the captain has crossed the line from youth to manhood .

		In point of length , method , interest , it groups with `` Ty - phoon , '' an extended episode somewhere be - tween a short-story and a novel .

		Like `` Typhoon '' and other stories of the sea by
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	, it contains within the prose form qualities which make it in effect as truly a poem as `` The Ancient Mariner . ''

		Conrad is a poet of the sea .

		On land his people move amid the sturdy actualities of life that can be comprehended in unmagical terms .

		However subtly he unfolds the char - acters of men , with whatever skill he con - trives the adventures , accidents , destinies of terrene humanity , however perfectly his phrases are suited to all occasions , always the daylight actualities ashore , even on strange
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 443 wild shores , remain on the hither side of that vague line beyond which is more than mystery , more than romance poetry .

		When the ship is out of sight of land , the line is crossed , another `` shadow-line '' ; the miracle happens .

		The ship becomes sentient , a spirit , a will .

		Common seamen are transformed into the figures of a dream , uncannily repulsive or glorified with an extramundane dignity .

		The sky above and the sea beneath are en - dowed , as by a new mythology , with obscure consciousness , purposes benign and malevo - lent , immensely indifferent to ships and men , yet in curiously personal or personified at - titudes toward them .

		And beauty always there is the beauty that springs from the poetic use of words , images , cadences , har - monies , whatever the formula is for literary magic .

		For
Conrad	PERSON	, `` the most unliterary of writ - ers , '' is no more nor no less unliterary than
Meredith	PERSON	or
Swinburne	PERSON	or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		No other writer I do not except the poets has a richer variety of verbal resource or uses his power with more careful command .

		This does not imply over-sophistication ; it means that mastery of an imaginative abundance which is the delight and the despair of those who understand literary art , and which , for - tunately , makes its effect on those who are merely listening to a story .

		In the steadily increasing number of Conrad 's sea pieces are many storms and many calms , dawns , fogs , and starry nights , and for each he finds new , unrepeated phrases .

		Not only does he find fresh words to convey the familiar aspects of the sea ; but the sea presents to him such manifold wonders that in each new voyage he reveals a mood that even he has not before recorded as if he could go on writing of the sea forever and exhaust neither the infinity of his mistress nor his power to celebrate her .

		In the midst of the waters , like the ship which is his creature and his fragile reliance , is man , adventuresome , romantic in youth , observant , philosophic when he has crossed the shadow-line . ''

		There they are : stars , sun , sea , light , darkness , space , great waters ; the formidable Work of the Seven Days , into which mankind seems to have blundered un - bidden .

		Or else decoyed .

		Even as I have been decoyed into this awful , this death - haunted command . ''

		Conrad 's men , the truest men that he has drawn , are children of the sea of life , and the god behind the winds that drive the sails toward fortune or disaster is Chance .

		JoHN MACY _ ON NEW FICTION The Irish Mr.
Ervine	PERSON	seems to have acquired more fame for his plays and novels than this very lengthy novel would seem to have entitled him to .

		`` Changing Winds '' -LRB- Maemillan ;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- is a mon - ument of industry rather than talent .

		There are few books that are easier to skip , and if the author had realized these failings of the reader , he might have made a more compact and convincing sketch of the modern Irish political movement .

		A book which deals with the intellectual preparation for the recent
Irish Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	deserves a weightier and more tragic tone , and should not be made gassy with endless and not too significant conversa - tion .

		The moral of the book seems to be thz > t Ulstermen may be both humanly appealing and indigenously Irish , but Mr.
Quinn	PERSON	's remarks are almost too ingeniously and deliberately constructed for the purpose of producing this conviction .

		`` Changing Winds '' suggests the book of a writer who has attempted to immerse himself in his sub - ject , but has not absorbed its implications .

		It is the work of a man who does not quite feel the life he portrays .

		As may be inferred from its title , Miss
Constance Lindsay Skinner	PERSON	's first novel , `` Good-Morning , Rosamond ! ''

		-LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is `` light . ''

		The publishers suggest that its setting is English , but the careful reader will assign the action to one of
England	LOCATION	's older and remoter American colonies .

		Perhaps the book may be described , with reserva - tions and qualifications , as a Nova Scotian `` Cran - ford . ''

		The cast of characters , while predominantly feminine , includes plenty of men , old or younger , who find it necessary to pay attention to the youthful widow that acts as heroine .

		The setting is designedly , perseveringly idyllic , but the action tends to lapse from comedy to melodra - matic farce .

		The book recounts the happenings of a single twenty-four hours , a `` wonderful day '' from which much is expected , and its form and development are largely conditioned by this cir - cumstance .

		Another result is that , owing to the considerable number of character-sketches essayed within narrow limits of space as well as of time , the work seems rather too much like a crowded even an overcrowded gallery of miniatures .

		Rosamond herself is sprightly and hearty , and is not meant to be too high-bred .

		An independent system - of illustrations by
Thomas Fogarty	PERSON	will challenge attention .

		It was done hastily and through her veil , but she was indignant .

		She does .

		The lady in `` The French Doll 's Dowry '' smiled at husbands and was civil to their wives .

		The latter suspected that she was not all she should be , and they were right .

		In '' Cupid at Forty '' it gives one a shock to learn that the heroine felt her esthetic nature `` sensuously '' soothed .

		This is put right later .

		The fault was hers for contenting herself 444 THE DIAL -LSB-

		On the whole , they are pleasing tales , some of which first appeared in impeccable periodicals , where one may shift from fiction to fashions , from proposals to pictures of the newest puddings .

		Having inherited her father 's entire fortune , which was to remain hers until she married , she went her placid way , circumventing the manoeuvres of five sisters-in-law .

		Petunia finally fell in love with a school teacher whom she at first took for a piano-tuner .

		The author has borrowed largely and more or less superficially from

		`` The Hornet 's Nest , '' by Mrs.

		A love story and a fair degree of humor bring it into line with the other mediocre and not alarmingly mysterious mysteries of the present season .

		`` If Wishes Were Horses , '' by

		The author adds a queer touch to the story by turning the end - ing into a regular `` glad book . ''

		The selfish and brutal hero falls on his knees at his wife 's death - bed , and becomes at once a good and noble man .

WAU	LOCATION	.

		By
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	appears here in the role of official and reflective reporter , trusted by the powers to present to a world un surfeited with war-books something of the problems , the technique , and the achievements of modern warfare .

		This he does with an admirable clearness , in the manner that is his own .

		Particularly significant , for Americans , at the present juncture , is the chapter `` New Arms for Old , '' which preparedness-mongers may well take to mind .

		Among other things , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	says : `` Occasionally into the writers study come to hand drifting fragments of the American literature upon the question of ` preparedness . '

		.

		.

		In none of these is there any clear realization of the fun - damental revolution that has occurred in military methods during the last two years . ''

		According to indications , there is n't yet , even in government circles , and the enlightenment of public opinion on the matter is imperative .

		For the rest , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	exhibits the old passion - ateness and the old incapacity to understand any - body who holds opinions different from his present ones .

		Particularly blind is his discussion of the yielding pacifist and the conscientious objector , and particularly unintelligent his discussion of the `` religious revival . ''

		The fact is that he has the healthy , instinctive outlook of a patriot to whom that is good which reenforces his patriotic and private hopes , and that evil which does n't .

		The religious revival , for example , turns out to be the realization of a common human purpose , as against churches , creeds , and sects a `` rule of righteousness '' with which `` hard and practical men '' want to get the world straighter than it is ; that is , the `` religious revival '' consists in hav - ing the same general sentiments as Mr.

		FIGURES OF SEVERAL CENTURIES .

Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

$ 3	MONEY	.

		Almost equally intriguing in its mechanical make-up and in its assemblage of component parts is this belated miscellany by
England	LOCATION	's well-known critic and poet .

		Though Mr.
Symons	PERSON	is con - stantly bringing out books , none of the reviews and literary essays in the present one date within the past ten years ; many of them are older than fifteen ; one or two date back a quarter of a cen - tury ; and some of them are early things recently or less recently retouched .

		From what source are revived the short pieces on Saint
Augustine	PERSON	-LRB- 1897 -RRB- , Welsh Poetry -LRB- 1898 -RRB- , and
Thomas Lovell Eeddoes	PERSON	-LRB- 1891 -RRB- ?

		Several of the essays , or book reviews , deal with French writers who once may have been living issues but who are scarcely such at present .

		Huysmans ,
Mallarme	ORGANIZATION	, Villiers de 1 ` Isle-Adam , and the Goncourts have had their place in the sun and have taken their place in the shade .

		The longest pieces are devoted to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and Swin - burne , and serve largely to show either their author 's restrictions as a critic or his shortcomings as a man .

		One inclines to take refuge in such essays as , by the very remoteness of the subject - matter involved , seem to escape being passe such as the pieces on Charles Lamb and on
John Donne	PERSON	.

		And a note of value is struck in instances of intimate personal knowledge as in the cases of Pater and
Patmore	PERSON	.

		Altogether a book of varying values and curious arrangement a book in which the reader browses at will and take ?

		THE LOCKED CHEST and THE SWEEPS OF NINETY-EIGHT .

		MOGU , THE WANDERER .

		By
Padraic Cohan	PERSON	.

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		When authors have tried to get back to the speech of the people , the success of the venture has depended on how close they really were to the people .

		Where they are far removed from the soil , there is usually a patent strain in their hand - ling of an idiom necessarily foreign to them .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	here attempts a reproduction of the matter and the manner of a tale from the Lax - daelsaga .

		The dramatic handling is of course without reproach , and one views the character por - trayal with interest , for the author departs from saga tradition and refuses to give heroic propor - tions to his people .

		He makes the ancient farmers act very much like the farmers of to-day , with all the characteristic petty greed , cowardice , jealousy , and self-interest .

		The only action that might be called heroic is the summary way in which Ingiald takes the doing of justice into his own hands , which is not so ancient after all when one considers our own feuds , lynchings , and vigilantes .

		The other play is a scene from the Irish rebellion of ninety-eight .

		Both are one-act plays written with a considerable amount of humor , and though little likely to add to Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's fame , they are thoroughly read - able and capable of presentation .

		Mr.
Colum	PERSON	's play is fantastic and full of au - thentic oriental color .

		It moves in a world , both physically and psychologically remote , where Fate , though never actually present to the eye , is really the chief actor .

		It is a world intrinsically dem - ocratic where , by Fate 's intervention , a beggar and his daughter may serve as lofty a purpose as a king .

		There Fate makes all , least and greatest , but the puppets of its will .

		The actors suffer and rejoice , and believe themselves to be acting freely , but he is most wise and content who realizes that he is only the servant of a higher power .

		To the occidental believer in the power of the will , there is something too humiliating in this belief , an in - definable something too spineless , too resigned and weak .

		To some , however , the mystic idea of self - immolation is lofty and beautiful .

		To these , the yielding of will and responsibility only makes man the more free in his actions .

		Mogu , the beggar , made vizier for a brief time , plays both parts with the proper gestures , returning to beggardom grace - fully .

		The working out of his destiny is necessa - rily accompanied by a grim humor with suggestive .

Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	, and suspicion prob - ably would better rest with them .

		The territory is divided into fifty-seven routes , such as `` Ports - mouth to

		The work of the town advertiser is conspicuous by its absence , in fact , some of the `` local authorities '' evidently were not very deeply impressed with the excellent qualities of their home towns .

		Yale ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		This little book will bring nothing new to stu - dents of
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's work , but it may well prove a useful introduction for those not fortunate enough to have secured Salt 's biography of the poet .

		Mr.
Meeker	PERSON	disclaims any ambitious purpose ; he has made a compendium , largely from the studies of Salt and
Dobell	PERSON	, now become rare .

		He adopts a rigid chronological order in the discussion of the poems , which he uses as an interpretative commen - tary of the biography .

		He quotes generously from the poems , and has chosen characteristic extracts from the letters and the journal cited by Salt .

		Mr.
Meeker	PERSON	has missed an opportunity in not striking into a little-explored region that of the compari - son between Leopardi and
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Again , there is the influence of Dante on
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, constantly referred to , but never carefully worked out .

		In addition to the often-mentioned Dantesque imag - ery of the `` City of Dreadful Night , '' a compari - son might be made between portions of `` Our Lady of Sorrow '' and `` La Vita Nuova . ''

		Possibly also the lady
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	meets in crossing the desert in the `` City '' -LRB- Part Four -RRB- owes something to the first sonnet of `` La Vita Nuova . ''

		There can be little doubt that
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	felt the analogy of his own situation with that of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	in regard to youthful love early doomed to bitter disappoint - ment .

		Without great stretch of the imagination `` The City of Dreadful Night '' might be called a memorial to
Matilda Weller	PERSON	, and a memorial such as `` hath not before been written of any woman . ''

$ 1	MONEY	.

		A poignant interest and much dramatic power characterize these two plays , closet dramas which might easily be adapted for the stage .

		Both de - pict , with caustic realism , home life in a western
New York	LOCATION	town -LRB- thinly disguised under the name Odysseus -RRB- ; both oppose to its fixed standards and stifling provincial air the freer existence of fash - ionable or Bohemian
New York	LOCATION	.

		No less vivid the contrast of characters presented : a Spartan older generation , clinging to routine and prejudice , a younger one grown to distrust even the idealism of its elders , rebellious , eager for freedom and self-realization , eager to solve the problems of life in its own way .

		It is this problem , so difficult in the case of a daughter , which makes both plays a strong indictment of the `` good old-fashioned '' home whose bondage is still robbing many a woman of her woman 's happiness .

		This is , however , but one aspect of these thoughtful plays , whose dial - ogue fairly bristles with general ideas , from mat - ters like marriage , sex education , and the double standard , to questions such as the future of dem - ocracy and the European War .

Boston	LOCATION	,
Dec. 11 , 1915	DATE	, it was decided that an ``

British Expeditionary Force	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	, for the duration of the war .

		Money was promptly subscribed , and
Miss Alice Fitzgerald	PERSON	was chosen , and the spirit in which she is carrying out her mission , and something of what that spirit means to her wounded in
France	LOCATION	, may be inferred from the following record .

		These brief extracts from her letters to members of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	and to other friends in

John E. Eob	PERSON	- inson 488 NOTES AND NEWS 490 LIST OF NEW BOOKS .

		491 CASUAL , COMMENT TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE BEGINNING OP THE EUROPEAN STRUGGLE , Mr.
L. P. Jacks	PERSON	wrote an article on the `` peacefulness '' of be - ing at war .

		The tone was almost idyllic .

		Eng - lishmen , he said , had found `` rest for their souls '' ; they had at last discovered a mission and were able to put certainty in the place of confusion ; the old uproar of rival '' idealisms '' had been stilled in the thunder of the guns .

		And out of `` moral chaos '' there had emerged a happy and united people .

		Yes , `` happy '' was not .

		too strong a term , he assured us , feeling possibly that it might sound a little incredible and even blasphemous to Americans not yet touched by the fever of war .

		What Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	described with even more than his cus - tomary eloquence , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	looks at from the other side in his ``
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	and Brit - ain at War . ''

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	finds something of the same attitude in all the peoples at war ; but he does not call it `` peace of mind '' ; he calls it simply a paralysis of thought .

		The war has absorbed every energy , centred every activity in itself , forced men to live only in the present .

		It has developed a whole tech - nique of evasion , which is sufficiently ex - pressed in that triumphant platitude : `` This war is going to produce enormous changes in everything . ''

		The phrase is felt to have all the mystic force of a conjuration ; it is a might soporific .

		It assumes that the future will take care of itself .

		There is , in a word , precisely the old tendency to drift , a tendency enormously intensified by the distractions of war .

		There is naturally a great deal of stir but it is hardly a stir of mind .

		There is no effort to understand and control events even the events that led to the war ; there is no deep realization of the formidable problems of the reconstruction .

		The mind of
Europe	LOCATION	, like a schoolboy freed from his books , has simply gone on a vacation .

		And that is the real `` peacefulness '' of being at war .

		TWO IMPORTANT CENTENARIES AMONG THE PUBLISHERS fall in the present year .

		Messrs.
Harper & Bros.	ORGANIZATION	, 1817-1917 , are out with an announcement of a `` centennial anniversary '' one that `` carries all friendly regard and 462 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 31	DATE	best wishes ... to the authors of to - day '' ; and `` Blackwood 's Magazine '' the `` Maga '' beloved of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	has advanced into its hundredth year .

		After a preliminary venture which involved in - capable editors and too-restricted honoraria this magazine , in its present aspect , struck its gait in
October , 1817	DATE	the first periodical decoration of the kind indulged in by the large publishing houses ; the immediate pre - decessor of `` Bentley 's , '' `` Chambers ' , '' `` Fras - er 's , '' `` Longman 's , '' and the rest , down to ``
Harper	PERSON	's , '' and beyond .

		The renovated magazine took its second step under the guidance of the boisterous and exuberant
Wilson	PERSON	, and of
Lockhart	LOCATION	, that sarcastic de - tractor of Hunt ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Tenny	PERSON	- son .

		It published
George Eliot	PERSON	's ``
Amos Barton	PERSON	'' in
1857	DATE	, and later enjoyed the serv - ices of Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	as historiographer .

		In days when so many of the best periodicals , issued by the best houses on both sides of the water , are suffering lapses , suppressions , and metamorphoses , the continuing careers of `` Blackwood 's , '' which has run its century , and of ``
Harper	PERSON	's , '' which has completed two - thirds of a century , are matter for gratula - tion ...
CHICAGO	LOCATION	'S PROMPT UTILIZATION OF ITS NEW POETS , for purposes of social entertainment , was an outstanding feature of the first `` field day '' of the
Cordon Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few years ago Messrs.
Sandburg	PERSON	,
Masters	ORGANIZATION	,
Lindsay	PERSON	, and the rest were far from being household words ; but to-day the `` quick comediennes '' of the Cordon not only know them but bur - lesque them , and not only burlesque them , but bid them come and see the thing done .

		In `` The Gods of the Market '' a travesty obviously referring to Lord Dunsany 's mas - terpiece these new friends and spokesmen of ours were put through various paces .

		Such a confident concernment with local matters may be either metropolitan or provincial it all depends .

		If successfully put over , the deed becomes that of a metropolis ; if not , it falls to that of a parish .

		As the general movement of the town is toward a metropoli - tan status , the lively ladies of the Cordon may be given the benefit of any possible doubt .

		Yet a readiness to burlesque litera - ture and its votaries is perhaps not the best way of indicating that literature may be a serious concern ; nor does it greatly brace the morale of the men whose work , done with full sobriety , furnishes the grounds for the skit .

		Of course , there is the `` advertis - ing '' ; but reclame does not always yield a sufficient consolation .

		THE HIT-OR-MISS PROCEDURE OP GOOD LUCK will never cease to astonish .

		There is the man who brings out his book only to discover , however good his will , that it is the wrong book for the time , or the wrong time for the book , and that his royalties are nil .

		And there is the man who , however unknowingly , brings out the right book at the right time and reaps , most unexpectedly , a great reward .

		Take , for example , `` The Plattsburg Manual '' and the two young lieutenants in the
United States	LOCATION	army who are its fortunate authors .

		After the
1916	DATE
Plattsburg Camp	ORGANIZATION	, where they were employed as instructors , they sat down to produce a book which would meet a need found there a manual that should teach a man a number of things which he could learn quite as well at home , before beginning train - ing at a camp ; and their modest expectation probably was to sell a thousand or so copies to intending Plattsburgers for
1917	DATE	.

		The book appeared about the time of our declara - tion of war , and army heads , seeing at once its value , hastened to give it their approval .

		In consequence , it has been steadily on the press ever since publication ; and its authors , besides having rendered their country timely and valuable service , will gain in royalties an equivalent , several times over , of a lieuten - ant 's proverbially modest salary .

		With good luck so frequently hitting the undeserving , it is a pleasure to record one instance of the opposite nature .

		^ THE REPORT TO THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE AMERICAN AUTHORS ' FUND , instituted a year ago for the relief of the wounded soldiers of the allied nations , shows that
$ 6000	MONEY	was raised , of which , after deducting various costs and charges , some
$ 5000	MONEY	was distributed among the military hospitals of
France	LOCATION	, Eng - land ,
Servia	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		`` Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	, '' says the report , `` has arranged that a bed in the hospital for
Les Tuberculeux de la Guerre	ORGANIZATION	should be endowed , and called ` The Gift of American Authors , ' '' and a small portion of the fund has been devoted to the work of teaching blind soldiers how to support themselves .

		The amount asked of each individual was modest , one dollar , or more , and the authors contributing num - bered thirty-seven hundred .

		The report nat - urally carries a postscript asking for further contributions , as the needs of the situation have grown rather than lessened .

		The com - mittee hopes to raise at least
$ 3000	MONEY	more , and offerings to the fund , of which Mrs.
Margaret Deland	PERSON	still remains treasurer , may be sent to the
State Street Trust Company	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 463 A Russian Dramatist and the American Stage The Russians are candid and disconcerting 1 critics .

		They lack the cement of hypocrisy , if we are to trust the judgment of Professor
Miliukov	PERSON	, the guiding spirit of the recent Rev - olution .

		They are bluntly outspoken and do not make a virtue of mental and sentimental reservations .

		When their intellectuals come to
America	LOCATION	and make harsh comments on cer - tain phases of our artistic and social life , we can well afford to listen respectfully to their verdicts .

		For one thing , they have the ad - vantage of being in a position to institute comparisons .

		And , happily , they do not have the deadly certainty , so common among Anglo-Saxons , that their own notions of doing things are far and away superior to all other varieties .

		Russians never hesitate to point a reproving finger at their own shortcomings .

		It is naive and refreshing .

		They were all brought up under an autocracy and they are very diffident .

		What will happen to this crit - ical sanity if they decide to become out-and - out democratic , one can only contemplate with dread .

		In such an event , imagine the superior spread-eagleism they will have every right and precedent to indulge in .

		The largest dem - ocracy in the world !

		But their judgment is as yet unspoiled .

		They have not learned to say what they do not think .

		One of these Russian intellectuals at present residing in
America	LOCATION	is
Ossip Dymov	PERSON	, the author of `` Niu , '' now being played in
New York	LOCATION	under the management of Ordinsky and Urban .

		Dymov has been in this country for the
last two and a half years	DATE	, and , in an essay written for the `` Viestnik Ameriki , '' he has some illuminating things to say about the American theatre .

		The American stage is a true reflection of our feverish civilization ; it is attuned to the rhythm of American life .

		It has developed , not by centuries , but by decades .

		In the countries of
Europe	LOCATION	there exists a similarity of culture .

		This imparts to the European drama a certain essential uniformity .

		European authors form one large family and dramas are freely translated from one language to another .

		But the American stage remains `` unconquered territory , '' and lives its own peculiar life in pleased provin - ciality .

		`` It is seldom that a member of the international family succeeds in penetrating to the American stage . ''

		The European stage still retains a far-away connection with the ancient `` mysteries '' that were permeated with religious feeling .

		To-day , this religious sen - timent takes the form of sestheticism , or sym - bolism , or mysticism , as in the case of Maeter - linck ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, Andreyev .

		The American the - atre has abruptly severed all relations with these sentiments .

		It is following an indepen - dent course and attempts to work out its own salvation .

		`` At best it moralizes , at worst it is a cheap amusement for a contented crowd . ''

		The dramatist of the old world has before him the ideal spectator a cultivated indiv - idual .

		With us , art is sacrificed to the mob ; the mob leads the author ; and `` he is only one of the crowd , not the only one above the crowd , as in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		The American play must appeal to every spectator , whether in the pit or the gallery .

		Hence the appeal of an American drama is to the emotions rather than to the intellect , for the emotions are more nearly universal , more primitive , less separ - ative .

		Therefore , in order to please the pop - ular taste , a drama is remodelled and mutilated dozens of times before it is pro- duced .

		Under such conditions , the dogged rise of the action to a pitiless and inevitable climax is impossible , as is the denouement that will bring the purgation of pity and terror .

		There must be no discord between the author and the spectator , the stage and the audience .

		The whole situation may be summed up in the compact formula : `` In
Europe	LOCATION	, they listen to a drama ; in
America	LOCATION	they look at a drama . ''

		This necessity of appealing to the eye makes the American producer aim at a painful per - fection of realism .

		The spectator `` sees '' all the steps in the development of the action ; he even `` sees '' the catastrophe , in most cases a `` happy ending , '' and the only thing he is permitted to guess is `` how gorgeous , how rich the wedding will be . ''

		As a consequence , all attempts at impressionism , symbolism , the modes of artistic reserve all seeking of new ways is viewed with disapproval .

		`` The American stage is rudely realistic , naturalistic to utter tastelessness . ''

		Esthetic experimen - tation is sacrificed to the stolid stability of the stage .

		464 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 31	DATE	The stage of
America	LOCATION	is all aglow with `` stars , '' each shedding his or her constant , unchanging light .

		`` Real artists , with a spark of the divine fire , are a rarity . ''

		The Russian method of acting through inner life , through emotional experience is totally foreign to the American theatre .

		Talent , versatility , artistic rebirths , are stifled by the tyranny of a suc - cessful `` part , '' of a role that has won the plaudits of the audience .

		There are no re - incarnations ; there are only repetitions faintly disguised .

		In the theatres of
Europe	LOCATION	, even before the war , the directors were clamor - ing for more plays .

		They complained of a dearth , and the drama seemed to be passing through a sharp crisis .

		A few talented play - wrights had a virtual monopoly of dramatic production : Andreyev ,
Hauptmann	PERSON	,
Bern	LOCATION	- stein ,
D'Annunzio	PERSON	,
Hamsun	LOCATION	.

		In
America	LOCATION	there is no crisis ;
New York	LOCATION	alone has an annual output of one hundred new plays .

		It is as if the whole thing were run by an ex - cellently adjusted machine , working , let us say , with the force of several thousand horse - power .

		But within very recent years , a new spirit has penetrated the American stage .

		Foreign stars have been cordially received , and there have been sporadic performances of foreign dramas .

		The dramatic art of all countries is passing through a period of tran - sition , and if the American theatre is being Europeanized , the European theatre is being Americanized .

		The compensation will enrich both .

		And when , to the perfection of Amer - ican stage technique shall be added the `` inner life '' of the Russian drama , the ideal theatre will arise .

		Dymov is by no means a carping or ungen - erous critic .

		But there is no doubt that he finds our `` dramatic morality '' smug and bour - geois and our playwrights and play producers obsessed by a synthetic apparition the Amer - ican audience which forever whispers a hol - low and affrighted Verboten .

		His views lead to the verdict that our stage is in a sad , but hopeful condition .

		Hope depends upon fur - ther European impregnation .

		He has noth - ing to say about our really excellent plays .

		In all likelihood he is not acquainted with them .

		Perhaps he is not able to appreciate , at its true worth , the `` inner life , '' the native spirit of our drama .

		Nor does he give suffi - cient credit to the valiant efforts that are mak - ing for the cultivation of an aesthetic sense in our people .

		The `` little theatres , '' the com - munity and neighborhood playhouses , the `` pageant '' movement , all are signs of a dramatic awakening in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is the prospect of this rebirth that gives special significance to the production of
Dymov	ORGANIZATION	's play , `` Niu . ''

		The real importance for our stage of this work , lies in its courageous at - tempt to apply a new principle that of the despised `` movies . ''

		to the spoken drama .

		Al - though moving-pictures were a rarity in
Russia	LOCATION	at the time the play was written , Dy - mov realized that they were destined to serve an important end in the civilization of the future .

		He determined to write a play which would not develop a single action interrupted only by the artificial act divisions , but which would be a series of separate pictures , follow - ing each other in rapid succession .

		This play is `` Niu , '' which is composed of ten scenes presented with the very briefest of intervals .

		The novel principle involved appealed to other Russian dramatists , among them
Sologub	PERSON	, who wrote his `` Vanjka Kluchnik and Page Jean , '' in thirteen `` pictures . ''

		The artistic basis of `` Niu '' would make the author of `` The New Laokoon '' shudder .

		The play bids defiance to the ordinary concep - tion of dramatic unity , and represents the attempt by another iconoclastic modern to merge the genres .

		But why should the mod - erns shut their eyes to the artistic combina - tions made possible by the new developments and discoveries in the mechanical arts ?

		In a sense , the dramatic principle underlying
D'Annunzio	PERSON	's `` Cabiria '' and
Knoblauch	PERSON	's `` My Lady 's Dress '' is the same .

		In the mov - ing-pictures miracles abound , causal connec - tion is almost destroyed , a lack of sober reasonableness is apparent , and the audience finds itself in the realm of the inexplicable and the unmotivated .

		But a drama intended for the stage can never depart from the higher unity of impression .

		Each of the scenes of `` My Lady 's Dress '' is a separate and dis - tinct `` drama , '' yet all are linked together by a single idea or mood and a unified motivation .

		The same is true of `` The Affairs of Anatol . ''

		A spectacular drama really a pageant like `` The Wanderer , '' or `` Caliban of the Yellow Sands , '' has the looseness of structure that characterizes the old miracle cycles .

		The dramatic structure of `` Niu '' differs from both of these types .

		It keeps close to the true dramatic form by introducing few characters , by focussing the interest upon the heroine ,
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 465 Annette or
Niu	ORGANIZATION	, and by limiting the action to one central conflict .

		All this appears ortho - dox enough .

		But in its dramatic technique `` Niu '' makes bold innovations .

		Each of its parts is a separate picture , one in a `` reel '' of ten scenes .

		Each scene has the elaboration of detail , the suggestive background , the sym - bolic side-business , the pantomimic action of the `` movies . ''

		The motion-picture heart-throb is there , and the appeal to the primary emo - tions of the very `` crowd '' that , as we have seen , Dymov counsels our American dram - atists to leave out of their reckoning .

		But `` Niu '' pays a heavy penalty for its thoroughgoing attempt to apply the principle of the moving-picture to the spoken drama .

		The action drags along with slow , lumbering gait and much drawing of creaking curtains .

		The effects are painfully obvious : symbolism , contrasts , pantomime , fated occurrences all are palpable and disenchanting .

		The dra - matic devices protrude like bare bones , and each one is made to work overtime .

		There is no artistic reticence .

		Everything is `` on the stage , '' plain as a pikestaff , distractingly simple , literal , naked , unequivocal , ploddingly consequential .

		The characters bring them - selves to book and dissect their emotions with decadent relish .

		And yet the drama has a flavor that is quite unique possibly Russian , surely exotic .

		This quality exists in the play not because of the central situation which is a variation on the orthodox `` triangle '' but because Niu and her husband are beings strangely compounded and oddly entangled .

		The husband 's hold on his wife rests on a sexual uxoriousness which makes him a weak - ling .

		He becomes distressing and hateful to a woman suffering from the nostalgia of the distant , the inexplicable , the desire for a love that is mystically near and yet forever unat - tainable .

		To the spectator Niu is the most interesting character in the play because she is the one that least understands herself .

		Psy - cho-analysts will hail her as a `` case '' ; literary analysts will significantly group her with The Lady from the Sea .

		But
Niu	PERSON	does not set out on a search for emancipation .

		Not even free - dom to love can heal her psychic malady .

		Hers is a recoil from the threadbare sameness of love and life , an inexpressible yearning for miraculous and magic experiences , a tragic weariness of the spirit in which regret and longing and hopeless boredom are strangely mingled .

		Only in death can she cease from troubling .

		Her very substantial husband and her light-o ' - love poet .

		will never under - stand this woman who can be neither wife nor mistress .

		And when she dies , the two men become as one to her placers of wreaths upon a coffin .

		It is interesting to speculate on how Dymov came to see the possibility of applying the principle of the moving-picture to the spoken drama .

		In all his work ,
Dymov	PERSON	shows a keen consciousness of subtle qualities and relations .

		The very titles of his two volumes of short stories `` Solstice , '' `` The Earth is Blossom - ing '' suggest something of the author 's style and method .

		Ossip Dymov is a skilful and re - fined impressionist and a mystic .

		For him everything in nature is a miracle , every stir and heave and movement in the world of things about us is a manifestation of a mi - raculous universe .

		The opening of a door , sunrise , a first kiss , the new
spring	DATE	, the birth of a noble thought , the song of a skylark on an
April	DATE	morning all are eloquent with divine meaning .

		Mystery lurks in all things .

		`` Some strange mystery marks women long before their birth , '' says
Dymov	PERSON	in one of the stories in `` Solstice . ''

		The phrase would make an appropriate motto for the play , `` Niu , '' a study of a woman seeking a love and a con - tentment which she never finds , and which forever remain a mystery to her .

		Even in the walls of a room
Dymov	ORGANIZATION	sees miracles .

		In one place he writes : `` Strange and incomprehensible is this influence of the walls upon a man and of the man upon the walls . ''

		And yet there is something shallow and ready-made about this facile mysticism , something of the disenchanting in these mul - tiplied mysteries and superabundant miracles .

		It all comes too easy ; you feel no laboring of the spirit to acquire a sense of otherworldly connotations .

		It is no better than the fluent symbolism of so many of the moderns .

		As a Russian critic says : `` Gold would have no value to the man who found that all the cob - blestones were made of gold . ''

		But the spirit that animates
Dymov	PERSON	's works is an earnest attempt to light up and glorify a workaday world .

		In his portrayal of character Dymov shows the same awareness of hidden mysteries in human beings , in their motives and in their strivings ; seeking to understand these , he comes upon miracles .


Louis S. FRIEDLAND	PERSON	.

		466 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 31	DATE	Advertising Politics Not since the Civil War have men been so interested in the business of politics as they are at the present time .

		The entrance of
America	LOCATION	into the European struggle has dramatized the significance of national affairs .

		They have become genuinely interesting to the average man .

		They have taken on some - thing of that fascination which before he ascribed only to baseball and Wall Street .

		It is a change in attitude of momentous impor - tance .

		For the last twenty-five years ob - servers have not ceased to complain that the modern democracy is uninterested in its own life .

		Certainly , politics seems , too often , to have been regarded as outside the legitimate scope of ordinary conversation .

		Social psy - chologists were not slow to point out the cause of this : they explained that politics failed to relate itself to the national life with such emphasis as to secure the eager attention of busy and somewhat weary men .

		Now , with amazing rapidity , the whole perspective is changed .

		Everyone is talking politics .

		The - ories of the state are tossed off lightly at the dinner tables of Broadway .

		They have ideas on the technique of administration in
Kansas	LOCATION	;
California	LOCATION	is full of plans for the vitalization of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It is a great opportunity for the reconstruction of political life .

		How are we to take advantage of it ?

		The central need is very clear .

		What we have to do is to make this sudden spurt of national interest a permanent fascination .

		What we have to do is to make the study of politics so important in the eyes of everyone , so arrestingly intelligible to him , so clearly the kind of topic that springs as naturally to his lips as the weather , that he will wonder , when the war is over , that there was ever a period in his life when he was not an eager student of national affairs .

		Our business is to create an educated and equipped electorate ; and the basis of that is an interested elector - ate .

		But the medium of interest in a popula - tion so busy as our own , a population , moreover , to which , from the nature of things , thought must be something of a luxury , is the adequate provision of information .

		We must give them news about the working of govern - mental machinery ; we must relate the news we give to the theories implied in events .

		The relation of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to labor , the coopera - tion of the Governors with
Washington	LOCATION	, the working of local committees , the plan and purpose behind the hastily erected structures of national organization , the attempt to cope with the problems of food and of shipping to all these must be given their full dramatic quality .

		It is hardly too much to claim that twelve months of adequate insistence may well serve to change the whole perspective of American political life .

		The basic machinery of such an enterprise the President has already created .

		The Pub - licity
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, of which Mr.
George Creel	PERSON	has been made director , has an immense opportu - nity in its hands .

		It is , in reality , the impre - sario of government ; and it is hardly an exaggeration to suggest that popular interest in the war will largely depend upon the qual - ity of its stage-management .

		It must take the largest possible conception of its functions .

		Two great duties have clearly devolved upon it .

		It has to relate the President 's war - speech to every issue of the present struggle ; and it has to trace out the steps by which the claims of that address are made effective in the events of the war .

		It is , of course , a diffi - cult task ; but it is also a task of immense importance .

		The
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	has in its hands the most effective means our generation has pos - sessed for the education of democracy .

		It must mobilize the intellectual talent of
America	LOCATION	.

		It must attach to itself every writer who has the capacity to make politics an in - teresting study to ordinary men .

		It must popularize the efforts of bureaus like that over which Miss Lathrop presides to conserve the child-life of the nation .

		It must illuminate the way in which the army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	coordi - nate their efforts .

		It must show us exactly how the President affects the activities of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It must interpret in popular terms the vast financial operations which , to most of us , are like nothing so much , at present , as a somewhat suspicious sleight-of-hand per - formance .

		It must bring home to every mem - ber of the nation what is meant by the national life .

		It must relate the pledge of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to use all the resources of
America	LOCATION	for victory to the actual labor of men and women in field and factory and workshop .

		It must popularize the kind of work the British committees on the physiological significance of industry have achieved , in order that the manufacturers of
New York	LOCATION	and
Massachu	PERSON	- setts shall not think of long hours as the first
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL step to victory ; and the workers thereby be rendered not unnaturally suspicious of the whole effort we are making .

		In this broad aspect , what the
Bureau of Publicity	ORGANIZATION	can do is like nothing so much as photographing a nation at work .

		Everyone knows the human desire to be photographed .

		Everyone can feel tolerably certain that effects will follow from the distribution of copies .

		But that is not all .

		There is a subtler and more difficult task that it is important to achieve .

		There are all varieties of studies , at present semi-technical in character , of which the conditions need to be stated in or - dinarily intelligible terms .

		We talk much , for example , of the Prussian theory of the State ; but it is not too much to say that be - yond a vague thought that despotism is in - tended , the concept is quite without realistic content to the majority of men .

		We shall have to control production and probably con - sumption , in every phase of their activity .

		We need nothing so much as the restatement of these questions in ordinary terms .

		It is useless to relegate them to the awkward hin - terland of the expert .

		If war is not to convert a democracy into a rasping bureaucracy , then upon every question which comes near to the life of the people , a public opinion must be generated .

		Above all , the electorate must be interested in the business of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		That will serve two great ends .

		It will , in the first place , improve the quality of congres - sional life .

		It will probably result in a larger proportion of able men being willing , as a consequence , to devote themselves to political service .

		But to that end we must place within popular reach an account of congres - sional life .

		For this purpose the `` Becord '' is useless : it is too big , too clumsy , and too full of unintelligent particularization ; it is written for posterity .

		We need a journal that meets the very special requirements of the present hour .

		Now the great journals are already tolerably well cared for in this re - spect .

		They retain their correspondents at
Washington	LOCATION	, who compile an adequate and in - teresting summary of congressional business .

		But there are thousands of small journals all over the country , daily and weekly , to which this is an impossible luxury .

		Nothing would be more valuable to them than such an ac - count .

		One great thing the
Bureau of Pub	ORGANIZATION	- licity can perform is to supply that need .

		It can place the business of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at the dis - posal of every man who can read the English language .

		It can even assist in the business of Americanization by having its accounts in - terpreted for the foreign journals of the dif - ferent nationalities among us .

		It is difficult to think of a greater service to the effective prosecution of the war .

		No one can fail to be impressed by the immense eagerness on the part of men and women all over the country to do something in this crisis .

		But their eagerness is paralleled by their ignorance .

		Many of them find that the life of the nation is a thing of which they form a blind , dumb part .

		They have been uninterested in its processes .

		It speaks a language they do not understand .

		They can - not interpret its needs , nor serve its purposes save by the dangerous path of slavish obe - dience to command .

		But they are passionately anxious to begin afresh .

		They are determined to understand every act and thought which bears to-day upon the changes in the social fabric .

		It is an immense opportunity .

		It gives us , for the first time in half a century , the opportunity to refresh the wellspring of our national life .

		No more solemn duty was ever laid upon a government than to take effective advantage of this tremendous good will .

		Aloi 's Ladislas de
Damaiowice Strzembosz	PERSON	, or , as his name was shortened by his intimates ,
Ladislas Strzembosz	PERSON	, has just died .

		He was librarian of the
Bibliotheque Polonaise	ORGANIZATION	, in - stalled in a quaint old building on the quai d ` Orleans , the southern and sunny side of the
Isle Saint Louis	LOCATION	, in the very heart of ancient
Paris	LOCATION	.


M. Strzembosz	PERSON	's health had been failing for a long time and for many months he had been bed-ridden with con - sumption .

		He was known in French learned circles for his thorough knowledge of bibliog - raphy and heraldry , but his special promi - nence was due perhaps to his position as head of this interesting Polish library , founded many years ago by the Polish refugees after their various unsuccessful efforts to restore their nationality .

		It counted among its bene - factors the most famous Polish patriots of the past century Prince
Adam Czartoryski	PERSON	, General
Kniaziewicz	PERSON	and
General Dembinski	ORGANIZATION	, THE DIAL -LSB-

Bogdan Zaleski	PERSON	, the historians
Levewel	PERSON	and
Niemce	ORGANIZATION	- wicz .

		Niemcewicz accompanied Kosciusko to
America	LOCATION	when he visited us in
1797	DATE	.

		The library contains some 80,000 volumes and the
Adam Mickiewicz	PERSON	museum , formed of the manuscripts , portraits , and other objects which belonged to the poet , all the editions and translations of his works , and a great number of printed articles concerning him .

		Among other notable things in this library are a fine collection of engravings and auto - graphs , a part of the archives of the Polish Legation which existed in
France	LOCATION	at the be - ginning of
Louis Philippe	PERSON	's reign , and his - toric documents like the act of dethronement of the Czar
Nicholas	PERSON	, voted and signed in
1831	DATE	by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and Chamber of Nuncios of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		The confiscation of the libraries in
Poland	LOCATION	explains the creation of Polish libraries in foreign lands , the first being that at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The present librarian ,
M. Ladislas Mickiewicz	PERSON	, grandson of the poet , sends me , apropos of the death of
M. Strzembosz	PERSON	, the following view of the Polish situation : Printed matter concerning
Poland	LOCATION	is , of course , very abundant in our library , and present events have added a great number of pamphlets and books to the mass born of our various revolutions .

		With more or less reticence and precaution , these publica - tions all point to the same solution of the problem .

		Many of their authors are very diplomatic in their treatment of the cabinets whom they try to mollify .

		Others imagine ingenious compromises or propose to the cabinets this or that concession , without bother - ing themselves as to whether they have any author - ity for making such proposals .

		But the Russian revolution has upset all the combinations of these Machiavellis in miniature ; most of them were imme - diately converted to the advocacy of the most un - compromising measures , while others turned toward arms and have offered their services to the Russian revolutionary parties with the same eagerness with which they had been wont to court the ministers who have fallen .

		They are to be held in suspicion and are probably the source of much of the contradic - tory `` news '' ' sent out from Saint
Petersburg	PERSON	or `` neu - tral '' news centres .

		I have never felt that the salvation of
Poland	LOCATION	would come from
Austria	LOCATION	, a composite empire , a mosaic of nationalities ; still less from
Prussia	LOCATION	, a predatory state , born of the perjury of a religious order , enlarged by successive robberies from its neigh - bors , cemented by the shameful brigandage of Fred - rick II and by the partition of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		Many signs lead us to hope that
Russia	LOCATION	will no longer remain the passive instrument of an autocracy without bowels of compassion .

		Liberated
Russia	LOCATION	ab - jures despotism , bureaucratic corruption , and relig - ious persecution , which were the governing principles of Czarism .

		Who does not pray that this new con - vert to freedom may continue in the way where she can find happiness for herself and at the same time repair her century - long wrongs to
Poland	LOCATION	f To substitute the reign of justice for that of in - justice , to recognize her obligations toward the un - fortunate whom she has robbed , and to break her own bonds at the same time , would be to offer a grand spectacle to the world .

		The Russian revolution has struck off at a blow all the heads of the monster ; autocracy in falling has dragged down with it the orthodox church ; and religious liberty has been pro- claimed .

		The Teutonic peril awakened the Russian con - science .

		Some day history may succeed in showing how much the martyrdom of
Poland	LOCATION	, with her thou - sands of deported citizens , contributed to the miracu - lous metamorphosis we have witnessed in the last few - weeks .

		That other great territorial theft
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	PERSON	is quite as much to the fore in European books as is that of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		The whole question is well treated from the French point of view in a scholarly and detailed man - ner by the late Professor
Antonin Debidour	PERSON	, of
Paris University	ORGANIZATION	, in his `` Histoire Diplo - matique de 1 `
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Felix Alcan	PERSON	, 4 vol .

		32 fr . -RRB-

		.

		The third volume , `` La Paix Armee '' -LRB- 1878-1904 -RRB- , appeared last year , and the concluding volume , `` Vers la Grande Guerre '' -LRB- 1904-1916 -RRB- , was published this year , just a week before the author 's death .

		The work deals not only with the
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	PERSON	question but with the origin of the war , which is presented in a clear , concise , and convincing manner .

		The preface to the third volume , written a year ago by the well - known French statesman , Senator Leon Bourgeois , is an excellent resume of the whole subject .

		The closing paragraph is devoted to our attitude to the war and is marked b.y its kindly tone , though we had then reached only the stage of the President 's note of
April 20 , 1915	DATE	.

		Professor Prignet , of the
Montpellier Lycee	ORGANIZATION	, presents the subject in a freer narra - tive manner in his handsome volume , `` L ` Al - sace-Lorraine '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Delagrave , 4 fr . -RRB-

		, printed on heavy paper and very finely illus - trated , several of the pictures being by
Hansi	PERSON	, whose drawings of Alsatian life , and espe - cially of Alsatian children , richly deserve their fame .

		This one sentence from the text shows the spirit in which the book is written : `` The fixed determination on the part of
France	LOCATION	to make no peace which does not include the return of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	was de - cided upon at the very opening of the cam - paign . ''

		How thoroughly this idea has taken pos - session of all classes in
France	LOCATION	comes out in a peculiar fashion in a thin little book called , `` Alsaciens , Corrigeons notre Accent '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Berger-Levrault , 2 fr . -RRB-

		, by
Baron Albert de Dietrich	PERSON	, whose wife is a Hottingeur , both members of the household being thus of the most ancient and distinguished Alsatian stock .

		The social standing of the author is in itself significant ; significant too is the rea - son he gives for writing the book : `` French
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 469 baldly spoken causes suspicion at this time . ''

		Then follows a learned disquisition on pho - netics in their bearing on the Alsatian dia - lect and Alsatian French .

		Though some critics may doubt whether many Alsatians will observe the rather complicated rules for good pronunciation laid down in these pages , the state of mind which drew them up is full of meaning .

		This book also , as well as a pamphlet by the same author `` Alsaciens , Lorrains , nos Freres ! ''

		-LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Henri Dieval	PERSON	, 25 centimes -RRB- discreetly reveals as few French books do the latent friction which often shows itself between the population of
France	LOCATION	and that of the Lost Provinces .

		This little family un - pleasantness comes out in these lines which I have received from
M. de Dietrich	PERSON	: `` The misunderstandings between French and Al - satians are disappearing and we are begin - ning to recognize the patriotism and bravery of many Alsatian soldiers who have shown devotion to
France	LOCATION	. ''

		There can be no doubt of this bravery and this devotion .

		The offi - cial journal of
Germany	LOCATION	has published twelve lists of young men of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	, total - ing 5149 names , who have fled the country since the war broke out , in order to escape service in the German armies .

		Many of these are in the French armies and not a few have been killed or wounded .


M. Albert Trombert	PERSON	's `` Souvenirs d ` Al - sace '' and `` Ombres Glorieuses '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Chaix	LOCATION	, 3 fr .

		50 each -RRB- are not controversial .

		The author abandoned his
Colmar	LOCATION	home in
1871	DATE	, and preserved his French citizenship by establishing himself at
Paris	LOCATION	, where he has become an authority on social science and a part of the publishing world of the French capital .

		The first of these volumes is , as its title indicates , a collection of personal rem - iniscences of
Alsace	LOCATION	, and the second presents historic Alsatian scenes during the war of
1870	DATE	.

		They not only give one an insight into the more intimate side of Alsatian life , but explain why so many Frenchmen are at - tached to the country and why they now de - mand its return with such unanimity .

		If one has time to read but a single book on the present Alsace-Lorraine problem , I would recommend that by the brothers
Henri	PERSON	and
Andre Lichtenberger	PERSON	, `` La Question d'
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Chapelot , 1 fr . -RRB-

		, which has gone through some half a dozen editions .

		Professor
Henri Lichtenberger	PERSON	, of the Sor - bonne , was the exchange professor at Har - vard during the first year of the war and is not forgotten in American university circles .

		His two sons were to have been freshmen at
Cambridge	LOCATION	while their father lectured there ; but instead , they went to the western trenches , and
M. Lichtenberger	PERSON	, in sending me his book , can say : `` We work , struggle and stand firm , though not without some melancholy at see - ing the day of peace further off than ever .

		But the morale remains good , and faith in the final victory as strong as ever . ''

		French war poetry is also deeply impreg - nated with , this Alsatian spirit .

		Take , for instance , the volume `` Rimes Vengeresses '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Hachette	ORGANIZATION	, 3 fr . -RRB-

		.

		The title suffices to show the nature of the poems between the covers , and
Germany	LOCATION	and the
Kaiser	PERSON	are treated with a severity unequaled in any other book I have seen .

		Of the author ,
M. Stephen Liegard	PERSON	, `` the
Lorraine	PERSON	poet , '' his friend
M. Arthur Meyer	PERSON	once said to me : `` In his youth , Liegard was seven times lau - reate of the
Toulouse Floral Games	ORGANIZATION	, which , it will be remembered , initiated the celebrity of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		One of his volumes , ` La Cote d'Azur , ' has given its very poetic and appropriate name to the whole superb coast - line stretching from
Marseilles	LOCATION	to
Genoa	LOCATION	.

		Just now his poems are very popular at all our patriotic reunions and at the concerts for the wounded in our hospitals .

		He is the last surviving deputy of the part of
Lorraine	LOCATION	an - nexed to
Germany	LOCATION	, and was one of those who , seer-like , foresaw the war of
1870	DATE	.

		The warmth and nobility of soul which pervaded his speeches of that period are reflected in his poems to-day . ''

		In sending me his volume , so full of fire and aggressiveness , the poet adds these lines concerning the future of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	: That these Lost Provinces should and would be re-incorporated into
France	LOCATION	, I have not ceased to pre - dict and to demand during the forty-four years which have separated
1870 from 1914	DATE	, and now more than ever I am convinced of the necessity of the meas - ure .

		To-day , after so much blood has been poured out by the Mother Country and the Allies , the non - realization of this hope seems to me impossible .

		And when this occurs , I trust , with the help of God , to take my seat again as deputy for
Thionville	LOCATION	.

		`` Le Laurier Sanglant '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Calmann	PERSON	-
Levy	LOCATION	, 3 fr .

		50 -RRB- , is also made up of poems relating to the last two French wars .

		The language is less extreme than that of M. Lie - gard , and the verses devoted to the present conflict are largely reflections of military hospital life , reproducing that life with all its pathos and with a remarkable exactitude which is explained by the fact that the author ,
M. Jacques Normand	PERSON	, has been acting as librarian in one of the hospitals at Saint -
Jean-de-Luz	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In reading Mr.
Cory	PERSON	's interesting article on `` The Senility of the Short-Story '' in your issue of
May 3	DATE	, I note a mistake often made by for - eigners in the use of French proper names .

		Mr.
Cory	PERSON	writes : `` Its chief masters , men like
Poe	PERSON	and de Maupassant , etc. '' The particle is de trop , but the error is everywhere ; the `` Century Dictionary '' speaks of de Musset .

		I beg the use of your columns to call to the attention of Amer - ican writers the following rules from Vian `` La Particule Nobiliaire '' : The particle de is never placed alone before the name ; one does not sign de Montmorency , de
Biron	ORGANIZATION	, de Noailles , but
Charles de Montmorency	PERSON	, due de
Biron , Paid de Noailles	ORGANIZATION	.

		In signing a note to a friend or a document , de is not used :
Grammont	LOCATION	,

		When the title of nobility or the title of Monsieur or Monseigneur is not used , there is no de : I met le comte de Segur , not I met de Segur ; mon cher

		THE SHORT-STORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In her verbose discourse on `` The American Short-Story , ''
Mary M. Colum	PERSON	mothers some as - tonishing philosophy .

		The most ridiculous of her platitudinous utterances are the weird uplift sug - gestions she offers `` a few magazine editors . ''

		`` By declining short-stories over three thousand words long and by refusing to pay more than a hundred dollars for any short-story , they could create a new standard and raise both the prestige of the short - story and of their magazines , '' she asserts .

		Thus , we have only to standardize and cheapen the short-story to improve its literary quality .

		As soon as it becomes a less profitable form , more painstaking work will be devoted to it .

		To per - fect it , we must make it a staple article ,
8915	DATE	ems or less in length , worth so much a stick .

		Would it not be equally logical to contend that by limit - ing the size of canvases to 12 by 18 inches , the quality of American paintings would be im - proved ?

		It is true that wordiness is one of our glaring defects .

		But can it be cured and artistic stand - ards raised by making the column measure a metre of literary values ?

		And just what is the tremendous psychological effect
$ 100	MONEY	checks would have upon writers ?

		In one breath Mrs.
Colum	PERSON	condemns commercial standardization and in the next proposes more rigid standardization .

		She mentions
Poe	PERSON	's `` Ligeia , '' and
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's `` Without Benefit of Clergy . ''

		According to her reasoning , neither of these should have been published , for the first exceeds her proposed space limit by more than
2000	DATE	, and the other by more than 7000 , words .

		It is contended that by arbitrarily limiting the length of the short-story , verbosity would be over - come , and that by lowering its market value , certain writers would cease prostituting their abil - ities .

		Condensation would greatly improve most stories , but it does not follow that none should exceed 3000 words .

		Who are the writers who have been prostituted by the so-called high prices paid for short-stories ?

		Since when has the short - story been considered a highly profitable form of literature ?

		Is n't the rambling , anaemic serial chiefly at fault ?

		It is the high-priced product that has made many writers turn from the short - story entirely .

		Men who once wrote creditably are now grinding out continued instalments of mushy flapdoodle not short stories .

		It would seem , also , that Mrs.
Colum	PERSON	fails to differentiate between the prices paid for short-stories and those offered for names .

		It is reasonable to suppose that the status of the short-story would be raised if its value were enhanced .

		If a premium were placed upon form and thought instead of upon words and sweetness , standards would climb .

		Incentive is needed ; not discouragement .

		If the real short-story were made more profitable than the serial , or the scenario , it would be produced .

		Elsewhere we are told that `` Most of all the short-story suffers from that blight which affects all creative art in
America	LOCATION	the want of intellec - tual freedom a want that saps the energy and withers up all but the most valiant and violent of creative spirits . ''

		If this be true , would it help matters to inflict still further limitations upon the writer ?

		Miss
MONROE	PERSON	RESPONDS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Having been rusticating in
North Carolina	LOCATION	, I have just read , in your issue of
May 3rd	DATE	, Mr.
Con	PERSON	- rad
Aiken	PERSON	's review of `` The New Poetry , '' which was edited by Mrs.
Henderson	PERSON	and myself .

		It may not be de rigueur for an author to take any official notice of his critics , but perhaps a mere editor of an anthology may say a word without transgress - ing literary proprieties .

		I am not surprised that Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	does not like the anthology ; in fact , I long since ceased to hope that any undertaking of the editors of ``
Poe	PERSON	- try '' would satisfy his fastidious taste .

		From the beginning of the magazine they have been , to their deep regret , unable to follow his lead , or to be aroused to editorial enthusiasm over his various books of verse ; and his fierce and facile pen has spitted them for many a roast in various journals , even before THE DIAL granted him the hospitality of its columns .

		Always they have confessed his skill , and marvelled at the agility of his weather - cock mind as now , when he rebukes them for giving too little space to Messrs.
Fletcher	PERSON	and
Flint	LOCATION	, both hardened imagists , after all his bitter diatribes against imagism .

		But this friendly tilt -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 471 ing has been all according to the rules of the game , and all , I trust , for the greater glory of the art .

		So Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	will gladly permit me , no doubt , to take up a few of the points he makes so sharply against the new anthology .

		`` Oh , that mine enemy had written a book ! ''

		cried a wise man long ago .

		He would have been wiser still if he had wished on his enemy an an - thology , as I now wish one on Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	.

		He will find that poets and their publishers , especially those across the water , have their own ideas , favorable or unfavorable , about anthologies and their representation in them , and that the editor 's preferences can not always be carried out .

		In this case certain of the finest poems `` Poetry '' ever printed were withheld from the anthology by their authors ; for example , Mr.
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	, who was about to bring out a book , very reasonably denied us its chief feature , `` Prufrock , '' which Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	blames us for omitting .

		The space accorded to Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	, Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	, and a number of other poets is less than it should be because of these perfectly proper inhibitions from poets and publishers who were mostly very generous , and to whom we can only be grateful for the loan of any of their copyrighted property .

		As for Mr.
Robin	PERSON	- son 's ``
Ben Jonson	PERSON	Entertains a Man from
Stratford	LOCATION	, '' we agree with Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	about its ex - traordinary quality , as `` Poetry '' has stated more than once , and we should have been overjoyed to include it , the author consenting , if its length , 425 lines , nearly three times that of any poem in the collection , were not prohibitive .

		Those objections of Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	which may not be met by such statements of editorial difficulties reduce themselves simply to differences of defini - tion and taste .

		I do n't know how he would define the phrase , `` the new poetry '' : in this article he seems to delimit it by greater radicalism of feeling and form than he has hitherto stood for , since he would exclude certain of our poets whom he calls `` distinctly traditional '' or `` pleasantly convention - al , '' while it would be difficult to count the various traditions and conventions Masefieldian ,
Gibson	PERSON	- ian , etc. which he has followed in the course of his brief career .

		Our definition would include re - cent poems , beautiful in their simplicity , sincerity , and lyric intensity , whether their form and motive be of the latest pattern or not ; while it would ex - clude the elaborate and deliberately thought-out artificiality of Mr.
Abercrombie	PERSON	, and other forms of modern rhetoric .

		Which is the more just defini - tion each reader of `` The New Poetry '' will doubt - less decide for himself .

		I despair of pointing out the triviality of some of Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	's strictures , and the injustice or in - correctness of others , while I must leave your readers to pronounce on the tone and temper of his article .

		He thinks Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's `` General Booth '' an `` ephemeral jingle '' : I disagree .

		He prefers Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's green and white symphon - ies : we have ventured to quote the blue one .

		He praises
Brooke	PERSON	's `` Clouds '' and `` Dust '' and `` Li - bido '' : we think the dead poet 's war sonnets and `` Retrospect '' would still represent him as well or better , even if our permit from his estate had not confined us chiefly to the poems first printed in `` Poetry . ''

		He draws up a formidable indictment against my humble self , pronounces me a `` senti - mental idealist anthropocentric , deist , panpsy - chist , or what not , but never , by any chance , a de - tached or fearless observer '' because three or four of his favorites , which he seems to think I found too daring in tone , are not in the anthology .

		The fact is , one of these poems , Mr.
Masters	PERSON	's `` Arabel , '' first saw the light in `` Poetry , '' and I ca n't see that any of them outdares certain poems included in the new collection .

		As for the more general accusation that the anthology favors
America	LOCATION	, and especially the Mid - dle West , and slights
England	LOCATION	, I can only say that its editors would rather be accused of that excess than of the long prevalent sycophantic colonialism in taste which has usually been too evident in books of this kind , and which Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	himself is guilty of when he braces his own opinion of Mr.
Abercrombie	PERSON	with that of two English poets .

		The proportions of English and American verse in the anthology represent , except for certain inhibi - tions above noted , the editors ' opinion of relative values ; but even if they did not , the book , being chiefly for American readers , might well lay a certain stress upon our own poets , and thus try to combat the ingrained American sentimental preju - dice in favor of foreign art .

		And between East and West in our own country , also , the
East	LOCATION	has always had a similar advantage .

		I will say nothing of the bitter arraignment of `` Poetry 's '' policy and of the shortcomings of its editors which Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	drags into his review .

		It is sufficient to refer your readers to our files , which categorically disprove many of his state - ments and amply defend us against others .

		He has shown less regard for truth than for making out a plausible case .

		But I fear he is `` intoxicated with the exuberance of his own verbosity '' mere assertion is not evidence .

		AN OLD DRAMATIC DEVICE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In his article on `` Some Experiments in Amer - ican Drama , '' in your issue of
May 17	DATE	, Mr.
Homer E. Woodbridge	PERSON	states that Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	makes `` use of a device which , so far as I know , is new even in closet drama , and which is a source of fatal weakness .

		From speech to speech , Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	shifts his scene ; with one speech we are in a com - fortable drawing room ; with the next on the street outside listening to the talk of passers-by , etc. '' I venture to comment that Mr.
Woodbridge	PERSON	does not know very far .

		The author , whoever he was , of `` La Celestina , '' probably the greatest closet drama of all literature , made use of that device ; and its weakness was not fatal enough to prevent `` La Celestina '' from still being , although over four centuries old , one of the few most alive of the supreme works of art
Europe	LOCATION	has produced .

		It is probable , indeed , that only by cooperative effort will it be possible to achieve an adequate analysis of this three years ' experience .

		The points of view it seems possible to adopt are as manifold as they are irreconcilable .

		The official dispatches in no sense complete one another .

		Eyewit - nesses are clearly trusting less to the objective vision than to that `` inward eye '' which is the basis of mystic interpretation .

		We barely understand what has happened .

		In an age when the means of communication are better than at any time in history , objective truth has become almost grotesquely unattainable .

		All we can do is to hold firmly by the large , vague outlines of events ; the details must go .

		Now and then some great feat of heroism will cast a light across the whole , some tragic fail - ure , as at the Dardanelles , reveal the purpose of gigantic effort .

		But , on the whole , we have to wait patiently and soberly for an under - standing that , to most of us at any rate , may never come .

		Any book , therefore , that has a genuine contribution to offer is particularly welcome .

		Mr.
McClure	PERSON	has many faults .

		He is an in - curable gossip .

		He writes with astonishing carelessness .

		He continually obtrudes his own personality into events where it has no place .

		But , again and again , he has some useful document to transcribe , some valuable fact to record ; and for these alone his book would be worth reading .

		As an attempt at analyzing the real aims of the belligerents the book is a failure .

		Mr.
McClure	PERSON	mistakes his anecdotes for history .

		He has the incurable habit of repetition .

		Much of his book lacks the per - spective into which it should have been thrown by the reading , for instance , of
Herr Nau	ORGANIZATION	- mann 's `` Mittel-Europa '' ; for at this stage of the conflict it is very clear that the essential crime of
Germany	LOCATION	is her willingness to sac - rifice the safeguards of democracy for economic gain in the
Near East	LOCATION	.

		I imagine that in the future Mr.
McClure	PERSON	's book will be more useful as an illustration for some other writer 's thesis than for any fundamental contribution of its own .

		Professor
Muir	PERSON	is an accomplished book - maker , and this latest of his war books is a useful illustration of his method .

		A success - ful teacher of history , he is accustomed to make facile generalizations of the kind that are large enough to be grasped immediately by the average intelligence .

		He writes well ; and he is able to support his argument by an abundance of apt illustrations .

		What he has endeavored to do what , indeed , he has very effectively done is to interpret the meaning of nationalism and to prove the futility of any cosmopolitan ideal which is not firmly grounded upon such a basis .

		If the thesis was worth maintaining , Professor
Muir	PERSON	has cer - tainly ree ` nf orced it ; though it may be doubted whether it is worth while reenforcing the ob - vious in some two hundred pages .

		Professor
Muir	PERSON	, of course , would reply that the ar - gument is unsound , since the rulers of modern
Germany	LOCATION	do not accept his conclusions .

		But since it is , to say the least , unlikely that the ruling caste of
Germany	LOCATION	will read his book , it still remains a work of supererogation .

		Moreover , it may be urged that the very facility of his generalizations and the easy charm of his style will act as a dangerous soporific to thought .

		His picture of law , for example , as the `` organized will and con - science of the community '' has a certain just - ification from the limits of space he has set himself ; but it neglects the fact that a very important school of thought denies that law as administered is so communally representa - tive .

		His law , so defined , ` is what the Romans meant by their jus naturae ; but no Common Law , and certainly no Civil Law , represents any a priori principles of abstract justice .

		Equally useless is Mr.
Muir	PERSON	's conception of liberty .

		Lord
Acton	PERSON	took forty years to col - lect material for its history , and , in the end , he was mastered by the very vastness of his subject ; but Mr.
Muir	PERSON	has no difficulty in disposing of it as an operating principle of western civilization , in a couple of pages .

		He does not in the least seem to realize that the problem of liberty is the most fundamental question which confronts the modern state ; and it is worse than useless to rehash the con - clusions of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	without an attempt to analyze the degree of their applic - ability to our modern time .

		These are not the only cases where Professor
Muir	PERSON	obscures truth by his eagerness for broad conclusions .

		His theory of nationality , his interpretation of mediaeval cosmopolitanism are both of them brilliant pieces of journalism , but they are brilliant journalism only because they rep -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 473 resent an unnatural simplification of complex facts .

		They take no account of exceptions , or else they regard them as easy jests .

		Professor
Muir	PERSON	has written a book that is useful for the purposes of dinner-table conversation .

		But it is not profound enough in its acquaintance with the real issues at stake to be more than a skilful piece of political persiflage .

		Mr.
W. M. Fullerton	PERSON	was very anxious for
America	LOCATION	to go to war , and he saw only signs of pathetic weakness in Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's painful hesitations .

		This book is the evidence of his impatience , and undoubtedly he has the merit of having pointed out the path
America	LOCATION	has finally chosen .

		But there is still something to be said for Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, even when Mr.
Ful	PERSON	- lerton 's accusations have filtered down into their small precipitate of actual fact .

		The fault of his book is that he continually mis - takes his private feelings for the public opin - ion of
America	LOCATION	.

		It is very clear that the war took , not merely Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, but also the American people by surprise , and that both had to grow into the full realization of its issues .

		Mr.
Fullerton	PERSON	seems unable to under - stand how wide was the abyss which separated the traditions of the hemispheres in foreign politics .

		He does not take account of the im - mense difficulties , racial , emotional , political , that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	had to confront .

		The Pres - ident 's policy was twofold .

		He had to gather the nation into an effective striking unit , and he had to give it a cause for which to strike .

		He could not take the declared statements of any of the belligerents as adequate ; he had to wait on their action .

		It was action alone which could prove to the American people the real nature of German ambitions .

		From the moment that
Germany	LOCATION	displayed her real hand , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	made a masterly use of the material at his disposal .

		His hesitations , now , have been coerced by
Germany	LOCATION	into the vig - orous protest of a validated moral purpose .

		In such an analysis , Mr.
Fullerton	PERSON	's book is simply a long misinterpretation of the facts at issue .

		Lord
Bryce	PERSON	has rendered a useful service by the publication of these important state - ments .

		Some , as the account of
Miss Cavell	ORGANIZATION	's death and
M. Barres	PERSON	's prose-poem , are simply the emotional penumbra of the larger issues .

		Others , as Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	's discussion of the value of small states , are historical analyses of permanent importance .

		The real value of the collection appears , however , when it is judged as a totality .

		It has , indeed , many of the obvious defects a partisan statement must possess .

		But when the last criticism has been made , it is a valuable statement of the atti - tude to problems of foreign politics which alone can ensure those safeguards for the democratic adventure to which Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	so finely pledged the resources of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The temper of the book is admirable in its moderation and its calm common sense .

		It is greatly to be hoped that this collection is only the first of a series which will winnow from the immense mass of pamphlets some , at any rate , of those which have more than a momentary importance .

		The completion of the `` Cambridge History of English Literature '' is an event which may justly give rise to some fruitful discussion concerning the method and the aim of literary history .

		And it may do so not because that science or art whichever one pleases has been illustrated in this massive and important work , but because it has been frankly and definitely abandoned .

		Both the arrangement of the history as a whole and the structure of the individual chapters follow the method of a primitive chronicle .

		The facts are grouped in the rudest way .

		The individual contribu - tors show a conscious timidity in respect of anything that may rise above a description of the obvious and the notorious .

		Of the likelihood of such a reproach the general editors are not wholly unaware .

		In a significant postscript to the fourteenth vol - ume , they warn the student against tracing in the literature of a given period `` a reflec - tion or refraction of the experiences of con - temporary national history , '' and against `` treating the course of a nation 's literary his - tory as an organic part of its political and social experiences . ''

		With these warnings one may readily agree .

		But the editors seem not to have suspected the fact that political and social experience manifests itself historically as group-experience , and that the precious - ness and enduring meaningfulness of litera - ' ture is due to the fact that it springs from the experience of individual souls and again ad - dresses itself to individuals .

		Hence a poem , a story , or a play shows , as nothing else can , how the pang and joy of life was felt and envisaged by the author .

		If , furthermore , it gained a wide or an intense acceptance among the author 's contemporaries , it may help to fix and to commemorate the spiritual temper of an entire age .

		The history of literature , 474 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 31	DATE	in other words , is , in a far deeper and more intimate sense than political or social history , a record of the experience and of the experi - encing spirit of mankind .

		And it is such a record not only in its subject-matter but also , if rightly and skilfully interpreted , in the peculiar forms of beauty in which the '' mak - ers '' of a given age embodied their special sense of `` man , of nature and of human life . ''

		From the acceptance of such a theory the editors of the `` Cambridge History '' would guard themselves by insisting that `` genius defies conditions of time and space . ''

		It does , without doubt , in its occurrence , in the meas - ure and the radiance of its powers .

		But its vision of things and its expression of that vision are not independent of historic cir - cumstance .

		Such an assertion would be ab - surd .

		Sophocles and Euripides ,
Virgil	PERSON	and
Horace	PERSON	,
Marlowe	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	and Goethe are each supremely individual .

		But each pair is profoundly alike and pro- foundly different from every other pair by virtue of qualities that are historic and the proper objects of historical inquiry .

		And of such inquiry there is hardly a trace in the ``
Cambridge	LOCATION	History . ''

		Nor , one fears , will better literary history be written in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	until scholars pay less attention to the externalities of politics and more to those deeper sources of human liberty which are revealed in the history of speculative thought , of morals , and of culture .

		One must clearly , then , accept the `` Cam - bridge History '' as a series of essays following the course of English literature in chro - nological order .

		Even as such , the chapters of the thirteenth and fourteenth volumes fill one with a mild astonishment .

		Except in Professor
Robertson	PERSON	's account of
Carlyle	LOCATION	and Professor
Grierson	PERSON	's of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, there is no aptness of phrase because there is no close - ness of thinking ; commentary and narrative creep along at the level of a mediocre text - book to sink occasionally to sheer parochial - ism and ineptitude .

		Thus one is told concern - ing
Rossetti	PERSON	's magnificent `` Jenny , '' a poem whose importance in the development of modern literature might impress the dull - est , that `` no one can take exception to the poet 's moral attitude , '' but that `` the situa - tion of the speaker is one with which moral reflection is seldom associated . ''

		In the dis - cussion of `` The Mill on the Floss , '' it is re - marked in regard to the forever delightful
Dodson	PERSON	sisters , that `` the inquiry into the motives of ordinary doings by ordinary peo - ple is , at times , trying . ''

		The great literature of a great people can not be adequately recorded by persons capable of the priggish - ness of the first citation or the spiritual snob - bishness of the second .

		But , indeed , a grim and militant provincialism is the presiding spirit of the volumes .

		Only so can one ex - plain the fact that
Newman	PERSON	is mentioned only in scattered references and nowhere treated as the great master of prose that he was , that
Meredith	PERSON	's `` Modern Love '' is slurred over as unimportant , and that the treatment of Pat - more 's later verse -LRB- `` The Toys , '' `` Magna est
Veritas	ORGANIZATION	, '' etc. -RRB- , of
Henley	LOCATION	, and of Pater is brief and grudging .

		Nor need one have an inordinate admiration for Oscar Wilde to be very sure that a history of literature which finds ample space for the verse of
Roden Noel	ORGANIZATION	and
Thomas Ashe	PERSON	, liberal space for the plays of
Robertson	PERSON	and
Gilbert	PERSON	, and dismisses the Irishman 's work in prose and verse and com - edy in nine lines of print , is not written in a disinterested or philosophical spirit .

		Yet it is not difficult to treat the Victorian era , to which -LRB- through the questionable omis - sion of living writers -RRB- these volumes confine themselves , in such a spirit .

		The significant facts are scattered over the whole period :
Tennyson	PERSON	was very anxious not to be identi - fied with the protagonist of `` Maud '' ;
Thack	PERSON	- eray , as
Lewis Melville	PERSON	tells us , called `` Mme. Bovary , '' `` a bad book ... a heartless , cold-blooded study '' ; Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	com - plains uneasily of the `` literariness '' of the secondary poets whom he criticizes ; `` Modern Love '' and `` Jenny '' founded no school and transmitted neither their vision nor their method ;
Browning	PERSON	, superb poet that he was , wearies one at last by his robust and un - discriminating joy fulness of assurance ; Swin - burne , the last giant of the period , shocked the Philistines by recounting sins in which no sensible person believes and ended by trying to drown his emptiness of matter in an ever wilder onrush of verbal music .

		Gladstone , finally , admired
Tennyson	PERSON	for making so poetical the description of a game-pie .

		It never occurred to
Tennyson	LOCATION	that he must either lift the game-pie itself into poetry make the object itself poetic or leave it alone .

		This humble but not trivial instance may sum up and serve to interpret all the others .

		The Victorians distrusted experience and were timid in the presence of reality .

		Except in the narrow sphere of the specific - ally religious emotions , they depended upon tradition , upon history , and upon literature for their subject-matter .

		So , it may be urged , did Shakespeare and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the Vic - torians did not pour into their borrowed stories that wealth of passion and pain , of ex - perience and the wisdom wrought by personal experience which vibrates in `` Hamlet '' and in
1917	DATE	THE DIAL 475 `` Faust . ''

		Their idealisms were not ignoble but they were not sufficiently hard won .

		Tennyson and
Browning	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	and New - man ,
Macaulay	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	, each in his own way , loved something else the mellow beauty of order , an emotion of boundless hope , a plexus of ethical reactions , a metaphysical assumption , a political - principle , a sense of contrast and irony a little better than he loved truth .

		Each brought to the contempla - tion of the inner and the outer life a system of anterior prejudices , habits , inhibitions , that rendered impossible the free translation of experience into art .

		Hence the `` literari - ness '' of the whole period , hence its exquisite and radiant achievements in the technique of literature the verse of `` The Lotos Eaters '' and `` A Forsaken Garden , '' the prose of the `` Apologia , '' and of ``
Henry Esmond	PERSON	. ''

		But hence , too , the absence in the whole period properly called Victorian of the lyric cry , the immediate utterance of the impassioned soul the accent of Catullus and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		Nor did any effort after a freer , braver , and more veracious art find following or applause .

		To this day it is not understood that the hope for the future of English poetry lies not in the romantic historical epic -LRB-
Noyes	ORGANIZATION	's `` Drake '' -RRB- , nor in the pseudo-classic masque -LRB- Bridges 's `` Demeter '' -RRB- , but in that neglected tradition of modern English verse which arose with `` Modern Love '' and ``
Jen	PERSON	- ny , '' was continued in
Blunt	ORGANIZATION	's `` Love Sonnets of Proteus , ''
Henley	PERSON	's `` In Hospital '' and ``
London	LOCATION	Types , ''
Housman	PERSON	's `` A Shropshire Lad , '' and culminates for the present in the poetic work of
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		But no one should , and the present re - viewer assuredly could not , leave the briefest remarks on the Victorian era without a word on its keenest critic and most illuminated spirit without a word on
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		In the incisive but always lovely wisdom of his best prose , he spoke out clearly concerning the provincial timidities , the gross self-decep - tions of the
England	LOCATION	of his day , the intellect - ual dishonesty he could not understand , the mean compromises he would not share .

		Again and again in his poetry , but especially in `` The Buried Life , '' he mourns over the in - ability of his period to be its truly human self and to express that self .

		After the elab - orate harmonies of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, after the im - perious exaltation of
Browning	PERSON	, with what a nameless and natural charm his quietest verses fall on the ear : Come to me in my dreams , and then By day I shall be well again .

		And they do so because , in words that are old but never trite , they came from the heart .

		How fortifying , in such a world as this , after the questionable theologies and otherwordly aspirations of his great contemporaries , that summons to the spirit of manhood that can never lose its validity : Charge once more , then , and be dumb !

		Let the victors when they come , When the forts of folly fall , Find thy body by the wall !

		That is the most tonic note of the whole Vic - torian age .

		And it was uttered by one who was fundamentally a stranger in it , by one who has not yet come fully into his own .

		It is a singular and perplexing thing , with so much verse being written nowadays , and so much of it on a high level , that we so seldom find poetry with magic .

		Is it possible that we are sometimes blind to it where it really exists .

		that it becomes apparent only to the after-comer , who sees it in a more detached way ?

		This might be true , certainly , of the more realistic of contemporary poets , or , to be more precise , of those who boldly use the everyday speech of the times , who to a cer - tain extent write journalese , or even employ slang ; for often what is the slang speech of to-day is the poetic speech of to-morrow .

		But to use this medium demands of the poet a very keen sense of values : he must be a good guesser , and pin his faith to the words and phrases most likely to survive , failing which he himself must perish .

		Equally unsafe is it to cling solely to the sort of speech which has come to be regarded as `` poetic '' : to - morrow it is frigid .

		For the average poet which the average poet is it is far safer to stick to the middle ground , using both , but sparingly .

		If luck is with him he may here and there leave a jewel for anthologies , by achieving an unforeseen beauty in the ex - pression of one of the great permanencies in 476 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 31	DATE	human experience ; or , as more often happens , by pitching his tent in some shabby suburb of poetry which a great genius may later ex - ploit .

		For the genius , of course , we can make no rules .

		He will do as he has to , and will compel a change in values to suit his own changes in method .

		Some will profit by this , and some will die .

		In accordance with this theory the present rather miscellaneous group of books may without much violence be divided into two parts .

		It would not be rash to assume that the great poet is not among them .

		The level , as usual , is perplexingly high ; there is often a technical skill of which great poets need not have been ashamed .

		In one group we have the traditionalists , who manifest a ten - derness for a speech deliberately poetic ; in the other , the modernists -LRB- the terms will have to be vague -RRB- , who use the language of prose .

		The former group will comprise Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	, Mr.
Shepard	PERSON	, Mr.
Mackintosh	PERSON	, and the author of `` War Poems by ` X ' '' ; the lat - ter , Messrs.
Squire	PERSON	, Wood ,
Johns	PERSON	, and
Unter	ORGANIZATION	- meyer .

		It will be seen that those who prefer a '' poetic '' speech prefer also the conven - tionally `` poetic '' tone and mood , and that the others are essentially realists .

		For the tough-minded , bread-loving modern , it is as difficult to be just to the former as to the latter .

		Miss
Brown	PERSON	, with much to say in affectionate diminutives and literary archa - isms of Pan ,
Dian	PERSON	, elves , and other Spenserian and Miltonic properties , and Mr.
Shepard	PERSON	, who sings a little more lyrically and easily of the same world , but with the deities them - selves absent -LRB- recently , one feels -RRB- , seem some - how remote from us : they live in archaic worlds of their own , worlds emotionally tenu - ous , hard to remember .

		Mr.
Mackintosh	PERSON	and `` X , '' who write of the war one as the sol - dier whose glance is backward to remembered beauty , who sings about it with a ballad-like tunefulness , simple and a trifle iterative , the other as the spectator whom the sound of bat - tle rouses to an unsatisfied militancy , which he expresses deftly , but with the rather col - orle ` ss deftness of Occasional Verse these , too , leave us unsatisfied .

		For all their cun - ning there is something unripe and vague about them .

		They leave us with a feeling that they have not wholly understood them - selves .

		All four of these poets are pretti - fiers , and it is hard to give them sufficient credit for doing well what they set out to do , particularly Mr.
Mackintosh	PERSON	, who now and then expresses a simple and deeply felt emotion with effective clearness , and Mr.
Shepard	PERSON	.

		With the other four poets one feels at once more at home .

		They talk our own lan - guage , and about things we ourselves know and do ; they live , it is plain , in our world .

		For this very reason we are a little too prone to forgive them their shortcomings as artists .

		Shortcomings they clearly have .

		If the tradi - tionalists hound beauty to death , these realists do likewise by truth : Beauty gets but a glance sidelong .

		Mr.
Wood	PERSON	, for example , makes it clear that he lives in a world intensely real , a world familiar to us ; but he seems utterly unable to focus sharply upon it .

		He has the air of one for whom it would be painful to cut from the moving surface of experience the significant moment or mood or impression .

		It is his failing , as artist , that he can not synthe - size .

		Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	suffers from the same difficulty , but not so much ; now and again he crystallizes his ideas ; and he does not to the same extent subside into mere prose .

		He shows an instinct for rhythmic invention , for melody , but not a subtle one .

		He is a little prone to shout , and is often obtuse to the point of quaintness in his sense of word values .

		Both he and Mr.
Wood	PERSON	make the mistake of dragging their ethics about with them .

		Both have their moments of vividness and beauty , but uncertainly , and in conjunction with much that is muddily perceived , scarcely felt , and vaguely phrased .

		It remains for Mr.
Squire	PERSON	and Mr.
Johns	PERSON	to intimate -LRB- rather than demonstrate -RRB- how we may at the same time use the speech of daily life , analyze those emotions or states of mind which are common to all , and yet achieve beauty .

		The six movements of Mr.
Squire	PERSON	's `` On a Friend Recently Dead , '' which take up half of his very slender book , are singu - larly powerful ; the thought is dogged , com - pact , living ; and if occasionally there are lapses into the stilted and artificial , the tone as a whole is remarkably true .

		This is a real grief we have ourselves experienced just such heavy linked chains of feeling .

		Mr.
Squire	PERSON	discloses a state of mind profoundly familiar to us .

		The ruggedness of the verse , its tortuous involutions are here a help rather than a hindrance ; in the rest of Mr.
Squire	PERSON	's book they stand alone , or with ideas some - what trivial , and are almost unreadable .

		Mr.
Johns	PERSON	, on the other hand , is essentially lyri - cal .

		One could wish that he had omitted the dialect poems at the beginning of his book , but in reading many of the lyrics which com - pose the rest one experiences little but delight .

		Not only has Mr.
Johns	PERSON	a very seduc - tive gift of melody , but at times he has what
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 477 is rare among contemporary American poets , charm , which is only one degree removed from magic .

		Partly this is rhythmic , partly a quaint blending of decorum and whim , partly a rather subtle instinct for approach - ing a mood tangentially .

		Mr.
Johns	PERSON	does not set out to exhaust an idea ; he contents him - self with the gleaming hint .

		Beyond this he does not go , nor attempt to go .

		For his suc - cess in this we can forgive him his failures and the occasional echo of
Robinson	PERSON	.

		Taken all in all , this group of volumes il - lustrates exceptionally well a singular feature of contemporary poetry : its lack of magic .

		It lacks this quality quite as much when it is traditionally `` poetic '' as when it deals realis - tically with everyday experience .

		If there are gleams of magic in the work of Mr.
Squire	PERSON	and Mr.
Johns	PERSON	, they are momentary and un - controlled , as with most contemporary poets ; one feels that they are accidental , at least in part .

		And it is impossible , of course , to tell a poet how to achieve this quality , even if we knew .

		`` We can offer rather obvious advice to most poets , on the purely technical side .

		We may suggest that most traditional - ists would profit by a loosening of the rigid rhythm-patterns and idea-patterns to which they cling , by inventing their own stanzas , by using more freely the language of the streets ; we may hint to the realists that they would do well to avoid more frequently the rhythms of prose , to allow themselves -LRB- if they can -RRB- a freer use of melody , which would in turn involve a more careful condensation of their material .

		But for the matter of magic , one can give little beyond a vague restatement of its mechanism .

		According to
Pavlov	PERSON	's law .

		one may re-create in the mind a more or less elaborate sensory pattern by giving a sharp stimulus to one carefully se - lected and highly familiar point in that pat - tern ; the pattern is completed by a motor reaction .

		The poet , then , must single out one aspect of an image which , from a sensory viewpoint , is so highly characteristic that it will stimulate the mind to re-creation of the image entire .

		It is something more than choosing the exact word it is choosing the exact idea .

		The phrase should be secondary .

		It is largely because our poets are so often intent on phrases rather than on ideas , and because they present their images in a cumula - tive group rather than singly , that they min - imize for themselves the chances for this happy accident .

		Though it is more interesting , and certainly more inspiring , to see a big building going up than coming down , the spectacle of demolition can usually hold us for a while .

		We watch the activities of the workmen with pickaxes atop the walls : the bricks fall , the dust flies , the racket runs on ; but after a little while one is likely to tire of the monotonous thump - ing and to say to himself : `` Well , I 've had enough of this ; I think I 'll move on . ''

H. T. Byron	PERSON	is given over half a column , but

		Nothing !

		Among philosophers , Sir
William Hamilton	PERSON	has a page and a half ;
William James	PERSON	and here Mr.

		Thus the bricks fall , and thus the dust of indignation is made to fill our nostrils .

		And the omissions !

		Belasco is but one .

		Two hundred are listed moderns all .

		Even that would seem to confer some measure of celeb - rity .

		There appear , in fact , to be three de - grees of fame , or of famelessness : first , to be mentioned in the `` Britannica '' ; second , not to be mentioned , but to have the omission 478 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Sometimes life seems very dreary .

		Well , now , where in this `` great English Encyclopaedia , with its twenty-nine volumes , its 30,000 pages , its 500,000 references , and its 44,000,000 words , '' are

		He is ar - dent ; he is indignant ; he means mighty well by current life and by his own country .

		Yet an encyclopaedia , like any other great human undertaking , can scarcely be accomplished on a basis purely abstract .

		It must be condi - tioned by human training and by human pref - erences .

		British scholars dig in the British Museum ; the first interest of the Briton lies in British businesses and bosoms .

		The edi - tors of the `` Britannica , '' comparing their lat - est edition with preceding ones , have a right to feel that , after all , they have limbered up considerably , have done a good deal for continental
Europe	LOCATION	and for the

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	might entertain himself by going through `` Larousse '' or `` Brockhaus . ''

		The editors may not have given all that their prospectuses and advertisements claim ; yet how many big edifices carry out , in all de - tails , the plans and specifications of the archi - tects , particularly in case of a comprehensive remodelling ?

		And surely such a structure has the right , even the duty , to guard itself against the intrusion of probable ephemera .

		What skyscraper is complete without wire screens ?

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's book , as a pamphlet against a long-established literary institution , gets to be rather wearying and irritating .

		One is irked by his disproportionate preoccupation with the arts .

		The remorseless and unstay - able thoroughness with which he works his system gets on one 's nerves .

		He clangs ; he clanks .

		So good a book ought not to produce such an effect .

		I suggest that it be read in a different spirit from that in which it is writ - ten , and that it be made to serve a different purpose .

		Let it be thoroughly indexed and annotated , and used as a little `` Encyclo - paedia Moderna '' -LRB- if such Latin will pass -RRB- , concerned altogether with current movements and latter-day personalities .

		Then all the New Ones will get a hearing ; then justice will be done the philosophy of

		Organized Charity CRIMES OF CHARITY .

		By
Konrad Bercovici	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Alfred A. Knopf	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The case against the charity organization societies was perhaps most forcibly stated long ago by the late
John Boyle O'Reilly	PERSON	when he wrote of Organized charity , scrimped and iced In the name of a cautious statistical Christ .

		More recently , various members of the
Fabian Society	ORGANIZATION	, notably Mr. and Mrs.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	, have drawn up carefully prepared indict - ments against the methods of organized char - ity as represented by the work of
the London Charity Organization Society	ORGANIZATION	; and the economist , Mr.
John A. Hobson	PERSON	, has also analyzed and rejected the principles of this organization .

		The attack upon the
London	LOCATION	Society has , however , been a criticism of its social philosophy rather than of its work for the poor , and it is of interest to us in
America	LOCATION	that the English critics of '' Charity Organiza - tion '' have in general agreed that the societies on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	are free from the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 479 objectionable characteristics of organized charity in
England	LOCATION	.

		The publication , therefore , of an attack upon organized charity in
America	LOCATION	might be expected to interest those who are concerned with the care of the poor in this country .

		I Inf ortunately the author of '' Crimes of Char - ity '' makes no attempt to present a reasoned statement of the case against organized char - ity , and the book will be a disappointment to those who are looking for facts or arguments rather than journalistic impressions .

		Al - though the book is advertised as an `` attack on organized charity , '' it is almost impossible to believe that the author understands the meaning of the term .

		It is , of course , now used to describe the work of a definite type of private charitable agency , such as we find in most American cities under the name of `` The Associated Charities '' or the `` United Charities '' or , in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	cities , `` The Charity Organization Society . ''

		Many of the charities condemned by the author of `` Crimes of Charity '' would cer - tainly not be considered forms of `` organized charity '' by those who are supposed to know what these words stand for .

		For example , an old people 's `` Home '' is described in which the inmates are beaten and an orphan 's home in which the children are `` treated like little would-be criminals '' ; but `` organized charity '' does not support such institutions .

		The or - phan-house described by
Marguerite Audoux	PERSON	in `` Marie-Claire '' is referred to as illustrat - ing the miseries for which organized charity is responsible , and an account is given of the
Baron de Rothschild Kitchen	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	, al - though neither of these institutions has the remotest connection with organized charity in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But the book is chiefly devoted to the work of a large relief agency , apparently a Jewish relief society in
New York	LOCATION	, and - the author finds his opportunity to observe the methods of the society by becoming what he calls a `` charity spy . ''

		Officially employed as a de - tective on the trail of the society 's `` investi - gators , '' he obtains information about the pensioners of the organization by falsely de - scribing himself , when he makes a visit , as a sewing-machine agent , a representative of the
Gerry Society	ORGANIZATION	, an agent from
Ellis Island	LOCATION	, and an officer of
the Board of Health	ORGANIZATION	.

		Is it necessary to say that such dishonesty is not really the method of organized charity in
America	LOCATION	?

		The plan of the book is the narration of imaginary interviews between applicants for relief and cruelly offensive interviewers , de - tectives , spies , and other representatives of an organization that can only be described as a caricature of the methods used by any repu - table charity organization in
America	LOCATION	at the present time .

		The picture of the office-inter - viewer in this book , a young man said to be `` about twenty , '' `` with the pipe between his teeth , reading an application and putting his insolent questions , laughing in the applicant 's face , calling tham -LSB- sic -RSB- liars , lazy immoral women , dirty , and all the rest of it , '' is typical of the charitable society described in this book .

		Applicants for assistance are described by this representative of organized charity as `` all the same , vicious scoundrels derelicts , beggars , rascals ... This whole damned pack is the degenerate fringe of our century , '' he lamented .

		`` We should do away with them and not help them to live . ''

		That the representatives and the methods of this imaginary society are those of `` or - ganized charity '' would hardly be believed by its most uncompromising opponents .

		If it was the author 's purpose to `` attack organ - ized charity , '' his method has been the build - ing up of a grotesque straw figure that must fall of its own weight .

		Take , for example , this extract from the book : The children of the poor ... are the greatest sufferers of them all .

		They are continually cross examined by the investigators .

		Never are they trusted , and the word , `` liar , '' is always on the lips of their torturers ... The '' Why don ' t you go to work ? ''

		is repeated every second .

		Their ages are always disputed .

		An applicant 's child is always over fourteen -LRB- working age -RRB- in the eyes of the neighbours , janitor , groceryman , butcher , investigator , and all the rest of the torturers ... A woman 's pension has been discontinued because Tier children looked , too well `` they were the picture of health , '' and as the investigator could not understand it the pension was discontinued ... I know of a boy to whom his mother had given vinegar to drink because his cheeks were too red to please the investigator .

		To one who knows the solicitude of the real `` charity visitor '' for the children under her care , the careful medical examinations pro- vided , the country outings arranged , the use of open air schools and convalescent homes , the searching of records to secure evidence that will mean the return to school of a child illegally employed , the raising of scholarships to keep in school the child who is legally old enough but not physically fit for work , the stories in this book are not fact but fiction that has not even a remote resemblance to fact .

		The language of the author is extremely violent throughout .

		`` This stupid ass in charge of the poor , '' `` This spiritual hog , '' are typical of expressions found throughout the book .

		His conduct is almost equally vio - lent .

		Thus , after a disturbing visit , he de - scribes his conduct as follows : `` I ran out .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
May 31	DATE	.

		.

		I wanted to drink .

		I stayed at home and drank brandy until I fell asleep .

		I drank and swore until I slept . ''

		And the account of his treatment of the office boy in the `` charity office '' is unfortunately not more revolting than many other passages in the book .

		`` I got hold of him , boxed his ears soundly , and before any one had time to interfere I had turned up his head and spat upon him full in the face .

		It was a disgusting act but a sweet revenge .

		I did it , then called out , ' Feel how it tastes you do it to every one . ' '

		Whatever the faults of organized charity may be , they are certainly not set forth in this volume of hysterical stories .

		Long ago Ar - nold
Toynbee	PERSON	wrote in criticizing some pro- posals on the subject of almsgiving : `` What we now see to be required is not the repression of the instincts of benevolence but their or - ganization .

		To make benevolence scientific is the great problem of the present age . ''

		No one knows better than the most devoted work - ers in the
Charity Organization Societies	ORGANIZATION	in this country how far they are , even now , from the solution of this `` great problem . ''

		But their mistakes and their successes are equally unintelligible to the writer of this volume .

		Pepys at the Theatre PEPYS ON THE KESTORATION STAGE .

		By
Helen McAfee	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		For the drama of the Eestoration period ,
Pepys	PERSON	's delectable `` Diary '' is a familiar source of information , vivid and valuable .

		A new compilation from the famous journal , by
Helen McAfee	ORGANIZATION	brings together , with compact - ness and in a form singularly practical , all of
Pepys	PERSON	's notations on the contemporary drama .

		The edition of the `` Diary '' used is that of
Wheatley	PERSON	-LRB- 1893-9 -RRB- , and thus the work is based upon the most recent and most inclu - sive version of the original .

		The introduction of some fifty pages expounds the value of the `` Diary '' in relation to the history of the Eng - lish theatre .

		In contrast to
Evelyn	PERSON	, whom moral scruples prevented from frequent at - tendance at the public playhouses and who did not hesitate to condemn the moral loose - ness of the stage ,
Pepys	PERSON	`` could enjoy without let or hindrance everything about it , from
Betterton	PERSON	's Hamlet to the orange-girls ... His curiosity was unbounded here as else - where .

		He liked to read plays on his trips to and from
Deptford	LOCATION	on Admiralty business as well as to see them at the theater .

		Hence everything and everybody on the stage ap - pealed to him ; ... if there was a single novel or exceptional fact about the play , the players , the scenery , the music , the dancing , the audience , or the theater itself , we feel cer - tain that he has noted it . ''

		It is therefore as a sympathetic and keen observer that the diarist appeals to us .

		As literary criticism , unfortunately , his judg - ments are not impressive ; but as cicerone , with what engaging intimacy , with what vi - vacity does he not discourse !

		Pepys takes us to all the
London	LOCATION	playhouses of that first dec - ade of Charles II 's reign .

		We occupy places in pit , gallery , or though rarely box , in the theatres just reopened .

		Once we are `` troubled to be seen by four of our office clerks , which sat in the half-crown box '' while we are in the middle gallery at one and sixpence .

		Once we enter late upon the plea that we are look - ing for friends , and so see part of the play for nothing ; but conscience troubles us .

		The fashionable company in the audience interests us as keenly as the play .

		My wife and I to the theater , and there saw `` The Jovial Crew , '' where the
King	PERSON	,
Duke	ORGANIZATION	and Duchess and
Madame Palmer	PERSON	were , and my wife , to her great content , had a full sight of them all the while .

		The play full of mirth ... The whole play pleases me well ; and most of all , the sight of many fine ladies .

		It has become the fashion for these ladies to wear vizards , which add to the fascination of unidentified beauty , and furnish excuse for gallantries .

		The wits and rakes of the aris - tocracy are there .

		In the intervals of the play the orange-girls sell their wares at sixpence , jest with the gentlemen , and convey messages between them and the ladies of the stage .

		If royalty is present royalty 's latest mistress is near at hand .

		Sometimes a diverting passage at arms occurs between two of these frail fair ones .

		The court scandal of the day is whis - pered in our ear .

		And what of the play ?

		The piece for the afternoon may be one of Sir
William D ` Aven	PERSON	- ant 's , written or adapted for the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's Theater , of which he is manager ; or , if we are at the
King	ORGANIZATION	's playhouse , it may be Dry - den 's , perhaps `` The Maiden Queen , '' which
Pepys	PERSON	saw seven times within a year .

		The pre-Eestoration drama is by no means obsolete .

		Twelve of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays are mentioned in the `` Diary , '' eight of which were prob - ably unaltered .

		The romances of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	are especially popular .

		Pepys saw no less than twenty-six presented .

		For the comedies of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	he exhibits more enthusiasm than for the Shakespearean pro- ductions , although he professes immense ad - miration for `` Macbeth '' and `` Hamlet . ''

		The spectacular appeals to him ; he applauds the costuming in a certain play `` the garments
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 481 like Romans very well '' ; '' there was the finest scene of the Emperor and his people about him , standing in their fixed and different pos - tures in their Roman habits , above all that ever I yet saw at any of the theaters . ''

		An - other play has `` a good scene of a town on fire . ''

		`` To the theater ... where a woman acted Parthenia , and came afterwards on the stage in man 's clothes , and had the best legs that ever I saw . ''

		In
January	DATE	, 1660-1 ,
Pepys	PERSON	for the first time saw women on the stage , and thereafter the noted actresses of the day , with several of whom he was on terms of intimacy , figure prominently in the `` Diary . ''

		Chief among them , of course , is
Nell Gynn	PERSON	pretty , witty Nell .

		So great a performance of a comical part was never , I believe , in the world before as Nell do this -LSB-
Florimell	PERSON	, in `` The Maiden Queen '' -RSB- , both as a mad girle , then most and best of all when she comes in like a young gallant ; and hath the motions and car - riage of a spark the most that ever I saw any man have .

		The greatest of the actors was Thomas Bet - terton .

		`` And so to the
Duke 's House	ORGANIZATION	, and there saw ` Hamlet ' done , giving us fresh rea - son never to think enough of Betterton . ''

		`` Mightily pleased with it -LSB- ` Hamlet ' -RSB- ; but , above all , with
Betterton	PERSON	, the best part , I be - lieve , that ever man acted . ''

		The plan of the book brings into groups all the notations bearing upon specific plays or details connected with their presentation .

		Thus , for example , we have all of
Pepys	PERSON	's comments on `` Hamlet '' grouped chronolog - ically ; the references to
Betterton	PERSON	and to
Nell Gynn	PERSON	are similarly arranged ; successive chapters include the references in the `` Diary '' to Plays , Actors , Actresses , Playwrights , Audiences ,
Theatres	ORGANIZATION	, and Stage Productions .

$ 1.25	MONEY	. -RRB-

		`` The Journal of an Author '' began to ap - pear in
1876	DATE	, that is , after
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	's re - turn from abroad , and it therefore coincides with what his biographers call `` the highest period of his life . ''

		He was then happily married , a man of secure position , of ever - growing renown , the author of a marvellous series of novels .

		His financial circumstances ever an essential factor in his career underwent a marked improvement ; he was able at last to throw off the shackles of liter - ary bondage to publishers and write without doing it under the lash of necessity and .

		time .

		Then , too , he wrote his famous novel , `` The
Brothers Karamazov	ORGANIZATION	, '' that extraordinary epic of human vileness , aberration , and psy - chopathy .

		With this he became a person of tremendous literary influence .

		In the sixties of the nineteenth century ,
Russia	LOCATION	began to acquire free speech , free thought , and a free press .

		The social fer - ment was prodigious and everyone consid - ered it his mission to aid matters as much as possible either by word or deed .

		The press became the hub of the wheel of progress and in this movement Dostoevsky was most prom - inent .

		He , with two others , edited the jour - nal `` Vremya , '' in which an attempt was made to break away from the excessive imitation of
Europe	LOCATION	and create an independent Russian outlook .

		In
1873	DATE	Dostoevsky became the ed - itor of
Grazhdonin	LOCATION	, and lastly , in
1876	DATE	, he began the `` Journal of an Author . ''

		Scat - tered through its pages are many and varied ideas : a bright and optimistic study of Rus - sian youth ; a suggestion for a reformatory for young criminals ; a plea for the feminine movement ; discussions of legal processes ; and many other articles , all excellent , though they lacked system and were united by no definite programme .

		The Journal enjoyed great pop - ularity and
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	was hailed as a prophet .

		Throughout his life , in all his novels , he had been a `` narodnik , '' or cultivator of the people , and this tendency and his personal popularity reached their apogee with his speech at the Pushkin festival .

		This speech , which the present book contains , indicates
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	's views of the people .

		He looked upon them as a great , silent mass wherein lurked all truth .

		He looked upon them as the sole repository of the wisdom of the heart and as the basis of the future not only of
Russia	LOCATION	but of all
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He scorned the
Intelligentsia	ORGANIZATION	, so subservient to Western ideals , and bade them humble themselves and `` listen to the Grey Smocks . ''

		He dreamed that strange Slavophile dream of the Russian soul playing a universal role and in the light of recent events that nation bids fair to realize the dream .

		The speech begins with a masterly analysis of
Pushkin	LOCATION	's `` The Gip - sies '' and ``
Eugene Onyegin	PERSON	, '' whose heroes ,
Aleko	PERSON	and
Onyegin	PERSON	respectively , are the type of the unhappy Russian wanderer , uprooted from among the people .

		These sufferers seek their universal ideals among Western coun - tries and in every fantastic spot except that place where they are being preserved among 482 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 31	DATE	the people .

		Dostoevsky divides
Pushkin	LOCATION	's work into three periods : those of the virile imitator , the poet of his native land , and , lastly , the universal poet .

		In praising the poet 's universal sympathy , the critic contends that this is the preeminent characteristic of the Russian people , that `` to be a true Rus - sian does indeed mean to aspire finally to reconcile the contradictions of
Europe	LOCATION	, to show the end of European yearning in our Russian soul , omni-human and all-uniting . ''

		He also emphasizes the fact that `` all that is truly beautiful in our literature has come of the masses , from
Pushkin	LOCATION	's creation of the humble , simple-minded type , onwards . ''

		Into this little volume has been put also `` The Dream of a Queer Fellow '' another queer fellow like
Raskolnikov	PERSON	,
Rogozhin	PERSON	, and
Ivan Karamazov	PERSON	and this time his name is
Fyodor Dostoevsky	PERSON	.

		He tells us how he had determined to kill himself but fell asleep and dreamed a dream which gave him the in - spiration to fight against despair and the fear that nothing matters .

		He had a vision of Truth , like
Nietzsche	PERSON	among the mountains and valleys of the Engadine , like
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, like
Descartes	PERSON	and
Schelling	PERSON	.

		He discovered that each of us is morally responsible and that the essence of life lies in humility and love .

		In short , the little story or essay of sombre intensity is a key to
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		In his book , Shestov attacks many philos - ophers and authors , devoting articles of vary - ing length to
Hegel	LOCATION	,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and others a destructive criticism , for he gives us no discoverable positive philosophy of his own in the place of those destroyed .

		In no country has dogmatism such power as in
Russia	LOCATION	, and Shestov seems almost unnerved by the fear that he too may be made an authority and a rule , and he protests mightily against the idolatrous love of thinkers , against exalting a philosopher to a god .

		The two longest articles are given to
Chekhov	ORGANIZATION	and
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	, and
Shestov	ORGANIZATION	ridicules the work done by the latter in the press and `` The Journal of an Author . ''

		It is doubtless true from the purely academic standpoint that
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	was poorly equipped for propaganda work .

		Many of his prophecies and chauvinistic ut - terances lay him open to an attack such as this .

		For example ,
Shestov	PERSON	mocked at the prophecy that
Russia	LOCATION	would be in
Constanti	LOCATION	- nople soon and accused Dostoevsky of being spoiled by the ease that came to him at this time , and of being unwilling to struggle .

		The article is hardly just , for it does not take into account all
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	's social work and no - where makes mention of his championship of the `` grey smocks , '' of his pronouncement of the truth that man and his works , if divorced from the popular element , are like uprooted grass-blades , bound to wither and die .

		Any - way , as
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	says : `` It is the privilege of genius to make great mistakes with impun - ity , '' and all admit that Dostoevsky belongs among the greatest of the great .


NELLIE POORMAN	PERSON	.

		NOTES ON NEW FICTION In `` Life '' there once appeared a cartoon which pictured a bespectacled author laboring over his typewriter from which a stream of manuscript ran into a press .

		From the press a heap of novels tumbled forth at the feet of a young lady who was avidly reading one of them .

		As we remember it , the cartoon was entitled `` The Endless Stream . ''

		It was incomplete in one respect , for there should have been also a yawning cavern labelled , `` Obli - vion , '' into which the lady finally cast every book .

		For this endless stream of novels one can hardly blame the novelist .

		He must make his hay while the sun shines .

		The general public has become `` movie-minded . ''

		Change the new thing has be - come the order -LRB- or the disorder -RRB- of the day .

		There is no denying that movie attendance has developed in a great mass of people the craving for skeleton - ized , melodramatic plots with no characterizations , no delicate nuances of style , or poetic moments plots which are all forgotten as soon as seen or read .

		And so the demand for more books and ever more , and also therefore but why reiterate the law of supply and demand ?

		The novelist has his formulas : `` the woman '' and `` the man '' and `` the other woman , '' and still more popular recently in the biographical style , `` the woman '' and sev - eral men or `` the man '' and several women .

		Add a little padding of conversation and description and there you are a novel !

		`` The Diplomat '' -LRB- Longmans , Green ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is written in the leisurely Trollope manner and han - dles
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's subject , English country gentry .

		We are told the story of the lives of three
Wades	LOCATION	,
Thomas	PERSON	, the diplomat ,
Gilmore	LOCATION	, and
Charlotte	LOCATION	.

		In the beginning all are more or less at the mercy of chance ; they allow themselves to drift until cir - cumstances become adverse enough to rouse their strength of character .

		Thomas wades through various entanglements produced by his susceptibil - ity to feminine charms , but he arrives at length on the heights of a gentle philosophy .

		Gilmore marries an actress and kills her former husband , and
Charlotte	LOCATION	marries a Lord , who is also mys - teriously killed .

		All of this sounds melodramatic enough , but it is n't in Mr.
Guy Fleming	PERSON	's simple telling of the tale .

		Ian Hay pives us in `` Pip '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- all that any reader can demand .

		He passes through the first three ages of man in this book .

		As a boy he plays naughty pranks ; as a youth he refuses to wear out his brain by too much study , but becomes a first-rate cricketer ; as a young man
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 483 he promptly accepts responsibility when it comes to him , very properly bloodies the nose of his rival in love , and wins the lady .

		After that , of course , the readers interest in him ends , for it is incon - ceivable that any one should be interesting after marriage .

		In her search for happiness , Hope Fielding has endless adventures with men .

		In her desire to know and understand life , she is thoroughly uncon - ventional , so that some of her adventures , set forth in `` The Magpie 's Nest , '' touch on the sordid , though she emerges unsoiled .

		She flirts with a married man , his chauffeur , a bank clerk , a spec - ulator , and numerous others , and to some her al - lure brings misfortune .

		Isabel
Paterson	PERSON	's heroine reminds one of
Owen Johnston	PERSON	's `` Salamander , '' a fact which will doubtless recommend the book to many .

		In decided contrast to Hope 's hoydenish , un - sheltered career is that of
Rosalind Copley	PERSON	, for she is a member of one of the ultra-conservative families of
Boston	LOCATION	.


Robert Cutler	PERSON	's `` Louisburg Square '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- belongs to the type of book in which the heroine hesitates between two men , the reasons for her hesitation being various misunderstandings and pity for the rejected .

		The author makes some attempt at characterization , but the result is not very convincing .

		The whole with its irritating self-immolation is somewhat too sug - gestive of an `` Elsie '' book to be pleasant , and it is truly Bostonese in that it never moves its scene from that
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	village .

		To be sure , that in it - self is enough to render the book worth while .

		The second volume , `` Backwater '' -LRB- Knopf ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , of
Dorothy M. Richardson	PERSON	's trilogy takes its heroine ,
Miriam	PERSON	, through the ordeal of employ - ment as resident governess in a school frequented by the daughters of the
North London	LOCATION	middle class .

		It is a chronicle of the commonplace .


Banbury Park	LOCATION	has its counterparts throughout
England	LOCATION	, and
Miss Richardson	PERSON	probes , through her one example , the nature of the institutionalism to which hun - dreds of such communities are subject , studying with notable insight the inbred pettiness against which
Miriam	PERSON	finally revolts and the sentimental nature of English education .

		Those pregnant mo - ments when the realization is borne in upon the individual that there is something beyond the mere imparting of knowledge , the moods that of a sud - den throw one out of `` the proner teacher 's frame of mind , '' the rare vacation days when nothing seems real , neither the present nor the past all these were
Miriam	PERSON	's .

		Miss
Richardson	PERSON	promises to be a writer of unusual power , a little too con - sciously clever perhaps , but one to whom we may look for work of real value .

		`` Vesprie Towers , '' by
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	-LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is one of those leisurely , well - ripened Victorian novels that convey relaxation and a gentle degree of interest to their readers .

		The kindly , beauty-loving nature of its author , his environment of culture , and his association with the Pre-Raphaelites are reflected here .

		The story is concerned with a young girl ,
Violet Vesprie	PERSON	, who , becoming mistress of
Vesprie Towers	ORGANIZATION	at an early age and owner of absolutely nothing else in the world , is thrown out upon that world for a liv - ing .

		Her breeding and her beauty stand her in little stead in the struggle , and her own uncon - scious class snobbery prevents her from attaining that easy-going comradeship which might have saved her in the beginning .

		But her hereditary faith in the family luck and the devotion of the obscure but heroic son of the `` Stratford Slasher '' restore her to her place in the sun .

		Life in upper
New York State	LOCATION	in the days before the Civil War has rarely been better or more charmingly described than by
Irving Bacheller	PERSON	in his latest novel , `` The Light in the Clearing '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The boy ,
Barton Baynes	PERSON	, was `` raised '' by his Aunt
Deel	PERSON	and his Uncle Pea - body in the sturdy old way that produced bone and gristle and a hardy character capable of weathering all storms .

		He discovered early in life that for lesser crimes in which conscience was not concerned his uncle 's slipper belabored the bed , but that when it was a question of conscious guilt , the slipper had a way of approaching his own person .

		Forced to distinguish wrong on his own account and to follow his own conscience , he be - came one of the sturdy citizens destined for a career in the world that lay outside his farm .

		But the novel , while more intimately concerned with
Bart Baynes	PERSON	's life and romance , gives an excellent picture of
Silas Wright	PERSON	.

		Senator and great-hearted leader , the man who refused the practically unani - mous nomination of the
Baltimore	LOCATION	Convention when Polk was chosen ,
Wright	PERSON	has been too little known ; and this story , told with simplicity , kindly humor , and genuine understanding , will help to make him better known .

		One of the strongest points in the writing of
B. M. Bower	PERSON	, author of `` Starr of the Desert '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- , is his sense of humor , which never deserts him .

		His latest novel shows no falling off in his ability to make a good plot and plausible characters , and to create suspense .

		One must grant him one more point timeliness in the present case , for he deals with a Mexican plot to snatch three states from the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and fol - lows the exploits of
Starr	PERSON	, the
United States	LOCATION	secret service agent in his efforts to round up the in - stigators thereof .

		In ``
Nadine Narska	PERSON	'' the
Baroness Mahrah de Meyer	PERSON	treats us to a miscellaneous mixture of pa - ganism , diluted
Nietzsche	PERSON	, worldly morals , and the doctrine of reincarnation .

		The heroine absorbs and struggles to digest idea after idea .

		She is rest - less , passionate , pure , tragic , and never contented .

		A mysterious person from
India	LOCATION	, `` beautiful as an archangel , '' appears at opportune moments to save
Nadine	PERSON	from herself .

		He tells her that she is a `` believing Nihilist '' looking for something she `` had not yet found , '' and he preaches patiently and constantly .

		She had a troubled life , since her husband distressed her acutely , but the reader finds it difficult to be stirred by her tribulations .

		Authors as a class are seldom rich .

		This may account for their occasional desire to prove in fiction that , given the coveted opportunity , money may be made quickly and easily .

		In `` The Son THE DIAL -LSB-
May 31	DATE	of His Father , '' Mr.
Ridgwell Cullum	PERSON	assures us that it can be done with no bother at all .


Gordon Carbhoy	PERSON	promised his father to make
$ 100,000	MONEY	in six months , if he had to rob a bank .

		He did not rob a bank ; he robbed his father instead ; and having inherited the paternal talent for high - handedness , he continued to have things come his way .

		It is a plausible tale , but one is pained at the extraordinary English employed by a
New York	LOCATION	millionaire .

		Perhaps he had been too busy making a fortune to acquire more than a smatter - ing of his native tongue .

		`` I 've sometimes thought it must be the footlights .

		They flare up between us and the audience and to look like human beings we 've got to paint our faces , and to act like real people we 've got to exaggerate our manners and grimace and gesticulate like monkeys .

		And then in time we come to exaggerate off the stage and pose and assume a grand manner and wear loud clothes .

		We 're no worse than your friends I met to-day the only difference is that we always have our make-ups on . ''

		This explains , perhaps , why
Charles Belmont Davis	PERSON	fails to `` get it over '' in all but one of this collection of short - stories : the make-up is always there ; the puppets never become quite human .

		In the light of the author 's imagination `` The Octopus '' and '' ` The Professor ' '' may seem real , but to the rest of us they are stagy and do not arrive ; they merely `` grimace and gesticulate . ''

		Exception may be made to `` The Joy of Dying . ''

		It is a pathetic and gruesome little tragedy .

		It is interesting to compare two recent detective stories , one by an American writer ,
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	, `` The Mark of Cain '' -LRB-

Louis Tracy	PERSON	, `` The Post - master 's Daughter '' -LRB-
Clode	LOCATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Here are two novels written for the sole purpose of entertain - ment and having practically the same theme , the solution of a murder mystery .

		But how shall we account for the extraordinary difference in qual - ity ?

		`` The Mark of Cain '' is a crude thriller .

		It is carelessly written , with no skill in characteriza - tion or plot ; its ingenuity is not above that in - spiring the
Sunday	DATE	`` feature story '' ; its humor is of the same quality as the `` comic '' sheet and where the author would be exciting she is only lurid .

		It is shoddy .

		Yet it was written to amuse the Amer - ican public !

		On the other hand , the English novel , written for the same purpose , possesses genuine literary worth in characterization and construc - tion .

		Where the one is a dreary rehash of stereo - typed `` mystery , '' the other is fresh and enthralling ; where the one has a set of manikins for characters , the other has living people who possess individuality and charm ; where the one is vulgarly commonplace and flagrant , the other is re - freshing and subtle .

		Why the difference ?

		Does the English public demand better stuff for its diversion , or does the English author respect him - self even when writing a pot-boiler ?

		`` The Post - master 's Daughter '' is a first-rate story , one to be recommended with a clear conscience !

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS THE CONTEMPORARY DRAMA OP
IRELAND	LOCATION	.

		By
Ernest A. Boyd	PERSON	.

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Scarcely half a year has gone by since Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	published his monumental book on `` Ire - land 's Literary Renaissance '' ; he follows it up now with another work , written previously , if we are not mistaken , a fine , agile , and spirited contribu - tion to Professor
Burton	PERSON	's `` Contemporary Drama Series . ''

		Those who are most familiar with Irish letters will be surprised , we imagine , at the impres - sive showing of the Irish theatre , as Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	presents it , among the various national theatres of twentieth-century
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Certainly it can hold its own with those of
Russia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, and more than hold its own with that of
England	LOCATION	, all of which goes to prove the force and value of an extra-artistic vision , a communal impulse behind and beneath the artistic impulse itself .

		Much of Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	's matter is familiar enough to reading Americans ; certain chapters , on the other hand , notably those on
Edward Martyn	PERSON	, on the learned histrionic art of the brothers
Fay	PERSON	, on the originative genius of
Padraic Colum	PERSON	, and on the Ulster Literary Theatre , contain a good deal that is fresh and surprising ; and the deftness with which Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	puts St.
John Irvine	PERSON	in his place , if this is not too strong an expression , is only equalled by that with which he sets before us in a few paragraphs a number of distinguished talents hitherto unknown on this side of the water .

		For the rest , Mr.
Boyd	PERSON	contends , most interestingly and provocatively , that
Edward Martyn	PERSON	has extracted the essence of Ibsenism in a far more personal way than
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	or any of the later Eng - lish playwrights , and he points out that
Colum	PERSON	had given the measure of his originality rather before than after
Synge	PERSON	and ranks with
Synge	PERSON	as a founder in the tradition of folk drama .

		The Irish Theatre has indeed proved itself a remarkable phe - nomenon in these eighteen years , during which it has held the ear not of a clique but of the general public ; and it is one of the unique fortunes of
Ireland	LOCATION	that it has weathered the war and promises to continue to be , in spite of a tendency to live on its tradition , a vital factor in the complete unfold - ing of the national consciousness .

		SHORT RATIONS .

		By
Madeleine Z. Doty	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		By means of a very feminine degree of in - tuition , a journalistic sense of observation , a tele - graphic style , and a purely American sense of humor ,
Miss Doty	ORGANIZATION	has achieved one of the most suggestive reports of conditions inside the German Empire that it has been our fortune to see .

		With a complete ignorance of the German tongue , she had the courage to push her way through to Ber - lin after , her visit to the Woman 's Conference at the
Hague	LOCATION	in
1915	DATE	, and again in
1916	DATE	, when she found interesting developments in sentiment and in conditions .

		It is in the spiritual sense as well as in the material that she has called her book `` Short Rations . ''

		Although the daily food ration in
Germany	LOCATION	is pitifully scanty , she found the spiritual starvation even more marked .

		No thought
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 485 is now given to the sick , the aged , the children , or the prisoners , except in so far as these affect the military strength of the nation .

		All effort and all care is expended upon the army , to which the German people look with pathetic expectation .

		The attitude is perhaps best shown in her description of `` the human circus , '' the Lazaret for armless and legless men , which was exhibited , together with like marvels of German efficiency expressly designed for publicity , in the course of a tour for journalists .

		`` The doctor 's talk ran as follows : ` This one has had his leg off just below the knee but he walks quite well / and he started the man down the room .

		` This one , ' jerking another wreck forward , ` has one leg off at the knee and the other at the thigh , but see how well he walks , ' and the maimed wreck was pranced up and down before us .

		` Now this one , ' continued the doctor with pride , ` has had both legs and an arm removed but you see he is quite satisfactory . '

		I began to feel in a horrible nightmare .

		It seemed to me in another moment the doctor would be saying .

		` Now this man had his head shot off and we have sub - stituted a wooden one .

		We found the spine controlled muscular action and he makes a per - fectly satisfactory worker . ' ''

		In addition to this quite general lack of the realization of human sensibility ,
Miss Doty	ORGANIZATION	perceived a profound igno - rance of the constitution of human efficiency .

		Ger - many is organized industrially with the utmost perfection , but human values are without recogni - tion .

		Plenty of food may be obtained for money .

		But the condition of
Germany	LOCATION	's poor is such that many can not afford even a daily visit to the soup kitchen .

		To starve
Germany	LOCATION	means to starve these , in whom lies the hope of democracy , and to leave those responsible for the war untouched except by a determination for revenge .

		``
Regen	ORGANIZATION	- eration , '' she says , `` always comes from within . ''

		It can not be imposed upon
Germany	LOCATION	by her enemies .

		MAN 'S UNCONSCIOUS CONFLICT .

		By
Wilfrid Lay	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Dr. Lay has succeeded in giving a coherent and systematic account , in simple terms , of the fun - damental principles and conceptions that are im - plied in the discoveries and hypotheses of Freud and his school .

		This is in itself no small achieve - ment , for basic as these discoveries are , they are overlaid , even in the work of Freud himself , with the excesses , irrelevancies , and extravagances usual to fertilizing novelty , and in a large meas - ure inevitable to novelties in the particular region of human investigation with which
Freud	ORGANIZATION	con - cerns himself .

		Dr. Lay seems not only to have read all the literature , but to have assimilated it .

		It is a pity that he still defers so much to the rather inconclusive and therapeutically as well as theoretically useless generalization of sex ; that he underestimates , if he at all considers , the im - portance of the `` self - regarding instinct '' ; and that he offers hasty prescriptions to teachers .

		It is undoubtedly true that the effectiveness of all teachers would be increased if the futile pedagogy which `` educators '' thrust upon them could be replaced by a thorough grounding in the only psychology which deals with the real dynamics of consciousness .

		But the field is as yet too unex - plored and our knowledge too indefinite for any prescriptive regulations of the art of teaching on the basis of Freudian assumptions .

		Although much that Dr. Lay says under the rubric of `` edu - cational applications '' is descriptive of recurrent situations in the school-room , the dangers involved in an educational practice based on it at present outweigh the advantages it might generate .

		The most needful thing is investigation , and then more investigation , and then investigation still .

		EARLY NARRATIVES OF THE NORTHWEST .

		Edited by
Louise Phelps Kellogg	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The exploits of the founders of
New France	LOCATION	, although often recounted , form a tale which still holds its fascination for serious student and casual reader alike .

		Men of the type of
Champlain	LOCATION	and Frontenac , gifted as they were with imaginations which permitted them to see golden visions of the future greatness of
France	LOCATION	when the vast hinter - land of
North America	LOCATION	should be hers , were men of action as well as dreamers of dreams .

		They gathered around themselves and inspired those who led the expeditions which traversed the streams , woodlands , and prairies from
Quebec	LOCATION	to the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		These leaders , who were recruited chiefly from among the lesser nobility and the better mid - dle class in
France	LOCATION	, were fired by the same patriotic sentiments which moved their superiors .

		The struggles , the tragic failures , and the brilliant suc - cesses of these heroes of the wilderness ,
Parkman	PERSON	has woven into an epic familiar to every reader of American history .

		Yet , in the accounts of the expeditions set down , as they often were , in the homely phrases of men more used to doing things than to reporting them , there is a gripping inter - est for the student of the French regime .

		In the `` Early Narratives of the Northwest '' are gathered thirteen of these accounts dealing entirely with the exploration of the region of the upper Great Lakes and the northeastern
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	le pays d'en haut , or the
Upper Country	ORGANIZATION	, as the French designated it .

		With two exceptions Father
Vimont	PERSON	's account of
Nicolet	ORGANIZATION	's journey into the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	country -LRB- 1634 -RRB- and Father
Lalemant	ORGANIZATION	's account of the journey of the Jesuits ,
Raymbault	PERSON	and Jogues , to the
Sault	LOCATION	-LRB- 1641 -RRB- the documents relate to the explorations of the
second half of the seventeenth century	DATE	.

		Of these there are
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	's account of his journey to the western country , an extract of La Potherie 's account of the adventures of
Nicolas Perrot	PERSON	, Father
Allouez	PERSON	's journeys -LRB- the one to Lake Superior , the other to the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	country -RRB- , the journey of the Sulpicians , Dollier and
Galinee	PERSON	, from
Montreal	LOCATION	to the
Sault	LOCATION	,
Father Marquette	ORGANIZATION	's voyages ,
Tonty	ORGANIZATION	's Memoir recording La Salle 's discoveries ,
Duluth	LOCATION	's account of the
Sioux	LOCATION	country ,
St. Cosme	ORGANIZATION	's letter describing his voyage from
Michilimackinac	LOCATION	to the
Arkansas	LOCATION	river , and the Jesuits ' report of the imposing ceremony held at
Sault	LOCATION	Ste.

May 31	DATE	XIV appeared before the assembled representa - tives of the Indian tribes and took formal posses - sion of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	valleys .

		All the documents have appeared before in print but the advantage of having them grouped in a single volume is obvious .

		All , with the exception of
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	's journal , were originally written in French and have been reprinted from the best available translations .

		THE BOOK OF THE PEONY .

		By Mrs.
Edward Harding	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 6	MONEY	.

		The ever-widening interest shown in gardening by serious amateurs has encouraged the publica - tion of books on garden specialties .

		In the present book Mrs.
Harding	PERSON	does at least three things ex - tremely well : she gives a fascinating account of the history and legend of the peony ; she makes her reader feel the charm and value of this flower ; and , having inspired the amateur gardener to cultivate peonies , she tells him simply and clearly how to do it .

		An encyclopedia is explicit , but it is not inspiring .

		For example ,
Bailey	PERSON	says , `` The propagation of peonies from seed is tedious . ''

		Mrs.
Harding	PERSON	, on the other hand , tells us that while the propagation of peonies from seed is extremely slow it offers untold possibilities for the devel - opment of new and beautiful varieties , and she makes it clear why this is so .

		She possesses the two most important attributes of the successful gardener patience and imagination .

		Although a large bibliography on the peony is given , no other volume yet published appears to be so com - plete as this one , with its minute directions for growing peonies , its useful classifications of types , and its beautiful illustrations .

		The two chapters on tree peonies present material new to many gardeners , and Professor
H. H. Whetzel	PERSON	's dis - cussion of `` Diseases of the Peony '' represents the latest research .

		Mrs.
Harding	PERSON	's book is delight - fully written and should not be neglected by amateur gardeners .

		AFTERNOON .

		By
Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	.

		Trans - lated by
Charles R. Murphy	PERSON	.

		Lane ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		It is a pleasure to note the rapidity with which
Verhaeren	ORGANIZATION	's works are being offered to English readers .

		A companion volume to `` The Sunlit Hours , '' recently reviewed in THE DIAL , contains an excellent translation of the second of the tril - ogy of love poems , `` Les Heures d'Apres-Midi . ''

		The poet again invites us to his garden , for he would `` hide from men who are too wise . ''

		The theme also is the same the expression , beautiful in its simplicity , of reverential affection and grat - itude .

		Nothing is better than to feel Happy and limpid still after what years ?

		But if fate had willed above For us two naught but suffering and tears , Still , would I have wished to live and die Complain tless , in such unrelenting love !

		The inspiration which nature always had for Ver - haeren , and which made of him a pantheist , is everywhere in his work .

		I bring you , this eve , an offering of joy From having drenched my body in the gold And silken texture of the joyous wind And in the yellow splendour of the sun .

		Surely no translation will satisfy those who can appreciate the original .

		Take , for instance , this verse : Je te regarde , et tous les jours je te decouvre .

		an echo , perhaps , of
Racine	LOCATION	's Titus : Depuis cinq ans en tiers chaque jour je la vois Et crois tou jours la voir pour la premiere fois .

		Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	renders
Verhaeren	PERSON	quite literally : `` And when I look at you I make discoveries , '' but the abyss that separates poetry from prose lies between the two .

		Still , frequently the translator catches the true rhythm of the original : And , like an eager ship with wind-swept masts , our jy , Voyages upon the seas of our desire , while once , at least , he has improved upon the French .

		What matter that the years grow heavier ?

		Since I know well that nothing can e'er bound Or trouble our exalted happiness , And that our souls are too profound For love to die for want of loveliness .

		`` Pour que 1 ' amour depende encor de la beaute , '' is the original of the last line .

		ST. JEAN DE CREVECCEUR .

		By
Julia Post Mitchell	PERSON	.


Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		St. Jean -LRB- or Saint
John	PERSON	-RRB- de
Crevecoeur	PERSON	was a native of
Normandy	LOCATION	who earned his own living , prior to the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, as surveyor and farmer , in what were to be our
Middle States	LOCATION	.

		He became a naturalized citizen of
New York	LOCATION	, and was appreciative in the highest degree of the peace , plenty , religious liberty , and political free - dom of American life .

		During our Revolution he suffered both as a family man and as an indi - vidual ; indeed , he was arrested by the British on suspicion of being a spy and was for some time detained in prison in
New York City	LOCATION	, whither he was to return , after a stormy voyage to the Old World -LRB- he tells us he was shipwrecked off the
Irish Coast	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as
France	LOCATION	's first Consul at
New York	LOCATION	his headquarters for the business of the three states to which he was accredited .

		As a member of the circle of Madame d'Houdetot -LRB- mistress of
Rousseau	PERSON	and later of Saint-Lam - bert -RRB- , he saw something of literary and aris - tocratic society in his native land ; later , he passed through the French Revolution as a harmless old man .

		Active in establishing the first regular mail packet service linking the
United States	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	-LRB- through the ports of
New York	LOCATION	and
Lorient	LOCATION	, in
Brittany	LOCATION	-RRB- , Consul
Crevecoeur	PERSON	was not content merely to carry out his routine duties trying -LRB- as his biographer records -RRB- `` to spread abroad such medical and botanical information as was at his disposal . ''

		But it is as the author of a modest series of papers that , by their lyric qual - ity , quaintness , and revelation of a love of nature at once highly modern and incontestably sincere , that
Crevecoeur	PERSON	is honorably remembered to-day , after having charmed such readers as the Pan - tisocratic circle of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, and
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 487
Southey	PERSON	; and the essayists ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		The manuscript of `` Letters from an American Farmer '' was sold by
Crevecoeur	PERSON	to a
London	LOCATION	pub - lisher for thirty guineas , and was first published in
1782	DATE	.

		In late years the Farmer 's memory has been warmed by the reprinting of his principal work by two American publishers -LRB- Duffield
1904	DATE	; Button
1913	DATE	-RRB- and now we have Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's biographical study of more than three hundred pages .

		This doctoral dissertation is the evidence of a good many years of untiring research , and is therefore much less superficial or fragmentary than investigations by the late
Robert de Creve	PERSON	- coeur ,
F. B. Sanborn	PERSON	, Mr.
Barton Blake	PERSON	, and others .

		Dr. Post fixes the principal facts in the life of a colonist who exchanged letters with many persons of note in
America	LOCATION	and in
France	LOCATION	: a worker for agricultural betterments , and , as noted above ,
New York	LOCATION	's first Consul of
France	LOCATION	.

		Even Miss
Mitchell	PERSON	's devoted energies have , how - ever , failed to establish certain facts about the Farmer-Philosopher , notably the details of the earlier stages of his career in
America	LOCATION	.

		This is no tragedy : for the minutiae of such a life as his are more important to the candidate for academic honors than to mere readers .

		New readers will hardly be drawn to
Crevecoeur	PERSON	and his `` Letters '' by this scholarly biography .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's stagnancy of style in her `` Life '' of an author who was seldom wanting in a certain naive vivacity , no doubt fol - lows the purest German tradition , which is too generally , in American universities , the tradition of our scholarship also ; but that authoritative theses are necessarily dull has been disproved to us again and again by the work of candidates for the French doctorate of letters .

		To demand humor or style or charm of our own doctors of philosophy , even when writing of a Frenchman , would be , however , both cruel and unusual .

		AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OP SCI - ENCE .

		By
Walter Libby	PERSON	.

		Houghton Mimin ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Professor
Libby	PERSON	's unpretentious little volume conforms strictly to the requirements of a pro- paedeutic course .

		It is not a systematic history tracing the development of the several sciences , nor an essay on the psychology of investigation , nor a philosophy of science , but a simple intro - duction to all three , with the emphasis perhaps even more on the cultural aspects and relations of science than on its history .

		The book is an attempt to rouse interest in the subject , being the outgrowth of lectures to young men of from seven - teen to twenty-two years of age .

		The choice of topics and of chapter headings -LRB- for the two do not always coincide -RRB- was evidently determined by this pedagogical , in one or two cases we are al - most tempted to say journalistic , sense for the popularly interesting .

		Professor
Libby	PERSON	has un - doubtedly done very well what he set out to do .

		Forced to exclude much that is important by the limitation to less than 300 pages , he has chosen little that is not worth while and brought into prominence several leading ideas , such as the de - velopment of science from everyday needs and its continuity of growth in Caucasian civilization .

		Of particular charm , precisely because of the rela - tively unhackneyed character of the subjects , are the chapters on `` Cooperation in Science '' and `` The Scientist Sir
Humphry Davy	PERSON	. ''

		On the other hand , no good reason is apparent for the disproportionate space devoted to
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, whose biography is amply known in
America	LOCATION	and who certainly does not merit over a dozen pages in a history of science when
Newton	ORGANIZATION	must content himself with two .

		The treatment of scientific law must be con - sidered rather inadequate , for even in an ele - mentary discussion it would have been possible to bring home some of the results of latter-day philosophy of science and to correct popular no - tions as to the `` laws of nature . ''

		Finally , there is not lacking a tang of provincialism in the con - cluding chapter on `` Science and Democratic Culture . ''

		In spite of attempts at qualification Pro- fessor
Libby	LOCATION	is somewhat too obviously convinced that American democracy is the best conceivable condition in the best of conceivable universes .

		Moreover , he seems not sufficiently aware of the romantic strain in many of the world 's great sci - entists .

		Some of them , no doubt , had the in - stinctive craving for power `` subdued to patience , industry , and philanthropy . ''

		But in science all is not of the colorlessness of a five o'clock tea .

		Personalities will assert themselves , and the clash of their individual temperaments and antagonistic world-views in scientific controversy is as fascinat - ing as any phenomenon in human society .

		These , however , are minor matters .

		There can be little question that Professor
Libby	PERSON	has rendered a capi - tal service to the American public .

		No subject is so well adapted to bridge the gulf between techni - cal knowledge and the humanities as the history of science .

		The growing necessity for studies in this branch of knowledge has been clamorously voiced by professional scientists during the last year or two .

		Their demands are paralleled by the needs of the laity who seek light as to the place of science in modern culture and who will be able to get their first bearings with the aid of Pro- fessor
Libby	PERSON	's primer .

		SEVEN YEARS IN

Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Court gossip from
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Vienna	LOCATION	has been rather plentifully supplied to the world in the
last two years and a half	DATE	.

		The anonymous writer of `` Seven Years in
Vienna	LOCATION	'' is described as an Eng - lish resident of the Austrian capital , and what he or she has to say of the inner workings of gov - ernment machinery is entertaining enough , but unsupported by any basis of authority .

		Emphasis is laid upon the late Emperor 's dislike of the murdered Archduke and his wife , and it is strongly insinuated that the
Sarajevo	LOCATION	crime was planned , not in
Servia	LOCATION	or
Bosnia	LOCATION	, but in
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		The array of circumstantial evidence in the case forms the most notable chapter in the book , which other - wise is largely devoted to sketches of character and summaries of recent events rendered impor - tant by the war .

New York	LOCATION	, for a sum said to exceed
$ 1,000,000	MONEY	.

		It comprises upwards of
4400	DATE	volumes of printed books , bound tracts and pamphlets , eighteenth cen - tury plays , civil war newspapers , proclamations and broadsides , 200 illuminated and other manu - scripts , and from
8000	DATE	to 10,000 historical docu - ments and autograph letters .

		This constitutes the whole of the
Bridgewater	LOCATION	library with the excep - tion of a certain number of books of no commercial value , and a few issues mainly or entirely of fam - ily interest .

		The library came to this country on several steamships that braved the peril of submarines .

		It was packed in 101 cases , and was the most ex - tensive shipment of literary material ever trans - ported over seas .

		A large number of the books and manuscripts will pass into the possession of
Henry E. Huntington	PERSON	, who now takes rank as the foremost collector of rare books in the world .

		Great historical interest is attached to the foun - dation of this library .

		It owes its origin to the books and manuscripts collected by Sir
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	,
Baron Ellesmere	PERSON	and
Viscount Brackley	PERSON	, who was Solicitor and Attorney General , 1581-94 , Master of the Rolls , 1594-96 , and Lord Chancellor to Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	and to King James I ; by his son ,
John	PERSON	, first
Earl	PERSON	of
Bridgewater	LOCATION	, and by his grandson ,
John	PERSON	, the second
Earl	PERSON	.

		Additions have also been made by subsequent noble owners , and especially by
Francis Egerton	PERSON	, first Earl of Elles - mere , who died in
1857	DATE	.

		Some of the original books came into the library through
Frances	PERSON	, the wife of the first
Earl	PERSON	of
Bridgewater	LOCATION	, who , as co-heiress of
Ferdinand	ORGANIZATION	,
Earl of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, appears to have received two or three hundred books as a part of her inheritance .

		Lord Chancellor
Egerton	PERSON	, his son , and grandson were men of scholarly at - tainments and lovers of literature , and may be reckoned amongst the earliest known book-col - lectors in
England	LOCATION	.

		Many of the books appear to have been acquired by gift from their authors and from other noteworthy persons .

		The library is especially rich in English manuscripts from the thirteenth century onward .

		Lord Chancellor
Egerton	PERSON	obtained a gift of the possessions of the
Monastery of Ashridge	ORGANIZATION	, which included several manuscripts .

		Perhaps the most notable item in the library is `` The Canterbury Tales , '' or the `` Ellesmere Chaucer . ''

		This is an illuminated manuscript writ - ten in large gothic characters on 232 leaves of vellum .

		Large ornamental letters appear at the commencement of each `` Tale '' and elsewhere , to the total number of seventy .

		In addition to the decoration there are curious drawings , in colors heightened with gold , of twenty-three of the Can - terbury Pilgrims .

		On the verso of folio 159 ap - pears a portrait of Chaucer himself in a hooded cloak and mounted on a horse .

		At the end of the volume is a copy in a contemporary hand of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's `` Balade of Truth . ''

		At the beginning , in a later hand , are written two poems which were erroneously attributed to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	.

		With the possible exception of
John Milton	PERSON	's autograph manuscripts in the library of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, this manuscript is unquestionably the greatest monument of English literature in the world .

		It appears to have been in the possession of the
Bridgewater	LOCATION	and
Ellesmere	LOCATION	families for two hundred years .

		Professor
W. W. Skeat	PERSON	used the text of this manuscript as the basis of his edition of `` The Canterbury Tales '' in the `` Complete Works of Chaucer , '' and says in his Introduction that it is `` the finest and best of all the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		now extant ... It not only gives good lines and good sense , but is also -LRB- usually -RRB- grammatically accurate and thoroughly well spelt ... This splendid MS. has also the great merit of being complete , requiring no supplement from any other source , except in the few cases where a line or two has been missed . ''

		The manuscript is undated .

		It was certainly written after
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's death in
1400	DATE	, but not more than a few years later , possibly
1405	DATE	.

		Other manuscripts , almost equally interesting , if not so valuable , include
John Gower	PERSON	's `` Confessio Amantis , '' early fifteenth century manuscript il - luminated ;
Lydgate	PERSON	's translations of `` La Danse Macabre '' and `` De Regimine Principum , '' four - teenth century ; copies of
Magna Carta	ORGANIZATION	, thirteenth and fifteenth centuries ; `` Speculum
Juris Canon	PERSON	- ici , '' fourteenth century , illuminated ; Psalter in
Latin	LOCATION	, fourteenth century , richly illuminated ; `` Statute Forestarum , ''

King Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	, dedicated to Prince
Henry	PERSON	, afterward
King Henry	ORGANIZATION	V ; `` Biblia Vulgata , '' fourteenth cen - tury , decorated ; `` Liber Sanctorum , '' 1380 ;
Missal	LOCATION	, with musical notes , fourteenth century ; `` Modus sive forma Regum et Reginarum Coronationis in Regno Angliae , '' fourteenth century ; several her - aldic manuscripts with arms emblazoned ; `` The Book of Garnsey '' -LRB-
Guernsey	LOCATION	-RRB- 1580-87 ;
John Penry	PERSON	's `` Journal , ''
1592	DATE	; volume of examinations of Recusants , time of
Henry VIII	PERSON	;
Francis Thynne	PERSON	's `` Animadversions on Speght 's Chaucer , ''
1598	DATE	;
Thomas Middleton	PERSON	's `` Game at
Chesse	LOCATION	, '' for which the author was imprisoned in
1624	DATE	; J. Mar - ston 's `` Mask , '' presented to
Alice	PERSON	,
Countess Dow	ORGANIZATION	- ager of Derby , in the author 's autograph ; poems in the autograph of
John Donne	PERSON	, and `` Olympian Catastrophe '' by Sir
A. Gorges	PERSON	,
1612	DATE	.

		There are also a richly illuminated French `` Book of Hours , '' fifteenth century , on vellum ; a collection of decor - ated miniatures from Venetian `` Ducali '' of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , and
Johannis Hispani	PERSON	`` Flos Decretorum , '' fifteenth century - , il - luminated on vellum .

		Of considerable dramatic and general interest is the collection of plays in manuscript formed by
John Larpent	PERSON	, who in
1778	DATE	became Inspector of Plays under the Lord
Chamberlain	PERSON	.

		The collec -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 489 tion comprises upwards of
2000	DATE	separate plays , the original drafts sent to the Lord
Chamberlain	PERSON	for inspection before the license to play `` should be granted . ''

		About 120 authors are represented , including
David Garrick	PERSON	, the Sheridans ,
James Lacy	PERSON	, the
Kembles	LOCATION	,
Thomas Dibdin	PERSON	,
H. Siddons	PERSON	,
George Colman	PERSON	and his son , and
John Dryden	PERSON	.

		In most cases a letter , signed by the author or authors , accompanies each play , stating where and when it is to be produced .

		There are legal and general papers of Sir
Thomas Egerton	PERSON	, documents of the first three
Earls	PERSON	of
Bridgewater	LOCATION	, papers of the family of the
Earls of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, manuscripts referring to topographical matters , and a series of letters and documents of the third Earl of Bridge - water , 1646-1701 , who was Colonial Secretary , re - lating to
America	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		Besides the first four folio editions of Shake - speare 's plays and his quartos , which include the very scarce `` Titus Andronicus , ''
1600	DATE	, of which only one other copy is known , there are a large number of plays which influenced Shakespeare or became the foundation of his own plays .

		Among these are `` Taming of the Shrew , ''
1596	DATE	; `` Jacke Drum 's Entertainment , ''
1601	DATE	; ``
Knacke	PERSON	to Knowe an honest man , ''
1596	DATE	; `` Raigne of King
Edward III	PERSON	, ''

		All these plays are bound in separate vol - umes , and generally speaking their condition is much better than was the case with the
Devonshire Quartos	ORGANIZATION	.

		A valuable and interesting adjunct to the Shakespearean collection is the extra-illustrated edition of
Steevens	PERSON	's `` Dramatic Works of Shake - speare , '' extended to 44 large folio volumes .

John E. Bob	PERSON	- NOTES AND NEWS .

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 534 537 539 CASUAL , COMMENT SOME CHANGES LIKELY TO BE WROUGHT IN ENGLISH EDUCATION BY THE GREAT WAR are foreshadowed by
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	in the `` Educational Review . ''

		Continental boys and girls , he says , work a great deal harder than English ones and demand less amuse - ment .

		Pleasure , in fact , simply occupies too large a place in the English scheme of life : `` We want this spirit changed ; we want a better husbanding of our vital pow - ers . ''

		He calls too for a number of concrete and definite educational reforms : smaller classes and a more personal treatment in elementary school ; better buildings ; better teachers , with a backing of culture and a real love for their work ; differentiation of teach - ing , so that `` both the scientific and the humanistic needs of the country may be sup - plied '' ; and supervision and help , after school is left , whether through continuation-classes or clubs .

		A few other things might have been added as necessary steps in
England	LOCATION	's renova - tion : a higher regard for the `` things of the mind , '' as
George Gissing	PERSON	put it ; a lessened contempt for science and its devotees ; and a general social readjustment which should in - duce a greater respect for the teacher and his work .

		THE ESCAPE OF THE WAR CORRESPONDENT FROM THE WILES OF
GERMANY	LOCATION	will Sometime constitute one of the interesting , if minor , chapters in the record of the Great War .

		Too many of these men even some possessed of good Anglo-Saxon or Anglo-Irish names al - lowed Prussian officialdom to have its own way with them .

		Carefully shepherded , they went hither and yon , seeing what ` they were told to see , hearing what they were told to hear , catching their color , like chameleons , from their environment , and all the time as completely soaked in their surroundings as a fish in water .

		Even the best of them , though in possession of their faculties and senses , were obliged to seem complaisant , in order that their functioning as correspondents might continue .

		The very violence of reac - tion , as evidenced by printed matter now com - ing from men of this latter type , proves the calculating pressure to which they were sub - jected .

		This reaction is shown nowhere more markedly than in the case of
Carl W. Acker	PERSON	- man , representative in
Germany	LOCATION	of the
United 506 THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 14	DATE	Press for the last two years .

		He , in the recent phrase of ex-Ambassador
Gerard	PERSON	, remained a true American in spite of all the blandish - ments and temptations of
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Ack	PERSON	- erman 's book , announced for this month , has no less a title than ``
Germany	LOCATION	, the Next Re - public . ''

		Not every reader will see so far and so optimistically as Mr.
Ackerman	PERSON	; but many a one will be prompted to wonder whether
James O'Donnell Bennett	PERSON	or Dr.
William Bayard Hale	PERSON	could ever become capable of throwing so grandly about himself the wide cloak of gallant prophecy .

		POEMS WRITTEN FOR ADVERTISING PURPOSES are sometimes good , but poems that are adapt - able to advertising purposes may be even bet - ter .

		A young English writer , pausing before a grocer 's window , has lately produced some couplets which might never have been achieved by the mere fabricator ad hoc .

		Soap to keep us pure and white may indeed be within the reach of the hack ; but its companion-line , Candles , the slim sons of light , is beyond the range of anyone save a born poet , functioning for poetry 's own sake .

		An - other couplet again brackets happily the defi - nite and the inspired : Eggs , fresh within and white without , Cocoa , of origin devout , thus at once depicting `` hen fruit '' that looks and tastes as it ought and setting forth the morning 's beverage with a backing of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	trustworthiness .

		If so slight a bit of verse can yield so much for one branch of trade , what might not `` Bartlett '' or some good con - cordance yield for another ?

		THE POTENCY OF THE PRINTED WORD AS A MEANS TO FAME becomes more and more ap - parent as the months of war go on .

		The man who is marked for memory is the man who goes `` on record '' the man who comes to be imbedded in his nation 's literature .

		It is the literary soldier who is likely except in cases of conspicuous , supreme leadership to get , with whatever degree of justice , the inside track ; and if , as is commonly the case , the fighter with a gift for literary expression is companied and survived by friends of his own tastes and affiliations , he is likely to keep it .

		One recalls with difficulty the name of the commander under whom Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	or
Theodore Korner	PERSON	may have served ; yet these two gallant spirits survive perpetually in the anthologies .

		It is likely enough that , generations hence , the name of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	, with a page or two of his verse , may suffi - ciently sum up for
England	LOCATION	the heroism of the present hard years .

		Heroism unrecorded however poignant , however deserving flies down the wind .

		The `` Poems '' of
Alan Seeger	PERSON	are now followed by his `` Letters and Diary . ''

		The `` Letters from
France	LOCATION	'' of
Victor Chap	PERSON	- man , first of American aviators to fall in foreign service , are lately published , with a memoir by his father ,
John Jay Chapman	PERSON	, the
Atlantic	LOCATION	essayist .

		All this mechanism of pious care works as it should .

		Yet one somehow in - dulges a faint feeling that literary fame , in war time , is always slightly factitious and often somewhat unjust ; and a thought must go out for the thousands who died no less bravely , yet who , because inarticulate , can hope for no enduring memorials in the gen - eral mind and eye .

		THE PROPENSITY OF FACT TO LOOK LIKE
FIC	ORGANIZATION	- TION continues to plague the artist in many fields .

		A prominent `` producer '' in the mov - ing-picture world has been complaining that people at the serious junctures of real life seldom act in a way that the films can use convincingly .

		They do not express joy as they ought to ; nor sorrow , nor hate , nor ter - ror .

		A hospital patient , told that he is soon to die , may express his feelings with a general inexpressiveness that is utterly malapropos and unserviceable .

		Worse yet , the doctor him - self does not know how to tell his patient his coming fate .

		Consequently , the registration of emotion , if it is to be caught quickly by an ordinary , casual audience , must be convention - alized , standardized .

		A similar difficulty sometimes meets the author who makes up a book out of novel material .

		The manuscript - wise may say to him , `` Your facts are fancies . ''

		For example , a Canadian government em - ployee , going about collecting Canadian folk-tales for official publication , and doubtless realizing how completely such material , if published on such a plan , might be buried in government archives , obtained permission to use a certain number of the tales separately in a book of his own .

		But a
New York	LOCATION	`` reader '' declared that his stories were works of imag - ination and not genuine folk-tales .

		This drove their compiler to
London	LOCATION	.

		Here another reader declared that - , novel and curious and fascinating as they were , no one but a genius of the first rank could have `` invented '' them , and that , as no such genius existed , the tales were doubtless what they purported to be .

		On such derogatory grounds as these an agree - ment was reached .

		It would be well if the discordant claims of fact and of fiction , in whatever field they crop out , could be settled with less pain to amour-propre .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 507 The Art of
Theodore Dreiser Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	has had the good fortune to evoke a peculiar quality of pugnacious in - terest among the younger American intelli - gentsia such as has been the lot of almost nobody else writing to-day unless it be Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	.

		We do not usually take lit - erature seriously .

		enough to quarrel over it .

		Or else we take it so seriously that we ur - banely avoid squabbles .

		Certainly there are none of the vendettas that rage in a culture like that of
France	LOCATION	.

		But Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	seems to have made himself , particularly since the suppression of `` The ` Genius , ' '' a veritable issue .

		Interesting and surprising are the reactions to him .


Edgar Lee Masters	ORGANIZATION	makes him a `` soul-enrapt demi-urge , walking the earth , stalking life '' ;
Harris Merton Lyon	PERSON	saw in him a `` seer of inscrutable mien '' ;
Arthur Davison Ficke	PERSON	sees him as master of a passing throng of figures , `` labored with immortal illu - sion , the terrible and beautiful , cruel and wonder-laden illusion of life '' ; Mr.
Powys	PERSON	makes him an epic philosopher of the `` life - tide '' ;
H. L. Mencken	PERSON	puts him ahead of Con - rad , with `` an agnosticism that has almost passed beyond curiosity . ''

		On the other hand , an unhappy critic in the `` Nation '' last year gave Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	his place for all time in a neat antithesis between the realism that was based on a theory of human conduct and the naturalism that reduced life to a mere animal behavior .

		For
Dreiser	PERSON	this last special hell was reserved , and the jungle-like and simian activities of his characters rather ex - haustively outlined .

		At the time this anti- thesis looked silly .

		With the appearance of Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's latest book , `` A Hoosier Holi - day , '' it becomes nonsensical .

		For that wise and delightful book reveals him as a very hu - man critic of very common human life , ro - mantically sensual and poetically realistic , with an artist 's vision and a thick , warm feel - ing for American life .

		This book gives the clue to Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	, to his insatiable curiosity about people , about their sexual inclinations , about their dreams , about the homely qualities that make them American .

		His memories give a picture of the floundering young American that is so typical as to be almost epic .

		No one has ever pictured this lower middle-class American life so winningly , because no one has had the necessary literary skill with the lack of self - consciousness .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	is often sentimen - tal , but it is a sentimentality that captivates you with its candor .

		You are seeing this vacuous , wistful , spiritually rootless , mid - dle-Western life through the eyes of a nai 've but very wise boy .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	seems queer only because he has carried along his youthful attitude in unbroken continuity .

		He is fas - cinated with sex because youth is usually ob - sessed with sex .

		He puzzles about the universe because youth usually puzzles .

		He thrills to crudity and violence because sensitive youth usually recoils from the savagery of the in - dustrial world .

		Imagine incorrigible , sensuous youth endowed with the brooding skepticism of the philosopher who feels the vanity of life , and you have the paradox of Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	.

		For these two attitudes in him support rather than oppose each other .

		His spiritual evolu - tion was out of a pious , ascetic atmosphere into intellectual and personal freedom .

		He seems to have found himself without losing himself .

		Of how many American writers can this be said ?

		And for this much shall be for - given him , his slovenliness of style , his lack of nuances , his apathy to the finer shades of beauty , his weakness for the mystical and the vague .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	suggests the over-sensitive temperament that protects itself by an ad - miration for crudity and cruelty .

		His latest book reveals the boyhood shyness and timidity of this
Don Juan	PERSON	of novelists .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	is complicated , but he is complicated in a very understandable American way , the product of the uncouth forces of small-town life and the vast disorganization of the wider American world .

		As he reveals himself , it is a revelation of a certain broad level of the American soul .

		Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	seems uncommon only because he is more nai 've than most of us .

		It is not so much that he swarms his pages with sexful figures as that he rescues sex for the scheme of personal life .

		He feels a holy mission to slay the American literary superstition that men and women are not sensual beings .

		But 508 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	he does not brush this fact in the sniggering way of the popular magazines .

		He takes it very seriously , so much so that some of his novels become caricatures of desire .

		It is , however , a misfortune that it has been Brieux and Freud and not native
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	who soaked the sexual imagination of the younger American intelligentsia .

		It would have been far healthier to have absorbed Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's literary treatment of sex than to have gone hysterical over its pathology .

		Sex has little significance unless it is treated in personally artistic , novelistic terms .

		The American tradition had tabooed the treatment of those infinite gradations and complexities of love that fill the literary imagination of a sensitive people .

		When curiosity got too strong and reticence was repealed in
America	LOCATION	, we had no means of articulating ourselves except in a deplorable pseudo-scientific jargon that has no more to do with the relevance of sex than the chemical composition of orange paint has to do with the artist 's vision .


Dreiser	PERSON	has done a real service to the Amer - ican imagination in despising the underworld and going gravely to the business of picturing sex as it is lived in the personal relations of bungling , wistful , or masterful men and women .

		He seemed strange and rowdy only because he made sex human , and American tradition had never made it human .

		It had only made it either sacred or vulgar , and when these categories no longer worked , we fell under the dubious and perverting magic of the psycho-analysts .

		In spite of his looseness of literary gait and heaviness of style
Dreiser	PERSON	seems a sincere groper after beauty .

		It is natural enough that this should so largely be the beauty of sex .

		For where would a sensitive boy , brought up in
Indiana	LOCATION	and in the big American cities , get beauty expressed for him except in women ?

		What does mid -
Western America	LOCATION	offer to the starving except its personal beauty ?

		A few landscapes , an occasional pic - ture in a museum , a book of verse perhaps !

		Would not all the rest be one long , flaunting offense of ugliness and depression ?

		`` The ' Genius , ' '' instead of being that mass of por - nographic horror which the Vice Societies repute it to be , is the story of a groping artist whose love of beauty runs obsessingly upon the charm of girlhood .

		Through different so - cial planes , through business and manual labor and the feverish world of artists , he pur - sues this lure .

		Dreiser is refreshing in his air of the moral democrat , who sees life impas - sively , neither praising nor blaming , at the same time that he realizes how much more terrible and beautiful and incalculable life is than any of us are willing to admit .

		It may be all apologia , but it comes with the grave air of a mind that wants us to understand just how it all happened .

		`` Sister Carrie '' will al - ways retain the fresh charm of a spontaneous working-out of mediocre , and yet elemental and significant , lives .

		A good novelist catches hold of the thread of human desire .

		Dreiser does this , and that is why his admirers for - give him so many faults .

		If you like to speculate about personal and literary qualities that are specifically Amer - ican ,
Dreiser	PERSON	should be as interesting as any one now writing in
America	LOCATION	.

		This becomes clearer as he writes more about his youth .

		His hopelessly unorientated , half-educated , boy - hood is so typical of the uncritical and care - less society in which wistful American talent has had to grope .

		He had to be spiritually a self-made man , work out a philosophy of life , discover his own sincerity .

		Talent in Amer - ica outside of the ruling class flowers very late , because it takes so long to find its bear - ings .

		It has had almost to create its own soil , before it could put in its roots and grow .

		It is born shivering into an inhospitable and irrelevant group .

		It has to find its own kind of people and piece together its links of com - prehension .

		It is a gruelling and tedious task , but those who come through it con - tribute , like
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	, creative work that is both novel and indigenous .

		The process can be more easily traced in
Dreiser	PERSON	than in almost anybody else .

		`` A Hoosier Holiday '' not only traces the personal process , but it gives the social background .

		The com - mon life , as seen throughout the countryside , is touched off quizzically , and yet sympathet - ically , with an artist 's vision .

		Dreiser sees the American masses in their commonness and at their pleasure as brisk , rather vacuous people , a little pathetic in their innocence of the possibilities of life and their optimistic trustfulness .

		He sees them ruled by great
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 509 barons of industry , and yet unconscious of their serfdom .

		He seems to love this coun - tryside , and he makes you love it .

		Dreiser loves , too , the ugly violent bursts of American industry , the flaming steel-mills and gaunt lakesides .

		`` The Titan '' and `` The Financier '' are unattractive novels , but they are human documents of the brawn of a pass - ing American era .

		Those stenographic con - versations , webs of financial intrigue , bare bones of enterprise , insult our artistic sense .

		There is too much raw beef , and yet it all has the taste and smell of the primitive busi - ness-jungle it deals with .

		These crude and greedy captains of finance with their wars and their amours had to be given some kind of literary embodiment , and
Dreiser	PERSON	has ham - mered a sort of raw epic out of their lives .

		It is not only his feeling for these themes of crude power and sex and the American common life that makes
Dreiser	PERSON	interesting .

		His emphases are those of a new
America	LOCATION	which is latently expressive and which must develop its art before we shall really have become articulate .

		For
Dreiser	PERSON	is a true hyphenate , a product of that conglomerate Americanism that springs from other roots than the English tradition .

		Do we realize how rare it is to find a talent that is thor - oughly American and wholly un-English ?

		Culturally we have somehow suppressed the hyphenate .

		Only recently has he forced his way through the unofficial literary censorship .

		The vers-librists teem with him , but
Dreiser	PERSON	is almost the first to achieve a largeness of utterance .

		His outlook , it is true , flouts the American canons of optimism and redemption , but these were never anything but conven - tions .

		There stirs in
Dreiser	PERSON	's books a new American quality .

		It is not at all German .

		It is an authentic attempt to make something artistic out of the chaotic materials that lie around us in American life .

		Dreiser inter - ests because we can watch him grope and feel his clumsiness .

		He has the artist 's vision without the sureness of the artist 's technique .

		That is one of the tragedies of
America	LOCATION	.

		But his faults are those of his material and of uncouth bulk , and not of shoddiness .

		He ex - presses an
America	LOCATION	that is in process of form - ing .

		The interest he evokes is part of the eager interest we feel in that growth .

BOURNE	ORGANIZATION	.

		A Cosmopolitan Poet
Ruben Dario	PERSON	died on the 6th of
February , 1916	DATE	, at the age of forty-nine .

		He had earned an undisputed title as the most famous
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- tilian poet of his day , the leader of the younger generation of writers in every sty - listic innovation .

		He was a Nicaraguan , and therein lies the marvel of his power over Span - ish letters .

		Never before has a Spanish - American ben the fugleman of a literary overturn in
Spain	LOCATION	, as
Dario	PERSON	was the originator of modernism .

		His personal victory over continental indifference and superiority would have been less notable had he issued from
Argentina	LOCATION	,
Chile	LOCATION	, or
Colombia	LOCATION	, the recog - nized centres of Spanish-American culture .

		Tiny , feud-torn
Nicaragua	LOCATION	could lend him no prestige .

		Modernism is a term used in
Spain	LOCATION	to de - note a movement in its world of letters which began there not long before the disaster of
1898	DATE	, and still continues to develop .

		It is not easy to define , since nebulosity is one of its aims .

		But
Dario	PERSON	, who was engagingly frank in his self-criticism , discloses without reserve his own literary ancestry , and with it that of the school .

		The lineage is almost wholly French .


Victor Hugo	PERSON	was
Dario	PERSON	's greatest object of admiration , both early and late .

		Next to him came
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	and
Verlaine	PERSON	; then
Leconte	PERSON	de
Lisle	LOCATION	,
Heredia	PERSON	, and lesser men , such as
Banville	LOCATION	,
Moreas	LOCATION	, Vil - liers ,
Armand Silvestre	PERSON	, and , in prose , Daudet and
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	.

		Poe and
Walt Whitman	PERSON	were often on his lips .

		Juan Valera commented with amazement upon the Parisian spirit of `` Azul , '' published at
Valparaiso	LOCATION	,
Chile	LOCATION	, in
1888	DATE	.

		`` None of the men of the peninsula who have had the most cosmopolitan spirit , '' said he , `` who have lived longest in
France	LOCATION	and who speak French and other languages the best , has ever seemed to me so steeped in the French spirit as
Dario	PERSON	. ''

		This , of a youth of twenty-one who had never left Central Amer - ica except to go to
Chile	LOCATION	!

		And underlying the French culture was classical training of a thoroughness which , in this country , has passed into a legendary state .

		Nearly every line
Dario	PERSON	wrote testifies to his familiarity with Greek and Latin mythology , metre , and art .

		Evidently , in the eighties , Leon of
Nicaragua	LOCATION	possessed real teachers of the hu - manities .

		Modernism , then , is nothing but a blend of romanticism , the
Parnassus	LOCATION	, symbolism , vers librism , and any other recent French isms .

		The surprising thing is that none of the cur - rents posterior to le Parnasse had been able to cross the Pyrenees directly .

		It remained 510 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	for
Dario	PERSON	, in his corner of the
New World	LOCATION	, to catch the different strands , weave them into a single cord , and ship his wares back across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the cradle of his race , there to create a sensation and a school .


Dario	PERSON	and his followers say , with justice , that they have renewed Spanish poetry , freed it from age-old shackles .

		It is invariably the formal , metrical side of their achievement that they stress .

		`` I applied to the
Castiliaii	PERSON	tongue verbal advantages of other languages , '' says
Dario	PERSON	.

		`` Attention to inner melody , which contributes to the success of rhythmic expression ; novelty in adjectives , study of the historical meaning of each word , use of a discreet erudition , lexicographic aristocracy , were my aims ... I think I have struck a new note in the orchestration of the octo - syllable . ''

		`` I flexibilized , '' he says again , with his customary neologism , `` the hendecasy liable to its utmost . ''

		He was , indeed , an indefatig - able experimenter with rhymes and rhythms , but one must not forget that he never dis - carded a system till he had become proficient in it , and that his daring innovations sprang consciously from supreme technical skill , from a minute understanding of the intricacies of metrics , ancient and modern .

		He was not trying , like a cubist painter or some poets of the day , to escape the bonds of rules that he had not patience to master .

		It is noteworthy that , in spite of the liberty he preached , he was not a vers librist , except in occasional unimportant poems .

		His anarchy developed within the limits of rhyme and syllable-count .

		It is not likely that his more extreme licenses , such as enjambement with a pendant definite article , will remain in the language .

		As might be expected in view of its origins ,
Dario	PERSON	's art is more French than Spanish .

		Not that he was unpatriotic or neglectful of the glories of his race .

		He was intensely loyal to his native tropics always and did not share the antipathy for
Spain	LOCATION	that many Spanish - Americans harbor .

		He came to love her national history and ancient honors .

		But the spirit of his art was quite unlike what we are accustomed to consider Castilian .

		To be sure , it may be all the more universal art for that .

		The savor of Spanish soil is so strong that , undiluted , it appears not to be much relished away from home .


Dario	PERSON	was un-Spanish , first , in the meticu - lous polish of his verse .

		`` Slap-dash methods and indifference to form , '' says
Fitzmaurice	PERSON	-
Kelly	PERSON	, `` are characteristic of the greatest Spaniards . ''

		The impeccable choice of words , the sapient harmony of line , the alliteration , the silvery combinations of vocables , the in - spired placing of the caesura , all these qual - ities , dropping at times into mannerism and preciosity , are something new in Spanish poetry .

		One must go back to
Luis de Leon	LOCATION	and
Gongora	PERSON	to find anything resembling it , and then remotely .

		He is un-Spanish in the lack of that sono - rous , mouth-filling rhetoric which impresses any reader of Castilian lyrics .

		Dario worked for lightness , freedom , and delicacy , and to that end substituted short words for long as much as possible .

		He is un-Spanish , too , in his lack of realism .

		Like many another poet who worked hard for a living , he put into his verse as little as possible of the sordid side of his life .

		To him his art meant an oppor - tunity to retire into an ideal world , `` within an ivory tower , '' as he put it , to regale himself with the joy of creation in a realm of dreams and illusions .

		Even in his erotic poetry , much of it a veritable hymn to Pan , the divinity of sex , the fundamental idea is clad in such a magical veil of imagery and mythology that it is incapable of offending .

		The great ex - cesses of his own life found only an idealized echo in his verse .

		He was a robust , full - blooded product of the tropics , having prob - ably a slight admixture of Indian blood , but such was the aristocracy of his intellect that , he would no more have soiled a blank sheet with slops than he would have cheapened it with rhyme-tags .

		I am speaking , naturally , of
Dario	PERSON	in his prime , the
Dario	PERSON	of `` Azul , '' `` Prosas Prof anas , '' and `` Cantos de Vida y Esperanza . ''

		Lastly ,
Dario	PERSON	is un-Spanish in his vacillat - ing religious faith .

		Every critic recognizes the duality of his nature , the `` cosmic sen - sualism '' of his pantheistic mythology , par - alleled or contradicted by yearnings toward revealed religion .

		Dario himself affirmed that he was `` a Christian if not a Catholic , '' and some of his admirers have tried to claim him for the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, but it is indubitable that paganism was the essence of his soul , while his faith was hesitating and frail .

		Repeat - edly , in both prose and verse , he describes the horror of death , a purely physical fear of annihilation , that beset him from his earliest years : `` in my desolation , '' he says , `` I have rushed to God as a refuge , I have seized prayer as a parachute . ''

		So he prayed : Jesus , sower of wheat , grant me the tender bread of thy hostia ; grant me salvation from hell , that yawns for the rage and the lusts of an ancient offender .

		Tell me the terrible horror of death that pursues me is naught but illusion , the wraith of unspeakable sin ; that dying means only a flood of new light to suffuse me , that then thou wilt say to me `` Eaise thee , and enter in . ''

		This is not the ardent faith of a convinced
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 511 Christian ;
St. Theresa	LOCATION	and
John	PERSON	of the
Cross	ORGANIZATION	would not recognize it as kin to their own .

		In fact , it bears a curious inverse resemblance to some recent remarks of
Miguel de Unamuno	ORGANIZATION	, the celebrated free lance of
the University of Salamanca	ORGANIZATION	.

		To an interviewer he said : `` I am very much afraid of certain things , and especially of dying . ''

		And in the same breath he added , in response to a ques - tion concerning his religious belief : `` Here in
Spain	LOCATION	even we atheists are Catholics . ''

		The sentiments of
Dario	PERSON	are not separated from those of Unamuno by any such chasm as parts both from the rapturous yearning for death so often expressed by the true Span - ish mystics .

		Nor did
Dario	PERSON	possess the equally Spanish courage of consistent mate - rialism .

		He was bold toward the world , but timid toward himself .

		His lyrics are the quintessence of pantheism , and yet he could snatch at prayer as a parachute .

		A like fluctuation is apparent in his poetry .

		His protean nature is the hardest in the world to pin a label to .

		Usually he is dubbed an apostle of imprecision , a translator of delicate nuances of mood into lines shaded with equal delicacy .

		He is , very often , that kind of Verlainian .

		Take as an example the opening stanzas of the well-known `` Era un Aire Suave ... '' There came a gentle breeze in tardy whirls , the fairy Harmony took rhythmic flight ; a cello sobbed in cadence ; sighs of girls and whispers floated outward , vague and light .

		Upon the terrace , where the boughs hang near , you would have said that , when the silk attire caressed the white magnolias , you could hear a tremolo from some seolian lyre .

		But that sort of thing is really untranslatable , of course .

		The charm is too closely linked to the form .

		No sooner have you decided that
Dario	PERSON	stands for nothing else than this , when , at some turn of a leaf , you come upon a son - net of robust contour , firmly imagined and strongly chiselled , an ode of frosty brilliance , a martial and aggressive polemic .

		He is often assumed to be a pure aesthete , but he gives proof of clear reasoning and exactness , when he wishes .

		Now a pagan lover of fleshly beauty , at times he dallies with a wholly sen - suous Christian mysticism ; again , he is over - come by a sense of the futility of life .

		His one constant trait is the worship of art for art 's sake , of the rare and delicate in every man - ifestation .

		Somewhere in his work there is meat for every taste .

		Is this the dilettantism of a roving assimilator ?

		Is it rather the full many-sidedness of genius ?

		I incline to the latter hypothesis .

		It is early to declare with the novelist Valle-Inclan , in a boutade meant perhaps only to startle the bourgeois , that `` all Spanish poetry may be reduced to two names ,
Jorge Manrique	PERSON	and
Dario	PERSON	. ''

		It is early even to boast , with a French critic , that ``
Dario	PERSON	had a hand in the funeral of
Nunez de Arce	ORGANIZATION	and all that his art represents . ''

		The world of letters is probably not ready to discard for - ever , in favor of modernism , the poetry of definite ideas .

		What can not be denied is that
Dario	PERSON	, single-handed , initiated a movement in
Spain	LOCATION	that affects to-day nearly every branch of literary art ; that he renovated the tech - nique of both poetry and prose ; that he made his own many diverse styles ; and that his verse is often so inevitable as to touch the finality of art .

		He was a real leader who could write : `` I am not an iconoclast .

		The time lost in destroying is always needed for creation . ''

		COMMUNICATIONS IGNORING THE QUESTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The criticism of
Willard Huntington Wright	PERSON	's `` Misinforming a Nation '' which appeared in your issue of
May	DATE	31st may be recommended to teachers of logic who are on the lookout for living ex - amples to illustrate the common fallacy known as Ignoring the Question .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's book is intended to show that the
Encyclopaedia Britan	LOCATION	- nica is a British book ; that it is unfair , all along the line , to other countries , especially to
America	LOCATION	.

		It is based , as the critic , Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	, confesses , upon wide knowledge and careful research , and considerable evidence is offered in its pages for the author 's contention .

		Does Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	meet the argument squarely in his unfavorable review ?

		Does he show that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is in error ?

		If he does , I quite over - looked the place .

		He makes fun of Mr.
Wright	PERSON	as a slashing , dashing , up-to-the-minute modern ; he suggests that the present edition of the
Britan	LOCATION	- nica is an improvement upon earlier editions ; he tells us something about the feelings with which he reads the book ; but he consistently avoids the issue .

		Personally , I am glad to know of Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's attitude toward contemporary life , and am encouraged to learn of the improvement in the
Britannica	LOCATION	.

		And I hope I am not so ungra - cious as to be uninterested in the mental and emo - tional state aroused in the critic by the reading of this `` Pamphlet against a long-established lit - erary institution . ''

		But unfortunately my mind makes no connection between these and Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's strictures .

		Perhaps Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is wrong in his belief that such men as Luther Bur - bank ,
John Dewey	PERSON	, and
Wilbur Wright	PERSON	would have found a place in an unbiased encyclopaedia .

		Per - haps there is no ground for his objection to the dismissal of
William James	PERSON	with twenty-eight lines where Sir
William Hamilton	PERSON	gets a page and 512 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14 a half	DATE	.

		Perhaps he is likewise wide of the mark in his estimate of the men of other nations .

		It is even conceivable that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	completely fails to prove that the Encyclopaedia Britannica booms
England	LOCATION	at the expense of
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, Rus - sia , and the rest .

		If so , Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	does not move a finger to show it .

		He simply smiles condescend - ingly and continues to elaborate a figure of speech in which the
Encyclopaedia	ORGANIZATION	is a wonderful sky - scraper and Mr.
Wright	PERSON	an amusing workman bent upon reducing it to debris with a pick .

		I regret that Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	could be satisfied with a superficial analysis of a criticism the truth or fallacy of which it is of considerable importance to establish .

		Perhaps the reason is to be found in the assumptions which apparently underlie his review , namely , that everything modern is ephem - eral , and that long-established institutions are sacred .

		If so , I can well understand why Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's book should get on his nerves , as he ad - mits it did , and why , rather than make a serious attempt to weigh the evidence offered by Mr.
Wright	PERSON	, he resorts to that battered shield of the defeated : `` How much finer to build than to wreck , to boost than to bang . ''

		MORE ABOUT THE SHORT STORY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Cory	PERSON	in his article `` The Senility of the Short Story '' says many things that are beside the point and many others that are bound to be puzzling to even an attentive reader .

		He declares that the short story shows signs of degeneration and senility and that one of these signs is its overwhelming popularity .

		But is not Mr.
Cory	PERSON	thinking , not of real short stories , but of Ameri - can magazine fiction a very different proposi - tion ?

		That the `` commercial short story '' is at a low level , I have already said in a previous article in THE DIAL .

		But Mr.
Cory	PERSON	seems to be aware only of this vast rubbish-heap and because of it he damns the whole art of the short story .

		But is not this like condemning painting as `` de - generate '' and `` pathological '' because of the ad - vertising posters in the magazines or on the hoardings ?

		There is nothing rarer than to find a bona fide short story in the magazines .

		When Mr.
Cory	PERSON	writes about the short story as a `` genre , '' I find it difficult to know what he means .

		For the short story is a distinct literary art like the play or the novel , and like the play and the novel it has many `` genres . ''

		For the moment some of these `` genres '' are doubtless done to death as were the eighteenth century formula for satire and the nineteenth century formula for Tenriysonian verse .

		That many are patho - logical I am prepared to admit .

		But the modern art of the short story as distinct from the maga - zine fiction industry Mr.
Cory	PERSON	does not seem to be conscious of .

		I hardly think it worth while to consider whether this latter is degenerate or senile or anything else , for it can not seriously be considered as writing at all .

		However , a thought - ful consideration of what are the defects of the modern art of the short story as represented , say , by such masters as Tchekhov or
Schnitzler	PERSON	or
Paul Heyse	PERSON	would be of great interest if Mr.
Cory	PERSON	had given it to us .

		He gives three reasons for his condemnation of the short story .

		First , because the unity is abnormally artificial and intense .

		Now what can Mr.
Cory	PERSON	mean by an `` intense '' unity ?

		As to its being artificial , the unity in any art is artificial .

		And is the unity in any good short story more abnormally artificial than the unity in any good play , poem , or novel ?

		As to his second point `` the popular habit of truncating the short story violently at the climax '' this I pass over , as it is merely a popular habit and has nothing to do with any art .

		`` Consider thirdly , '' says Mr.
Cory	PERSON	, `` the rapid action of the short story .

		Life is made to whirl by like the walls of a subway . ''

		In certain genres , no doubt , the action is rapid .

		But when he speaks of life whirling by like the walls of a subway , it is again apparent that Mr.
Cory	PERSON	's exemplars are all in magazine fiction .

		If life whirls by in this way we are reading something that ought to be dealt with in a novel or a play or some other form .

		It might be as well to state here that the material of a short story , properly speaking , can not be dealt with in any other literary form .

		Mr.
Cory	PERSON	writes : `` If a great artist would take subjects like ` Poverty , ' ` Immigration , ' ` Violence and the
Labor Movement	ORGANIZATION	' and treat them with thoroughness and eloquence in a form compounded of historical narrative and reflective essay , if he could unite in himself the dialectic of metaphysics with its concern over fundamental principles , the sense of the picturesque tempered by a sense of moral horror , an Emersonian or , better , a Fichtean fervor to edify , he would express the aspiration of the world to-day , he would be our supreme ar - tist . ''

		Why should work on these lines take the place of the short story ?

		There is no reason why both should not flourish side by side .

		As a matter of fact this Emersonian or Fichtean fervor to edify is all too common in
America	LOCATION	to-day .

		It oozes through magazine fiction , which is often really tracts on Efficiency ,
Social Service	ORGANIZATION	, and so on under fictional disguise .

		Is not Mr.
Griffith	PERSON	in his motion pictures really approaching what Mr.
Cory	PERSON	desires ?

		He has already given us `` Intol - erance . ''

		He will doubtless in time arrive at `` Immigration '' , and `` Violence and the Labor Movement . ''

		An Emersonian or Fichtean fervor to edify would be more likely to find in a great artist a satirist rather than an exponent .

		A Cervantes of the New World might find his
Don Quixote	PERSON	in one of these Emersonian or Fichtean uplifters .

		He writes : `` The short story teems to-day on our news-stands . ''

		Let me assure Mr.
Cory	PERSON	and the readers of this note with all the earnestness I can command that the short story is rarely found at all on our news-stands .

		And I really believe that if it was it would give considerable satisfaction to a goodly proportion of the reading population of this country .

		The manufactured fiction or com - mercial short story , in spite of the high price paid for it , appeals to very few of the people who for
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 513 various reasons buy the magazine .

		When he tells us that the reading of it is a mere public habit , I am heartily in agreement with Mr.
Cory	PERSON	.

		IRELAND 'S DEBT TO FOREIGN SCHOLARS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
May 17th	DATE	, Mr.
Padraic Colum	PERSON	speaks of the indebtedness of Irish language and literature to certain French , Italian , and German scholars .

		Zeuss , of course , is the great pioneer of the scientific study of Celtic philology .

		With
Zimmer	PERSON	,
Windisch	PERSON	, and
Kuno Meyer	PERSON	, however , one would have liked to see mentioned the great Ger - man authority on Old Irish ,
Rudolf Thurneysen	PERSON	.

		His exhaustive work on the Irish language of the monuments of the eighth and ninth centuries , `` Handbuch des Alt-Irischen '' -LRB-
Heidelberg	LOCATION	,
1909	DATE	-RRB- , is probably the most important single monograph yet published on Irish linguistics .

		Thurneysen 's book is at the same time one of the most admir - able specimens of philological writing that have come to my notice .

		No doubt
Zimmer	PERSON	,
Windisch	PERSON	, and
Meyer	PERSON	are better known to the Irish them - selves , as these men have occupied themselves not only with the Irish language but also with the literary monuments of the Middle Irish period .

		One further regrets Mr.
Colum	PERSON	's failure to mention the great English student of Irish ,
Whit	PERSON	- ley
Stokes	PERSON	, who ranks easily with the rest .

		In - cidentally , `` d'Arbois de Jourainville '' should be corrected to `` d'Arbois de Jubainville . ''

		SAINT-SAENS ON
WAGNER	PERSON	AND SHAKESPEARE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The letter of
M. Saint-Saens	PERSON	, which you pub - lished in your issue of
May 3	DATE	, refers to two para - graphs in my correspondence of
January 11	DATE	, where I touched upon this well-known French musician 's present excessive antipathy to Wag - ner and his rather half-hearted admiration for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		As regards the first-named genius , I may point out , perhaps , that just after the Franco-Prussian war of
1870	DATE	, Saint-Saens was a warm supporter of
Wagner	PERSON	; and in connection with his changed position to-day , one should read the article by
M. Jean Marnold	PERSON	, the music critic of the `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	, '' in the
Septem	LOCATION	- ber issue of that periodical .

		To say that
M. Marnold	ORGANIZATION	handles
M. Saint-Saens	PERSON	without gloves , is to put it very mildly .

		As regards
M. Saint-Saens	PERSON	's attitude toward
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, as expressed in his communication to the `` Renaissance , ''
M. Paul Souday	PERSON	, the lit - erary critic of the
Paris	LOCATION	`` Temps , '' got the same impression of that article as I did , as will be seen by reading
M. Souday	PERSON	's strictures in the issue of the `` Temps '' for
November 3	DATE	.

		Since my correspondence appeared in your columns , I have seen the `` Renaissance '' article , and I find that M. Saint-Saens shows therein very little enthu - siasm for the
Bard of Avon	ORGANIZATION	.

		M. Saint-Saens states that the only real grudge he has against
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and even this ap - plies more to the present-day admirers of the poet than to the poet himself , is the growing tendency in
Paris	LOCATION	to put his plays on the stage .

		Shake - speare is better in the reading than in the acting , he holds .

		Yet at the very moment when his let - ter to you was crossing the ocean ,
M. Firmin Gemier	PERSON	, one of the really great living actors of
France	LOCATION	, was making at the Theatre Antoine perhaps the hit of the season with `` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' the very play to the production of which M. Saint-Saens objects because `` it has often been given in
Paris	LOCATION	in French and Italian . ''

		And yet this new presentation is unanimously approved by the leading dramatic critics of the French capital .

		Thus , in the `` Temps '' not less than three of its regular staff write laudatory articles thereon
M. Adolphe Aderer	PERSON	in the issue of
April 25	DATE	,
M. Abel Hermant	PERSON	in that for the 27th , while
M. Adolphe Brisson	PERSON	seems to sum up all their views on
May 7	DATE	in these words : `` Shakespeare triomphe en ce moment a
Paris	LOCATION	; une sympathie voisine de 1 ` enthousiasme a accueilli la premiere representation du Marchand de Venise . ''

		The truth of the matter is that
M. Saint-Saens	PERSON	, like many of us old folk , grows more and more bitter in his judgments as he advances in years , but is evidently not aware of the fact .

		POETRY AND CRITICISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In two recent issues Mr.
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	writes , first , an arraignment of Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	as editor of an Anthology of New Poetry ; secondly , an article deploring the lack of magic in new poetry .

		It seems to me that the spirit of his first article answers the query of his second .

		The poet can not write with magic unless he himself is `` magicked . ''

		The spirit of magic in poetry is the spirit of the child-heart .

		It is the spirit of receptivity , blitheness , comradeship , laissez-faire , hope , wonder , and the always attendant wistful - ness ,
Gemiith	PERSON	.

		Magic is a stranger to bitterness and carping .

		The poets of this hour are , in general , too much concerned about each other 's development and not enough concerned with their own .

		They spend too much conversation and type in exposing the flaws they believe they find in other poets ' work and in the other poets ' mentalities ; and they expend too little thought in understanding , disciplining , and developing their own `` urge . ''

		They show a tendency to divide into little groups , partly for destructive oral and calligraphical warfare on other little groups .

		Less attention to personalities and a deeper sub - mergence of self in life would result in poetry with magic now , even as in the past .

		The first rule of every creator who has stepped out of the `` high average '' class into greatness has been `` mind your own business . ''

		514 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	Some Fundamentals of Peace AN INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF PEACE AND THE TERMS OF ITS PERPETUATION .

		By
Thorstein Veblen	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Critics of the work of Mr.
Thorstein Veb	PERSON	- len have found fault with him for treating the social problems with which he concerns himself in the impersonal and detached way in which he does .

		They have asked him to leave the rarified atmosphere of scientific dis - passionateness and Qome down into the arena , where the fighting is done , and tell us what to do about it and how to do it .

		Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	, how - ever , has persistently refused to forsake his scientific objectivity and has continued to handle society , particularly in its economic aspects , as a question to be understood rather than to become excited and inflamed over .

		If Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's critics interpret his dispas - sionateness as indifference , they have been indifferent readers of his works .

		No man who has spent a lifetime studying and describing society can be said not to care about the hu - manity of the thing which he has so in - timately made his own .

		In fact , the economic aspect of social activity is about the last field imaginable where one can rest satisfied with a mere analysis or statement of how the bug buzzes .

		Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	is interested , intensely interested , in what is to-day rather smugly called social welfare .

		That he has not felt it incumbent upon him to indulge in advice and exhortation is perhaps due , on the one hand , to the fact that he saw no particular scarcity of that commodity , and on the other , to the preconception on which his scheme of social psychology may be said to rest .

		This preconception runs to the effect that taking thought has so far not succeeded in deviating the workaday habits of any com - munity from idiotic activities or imbecile preoccupations .

		Such taking thought is only a half-hearted affair at best , surrounded as it is by the terribly heavy and intricate mass of former and present thoughts derived from the manner in which the daily work of the world is carried on .

		Since one 's habits of mind are so intimately determined by one 's habits of work , work in the large sense of the activities connected with daily living and dying , advice and exhortation would be simply in the nature of homiletic supereroga - tion , useful for the purpose of emotional dif - fusion or aesthetic complaisance .

		The situation is different in a crisis , such as the present war may be said to have pro- duced .

		The ordinary ways of living and dy - ing have been wrenched from their moorings and the ordinary habits of thought are found to be wanting in their old-time comforts and stability .

		Taking thought is conceivably more likely now to result in a way of living in accord with that thought than ever before .

		Or to put it more as Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	presents it , taking thought may result in the abolition of a part or the whole of that system of organ - ized and revered nuisances which makes up so much of our institutional scheme of mental habituation .

		For so Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	views the nature of peace and the means of its perpetuation .

		To him , peace is less in the nature of something to be established than of something not to be disturbed .

		An inquiry into the nature of peace would , therefore , reduce itself to an inquiry into the agencies calculated or not calculated to interfere with the established peace .

		Assuming that our voluble professions of pacific intentions are to be taken seriously , Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	presents a few propositions which he believes will make for peace , in case the situation at the end of the war is of a char - acter to make possible the establishment of an order opposed to disturbance of the peace .

		These propositions assume the existence of a league of nations , something on the order of the much-heralded League to
Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	.

		The propositions are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The definitive elimination of the Imperial -LRB- German -RRB- establishment , together with the monarch - ical establishments of the several states of the Em - pire and the privileged classes ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- Removal or destruction of all warlike equip - ment , military and naval , defensive and offensive ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- Cancelment of the public debt of the Em - pire and of its members creditors of the Empire being accounted accessory to the culpable enterprise of the Imperial government ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- Confiscation of such industrial equipment and resources as have contributed to the carrying on of the war , as being also accessory ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- Assumption by the league at large of all debts incurred by the Entente belligerents or by neutrals for the prosecution or by reason of the war , and distribution of the obligation so assumed im - partially among the members of the league , including the peoples of the defeated nations ; -LRB- 6 -RRB- Indemnification for all injury done to civil - ians in the invaded territories ; the means for such indemnification to be procured by confiscation of all estates in the defeated countries exceeding a certain very modest maximum , calculated on the average of property owned , say , by the poorer three-fourths of the population , the kept classes being properly ac - counted accessory to the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's culpable enter - prise .

		It will be seen at once that Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	assumes the defeat of the German Imperial power as a necessary condition for any but a German peace .

		The reason for such an as - sumption is found in the very character of any Imperial power , the tendency to war , dominion , and exploitation being its `` original THE DIAL 515 nature . ''

		As long as such an Imperial power is running around loose , there is absolutely no chance for any peace except on terms dictated by that Imperial power a Pax Ger - manica on the order and analogy of the an - cient
Pax Romana	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	discusses at length the contingency of a `` peace without honor , '' and he concludes that , while biolog - ically such a peace is no more an obstacle to useful , decent , and upright living than the system of balances of power under which we live at present , the ordinary man is alto - gether too patriotic , too much imbued with `` a sense of partisan solidarity in respect of prestige , '' to tolerate any such violent dam - age to his feelings of respect for tribal prec - edence and decorum .

		There remains a third alternative .

		If the dynastic busybodies who run the business of Imperialistic expansion by means of death and destruction can be put out of that busi - ness , if the devoted loyalty of the rank and file of Imperial subjects can ever be made amenable to a sense of the discrepancy be - tween that loyalty and its corresponding cost in life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , then the Imperial show will have to be closed down and the danger of disturbance of the peace will be diminished by that much .

		Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	has no illusions on that score .

		Habits are slowly learned and slowly unlearned not so slowly unlearned , perhaps , but slowly enough .

		Still , the thing can be done by fol - lowing a policy of thorough neutralization and stubborn refusal to take the host of gen - teel military and bureaucratic parasites at their own valuation .

		While the Imperial establishment is by far the most gifted with potentialities for dis - turbing the peace , the so-called constitutional monarchies are not altogether slackers in that respect .

		Wherever there is a system of hier - archically graded men , there peace trembles in the balance .

		To the extent that this grad - ing system has a basis in the affections of the common man , to that extent is a weapon placed in the hands of the irresponsible , which they can , and which they usually do , use for their God , their King , and their coun - try different names for their own predilec - tions .

		Lastly , one must not exclude from the list of the potential trouble-makers the so-called republics by the grace of the business man .

		They also share , and share richly , in that potentiality .

		Under modern conditions of financial investment , when God ,
King	PERSON	, and country are transformed into national honor at so much per cent , it is to be expected that the peace will be disturbed as often and as much as the single-minded and single-hearted purpose of financial returns demands such a procedure .

		The crucial factor in this disturbance of the peace by these various , variously ill-mean - ing agencies , is , after all , the system of tribal loyalties and habits , of tribal animosities and pugnacities which make up the essence of patriotism .

		It is on the basis of these that the knight-errant in search of adventure and the knight-investor in search of dividends construct their schemes of assault and bat - tery known as national expansion .

		This feeling of patriotic devotion is given due treat - ment by Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	.

		He finds democracy not lacking in such feeling and mankind in - differently and abundantly provided with it .

		With it also he finds that the system of me - chanical habits of work and thought which characterizes the modern machine process , makes for an insubordination necessary to the ultimate defeat of that feeling .

		In this respect warlike organizations find themselves in the dilemma brought about by the modern industrial revolution .

		They can not success - fully prosecute their wars without the prod - ucts of the machine process , modern warfare being altogether a question of mechanical and industrial technique .

		and , in the long run , they can not get along with it .

		In the last analysis , Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	bases his hope for peace on the foundation of the revolution in mental habits which goes with the machine process .

		Such , in the barest outline , is Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's analysis of the factors which make for or against peace .

		It is an analysis not written for the man who wants to read while he runs .

		None of Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's works were written with such readers in view .

		If the subject is worth writing a book about , it is also worthy of a book that must be read with thought and consideration .

		Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's great care in expressing his thoughts may mislead some into believing him difficult of access .

		This is not the case , except for the man who wants to get the greatest immediate returns for the least effort .

		Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's manner of writing is symphonic ; what he repeats is not repeti - tion in the common sense of the word ; no idea is quite the same after he has stated it twice or even three times .

		The theme may be the same , but the complex working out of the theme gives it the value of an entirely new composition .

		Above all there stands a mas - terly intellect , holding the various strands of fact and thought securely in its grasp and weaving them into patterns of compelling truth .

		516 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	A Cook 's Tour in
Arnold MATTHEW ARNOLD	LOCATION	, How to Know Him .

		By
Stuart P. Sherman	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Adam doubtless had lonesome moments in
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, but one thing he was spared : there were no official guides to advertise the scenery ; no experts to legislate his taste .

		His was a life of discovery .

		How different the envir - onment of his descendants in these efficient days !

		So completely have conditions changed that the son or daughter of
Adam	PERSON	who enjoys the privilege of discovery even in moderation is a rare and heroic specimen .

		The vast majority of individuals , educated as well as uneducated , clothe their ignorance in bor - rowed finery , and are as much embarrassed when caught in any other dress as in none at all .

		Even our universities , ostensibly ded - icated to discovery , have developed an effec - tive technique for safeguarding society against the appearance of intellectual `` sports . ''

		Everywhere it is bad form to per - ceive or enjoy immediately rather than vica - riously , and to confess the experience .

		So deep-seated has this habit of mind become that one undertakes a heavy task in trying to sequester even a small corner of one 's spir - itual domain from the rule of the omnipres - ent specialists .

		What are the experts for , is the language of our environment , if not to teach us what to think and how to feel ?

		These remarks are occasioned by the read - ing of
Stuart P. Sherman	PERSON	's book , ``
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, How to Know Him . ''

		There is much to be said in favor of the volume .

		Its rich content is expressed in a style combining vi - vacity with restraint , while the author 's sym - pathetic treatment of
Arnold	LOCATION	's standpoint is tempered by independence of judgment .

		The reader will turn from the book with a distinct impression of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	as a person , and with a pretty clear concept of what he considered it necessary to believe regarding poetry , education , politics , and religion if one would see life and see it whole .

		Indeed , except for an occasional overstraining to turn a smart phrase , a somewhat superior attitude toward `` middle-class virtues '' and `` the people , '' and an irritable manner with those who are still young enough to find fault with
Arnold	PERSON	-LRB- `` younger critic , '' it would seem , is Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's damn -RRB- , the book is an admir - able study .

		It is , however , an invitation to substitute knowledge about Arnold for ac - quaintance with him , and for that reason may fail to arouse the enthusiasm of many who have hopes and fears for literature .

		To avoid misunderstanding and in justice to the author , the point of the criticism must be made perfectly clear .

		I am not finding fault with the content , style , or spirit of the book .

		My criticism goes deeper , or else is be - side the mark .

		I object to the general theory upon which the book is based ; I attack Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's method .

		Assuming that the sub - title , `` How to Know Him , '' means `` How best to become acquainted with what he wrote , '' I submit there is but one answer : read him .

		That is old-fashioned advice , and to follow it takes time , but no better way to know him has , I believe , been invented .

		To be sure , there is a better and a worse way of reading any writer , and judicious guidance is of value at this point .

		But there is no adequate substitute for extensive contact with the writer 's own works .

		The besetting temptation of literary experts is to disregard this fact .

		They find it well-nigh impossible to stop with introducing the reader to the writer and giving some general directions on how to go about developing a personal ac - quaintance .

		Nor are they satisfied to tell you what interested them , what they liked , and why .

		They must tell you what the author meant by what he said , if not what he should have said .

		In a word , they deviate the reader 's interest in an author to occupation with another 's criticism of him and block direct , spontaneous approach with a mass of interpretation .

		Enjoyable as Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's book is it yields , in my judgment , to this temptation .

		Take , for example , the chapter entitled `` Poems of the Personal Life . ''

		Here frag - ments of Arnold 's poetry , and now and then a complete poem , are set in a running com - ment of interpretation the background out of which the verses grew , the mood they illus - trate , what they mean , and so on .

		Limita - tions of space make cutting necessary , and at times
Arnold	LOCATION	's lines have to be replaced by Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's prose , with only enough verse to point the moral or adorn the tale .

		`` Empedocles on Etna '' thus shrinks to nine - teen lines , not counting broken bits scattered here and there .

		And at every turn , the reader is forearmed with an interpretation against the danger of coming face to face with
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's words .

		It seems to me that the lover of poetry should be protected instead against finding an exquisite lyric such as
Arnold	LOCATION	's `` Longing '' framed in the following comment : To bring out still more clearly the conflicting forces in
Arnold	LOCATION	's nature let us take first a passage from `` Faded Leaves '' in which one feels the pang and hears the cry of the heart uttered in pure lyr - ical abandon : Now let us have a single stanza from `` Absence , '' the
Switzerland	LOCATION	series which seems to sum up the
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 517 comment of
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's reason upon the sweet tumult of the emotional life .

		But the job is well done ; so well indeed that one almost forgets to be critical .

		One ap - pears to get over a good deal of
Arnold	LOCATION	and one enjoys it .

		One learns from citations and comments that
Arnold	LOCATION	passed through three distinct phases of disillusionment , `` as is commonly enough the case with young men crossing the threshold of manhood : a dis - illusionment about love and human relation - ships ; a disillusionment about his powers and his career ; and a disillusionment about God and the universe . ''

		One learns in the follow - ing quotation how he recovered himself : Without any special reference to chronology , we can find the record in his poems of a gradual spiritual pilgrimage through disillusions to ennui and despair , thence to resignation and stoical endurance , and ultimately to a new kind of courage and hope , denot - ing a pretty complete moral recovery .

		But all this is obviously biographical .

		It con - tinues the treatment of
Arnold	LOCATION	's character and career completed in the first chapter .

		To mistake what one learns about the man who wrote the poems for an acquaintance with the poems he wrote , is a not unnatural result of Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's convincing style , but it is none the less an error .

		Were there less of an air of finality about the chapter , were it definitely constructed with the purpose of serving as an introduction , were there some suggestion as to what should be read by one who would become acquainted with the personal poems of
Arnold	LOCATION	, the chapter might act as an in - ducement .

		The whole structure of the study , however , encourages the idea that it may be substituted for direct contact with
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's personal poems , and this , if taken seriously , would surely be a pity .

		The remaining chapters `` Poems of the External World , '' `` Literary Criticism , '' `` Edu - cation , '' `` Politics and Society , '' `` Eeligion '' are not all equally open to the same objection , for there is an occasional slight encour - agement to follow up Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's discus - sion by a reading of
Arnold	LOCATION	, or it is taken for granted that the poems have been read .

		The suggestion , however , is always most delicate , and from the beginning to the end of the book there is no clear indication that it is to serve merely as a prolegomenon , or that a wide reading of
Arnold	LOCATION	is thought necessary .

		The form of discourse fathers the delusion that the reader is `` doing '' Arnold .

		As a text for college classes , accompanied by a wise pro- gramme of reading and class discussion , or as a guide to teachers who must get up `` back - ground '' for a course in
Arnold	LOCATION	, Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	has hit the mark .

		But I can not say that `` How to Know Him '' is clearer to me than it was .

		Perhaps , after all , the book is intended as a biography .

		I am , at all events , more than ever convinced that the art of furthering ac - quaintance with the best that has been written is an art of arts .

		I conclude with the fear that this review fails to convey , in Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's words , `` that indispensable personal gusto of the interpreter which excites the envy of the reader , stim - ulates his curiosity , and makes him feel that , unless he shares it , he is excluded from one of the most exquisite pleasures of the world . ''

		If so , a discussion of the content rather than the method of the book might not have led to the same failure .

		And there were many temptations : Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's easy method of solving the religious problem by moving God from metaphysics to experience , for example ; or his interpretation of
Arnold	LOCATION	's character as winsome ; or his tendency , in common with all those who bow the knee as to
Pope Arnold	LOCATION	, to talk about eternal values as a matter of course .

		In spite of disagreements , considera - tion of these matters would have led to the placing of greater emphasis upon the excel - lences of the book .

		Nor could I have been content to speak in mild praise of chapter five , which is an ex - cellent discussion of educational values and of the warfare between the sciences and the humanities , as represented by
Spencer	PERSON	and
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		If it seemed better on the whole to attack a single bone of contention , this should not be construed as condemning the juiciness of what was left untouched in the dish .

		The
` Problems of Organization COMMUNITY	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
K. M. Maciver	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3.75	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	has written an able but disap - pointing book .

		It is an able book because Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	has thought deeply upon his subject , and he has much to say that is both timely and important .

		But it is disappointing partly from a certain curious scholasticism of form , and partly from its somewhat colorless char - acter .

		It suffers from a certain abstractness .

		Again and again one needs the apt illustration which will serve to drive home the point that has been made .

		It is a well-arranged book ; and a student who is acquainted with the lit - erature of which it is a part can read it with interest and profit .

		It is , indeed , here that its main value lies .

		It is nothing so much as an encyclopaedia of the problems involved in the fact of human organization .

		It suggests the kinds of question to which more and more 518 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	it is becoming imperative that an adequate theory of the state shall make answer .

		For , war-time apart , it is very clear that the state no longer commands from its subjects the high respect it formerly possessed .

		It has become simply one of a great series of public associa - tions , and such other groups as churches and trade unions make incessant demand upon the loyalties of men .

		The state , indeed , is still the great guardian of public order and the dispenser of justice .

		But it is increasingly compelled to enter areas of activity where its divinity may well be challenged .

		The
Union	ORGANIZATION	- ists in Ulster and the
I. W. W.	PERSON	in
America	LOCATION	may well serve to remind us that we live in an age when refusal of obedience to state law is taken almost as a matter of course .

		The relation of the individual to the state is un - dergoing a vast change in perspective .

		It is becoming clear that the primary fact is not the state but society and that it is to the latter that our first loyalty is due .

		But we greatly need an analysis of the conditions under which men act as members of a group ; and to that necessity Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	has made a useful con - tribution .

		What I can not help doubting is whether Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	's method is likely to lead to the kind of results we require .

		The `` fundamental laws '' which he endeavors to lay down seem to me a little premature at this stage of so - ciological development .

		I confess , too , that long discussions of the place of sociology among the sciences seem to me , on the whole , so much beating of the philosophic wind .

		Let us each say what is within us , and it hardly seems to matter if we appropriate material of which other thinkers are jealously con - servative .

		Methodological discussion is one of the most barren tracts upon which a thinker can wander .

		It serves every sociological writer as a perpetual King
Charles	PERSON	's head .

		What does it matter how a thinker sets to work , if , as
Cromwell	PERSON	said , he has the root of the matter in him ?

		My skepticism about Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	's method is of a different kind .

		It seems to me dubious whether the facts exist which warrant the abstract analysis upon which he has embarked .

		To take a single ex - ample : no one has yet given us an adequate analysis of the psychological factors upon which community rests .

		The theories of Hobbes and
Bentham	PERSON	, of
Bagehot	PERSON	and of
Tarde	LOCATION	, all vanish into nothingness at the subtle touch of Mr.
Graham Wallas	PERSON	's dissolv - ing hand .

		Here , where help is so badly needed , Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	has little to give us ; sociology is not psychology , and we must not wander outside the province of the sociologist .

		We want to know what makes a member of the
American Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	respect the state , and a member of the
Confederation Generale du Travail	ORGANIZATION	concern himself with denying it .

		What is the part of habit and of fear in our obedience to law ?

		What kinds of association command our permanent affec - tion , and why ?

		What has been their histor - ical significance ?

		These may not be questions for the sociologist , but it seems to me that these are the questions we want answered .

		The most admirable section of Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	's book is his discussion of what he calls `` false perspectives of community . ''

		Here every word that he has to say is golden , and there is not a word too much .

		He disposes at once of the idea of community as an organism ; that very dead horse has a skin which does not repay the cost of removal .

		He analyzes the idea of a communal will , and decides that it is in reality no more than the action of a number of individual wills directed to a single end .

		He refuses to look upon commu - nity as greater than the sum of its parts .

		For him the only realities are individuals and this fashionable communalizing is no more than the resurrection of mediaeval nominalism .

		But the problem is in reality much more complex , and it can not be understood with - out reference to a considerable juristic liter - ature which , as I suspect , is outside Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	's purview .

		He knows of
Maitland	ORGANIZATION	's famous introduction to the translation of
Gierke	PERSON	, but he does not seem aware that that classic utterance is the beginning and not the end of a literature .

		No one can really un - derstand the nature of communal action who has not read widely in the English law re - ports .

		Why is it that the American courts have been driven to the creation of de facto corporations ?

		Why is it that in the
Taff Vale	PERSON	case the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	was compelled to recognize an association which
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	had specifically ordained to be outside the law ?

		Why is it that the courts are increas - ingly driven to take account of corporate crime ?

		Simply because where men act to - gether they tend to create , to use Professor Dicey 's words , `` a body which , from no fiction of law , but from the very nature of things , differs from the individuals of whom it is constituted . ''

		Our social philosophy must be pragmatic enough to realize that personality is too broad a category to admit only living men .

		I wish that Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	would read the great work of
Leon Michoud	LOCATION	, or
M. Hauriou	PERSON	's fine essay on personality as an element in social organization , and then give us his thoughts on this vital problem .

		He does not seem to know that
M. Duguit	PERSON	has defended the individualist position in half a dozen most
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 519 brilliant books , and that
M. Duguit	PERSON	in his turn , has been ably attacked from the realist standpoint .

		It is not quite sufficient to dis - miss realism with a smiling reference to the anthropomorphic fancies of St.
Paul	PERSON	and the great
Nicholas	PERSON	of
Cusa	LOCATION	.

		There is still a great deal of valuable truth to be extracted from the bog of mediaeval speculation ; and one at least of Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	's readers is con - tent to regard realism as a pragmatic ne - cessity .

		The criticism he makes of corporate realism is able within its limits , but it does not cover the necessary ground .

		Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	has admirably argued that the `` true relation of localities to the whole com - munity may be described as federal . ''

		It is in just such an aspect of his thought as this that the poverty of abstract analysis becomes most evident .

		Here is a thesis that admits of the most abundant and incisive illustration .

		The centralization of modern
France	LOCATION	has been assailed by jurists and monarchists .

		It has been made the theme of an admirable and distinguished survey by M. Paul-Boncour .

		An analysis of its defects would have enabled Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	to prove the force of what at present stands in his book less as a conclu - sion than as a premise .

		He had admirable material in the relation of the states to Wash - ington , in the growing disorganization of local government in
England	LOCATION	.

		The variety of
Greece	LOCATION	as against the uniformity of
Eome Freeman	PERSON	had already demonstrated in the greatest of his encyclopaedic monuments and his conclusions ought to find their place in Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	's volume .

		One last criticism it is worth while mak - ing .

		Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	is not a biologist and it is difficult not to read with regret his long dis - cussion of the sociological significance of Weismannism .

		Whatever may be said of the theoretical parts of the latter 's work , his argu - ment against the transmission of acquired characters is admitted as a starting-point of modern studies in heredity .

		To quote , as Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	does , the experiments of
Laitinen	PERSON	on infant mortality is to be ignorant of the fact that Professor
Karl Pearson	PERSON	, in one of the most brilliant of his essays , has conclusively demonstrated their worthlessness .

		Acquaint - ance with the work of the
Galton Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	would convince him that his attempt to write social progress in terms of environment is a mistaken one .

		Its importance we may not in any degree deny .

		But its importance is rela - tive to the material with which it interacts and Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	nowhere gives adequate con - sideration to the hereditary factor .

		These are the kind of criticisms anyone who reads Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	's book at all carefully will be impelled to pass .

		He will recognize its usefulness ; but he will regret that it has at - tempted so immense a superstructure on so narrow , and , often , so insecure , a foundation .

		I do not doubt that if Mr.
Maciver	PERSON	will give us a full analysis of some single aspect of his problem , he will write a very valuable book .

		For that one must be content to wait .

		But it is permissible to suggest that future work of this kind will be the more useful and sug - gestive exactly in so far as it is written from the standpoint of historical experience .

		Here are two books that attempt to trace the current drift in American literature .

		They have little enough in common except the originating purpose , for they are ad - dressed to different audiences and show a dif - ferent bias throughout .

		It is hardly too much to say that Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	speaks confidently to the wide-eyed if not to the open-mouthed ; he is the glib and complacent showman ; he rests heavily on the Established and does not dis - dain the Commercial , though he sweeps in the New also as a phenomenon not without its sig - nificance for purposes of orientation .

		He be - gins , unexceptionably , with Mr.

Chambers	PERSON	, Mr.
Rex Beach	PERSON	, and Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	, and winds up with Mr.
Charles Rann Kennedy	PERSON	and
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	.

		His book is a compilation of
Sunday	DATE	`` specials '' that appeared originally in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times '' a piece of facile journal - ism , easy , altogether too easy , to read , and not very obviously worth reading .

		The essays were based on talks with the various writers represented ; they flit and skim over the sur - face of our life without plunging into any of its depths or searching out any of its dark places .

		Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	, one infers , wanted the art to seduce his subjects into the unguarded fervor of real talk in which revelational hints and flashes might have emerged ; they simply discoursed on set themes , not always too hap - pily set , either .

		The measure of Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	's sensitiveness is sufficiently indicated , for ex - ample , by the fact that he talked of sex to
Robert Herrick	PERSON	and of Flaubert and genius to
Robert Chambers	ORGANIZATION	.

		If one feels that such a choice of topics was fortunate , then one will want to read Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	's book .

		520 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	Mr.
Morris	PERSON	ranged less widely than Mr.
Kilmer	PERSON	: he has restricted himself almost en - tirely to the New , and by that I mean the obviously and rather aggressively New , the self-consciously New , at all events .

		And since the New in
America	LOCATION	flows most easily into the forms of verse , he has considered chiefly the poets .

		He looks for and finds a breaking up of moulds , an overturning of traditions , a preparation for another renascence of beauty .

		Whether he really finds much more than a preparation , I do n't know ; but it is clear enough that he is an optimist and willing to take good intentions at pretty much their face value .

		He has less the air of being a critic -LRB- in spite of a formidable penchant for bris - tling classifications -RRB- than a skirmisher with the advance guard .

		He finds the fresh drive thor - oughly exhilarating and is fairly certain at least that it is mainly a drive in the right direction that is , a drive toward an art broadly and sincerely expressive of the com - mon lot .

		Indeed , if you examine the various credos contributed by such poets as
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	,
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	,
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	,
Louis Unter	PERSON	- meyer ,
Max Eastman	PERSON	, and
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, you will hear them all repeating in one form or another the conviction that what chiefly marks off our period is the passion for emancipation .

		The rebels are present in sufficient numbers and are sufficiently eloquent to give the tone to the book and smother the protests of the Traditionalists , who are , on the whole , a less vigorous lot .

		Romanticism , which is a per - fectly natural reaction against the scientific attitude and expresses the age-old revolt of man at the thought of being put too contemp - tuously in his place , has had a belated rebirth in
America	LOCATION	, but it is anaemic and scarcely yet articulate .

		There has been almost nothing of that recrudescence of the tinseled and the meretricious which pessimists looked for as one result of the war , but it is altogether pos - sible that it is still too early and that we are not yet ready for easy consolations masquer - ading as spiritual elevation .

		The apostasy of so stout a soul as Mr.
Wells	PERSON	warns one not to be over-confident .

		Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	, who is one of the keenest thinkers and most accomplished critics of the younger group , exhibits the continuing tri - umph of the realistic attitude and explains the reason for it here with his usual lucidity .

		We suspect , he says , `` everything that is called culture we suspect it of the taint of pe - cuniary elegance .

		We have armed our crit - ical judgment with
Thorstein Veblen	PERSON	's ` Theory of the Leisure Class ' perhaps the greatest book of our day .

		for it combines a new flavor in literature with a new and great truth in science . ''

		If it were not indeed for the enormous influence which he has been able to exercise , directly or indirectly , on the young , one would be inclined to call Mr.
Veb	PERSON	- len the obscurest great man in
America	LOCATION	, and to add that his obscurity was a sufficient com - mentary on our good sense and the measure of our appetite for unpalatable truth ; but he is fortunate at least in his prospective heirs and assigns and no man having that happy fate can honestly be called unlucky even during his lifetime .

		If Mr.
Morris	PERSON	's book fails to be representa - tive of all aspects of the newer movement , that is , I should think , one of the best things about it .

		There is , for example , very little of the metaphysical framework with which the va - rious schools and coteries are given to shor - ing up the artistic structure .

		Since the meta - physics of the artists is notoriously of a suspicious tenuity and spun besides of the most disparate material , the lack of it is all to the good .

		The metaphysics of the artists centres usually about form , and since even those who are given to emphasizing form are inclined to admit , with
Miss Lowell	PERSON	, that form is relatively unimportant after all , it seems to be more profitable to ignore such discus - sions and turn again to the spirit .

		Here there is , as I have said , a striking unanimity .

		Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	declares that the younger men have `` tasted an affirmative and universal sympathy with all realities of life that lies far out and beyond culture in the mind 's adventure . ''

		Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	finds the characteristic quality of our time in `` its sharp , probing quality , its insatiable curios - ity , its determined self - analysis . ''

		The poet has been set free from a `` preoccupation with a poetic past , from the repeating of echoes and glib superficials . ''

		He is free to turn his eyes on the here and now , to express as much truth as he is able to see .

		As
Miss Lowell	PERSON	puts it , the poets to-day `` are seeking reality the greater reality , which includes ideality ; they are seeking it through the sim - plicity and beauty of current speech ... '' Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	finds it chiefly encouraging that poetry has vastly extended its sweep , and he makes the same claim for it that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	made some time ago for the novel : that it `` should take all life for its province , and all knowledge , too . ''

		Since that is certainly an excessive claim to make for poetry in an age when specialization has taken most subjects out of the province of even the amiable gen - eral writer in prose , one must interpret the words rather mystically .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 521 But the thing that strikes one as , after all , strangest about these various passionate con - fessions of faith is that there should be felt to be so pressing a need to defend the claims of truth on our attention .

		Truth is the beg - gar-maid and one must apologize for the rags in which she is brought to the feast .

		How characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon mind that is , and how swiftly illuminating as to the Anglo-Saxon tradition !

		On the whole , one of the things of which we seem to be most unalterably convinced is the inadequacy of nature to meet the claims of the ideal .

		It takes a great deal of adornment , of stubborn and even blind idealization , to be quite tolerable .

		Idealization becomes thus a branch of good form .

		The effort to abolish this pestiferous dualism by dialectics may be necessary , but how much more persuasive is the innocence of the Russian , who never thinks of apologiz - ing for telling the truth and has always re - garded his everyday adventure as the stuff out of which to fashion the most profound and str angel y beautiful creations of the mod - ern mind .

$ 5	MONEY	. -RRB-

		Some years ago Mr.
Charles Withall	PERSON	, of
Messrs. Withall & Withall	ORGANIZATION	, discovered some material relative to the poet
Shelley	PERSON	among the papers which had come to the firm from
William Whitton	PERSON	, a man long in charge of the legal business of Sir Bysshe and Sir
Tim	PERSON	- othy
Shelley	PERSON	.

		This material he augmented by a further search and arranged with laborious care .

		In consequence an array of letters , diaries , and other documents was at length turned over to Mr.
Roger Ingpen	PERSON	, who had brought out two excellent volumes of the poet 's `` Letters , '' to be edited .

		`` The most satisfactory manner of utilizing this material appeared '' to Mr.
Ingpen	PERSON	`` to be that of re - telling the story of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's early years , the portion of his life that he passed in
England	LOCATION	, especially as many new facts have been brought to light since the publication of Pro- fessor
Dowden	PERSON	's monumental biography of the poet . ''

		The task has now been completed .

		The initial criticism must be adverse .

		Mr.
Ingpen	PERSON	's materials are of such character as to add substantially to our knowledge of cer - tain aspects and periods of
Shelley	PERSON	's life , and to add nothing to others .

		He should there - fore either have published them by them - selves with the least possible addition of familiar matter , or else he should have in - corporated them in a new biography .

		He has halted half way between the two meth - ods .

		Thus he has treated
Shelley	PERSON	's boyhood more fully than his discoveries about it would require ; he has , in a sense , brought the story down to the death of the poet 's son in
1889	DATE	; and yet he has all but ignored perhaps through loyalty to his title the association with
Byron	PERSON	in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, which belongs to the very years he traces in fullest detail .

		His work is too bulky for a supplement to Dow - den 's and too scant for a successor .

		He deserves much credit , however , for as - sembling a variety of information which has been adcumulated since
Dowden	PERSON	's time .

		He deserves still more credit for original con - tributions to our knowledge of
Shelley	LOCATION	.

		Most of the contributions could not have been made without a use of the material which Mr.
Charles Withall	PERSON	brought to light .

		This in - cludes twenty-nine of the poet 's letters , dat - ing from
1810	DATE	to
1818	DATE	; various pedigrees and legal documents ; official papers relating to the inquest on
Harriet	PERSON	's body ; two letters by
Byron	PERSON	; and letters by Sir
Timothy	PERSON	,
Sir Bysshe	LOCATION	,
Whitton	PERSON	,
Mary Shelley	PERSON	,
Peacock	LOCATION	, and others .

		Mr.
Ingpen	PERSON	adds extracts from
Shel	PERSON	- ley 's notebook , now in the possession of Sir
John C. E. Shelley	PERSON	.

		Of these extracts the most interesting are the notes for the preface of `` Adonais '' and the early draft of a section of the poem .

		The new information does not revolution - ize our impressions of
Shelley	LOCATION	, either as to his temperament or as to the course of his life .

		It serves rather to clarify details and often allows us to substitute certainty for conject - ure .

		It establishes the fact , for example , that the poet was married to
Harriet	PERSON	in
Edin	LOCATION	- burgh ; it seems to indicate that in
1815	DATE	he acted under an assumed name in perform - ances of Shakespeare on the
Windsor	LOCATION	stage ; and it reveals that he was twice arrested for debt once in
Carnarvon	LOCATION	and once in
Marlow	LOCATION	.

		Above all , it enables us to thread the com - plicated mazes of
Shelley	PERSON	's long contention with his father .

		The character of the dispute has long been familiar .

		Shelley had already awakened grave disquiet in Sir
Timothy	PERSON	when he en - tered
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and his expulsion on account of his pamphlet on atheism was a shock to his conservative and opinionated father .

		After Sir
Timothy	PERSON	had laid down impossible terms , such as a breach with
Hogg	PERSON	and an apology to the authorities at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and the poet had advanced counter proposals that were equally unacceptable , the estrangement was lessened by the softening processes of time .

		Shelley 522 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	renewed it by his elopement with
Harriet	PERSON	.

		Again it was diminished , and again intensi - fied this time by the elopement with
Mary Godwin	PERSON	.

		Various monetary arrangements were made , only to be suspended or modified in consequence of what
Shelley	PERSON	thought was his father 's tyrannical caprice , but what Sir
Timothy	PERSON	thought was the .

		demand of pru - dence and justice .

		The difficulty was accent - uated by the fact that
Shelley	PERSON	was to come ultimately into property that belonged to his eccentric , self-willed grandfather ,
Sir Bysshe	PERSON	, who was out of sympathy with both Sir
Tim	PERSON	- othy and the poet .

		Mutual inability to accept the other 's view made a real accommo - dation impossible , and even after
Shelley	PERSON	's death his widow and his son , the latter now heir to the property , long felt the weight of Sir
Timothy	PERSON	's distrust .

		Our more minute acquaintance with the struggle brings home to us the pathos of it .

		Had Sir
Timothy	PERSON	dared trust his natural im - pulses , it is possible that a modus
Vivendi	PERSON	, if not a reconciliation , might have been ef - fected .

		Certainly much bitterness would have been spared .

		Sir
Timothy	PERSON	trusted a law - yer instead .

		Whatever
Whitton	PERSON	's skill in other respects , he was singularly incapable of understanding
Shelley	PERSON	.

		He pointed out offences against convention , self-interest , fam - ily pride , all of which Shelley heartily de - spised .

		He snubbed
Shelley	PERSON	, lectured him .

		He thought it wisdom to wrest from
Shelley	LOCATION	, by cutting off his resources , the one thing the poet would have at all costs liberty .

		No wonder that
Shelley	PERSON	, exasperated that his mes - sages to his father must pass through Whit - ton 's hands , to be withheld or forwarded as the lawyer saw fit , sometimes broke into furi - ous invective : `` I am not a likely person to submit to the imperious manner of address , of which
this evening	TIME	's letter is a specimen . ''

		Again : ``
William Whitton	PERSON	's letter is con - cieved -LSB- sic -RSB- in terms which justify Mr.
P. Shelley	PERSON	's returning it for his cool reperusal .

		Mr.
S.	PERSON	commends Mr.
W.	PERSON	when he deals with gentlemen -LRB- which opportunity perhaps may not often occur -RRB- , to refrain from opening pri - vate letters , or impudence may draw down chastisement upon contemptibility . ''

		Armed with a missive like one of these -LRB- `` the most scurrilous letter that a mad viper could dic - tate '' -RRB- ,
Whitton	PERSON	experienced no difficulty in extracting from Sir
Timothy	PERSON	the decision : `` These sallies of Folly and
Madness	ORGANIZATION	ought to be restrain 'd and kept within bounds .

		Noth - ing provokes him so much as civility . ''

		Nothing provokes him so much as civility a more absolute ministerpretation of a son by a blundering and muddle-headed father has yet to be recorded .

		Shelley appealed to his grandfather : `` Language is given us to ex - press ideas ... he who fetters it is a BIGOT and a TYRANT , from these have my mis - fortunes arisen . ''

		Sir Bysshe made it em - phatically clear that he thought his grandson `` in a state of High rebellion . ''

		Shelley , yearning to be understood , wrote secretly to his sister Helen : Everybody near you says that I have behaved very ill , and that I can love no one .

		But how do you know that everything that is told you is true ?

		A great many people tell a great many lies , and believe them , but that is no reason that you are to believe them .

		Because everybody else hates me , that is no reason that you should .

		Think for yourself , my dear girl , and write to tell me what you think ... Think - ing , and thinking without letting anything but reason influence your mind , is the great thing .

		No answer came .

		Sir
Timothy	PERSON	had inter - cepted the letter and sent it to
Whitton	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Ingpen	PERSON	is to be commended for re - fraining from sentimentally making out a case for
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	.

		For if much may be said for the poet , much also may be said for Sir
Timothy	PERSON	and it is best to set the personali - ties before us and let them plead for themselves .

		With less narrow notions of re - spectability than Sir
Timothy	PERSON	entertained , we might still hesitate to stand in the relationship of father to such a man as
Shelley	LOCATION	.

		We might doubt the pure reason of a son who would mortgage his future to stem the avalanche of debts contracted by the cold and unforgiving
Godwin	PERSON	.

		We might question the altruism of a son who wrote : `` To interest , to fortune I am indifferent '' and who denounced institu - tions , and then shrilly protested in our ears : `` You must treat me as a son , and by the common institutions of society your super - fluities ought to go towards my support . ''

		We might be genuinely puzzled by the logic which would permit such a son , a thorough - going atheist , to address us as follows : Let us admit even that it is an injury that I have done ... Father , are you a Christian ?

		... I appeal to your duty to the God whose worship you profess ... Father , are you a Christian ?

		Judge not , then , lest you be judged ... What !

		will you not forgive ?

		How then can your boasted professions of Christianity appear to the world , since if you for - give not you can be no Christian ?

		... A moral one -LSB- atheist -RSB- would ... quietly put in practise that forgiveness which all your vauntings can not make you exert .

		Nor might we , finally , listen with patience to the reproach of a son who had wrecked many a fond hope for us : This is a cowardly , base , contemptible expedient of persecution : is it not enough that you have deprived me of the means of subsistence -LRB- which means , recol - lect , you unequivocally promised -RRB- , but that you must take advantage of the defencelessness which our rela - tion entails upon me , to libel me ?

		Have you for -
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 523 gotten what a libel is ?

		or is your memory so very treacherous ?

		... You have treated me ill , vilely .

		Even had we been so discriminating as to see that
Shelley	PERSON	was the most ethereal lyrist and one of the most valiant champions of liberty the nation had produced , we should hardly have deemed him an exemplary son .

		So long as the genius has freakish qualities , and other men have worldly qualities , fric - tionless adjustments will not be the rule .

		But the contrasts , the oppositions , the an - tipathies will not often be so stringent as in the example we have studied .

		Shelley might have cursed the harsh fates for making Sir
Timothy	PERSON	his father , and Sir
Timothy	PERSON	in turn might have cursed them for making
Shelley	PERSON	his son .

		Socialism and Christianity THE CHURCH AND THE HOUR : Papers by a Socialist Churchwoman .

		By
Vida D. Scudder	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The point of view which Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	here exposes is a most interesting and important one .

		At present it is not very widely held , but it is probable that as time goes on an in - creasing number of people will be led to adopt it , for the author finds herself in a predicament in which many others would be if only they saw as clearly as she .

		Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	is a descendant of the Puritans , and has retained their old zeal for righteousness and their sense of the importance of religion , but she is also aware of modern problems .

		A few years ago , in her book on `` Socialism and Character , '' she traced the history of a `` soul '' perhaps her own which began with the study of the great idealists of the nine - teenth century and from them became aware of the existence of the social question .

		Rem - edies were sought in philanthropy and re - form , but in vain ; and she was forced at length to turn to socialism .

		But no sooner had she done this than she began to feel that modern socialism frequently lacks some of the lofty idealism of her former teachers : if life ever were really as materialistic as some socialists would apparently like to see it , she would not consider it worth living .

		She be - came convinced , however , that socialism is not necessarily materialistic , and that it might easily adopt the highest idealism .

		She maintained that even though one accept the socialist doctrines of the economic interpreta - tion of history and the class struggle , he need not become a helpless materialist ; on the con - trary , in the
Socialist State	ORGANIZATION	itself , the lofty Christian virtues of mercy , poverty of spirit , the apotheosis of suffering , renunciation , and the like would continue to exist transfigured , while Christian doctrines , even such as those of the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, the Incarnation and the
Atone	LOCATION	- ment , would remain essential .

		In fact , so - cialism being the essence of Christianity , it would continue all the elements which
Chris	PERSON	- tians have taught through the ages .

		She finally found a reconciliation of historical Christian mysticism and modern humanita - rianism in something resembling a high - church Episcopalianism .

		The present volume unites a number of papers continuing this discussion .

		Thus on the cover itself we are told that the object of the book is `` to promote better understanding between the religious world which fears social revolution and the unchurched world of rad - ical passion which demands it . ''

		With this end in view , the author first denounces the modern church for its failure to meet the mod - ern social emergency , and then suggests meth - ods by which this might be done .

		On the other hand , she protests vigorously when the `` Masses '' indulges in anti-clerical attacks , saying that `` it should be possible to believe people who tell us they see a light we do n't , and to accept them courteously as fellow-pil - grims toward the
City of Equity	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In an - other essay she discusses why the church does not turn socialist .

		The answer is found in the statement that the church 's business is to cultivate `` spiritual values '' not `` social justice , '' but , on the other hand , the - same individual who is a Christian might and should be a socialist .

		Finally , in the Intro - duction , the author collects a number of prac - tical programmes for social reform which have been adopted recently by the
General Conventions of the Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	`` a body usually reckoned one of the most in - stinctively conservative and aristocratic , but whose recent action at least partially exoner - ates it from this accusation . ''

		There is much to be said for the point of view set forth in this book : it is certain that if socialism is to win the world it must give a place to religious idealists and mystics like Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	; it is equally certain that if one practised the ethical teachings of Jesus , he would be a socialist .

		But is it also true that a socialist should unite himself with the historical Christian Church ?

		It would be hard for him to answer in the affirmative .

		There are many features of the church , particularly
the Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, such as its solidarism and catholic - ity , its internationalism and its teaching of the ultimate equality of all men , which every 524 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	socialist would accept ; but on a host of other points he would have to differ from it as white differs from black .

		In their ultimate conceptions of life , the two are diametrically opposed .

		Thus Christianity bids men `` praise God from whom all blessings flow '' ; socialism bids the `` proletarians of the world unite '' and seize these blessings for themselves .

		Christianity teaches that the church goes through three phases the church militant , the church suffering , the church triumphant ; so - cialism reverses this evolution and says , so - ciety suffering , society militant , and society triumphant .

		Christianity can not cease assert - ing that it is a `` supernatural '' religion ; so - cialism can not help denying that there is anything supernatural .

		The church looks above to God for its hope and defence ; social - ism seeks them in Humanity below .

		Whatever Jesus may have taught , the Christianity of the church -LRB- even Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	's variety -RRB- is hopelessly and fundamentally aristocratic ; socialism is democratic .

		In fine , the great question is , Can a democratic society believe in the Christian God ?

		The question is not settled , but it is one of the most important that we have before us to-day .

		Any intelli - gent discussion of it must be of value .

China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	THE DEVELOPMENT OF
CHINA	LOCATION	.

		By
Kenneth Scott Latourette	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	. -RRB-

		The world has many reasons for being inter - ested in
China	LOCATION	.

		It is the most ancient of na - tions , being already old when
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	dominated the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		It con - tains between a fifth and an eighth of the entire population of the globe , and has wielded a cultural influence over a still greater propor - tion of the human race .

		Since
1895	DATE	, and especially since the revolution of 1911-12 , it has been undergoing stupendous transforma - tion , involving nothing less than the dissolu - tion of an old civilization and the swift upbuilding of a new one .

		Finally , its rela - tions with
Japan	LOCATION	have become one of the most crucial phases of world politics easily the most crucial aside from the problems raised directly by the world war .

		Perhaps a dozen brief histories of
China	LOCATION	are available in English .

		Some of them are hastily written and untrustworthy .

		Some are prejudiced .

		Some are overloaded with dynastic details , in which the Western reader finds it difficult to become interested .

		There is , therefore , a place for Mr.
Latourette	PERSON	's `` Development of
China	LOCATION	, '' which is carefully written , fair , and free from excessive tech - nicalities .

		Mr.
Latourette	PERSON	writes as one who came to know the Chinese language , history , and civilization through years of service in the
College of Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
China	LOCATION	.

		His purpose has been to produce a compact Chinese his - tory which will attract the general reader and at the same time meet the needs of college courses in Oriental Politics and related sub - jects .

		The general reader , at all events , will not regret that the author has chosen to pass very lightly over the narrative of Chinese history prior to the nineteenth century , in order to have space for highly informing chap - ters on the geographic background of the country 's development , the nature of Chinese culture at the beginning of intimate contact with the West , and present-day problems of the young republic .

		The narrative is car - ried over the entire stretch from unknown antiquity to
1840	DATE	in seventy pages .

		Yet the essentials are brought out , and the roots of the Chinese national life are satisfactorily laid bare .

		Under the changed condition of the world in modern times it was inevitable , Mr.
Latour	PERSON	- ette says , that the ancient Chinese civiliza - tion should be superseded not because it was decadent , but because it was based on a self - contained national existence which is no longer possible .

		If most of the nineteenth century was an era of stagnation , the fault was that of the ruling Manchu dynasty , not of the people .

		`` One does well to remember that within so short a period as a century and a half ago , when the Manchus were at their height ,
China	LOCATION	was among the best-gov - erned and most highly civilized nations on earth , and that its reputation in the West was such that it was held up by many as an ideal in industry and the arts of living . ''

		The story of the building up of European and American trading interests in
China	LOCATION	after the Opium War of
1840	DATE	has been often told .

		It contains a good deal that is sordid , yet something of the heroic ; and Mr.
Latourette	PERSON	has satisfactorily stressed both aspects .

		Gen - erally satisfactory , too , is his sketch of European and Japanese aggrandizement on Chinese soil between
1894	DATE	and
1916	DATE	.

		How - ever , the connection between Chinese borrow - ing in European capitals after the defeat of 1894-5 and the memorable series of conces - sions of
1898	DATE	is not brought out ; and while the direful consequences of the country 's re - cent fiscal weakness are emphasized , there is no adequate explanation of the part played
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 525 in producing that weakness by the huge and unfair indemnity imposed by the powers after the
Boxer	PERSON	uprising of
1900	DATE	.

		The author 's interpretation of
Japan	LOCATION	's course since
1914	DATE	is that the Tokio authorities have been resolved to take advantage of the preoccupation of the Western nations to get a grip on
China	LOCATION	's trade , and even on her governmental affairs , that can not be broken .

		`` From
Japan	LOCATION	's standpoint it appears to be a matter of life and death that she be assured an open door to her great neighbor .

		There is the natural field for her commercial expan - sion , and without this expansion her future as a great power is dark .


China	LOCATION	possesses great quantities of coal and iron and a huge population which can be organized into a mighty industrial force .

		She is potentially a fabulously rich market .

		What wonder that the Japanese should desire to lead her and to establish that leadership so firmly that it can - not be disputed by the Western powers ?

		.

		.

		.

		The great war offered the opportunity for which she has been looking .

		While the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	were busy at home , she could gain so great a hold on her neighbor that they would be forced to recognize it after the war .

		As an ally of
Great Britain	LOCATION	she could drive out
Germany	LOCATION	, and as the price of her aid she could demand a freer hand in
China	LOCATION	. ''

		The events of the past two and a half years readily bear out this view .

		In
1914	DATE	Japan ruthlessly violated Chinese sovereignty in her campaign against the Germans in
Shantung	LOCATION	.

		In
1915	DATE	she forced the Peking government to accept a series of political and economic arrangements tantamount to vassalage .

		In the same year she capped her rapprochement with
Russia	LOCATION	with a strong defensive alliance .

		Small wonder that
China	LOCATION	trembles with rage , that
Great Britain	LOCATION	has grown cool , and that the
United States	LOCATION	is beginning to realize that her Japanese problem is in
China	LOCATION	, not
Cal	LOCATION	- ifornia !

		If
China	LOCATION	enters the war , she will gain an opportunity for a hearing by the na - tions ; and she may get relief from the present burdens of the Boxer indemnity , extra-terri - toriality , and the Japanese menace .

		In any event , her future will give the powers per - haps most of all the
United States	LOCATION	serious thought .

		The outlook is considered by Mr.
Latourette	PERSON	encouraging , provided the huge republic can be assured an opportunity to build up its new government and civilization in its own way .

		As it was , he did as much as any writer of his generation to fasten on English fiction the fet - ters of an inartistic reticence .

		It was only in the last generation that English and Irish nov - elists , under the influence of French litera - ture , freed themselves from the cowardice of Victorian fiction and assumed that anything human under the sun is proper subject-matter for art .

		If they have n / > t produced master - pieces -LRB- and I do not admit that they have not -RRB- , they have made a brave beginning .

		Such a book as `` A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man '' would have been impossible forty years ago .

		Far from looking back with regret at the good old novelists of the nineteenth cen - tury -LRB- whom , besides , we need never lose -RRB- , I believe that our fiction is immensely freer and richer than the fiction of our immediate fore - fathers .

		Joyce 's work is outspoken , vigorous , orig - inal , beautiful .

		Whether it faithfully reflects Irish politics and the emotional conflicts of the Catholic religion one who is neither Irish nor Catholic can not judge with certainty .

		It seems , however , that the noisy controversies over
Parnell	PERSON	and the priests in which the boy 's elders indulge have the sound of living Irish voices ; and the distracted boy 's wrestlings with his sins and his faith are so movingly human that they hold the sympathy even of one who is indifferent to the religious argu - ments .

		I am afraid that the religious ques - tions and the political questions are too roughly handled to please the incurably de - vout and patriotic .

		If they ever put up a statue of Joyce in
Dublin	LOCATION	, it will not be dur - ing his life time .

		For he is no respecter of anything except art and human nature and language .

		There are some who , to turn his own imag - inative phrase , will fret in the shadow of his 526 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	language .

		He makes boys talk as boys do , as they did in your school and mine , except that we lacked the Irish imagery and whim - sicality .

		If the young hero is abnormal and precocious , that is because he is not an or - dinary boy but an artist , gifted with thoughts and phrases above our common abilities .

		This is a portrait of an artist by an artist , a lit - erary artist of the finest quality .

		The style is a joy .

		`` Cranly 's speech , '' he writes , `` had neither rare phrases of
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan English nor quaintly turned versions of Irish idioms . ''

		In that
Joyce	PERSON	has defined his own style .

		It is Elizabethan , yet thor - oughly modern ; it is racily Irish , yet univer - sal English .

		It is unblushingly plain-spoken and richly fanciful , like
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	.

		The effect of complete possession of the traditional resources of language is combined with an effect of complete indiffer - ence to traditional methods of fiction .

		Epi - sodes , sensations , dreams , emotions trivial and tragic succeed each other neither coherently nor incoherently ; each is developed vividly for a moment , then fades away into the next , with or without the mechanical devices of chapter divisions or rows of stars .

		Life is so ; a fellow is pandied by the schoolmaster for no offense ; the cricket bats strike the balls , pick , pock , puck ; there is a girl to dream about ; and
Byron	PERSON	was a greater poet than
Tennyson	PERSON	anyhow ... The sufferings of the poor little sinner are told with perfect fidelity to his point of view .

		Since he is an artist his thoughts appropri - ately find expression in phrases of maturer beauty than the speech of ordinary boys .

		He is enamored of words , intrigued by their mys - tery and color ; wherefore the biographer plays through the boy 's thoughts with all manner of verbal loveliness .

		Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour ?

		Or was it that , being as weak of sight as he was shy of mind , he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism of a language many-coloured and richly storied than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose ?

		From the fading splendor of an evening as beautifully described as any in English , he tumbles into the sordid day of a house rich in pawn tickets .

		That is life .

		`` Welcome , life ! ''

		he bids farewell to his young man - hood .

		`` I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated con - science of my race .

		Old father , old artificer , stand me now and ever in good stead . ''

		I know nothing of Mr.
James Joyce	PERSON	, the man , and I have not yet tried to look up his history ; it is pleasanter to read him first and find out about him afterward .

		`` A Portrait of the Artist '' bears the dates , ``
Dublin	LOCATION	,
1904	DATE	:
Trieste	LOCATION	,
1914	DATE	. ''

		The first American edition was published last year .

		One book which I have not seen , `` Chamber Music , '' is not yet printed in this country .

		The third book , a collection of sketches called `` Dubliners , '' bears only the American dates ,
1916	DATE	,
1917	DATE	.

		Is this a man who writes little and writes slowly ?

		Or has he been buried and come to life again ?

		The dates show a writing life of more than ten years , and the writing shows a trained artist , not a casual wanderer into literature .

		The sketches in `` Dubliners '' are perfect , each in its own way , and all in one way : they imply a vast deal that is not said .

		They are small as the eye-glass of a telescope is small ; you look through them to depths and dis - tances .

		They are a kind of short story un - known to the American magazine if not to the American writer .

		An American editor might read them for his private pleasure , but from his professional point of view he would not see that there was any story there at all .

		The American short story is explicit and over - developed and thin as a moving-picture film ; it takes nothing for granted , except in some of its rapid-fire farcical humor ; it knows noth - ing of the art of the hintful , the suggestive , the selected single detail which lodges fertilely in the reader 's mind begetting ideas and emo - tions .

		America is not the only offender -LRB- for patriotism is the fashion and bids criticism relent -RRB- ; there is much professional Irish humor which is funny enough but as subtle as a shillallah .

		And English short stories , such at least as we see in magazines , are ob - vious and `` express '' rather than expressive .

		Joyce 's power to disentangle a single thread from the confusion of life and let you run briefly back upon it until you encounter the confusion and are left to think about it your - self that is a power rare enough in any lit - erature .

		I have an impression of having felt that power in some of
Gissing	PERSON	's sketches , though that is only an impression which I should not care to formulate as a critical judgment until I had read
Gissing	PERSON	again .

		-LRB- A good thing to do , by the way . -RRB-

		Except one story , `` A Painful Case , '' I could not tell the plot of any of these sketches .

		Because there is no plot going from beginning to end .

		The plot goes from the surface in - ward , from a near view away into a back - ground .

		A person appears for a moment a priest , or a girl , or a small boy , or a street - corner tough , or a drunken salesman and does and says things not extraordinary in
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 527 themselves ; and somehow you know all about these people and feel that you could think out their entire lives .

		Some are stupid , some are pathetic , some are funny in an unhilarious way .

		The dominant mood is reticent irony .

		The last story in the book , `` The Dead , '' is a masterpiece which will never be popular , be - cause it is all about living people ; there is only one dead person in it and he is not men - tioned until near the end .

		That 's the kind of trick an Irishman like
Synge	PERSON	or
Joyce	PERSON	would play on us , and perhaps a Frenchman or a Eussian would do it ; but we would not stand it from one of our own writers .

		NOTES ON NEW FICTION Count
Ilya Tolstoy	PERSON	, like
Siegfried Wagner	PERSON	and so many others , will probably suffer from having a genius for a father suffer from too much blame or too much praise .

		The hasty will endow him with his father 's stature or censure him for not attaining to that stature .

		In any case , comparison is inevitable .

		`` Visions '' contains five war stories and four stories of Russian life ; and in reading the former , the reviewer inevitably recalled the father 's
Sebastopol	LOCATION	sketches those sketches that reveal such a change in the writer 's outlook .

		In many respects the matter is similar ; there are the same numerous pictures of the wounded and dying , of the agony in the hospitals ; but the son 's man - ner is never truly Tolstoyan .

		It is intrinsically the modern , introspective Russian manner not great but simply good .

		There is some of the father 's ability as a reporter -LRB- so wonderfully ex - emplified in the
Sebastopol	LOCATION	pieces -RRB- , but nowhere does this attain the impressive and the grand .

		The tale called `` The Little Green Stick '' is an attempt to answer the question so often asked the count : `` What would your father say about the war if he were living to-day ? ''

		His father is buried in the woods about a mile from his home at
Yasnaya Polyana	LOCATION	.

		In this place , says the tale , is buried a little green stick on which is written a word that will render all men brothers and all people happy .

		This `` sacred coveted word will some day be heard .

		The little green stick is there ; its power must manifest itself upon the earth . ''

		But now its voice is drowned by the roar of the war .

		The Findlaters are quite themselves in their latest stories , `` Seen and

		We never read a book of theirs with - out recalling
Nora Archibald	PERSON	's sketch of them , sit - ting down together at the big table to write , each undisturbed by the other 's rustling and fluttering .

		Their stories , here as elsewhere , are interesting bits of reality from Scotch backwaters , with shiftless , wandering tinkers , a chimney sweep , and a simple fanner for the chief figures in the ante-bellum sketches ; and a recruit who is not a recruit , an old plumber who returns to work and life when war takes away his young competitors , and two old spinsters who through loss of income are forced to work and thereby achieve happiness and sanity as the outstanding figures of the war time .

		Mary contributes but one tale to the collection , that of the two spinsters , and she writes with the more trenchant realism .

		Both write however in the old - fashioned way , where thoughts , sentences , para - graphs , and story are all nicely rounded out , a thoroughness enlightened by the caustic Scotch humor .

		The stories are told in a supposedly oriental style ; they offer us ethereal creatures who wing their way hither and discover the emptiness of earthly love , a king who gives up his kingdom after discourse with the gods , and a prince who seeks far and wide to know whether man is immortal ; in short , they solve metaphysical questions by the dozen .

		The only trouble with such a book is that only the ethereal - minded will read it , while the light-minded , the serious-minded , and the materialist go on their way rejoicing .

New England	LOCATION	life and character .

		The heroine appeared one fine day in the town of
Brookfield	LOCATION	, put life into a church fair , paid the minister 's salary , and settled down as benefactress to the struggling village , which fifteen years previously had been ruined by tbe convincing charm and the financial acquisitiveness of one
Andrew Bol	PERSON	- ton .

		The tale is extraordinarily true to village life , with its petty gossip , its importance over trifles , its stiff-necked pride , and its humor , con - scious and unconscious .

		Each must do his bit and in doing it he will achieve the salvation of his own soul save it from fatty degeneration .

		This is the point made by
Leonid Andreyev	PERSON	in `` The Confessions of a Little Man During Great Days '' -LRB- Knopf ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	-RRB- An - dreyev , the author of `` The Red Laugh '' !

		The hero is a clerk in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, who lays bare his soul in a diary which extends from
August , 1914	DATE	, until
January , 1916	DATE	.

		The diary tells us bow he was gradually forced from selfish contentment into happy service for his country from self-centred individualism into a whole-hearted willingness to be just a cell in the Russian organism .

		Following tbe loss of relatives and position ,
Dementev	PERSON	-LRB- the clerk -RRB- is brought through grief and self-pity into pity for others , and eventually into that larger pity which expresses itself in serving the people .

		Andreyev 's genius for analysis attains an intensity at times that is fairly hypnotic .

		The diary sets be - 528 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	fore us a man undergoing horrible moral torture .

		Fear , especially , is avowed and shown in all its ugli - ness .

		JDementev tells of nervous crises which assail him at night ; unforgettable pages are devoted to the description of all that passes through the mind of the unhappy man , an ordinary man , timid and feverish , depressed by the feeling of his solitude and the indifference of a world at war , and then uplifted by the joy caused by sentimental sacrifice .

		But the analysis is not all .

		There are moments of great poetic freshness pages of lyric beauty with accents exultant or despairing , as in the vivid pic - tures of springtime in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, or the moonlit city , still and mysterious and fearful , or the scene in the depot where the wounded soldiers arrive .

		Frederick

		Throughout the book
Monte	ORGANIZATION	and Marjory advance and retreat , love and languish , waiting in agony for the last chapter to put them out of their misery .


Peter	PERSON	did his best to make them see clearly , but
Monte	ORGANIZATION	and
Marjory	PERSON	shut their eyes to facts without sense or reason .

		It is puz - zling that the

		There must be something fatal about the name .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS AT
PLATTSBURG	LOCATION	.

		By
Allen	PERSON	French .

		Scrib - ner 's ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		The wrapper compares Mr.
French	PERSON	's book to Captain
Ian Hay Beith	PERSON	's now famous `` First Hundred Thousand . ''

		And the comparison has its justification .

		The humors , the pleasures , and the trials of military training everywhere differ only in degree .

		Mr.
French	PERSON	is facile and vivacious , except in his unhappy stiffening of love story and melodrama .

		But
Ian Hay	PERSON	is a veteran novelist ; he puts real character into his soldiers and offi - cers ; he has `` done up '' the British amateur fighter as
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	long ago `` did up '' the professional .

		It is a play-time
Plattsburg	LOCATION	which Mr.
French	PERSON	has described so agreeably , a
Plattsburg	LOCATION	already past , a stepping-stone toward the universal American army , which in turn will do away with all such effervescences .

		That old
Plattsburg	LOCATION	was unique , and a unique success .

		Good , wholesome Americans who could conveniently spare the time and money as well as some who could not drifted in on Pullmans for a month , worked hard , and were photographed continuously The tired business man found a new and novel relaxation in permitting his every move to be bossed by young Second Lieutenants fresh from the Point .

		And he found that that bossing was done remark - ably well .

		And the tired business man 's juniors rivalled one another in `` military efficiency '' to win promotion and the right to wear the coveted chevrons during the final week .

		The arrangements and the equipment were of the best while the militia on the border went without .

		There was no pay , but prospects of a refund if only Con - gress
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was early recognized as the per - petual stumbling block in the way of all reforms would pass the
Army Appropriation Bill	ORGANIZATION	, and let the army have what it needed .

		Moreover , there was the ultimate goal of a
Reserve Commission	ORGANIZATION	, opportunity for a man to use his brains and knowledge in the service of his country .

		The `` rookies '' were a picked lot ; so perhaps were the officers detailed to the camp .

		At any rate mutual appreciation grew apace .

		But most of all was General Wood respected .

		To him was due the camp and the whole great effort which it typified .

		And in the meantime , rumors although the day 's work and its novelties were generally more interesting than rumors occasionally flitted through the camp , rumors of General Wood 's dis - favor at
Washington	LOCATION	, of efforts made there to wreck his camp -LRB- after the previous
summer	DATE	had proved its success -RRB- by taking away its best offi - cers .


Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	visited the camp ; so did a plethora of college presidents ; and the
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary of War finally came to make a somewhat perfunctory speech .

		So ended that bold and suc - cessful effort to make
America	LOCATION	know its army .

		1917 -RSB- THE DIAL 529 LLOYD GEORGE : The Man and His Story .

		By
Frank Dilnot	PERSON	.

		Harper ;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Nothing makes and unmakes careers like war ; and when the present conflagration is over it will be interesting to reckon up its tale of humble men exalted and mighty men abased .

		One thing that the conflict has already done is to lay hold of a vivacious and daring Welshman , who as early as
1908	DATE	had risen from obscurity to the control of a great national treasury , and make of him the dictator of the British Empire .

		How this came about and , indeed , the whole fascinating record of the British Premier 's career is splen - didly told in Mr.
Dilnot	PERSON	's book .

		Mr.
Dilnot	PERSON	has had first-hand acquaintance with British politics and political leaders for two or three decades , and he has written a substantial book on the dramatic contest over the
Lloyd George	PERSON	budget of
1909	DATE	.

		The present biography is a simple chronicle , highly laudatory , yet hardly more than the subject seems to demand .

		For it is difficult to exaggerate the achievement that is represented in Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	's rise to his present position .

		Born of humble parents , left fatherless at the age of three , educated in the rough-and-ready way of the Welsh back-country , trained for the law , forcing his way from a penniless practitioner to a successful barrister , entering politics , going to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, becoming a minister , ramming down the throats of the vested interests the most rad - ical financial reform known to the history of the country , rapidly absorbing leadership under the stress of the world war , called to Buckingham pal - ace and asked to form a ministry , rallying the forces of a disorganized nation against a still pow - erful and unbeaten enemy , and guiding the des - tinies of a great empire almost single-handed
Lloyd George	PERSON	has a career that at many points runs astonishingly parallel to that of our own Lincoln .

		There is little to criticize in Mr.
Dil	PERSON	- not 's book .

		No attempt has been made to write history in the large or with finality , and no one will quarrel with the few somewhat doubtful gen - eralizations that appear The story is told simply and directly , with much of the flavor of Welsh and English life .

		SOME RUSSIAN HEROES , SAINTS AND SINNERS .

		Legendary and Historical .

		By
Sonia E. Howe	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The pursuit of finding counterparts and par - allels in history becomes particularly fascinating when one begins to speculate about
Russia	LOCATION	.

		In reading Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's volume , one is constantly reminded that racial characteristics do not rad - ically change , and that the great Russian leaders of to-day are of the same flesh and blood , are the spiritual descendants , as it were , of those por - trayed in this book .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	, in preparing these sketches , has consulted mainly Russian authorities , and has dipped into legend as well as history .

		She has the gift of painting her characters with vivid - ness , almost as if she had known them face to face : the terrible
Ivan	PERSON	, the staunch Yermak , and the pious
Boywiyinia Morozov	PERSON	become astonish - ingly real .

		One gets a sense that Russian history has always been an ebb and flow , a series of actions and reactions .

		No matter how complete a victory seemed , there was always a leader of another faction to stir up trouble .

		Popularity has ever been ephemeral .

		One instinctively draws comparisons .

		An observant English ambassador in the sixteenth century remarked that the stuff of which Russians were made was good it was the conditions which needed changing .

		The great mil - itary leader ,
Yermak	PERSON	, was confronted with a per - petual struggle to maintain the morale of his men .

		The Russians have always displayed courage and endurance , and in prehistoric times a Greek writer said they were conquerable only because of their internal dissensions .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	wrote this book , of course , before the late Russian revolution .

		She promises to write further of
Russia	LOCATION	, and we may hope for some interesting interpretations of modern conditions .

		Meantime , she has written with authority of Rus - sian history , a task for which she is suited by temperament and intellect , for , to quote the poet , `` Faith alone can fathom
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		THE ISSUE .

		By
J. W. Headlam	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		Speculation concerning
Germany	LOCATION	's intentions in war and in peace provides a never-ending source of intellectual or emotional stimulus .

		Mr.
Head	PERSON	- lam ought to be one of the best equipped of Eng - lishmen to give the material for such speculation .

		Certainly he is thoroughly sane .

		In his recent collection of articles he examines
Germany	LOCATION	's inten - tions as they have been expressed in the manifes - toes of the six Industrial Associations , and of the German professors , which were suppressed by the government on account of their ill-timed ap - pearance ; in the speeches of the Chancellor ; in the words of Prince Billow concerning peace ; and in the writings of Dr.
Naumann	PERSON	concerning the establishment of a Central European state .

		The significance of these collected utterances lies in their virtual agreement and their indubitably rep - resentative nature .

		They agree in their deter - mination that
Germany	LOCATION	's next war shall not be fought on her own frontiers , but on the frontiers of those dependent countries which she shall have `` attracted '' to her own industrial domination .

		Ger - many repudiates the word `` annexation '' ; her posi - tion after peace is to be that of the larger astral body that draws toward itself numberless stars of lesser magnitude .

		She does not ask for annexa - tion out of deference to the susceptibilities of her own Socialists but for `` guarantees . ''

		That is , she will establish a nominally autonomous
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	, and so on , with industrial , financial , and military dependence upon herself .

		She will re - move the French `` peril '' by taking over the rich industrial districts of
Northern France	LOCATION	, and the Russian `` peril , '' by drawing all
Poland	LOCATION	under her beneficent wing .

		The difficulty of government she will settle by removing the inhabitants of these conquered regions and by transporting thither well-trained German citizens , making the conquered 530 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	countries pay the cost .

		Thus will she guarantee herself security .

		This is virtually the same issue that was raised by
M. Cheradame	PERSON	's `` Pan-German Plot Un - masked . ''

		The emphasis and the proofs in the two books are different , but the facts are the same .

		Mr.
Headlam	PERSON	urges that the war go on until Ger - many is crushed .

		He believes that the feeling which the manifestoes represented is growing weaker with each month of warfare , and that the repudiation of their government by the people themselves can only be accomplished through de - cisive military disaster .

		That may be true ; but it is at least open to question whether the people will not be more crushed in the process of defeat than the government and the autocracy which were responsible for their disaster .

		MASTERPIECES OP MODERN SPANISH DRAMA .

		Edited by
Barrett H. Clark	PERSON	.

		Duffield ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		It can not be said that Mr.
Barrett H. Clark	PERSON	's collection of three `` Masterpieces of Modern Span - ish Drama '' offers much that is stimulating to readers who are at all familiar with modern plays .

		Echegaray 's `` The Great Galeoto '' is already known through previous translations and public read - ings ; `` The Duchess of San Quentin , '' by
Galdos	PERSON	, seems a little facile , theatrical , and old-fashioned , like some of the once `` daring '' works of Strind - berg , revived and translated a decade after the wind had been taken out of their sails by still more advanced innovators ;
Guimera	ORGANIZATION	's `` Daniela '' alone , translated from the Catalan by
John Gar	PERSON	- rett
Underbill	PERSON	, comes to us with all the force of a new sensation , and this by virtue of the profound and tragic poetry of its theme .

		That `` The Duchess of San Quentin '' does not greatly move us is no doubt due to its being a social comedy hinged upon conditions that have largely ceased to obtain in the great world ; it is a stage play that hardly transcends these conditions .

		``
Daniela	PERSON	, '' on the other hand , the story of the pecadora who returns from the scene of her tri - umphs to the little Catalan village where she was born and where she longs to regain before her death some of the innocence of her childhood , is of the great order , not least in the impressive art with which the author has conveyed the prim - itive atmosphere of peasant psychology across which the personality of his heroine passes like a meteor only to be engulfed in the end .

		For this play at least we are indebted to the editor and the translator .

		RECOLLECTIONS OF A REBEL REEFER .

Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		``
Dumas	PERSON	would have woven a three volume novel from this stirring book of reminiscences , '' say the publishers of Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	's autobiography .

		For once the publishers are right .

		Or rather may we say that the narrative itself is as absorbing as
Dumas	PERSON	would have made it , and has all the ear - marks of actuality besides .

		Without literary pre - tence , with slips here and there in the details of style , it yet has about it a straightforwardness , a veracity , a genuineness of speaking .

		right on that makes it in its way a masterpiece .

		Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	was born with a roving , adventurous disposition .

		He came of a good family .

		He was gifted with an extraordinary sense for the significant and picturesque elements of any situation in which he found himself .

		As a result of these qualities he has had a strenuous career , met interesting people , and observed as many aspects of life on this planet as could well come to anyone 's knowledge in three score years and ten .

		As a midshipman aboard the old `` Constitution , '' he was associated with four of the future captains who played lead - ing parts in the destruction of
Cervera	ORGANIZATION	's fleet .

		Resigning at the outbreak of the Civil War , he served for a time along the
Mississippi	LOCATION	; was res - cued from a romantic plight at
Charleston	LOCATION	by the future Secretary of the Confederate Treas - ury , whose daughter he was to marry ; engaged in remarkable exploits aboard the commerce raider , ``
Georgia	LOCATION	'' ; assisted in the defence of
Richmond	LOCATION	; and escorted Mrs.
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	, to whom he was related by marriage , in her flight from the city .

		After holding for a few years a commis - sion in the army of the Khedive of
Egypt	LOCATION	, he settled in
South Carolina	LOCATION	in time to receive the full benefits of the hell of reconstruction .

		Con - nection with the silver mines of
Mexico	LOCATION	, a con - sulship in
Australia	LOCATION	, and a mission to
Panama	LOCATION	at the time of the revolution are possibly the most interesting of his remaining experiences .

		His narrative is frank and relieved with humor , and the breadth of outlook it displays gives it value as a historical document .

W. B. Yeats	PERSON	's happy phrases , is not itself the hap - piest title that Mr.
Morris	PERSON	might have found for his book ; but the book itself , the work of an American student , is perhaps the most compre - hensive of all the recent surveys of the Irish ren - ascence .

		And it differs to advantage from most American surveys in rather under-emphasizing than otherwise the purely aesthetic aspect of that wonderful transformation of a small nationality so intimately related to our own repubb ' c that , as the case is apt to be with members of a common family , we have most appreciated its less essential excellences .

		What interests us in the new
Ireland	LOCATION	is no longer the shadow-literature that so charmed the world a dozen years ago ; it is the reality that has emerged from the shadow , and the pungent , ironic , realistic , tragic personal attitudes to which this reality has given birth .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	, while entirely just to
Yeats	PERSON	as a poet , is just also to
Yeats	PERSON	's negative and life-denying philosophy : it is a pity that he has included in his account of the minor poets two or three at least who are en - titled to the distinction only because they are blessed with Celtic names and an infinite capacity for pseudo-Celtic wool-gathering .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	is particularly happy in his characterizations of
A.E.	LOCATION	,
Synge	PERSON	, and
James Stephens	PERSON	, but we miss that recent remarkable apparition
James Joyce	PERSON	, and is it the part of good taste to take `` Fiona
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 531
Macleod	PERSON	, '' that
Highland	LOCATION	echo , so seriously ?

		Might we not have had a still more detailed ac - count of ``
John Eglinton	PERSON	, '' a rare mind certainly , a unique figure in modern criticism , whose writ - ings should long before this have been brought before the American public ?

		IN
CANADA	LOCATION	'S WONDERFUL NORTHLAND .

		By
W. Tees Curran	PERSON	and
H. A. Calkins	PERSON	.

		Putnam ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		When it is borne in mind that the Province of
Quebec	LOCATION	alone is larger than
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	combined , and that its re - sources are as yet only vaguely suspected , Mr.
W. Tees Curran	PERSON	and Mr.
Harold A. Calkins	PERSON	, ex - plorers of the coast region bordering the south - eastern portion of
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	, are found to be justified in naming the account of their expedition `` In
Canada	LOCATION	's Wonderful Northland . ''

		So im - pressed are they with the agricultural and other possibilities of this region that Mr.
Curran	PERSON	con - fidently predicts the early building of the largest grain storehouses in the world on the shores of
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	, and the establishment of steamship lines between there and European ports .

		In an earlier work of his issued by the Canadian govern - ment and entitled `` Glimpses of
Northern Canada	LOCATION	, a land of Hidden Treasure , '' which he tells us , with manifest exaggeration , `` found its way into every public library , both at home and in foreign lands , '' he described his first impressions of this vast and little-explored territory .

		His later book continues the description of the marvellous virgin land awaiting development .

		As far north as the
Nastapoka River	LOCATION	he and his party pushed their explorations , and the varied and well-written nar - rative has all the illustrations and maps that could be desired , though no attempt has been made to mark the route followed .

		Such graphic itinerary would have been a help to the reader .

		The book prefigures , in all likelihood , a remarkable expan - sion northward in the near future .

		GREAT INSPIRERS .

		By
J. A. Zahm	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The `` woman in the case '' in Dr.
Zahm	PERSON	's `` Great Inspirers '' exerts no baleful influence ; on the con - trary , she is the moving spirit to noble achieve - ment .

		St.
Jerome	PERSON	's benefactress and powerful aid ,
Paula	LOCATION	, mother of Blesilla and Eustochium , and grandmother of the younger
Paula	LOCATION	, all of whom were his devoted disciples and able assistants ; and
Beatrice	PERSON	, adored and idealized by Dante these are the chief figures in the book , the in - spirers of great men and thus , by a reflected ' light , great themselves .

		But
Paula	PERSON	and her daugh - ters were remarkable in themselves , and
Beatrice	PERSON	, viewed as a veritable personage , as Dr.
Zahm	PERSON	would have her viewed , and not as a poetic ab - straction , must have possessed a rare nobility of soul .

		The book is a thoughtful and scholarly production , and illustrates anew its author 's vari - ety of learning and range of interests .

		To many he is better known under his pseudonym , ``
H. J. Mozans	PERSON	, '' as the writer of several fascinating books of travel and a work on `` Woman in Science . ''

		HIGHWAYS AND BYWAYS IN NOTTINGHAM - SHIRE .

		By
J. B. Firth	PERSON	.

		Nottingham , according to an eighteenth-century authority , `` may be called , as a man may say , Paradise Restored , for here you find large streets , fair built houses , fine women , and many coaches rattling about , and their shops full of all mer - chantable riches . ''

		This pleasant town , with the region about it , forms the subject of the latest addition to the `` Highways and Byways '' series that has already given us agreeable descriptions of many other English counties .

		Wide valleys , broad meadows , the famous Sherwood Forest -LRB- what is left of it -RRB- , old castles and abbeys and churches , of such matters does the book treat in a readably discursive fashion , with a copious fund of anecdote , tradition , metrical lore , and curious family history .

BRIGGS	PERSON	TALKS .

		By
Madeline Yale Wynne	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		That free verse still remains in the fluid , forma - tive stage is the impression left by this little book of sketches and anecdotes of
New England	LOCATION	life and character .

		Any new hand , it would seem , may give this now popular form a light touch as it spins , like a vase on the potter 's wheel , through a series of novel , if ephemeral , shapes ; and Mrs.
Wynne	PERSON	's touch in this field , as in many others she has entered is not only light , but deft , confident , and original .

		She adds rhyme at her pleasure , and even rhyme within rhyme .

		A system of carefully carried out indention keeps the reader constantly advised as to the progress of the rhyme-scheme .

		The following ten-line poem shows , within nar - row limits , the newest efflorescence of vers libre : You could n't faze
Uncle Sid	ORGANIZATION	.

		They tell this yarn On him : One day
Hiram	PERSON	, Uncle
Sid	PERSON	's hired man , Went out to the barn And hung himself to a beam .

		A neighbor found him , and ran In and told
Uncle Sid	ORGANIZATION	.

		He jest shook his head And said , '' Wall , wall , what '11 Hiram do next , I wonder ! ''

		Rhyme , it will be seen , follows indention , just as `` trade follows the flag . ''

		And , `` No indention , no rhyme '' ; just as the earlier
New England	LOCATION	once declared , `` No representation , no taxation . ''

		Some of these small , quaint pieces have the fortune to end rhyme-wise , when the adaptability of this method for closing a pointed anecdote with an epigrammatic crack of the whip becomes quite ap - parent .

		The following lines wind up a debate on Sabbath-breaking among gardeners : I 've often tried But never yet have seed The difference between A-flickin ' off a worm And a-snakin ' out a weed .

		The elaborate scheme of illustration is more notable for consistency than for strength .

		532 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 14	DATE	HYGIENE IN
MEXICO	LOCATION	.

		By
Alberto J. Pani	PERSON	.

		Putnam 's ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The present political and social conditions in
Mexico	LOCATION	, even under the most optimistic interpreta - tion , can hardly be considered promising for fruit - ful scientific or social endeavor .

		Hence our surprise at this seriously intelligent study of the sanitary problems of the afflicted capital city and of the still more fundamental educational problems upon whose prior solution any considerable san - itary improvement in the state must ultimately rest .

		The literacy of the Mexican population as a whole is only about thirty per cent .

		Obviously compulsory primary education must precede the compulsory sanitation which the author proposes for every city in which `` the mortality shall exceed the maximum limit of tolerated contamination . ''

		The mortality in Mexican cities is nearly three times that in our own cities .

		The work deals more with the author 's hopes for future achievements than with past accomplishments .

		The problem as he conceives it consists in `` hygienizing the popula - tion , physically and morally , and in endeavoring , by all available means , to improve the precarious economical situation of our proletariat . ''

		Hygiene in our sister would-be republic is evidently synon - omous with universal social uplift .

		A Gallic fer - vor for system and for a well-expanded and rounded-out scheme for the hygienic redemption of the state permeates the work .

		Sefior
Pani	PERSON	's treatise on public hygiene in
Mexico	LOCATION	is like unto a shoot out of dry ground .

		Let us hope it is an omen of better days to come in that troubled land , and a forecast of the intellectual and scientific awaken - ing which must prepare the way for the coming Mexican social renaissance .

		THE MIRROR OF GESTURE .

		The
Abhinaya Darpana of Nandikesvara	ORGANIZATION	.

		Translated by
Ananda Coomaraswamy	ORGANIZATION	and
Gopala Kris	PERSON	- nayya Duggirala .


Harvard University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The best of the European actors and actresses to whom are dedicated the curious pages of the Indian `` Mirror of Gesture '' can not but be grateful for the high ideal of their art here set forth with a sincerity half concealed by oriental subtlety .

		According to the preface by
Ananda Coomaras	PERSON	- wamy , the volume is merely an introduction `` to Indian dramatic technique and to oriental acting in general , '' brought out in English not so much to be a pattern for occidental actors as to inspire them `` with the enthusiasm and the patience need - ful for the recreation of the drama '' in the western world .

		Nothing in this ancient `` deliberate art '' `` is left to chance , '' nothing is changed in the ritual of the legitimate Hindu drama as it passes down from age to age , ignoring the claims of its finite interpreters , demanding of them , indeed , a self - discipline and a submission to studied forms far more complete than
Europe	LOCATION	has ever understood or admitted .

		Consequently each exhibition of the actor 's skill is `` altogether independent of his own emotional condition '' ; he is never allowed to ex - ploit his theme for personal effect , as is too often done by our contemporary stars .

		Dramatic interpretation in
India	LOCATION	, however , is by no means so stiff and lifeless as its traditional technique might seem to imply ; it `` wears an air of perfect spontaneity , '' although `` hardly a posi - tion of the hands or of the body ... has not a recognized name and a precise significance . ''

		Science , therefore , together with art , is at the basis of the `` Mirror of Gesture '' a science of expression much more fundamentally studied than anything our schools have yet produced . ''

		The four aims of human life virtue , wealth , pleasure , and spiritual freedom '' are expressed through obser - vation of human habits combined with archaeologi - cal study of ancient symbols and traditional modes of thought .

		Behind them all is the wonderful quiet of the reflective oriental mind , which compares its pure god to an actor-dancer .

		ENGLISH BIOGRAPHY .

		By
Waldo H. Dunn	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Seventh in the series entitled `` The Channels of English Literature '' comes Professor
Dunn	PERSON	's study of English biography , a work of careful research and also the first formal treatise on its subject .

		It does for English biography what an - other pioneer work of a few years ago did for autobiography ; we mean Mrs.
Burr	PERSON	's treatise on that theme .

		It traces the rise and growth of biography in our language and supplies references for those who wish to push their inquiries further .

		Its methodical procedure is seen at the very outset in the ten pages of Introduction devoted to an elucidation of the meaning of `` biography . ''

		Then follows the orderly survey of the field , with two chapters given to autobiography as a species of biography , and with considerations of `` problems and tendencies of the present , '' a comparative view of biographical works , and a glance at English biography as literature .

		The author names Xen - ophon 's `` Memorabilia '' as `` the first specimen of deliberate biography '' a rather unexpected char - acterization of those fragments of Socratic wisdom and habit of life .

		In its appended matter and its index the book maintains the scholarly system with which it begins .

		It is a useful manual , welcome to the lovers of one of the most fascinating depart - ments of literature .

		Mr.
Hankey	PERSON	's theme in `` A Student in Arms '' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- is the growth of spiritual strength in the peoples at war .

		We see the trenches as a great melting pot , where the Cockney is glorified , the ordinary Englishman learns to philosophize ,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is taught to be on time , the practical man of affairs learns from the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	product the art of living , and the church learns how to reach men 's hearts .

		Mr.
Hankey	PERSON	scores three kinds of war literature : journalese or heroics , written by men who make copy out of soldier 's blood , comic sketches , and stories by ladies who portray the soldier as a curly-haired darling .

		For his part , the author treats the subject in a matter-of-fact way , which , by its very rarity , becomes effective .

		The few pages of heroics are forceful and vera - cious .

		The collection of original autograph dispatches of General
U. S. Grant	PERSON	, during the Wilderness cam - paign , 1864-5 , for the capture of
Richmond	LOCATION	, em - bracing nearly five hundred dispatches to President
Lincoln	PERSON	, to Secretary of War
Stanton	PERSON	, to Secretary of the
Navy Welles	ORGANIZATION	, and to his generals , was sold on the
afternoon	TIME	of
June 8	DATE	by Stan .


V. Henkels	PERSON	,
1304	DATE	Walnut Street ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	.

		The col - lection was kept together by Major
George Keller Leet	PERSON	, who held that rank in the regular army with brevet lieutenant-colonel .

		He was in charge of the headquarters in
Washington	LOCATION	during the time that General Grant was at
City Point	ORGANIZATION	,
Va.	LOCATION	, which was his headquarters during the campaign .

		Major
Leet	PERSON	was a member of his staff .

		The dispatches had been in the possession of the family ever since and were sold by order of his son ,
Grant Leet	PERSON	.

		`` I will fight it out on this line if it takes all
summer	DATE	, '' were the words which
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	used when about to enter on the Wilderness campaign .

		The dispatches , which are , with a very few excep - tions , virtually full autograph letters signed by him , are the originals handed to his Aide-de-Camp for the purpose of transmitting them by wire to the persons indicated .

		They are written in terse , vigorous language , in a fine , clear hand .

		The most momentous questions are decided with the same certain , calm , quick judgment as are those of minor importance .

		His personal interest in his com - manders and lesser officers and the sympathy be - tween himself and President Lincoln are vividly revealed .

		Leaving City Point in pursuit of Gen - eral
Lee	PERSON	, after the evacuation of
Richmond	LOCATION	, we find Grant moving swiftly from place to place , at
1917	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 535 times pencilling his orders on `` scraps of paper . ''

		All dispatches are in excellent condition and the collection was one of the most remarkable of Civil War material ever offered .

		Few erasures or changes of any kind appear .

		If Grant needed any vindication of his ability as a general , the material in this collection performs that service .

		At one moment he is communicating with the Secretary of War with reference to necessary military place - ments in the Valley of the
Shenandoah	LOCATION	; the next moment he is asking ree ` nf orcements for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the West and wants to know the names of com - manders and corps with
Sherman	PERSON	in his march through
Georgia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Henkels	PERSON	says of the collec - tion : These dispatches , many of them written during the turmoil of strife , naturally indicate the char - acter of the man .

		When they relate to the enemy no vindictiveness is shown , no exultation over success , only kindly feelings expressed toward all , insisting on proper performance of duty by his generals , re - proving their seeming deficiencies in carrying out orders by putting them in other places more fitting to their abilities , upholding his agreements with the enemy in relation to the exchange of prisoners , scold - ing the Federal authorities when his orders in this respect were not carried out , receiving emissaries from the enemy with courtesy and kindness .

		These traits in his character are so forcibly portrayed in these dispatches that it is no wonder he won the love and respect not only of his own army , but that of - the enemy , who laid down their arms before him on the field at
Appomattox	LOCATION	.

		By those traits he proved that a man can be a soldier , and at the same time have a feeling of brotherly love for his fellow-men , even if opposed to him in arms .

		A dispatch , dated
July 16 , 1864	DATE	, to Major-Gen - eral
Halleck	PERSON	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
D. C.	PERSON	, shows the precau - tion Grant took to prevent the Confederate forces under Early and others from invading that city .

		In a dispatch to Major General Ord ,
August 25 , 1864	DATE	, he says : I have just received the dispatch to
General Pickett	ORGANIZATION	, which was intercepted by our Signal Officers -LRB- with reference to the mine to be exploded at
Petersburg	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		If there is to be any blowing up it will probably be in front of the 18th corps -LSB- which Ord commanded -RSB- .

		The men who are likely to be exposed however ought to be notified so they will not be stampeded .

		If we can be on our guard when a mine is sprung the enemy ought to be repulsed with great slaughter .

		When do you understand from the dispatch the ex - plosion was to take place ?

		On
November 30 , 1864	DATE	, he wires Major-General Butler : I have files of
Savannah	LOCATION	and
Augusta	LOCATION	papers sent me by Col.
Mulford	PERSON	from which I gather that
Bragg	LOCATION	has gone to
Georgia	LOCATION	, taking with him what I judge to be most of the forces from about Wilming - ton .

		It is therefore important that
Weitzel	PERSON	should get off during his absence , and , if successful in effect - ing landing , he may , by a bold dash , also succeed in capturing
Wilmington	LOCATION	.

		Make all the arrangement for his departure so that the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	will not be de - tained one moment for the
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		Did you order
Palmer	PERSON	to make move proposed yesterday ?

		It is im - portant that he should do so without delay .

		He says to Major-General
Halleck	PERSON	on
December 8 , 1864	DATE	: Please direct
General Dodge	ORGANIZATION	to send all the troops he can spare to Gen.
Thomas	PERSON	.

		With such an order

June 14	DATE	men an -LRB- women alike _ are drawn in sympathy toward the man , who from small beginnings makes his way from the bottom rung of the ladder to the top .

		Hence the appeal of `` Big Bill ''
Matthews	PERSON	, super-man and dominant figure in THE ROAD OF AMBITION
Elaine Sterne	PERSON	's big novel in which the great steel industry of the nation serves as a background .

		Eeviewers are more than generous in their praise of this story .

		Some say it is The Big Novel of the Year and others that it is `` The biggest story in years . ''


New York Tribune	ORGANIZATION	says : `` A big story about a big man , who did big things in a big way . ''


Boston Herald	ORGANIZATION	: `` Miss
Sterne	PERSON	's story has the appeal of its hero 's powerful personality . ''


Philadelphia	LOCATION	North American : `` All play their parts well so that when the final curtain falls there is nothing more to be said or thought . ''

		Richmond Dispatch : `` A story of the masses and the classes the kind that keeps the world from going back . ''


New York	LOCATION	World : `` This author has written a story vividly and richly hu - man and completely convincing , reveal - ing in herself ` Big Bill 's ' own power to reach the goal of purpose . ''

		Pittsburgh Press : `` One is awed by the bigness and vitality of this book which fairly shakes with power .

		It is the best novel in years . ''

		They had probably better be sent to
Louisville	LOCATION	, for I fear either Hood or Breekenridge will get into the
Ohio	LOCATION	river .

		I will submit whether it is not advisable to call on
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	and
Illinois	LOCATION	for sixty thousand men for thirty days .

		If
Thomas	PERSON	has not struck yet he ought to be ordered to hand over his command to
Schofield	PERSON	.

		There is no better man to repel an attack than
Thomas	PERSON	, but I fear he is too cautious to ever take the initiative .

		He wires as follows on
March 2 , 1865	DATE	, to Secre - tary
Stanton	PERSON	: My dispatch of
this afternoon	TIME	answers yours of
9.30 this evening	TIME	.

		I do not think it possible for Lee to send anything towards
Washington	LOCATION	unless it should be a brigade of Cavalry .

		Augur -RCB- s returns show a good force of cavalry to meet anything of the kind , besides a large infantry force .

		The great number of deserters and refugees coming in daily enable us to learn if any considerable force starts off almost immediately as soon as it starts .

		Except in the neighborhood of
Stanton	PERSON	there is not now North of the Chickahominy 5,000 rebel soldiers , in - cluding all the guards on the Central Kailroad .

		I have not sent a force to the Eappahannock , but shall do so as soon as possible .

		Mr.
Henkels	PERSON	also sold on the
evening	TIME	of
June 8	DATE	a collection of important autographs , including rare letters and documents relating to
Charles I	PERSON	, the Regicides , and other important characters of that time ; a fine series of letters from Colonel
John Trumbull	PERSON	with regard to his painting at the
National Capital	ORGANIZATION	and to his estate ; a series of pathetic letters from
Robert Morris	PERSON	, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence , to
John Nicholson	PERSON	during his financial difficulty ; doc - uments signed by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	and
Franklin	PERSON	.

		There was also the autograph manuscript , signed by
Samuel F. Smith	PERSON	, of the song `` America . ''

		It consisted of the five stanzas complete , including the lines about this country 's one hundred years .

		A letter of the author , which accompanied the song , denied the generally accepted statement that he re - ceived money for copies of it .

		`` I have never under any circumstances , '' he says , `` received pay for autographs of `
America	LOCATION	, ' though I have written many for benevolent causes .

		I take pleasure in aiding your good designs by sending two copies of the song . ''

		Another interesting item was a lock of
John Milton	PERSON	's hair , in an old black and ormolu miniature frame .

		The vendor was
Miss Martineau	PERSON	, of
Fairlight Lodge	ORGANIZATION	,
Hastings	PERSON	.

		She is the great granddaughter of Dr.
Robert Batty	PERSON	, of the `` European Magazine , '' who died in
1859	DATE	.

		He ob - tained the lock of hair from
John Harte	PERSON	, Dr.
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	's executor .

		Before
Johnson	PERSON	ac - quired it ,
Joseph Addison	PERSON	is supposed to have been the owner , but it is on record that
Johnson	PERSON	took a great interest in
Milton	LOCATION	's surviving daugh - ter , and composed a prologue recited by
David Garrick	PERSON	at a benefit arranged for her .

		It is pos - sible , therefore , that
Johnson	PERSON	obtained it from her .

		Dr.
Batty	PERSON	gave a portion of the hair to
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, who shared it with
Robert Browning	PERSON	.

		The remainder had been at
Fairlight Lodge	LOCATION	ever since .

		The poem by
John Keats	PERSON	was written after seeing the lock at
Leigh Hunt	ORGANIZATION	's house .
