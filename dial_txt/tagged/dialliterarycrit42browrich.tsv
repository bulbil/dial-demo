		BRIEFER MENTION 20 NOTES 20 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 21 A CLINIC ON THE DRAMA . ''

		Why have we made such a beggarly mess of our drama ? ''

		The question is a pertinent one , and Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	, who first puts it and then attempts to find its answer , is an expert whose critical opinion is backed by a record of very substantial performance in the field of dramatic craftmanship , a record cover - ing a quarter-century of industrious activity .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, who recently visited this country , took occasion to deliver himself of certain views concerning the art which he represents , views which were primarily offered to academic au - diences at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	and are now being circulated in printed form among the larger < American public .

		The Harvard address , upon '' The Corner Stones of Modern Drama , '' is published in pamphlet form ; while the Yale lecture , called '' Literature and the Modem Drama , '' appears in the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' for
December	DATE	.

		Both are thoughtful and weighty deliverances , sound in their fundamental con - tentions and deserving of the most attentive consideration .

		The primary cause of our barrenness in dramatic production is naturally provided by our inheritance of puritanism .

		If the better elements of our society -- or even a large pro- portion of these better elements -- avert their gaze from the drama , or are filled with suspicion when they actually give it a share of their atten - tion , it becomes a matter of course that support of the stage and encouragemeilt of dramatic writing will be left to a public of lower average quality than would otherwise be the case .

		This lowering of the standards of taste will be notice - able all along the line ; it will give everywhere an undue advantage to the artificial over the natural , to the mediocre over the excellent , to vacuity over thought , and to vidgarity over re - finement .

		It is not too much to say , with Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, -- '' We owe the imbecility and paralysis of our drama to-day to the insane rage of puritanism that would see nothing in the theatre but a horrible , unholy thing to be crushed and stamped out of existence ... The feel - ing of horror and fright of the theatre , engendered at the Restoration , is even to-day widely prevalent and operative among religious classes in
England	LOCATION	and Amer - ica .

		It muddles and stupefies our drama , and degrades THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, it from the rank of a fine art to the rank of a somewhat disreputable form of popular entertainment . ''

		This is surely an unwholesome condition , and , what is more to the * point , it is an unnat - ural condition for the English-speaking people .

		For our race '' is naturally and instinctively a dramatic race ; a race of action ; a race fitted for great exploits on the outer and larger stage of the world 's history , and also for great ex - ploits on the inner and smaller stage of the theatre .

		We have proved our mettle on both stages .

		We hold the world 's prize for drama . ''

		And yet our estate is now so miserable that even the smaller European countries are justified in pointing the finger of scorn in our direction .

		Turning from his general arraignment to more specific considerations , Mr.
Jones	PERSON	proceeds to conduct a clinic upon our pitiable case , and indicates the '' symptoms and conditions '' which seem to him the '' secondary and resultant causes and signs '' of the disease from which we suffer .

		They are , in the order of statement -LRB- which is also the order of their importance -RRB- the following : The divorce of our drama from literature , the absence '' from modern English plays of any sane , consistent , and intelligible ideas about morality , '' the separation of the drama from its sister arts , the lack of standards and traditions , the want of suitable means for the training of actors , the star system with all its attendant evils , and the too great '' dependence upon trans - lations and adaptations of foreign plays . ''

		All of these discouraging facts are '' inextricably related to each other ; many of them are , indeed , only different aspects of the same facts ; they are woven all of a piece with each other , and with that puritan horror of the theatre which I believe to be the cardinal reason that neither
England	LOCATION	nor
America	LOCATION	has to-day an art of the drama at all worthy the dignity , the resources , and the self-respect of a great nation . ''

		We might discuss each count of this indictment at length , but this condensed diagnosis is all that space will allow .

		In their attitude toward the stage , Mr.
Jones	PERSON	distinguishes three classes of people in the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American public .

		First , there are the mere seekers after amusement , '' newly enfranchised from the prison house of puritanism , eager to enjoy themselves at the theatre in the easiest way , without traditions , without any real judg - ment of plays or acting . ''

		This is the largest class , and next to it we have the class of those who occasionally visit the theatre , but generally feel uneasy about the drama , and are '' quite indifferent to its higher development and to its elevation into a fine art . ''

		The third class , a large one also , containing '' some of the sound - est and best elements of the Anglo-Saxon race , very influential , very respectable , very much to be regarded , and consulted , and feared , '' assumes an attitude of active hostility to the stage and all connected therewith .

		This hostile spirit , imagining its motives to be of the highest , '' everywhere sets up a current of ill-wiU and ill-nature toward the drama throughout the two entire nations ; it everywhere stimulates oppo - sition to the theatre ; it keeps alive prejudices that would otherwise have died down two hun - dred years ago ; and it is , in my opinion , the one great obstacle to the rise and development of a serious , dignified , national art of the drama . ''

		This is the spirit against which missionary effort should be directed , not so much in the way of denunciation as of appeal , for it is , after all , a spirit of sincerity , however mistaken in its view and however narrow in its knowledge .

		Such an appeal is eloquently voiced by our author in a lengthy passage from which the fol - lowing sentences may be extracted : '' The dramatic instinct is ineradicable , inexhaustible ; it is entwined with all the roots of our nature ; you may watch its incessant activity in your own children ; almost every moment of the day they are acting some little play ; as we grow up and strengthen , this dramatic in - stinct grows up and strengthens in us ; as our shadow , it clings to us ; we can not escape from it ; we can not help picturing back to ourselves some copy of this strange , eventful history of ours ; this strange earthly life of ours throws everywhere around us and within , us reflections and re-reflections of itself ; we act it over and over again in the chambers of imagery , and in dreams , and on the silent secret stage of our own soul .

		When some master dramatist takes these reflections , and combines them , and shapes them into a play for us , very Nature herself is behind him , working through him for our welfare .

		So rigidly economical , so zealously frugal is she , that what is at first a mere impulse to play , a mere impulse to masquerade and escape from life -- this idle pastime she transforms and glorifies into a masterpiece of wisdom and beauty ; it becomes our sweet and lovable guide in the great business and conduct of life .

		* ... This , then , is the use of the theatre , that men may learn the great rules of life and conduct in the guise of a play ; learn them , not formally , didactically , as they learn in school and in church , but pleasantly , insensibly , spon - taneously , and oftentimes , believe me , with a more as - sured and lasting result in manners and conduct ... Look at the vast population of our great cities crowding more and more into our theatres , demanding there to be given some kind of representation of life , some form of play ... The effect of your absence , and your dis - countenance , will merely be to lower the moral and intel - lectual standard of the plays that will be given .

		Will you never learn the lesson of the English Restoration , that when the best and most serious c lasses of the nation de - • '' The little mime which all children delight to play has but to wait for ^ schylus ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, in order to receive for ts content the whole of human culture . ''

1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL test and defame their theatre , it instantly justifies their abuse and becomes indeed a scandal and a source of cor - ruption ?

		Many of you already put Shakespeare next to the
Bible	LOCATION	, as the guide and inspirer of our race .

		Why then do you despise his calling , and vilify his disciples , and misunderstand his art ? ''

		These are searching questions , and the foe of the theatre , if he will but heed them , shoidd be led to an examination of his conscience that can hardly fail to soften inveterate prejudice and dis - arm hostile purpose .

		Having cleared the ground , as it were , by the preliminary exposition of the obstacles with which the drama has to contend , Mr.
Jones	PERSON	proceeds to lay the corner stones of the dramatic edifice of the future .

		They are four in number .

		One is '' the recognition of the drama as the highest and most difficult form of literature '' ; another is the dramatist 's right '' to deal with the serious problems of life , with the passions of men and women in the spirit of the broad , wise , sane , searching morality of the Bible and Shakespeare '' ; another is '' the severance of the drama from popular entertainment '' and its establishment as an art '' in marked and eternal antagonism to popular entertainment '' ; and the fourth is the establishment of suitable systems of training for actors , and of schools -LRB- not in the narrow sense -RRB- for the encouragement of serious dramatic composition .

		Upon all of these sub - jects the author has something to say , and the first of them in particular , the relation of the drama to literature , is made the theme of the entire lecture delivered at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		How many American plays , '' he asks , '' are in active circu - lation among you , so that on reading them over you can put your finger on the fine passages that amused you or stirred you when you saw them acted ? ''

		The question is too evidently ironical to call for an answer .

		The essence of the argument that follows is that our drama may acquire the character of literature , not by cloth - ing its lines in the verbal garb of imitative blank verse , and not by clothing its characters in the costumes of past ages , but by plunging into the pulsating life of the present , and by por - traying real men and women in real relations one with another .

		In some respects , Mr.
Jones	PERSON	looks upon Amer - ica as more favorably predisposed than
England	LOCATION	to foster the reformed drama of the future .

		Since his return , he has unburdened himself of the im - pressions made by his visit in the columns of the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Telegraph , '' noting particularly the immense hold which the theatre has upon our public , and the urbane spirit of the audiences that throng our playhouses .

		With us , the theatre is '' much more of an institution , less of an after - dinner entertainment '' than with the English public .

		This view is flattering , but possibly a bit roseate .

		In similar strain , we read in the Har - vard lecture : '' Your nation has , what all young - nations have , what
England	LOCATION	is losing , the power to be moved by ideas , and that divine resilient quality of youth , the power to be stirred and frenzied by ideals . ''

		We should like to believe this , and are inclined to think that there is some reason for such a faith .

		At least , we may do much to make it truth by taking to heart the elo - quent adjuration which closes this address . ''

		Let your lives be fuller of meaning and purpose than ours have lately been ; have the wisdom richly to endow and imceasingly to foster all the arts , and all that makes for majesty of life and character rather than for material prosperity and comfort .

		Especially foster and honour this supreme art of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's , so much neg - lected and misunderstood in both countries : endow it in all your cities ; build handsome , spacious theatres ; train your actors : reward your dramatists , sparingly with fees , but lavishly with laurels ; bid them dare to paint American life sanely , truthfully , searchingly , for you .

		Dare to see your life thus painted .

		Dare to let your drama ridicule and reprove your follies and vices and deformities .

		Dare to let it mock and whip , as well as amuse you .

		Dare to let it be a faithful mirror .

		Make it one of your chief counsellors .

		Set it on the siimmit of your national es - teem , for it will draw upwards all your national life and character ; upwards to higher and more worthy levels , to starry heights of wisdom and beauty and resolve and aspiration . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The serious study of fiction , so warmly advo - cated by
Professor Phelps of Yale	ORGANIZATION	, is finding favor with many novelists of the day -- or , one might safely affirm , with them all .

		Mr.
Booth Tarkington	PERSON	enlarges on the benefits of such study , if devoted to novels of a certain type , in familiarizing the student with
Indiana	LOCATION	life and manners .

		Mr.
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	is reported as declaring that novel-study will be required for a degree from the
Jungle University	ORGANIZATION	, soon to be established at
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	.

		M r.
George Ada	ORGANIZATION	says a good word for the movement as one -LRB- we will suppose -RRB- likely to result in a more serious study of college widowhood and other weighty sociological problems .

		Expectation is cherished that a student would gladly devote three or four times the number of hours to a course in modern novels that he would give to one in ancient language and literature , with a correspondingly greater intellectual quickening .

		Says Professor Phelps : `` The two most beneficial ways to study a novel are to regard it , first , as an art form , and , secondly , as a manifestation of intel - lectual life . ''

		To this Mr.
Ade	PERSON	adds : '' But there are other ways .

		It is desirable to ascertain the identity of best sellers , and to study the reasons why they sell .

		The mechanism of publication should be 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, studied also ; as , for example , the methods of pub - lishers in negotiating royalties , the best methods of street-car and bill-board advertising , the art of printing on rotten paper , '' etc. .

		Manifestly the great novel-manufacturing industry must be recognized .

		Mumbling over the mummies of antiquity will no longer answer .

		^ ^ ■ ^ The history and futility of enforced SPELLING-REFORM were ably discussed by Professor
Mark H. Liddell	PERSON	in a recent lecture before the
Twentieth Century Club of Boston	ORGANIZATION	.

		So-called re - form was undertaken as early as
1200	DATE	B. C. by Orm in his attempt to deVise a method of distin - guishing long from short vowels .

		Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, among countless others possessed of more zeal than knowledge , tried her royal hand at revising our spelling .

		-LRB- Our own chief magistrate follows a dis - tinguished precedent . -RRB-

		In the `` classic '' age the movement halted , but received fresh impulse in the middle of the nineteenth century .

		`` The current movement , '' said the lecturer ; '' furnishes little that is new , in spite of a somewhat impossible combina - tion of amateur enthusiasm , professional beneficence , and executive authority . ''

		He well urged that easy spelling might prove hard reading . ''

		So many of our strong words being monosyllabic , of two or three sounds , it would be very difficult to identify them rapidly if they were spelled phonetically . '' ''

		It is the eye that reads , not the ear : the value of an eye sug - gestion depends upon its distinction from the forms about it . ''

		Many other arguments were brought forward against spelling-reform as at present under - taken ; but it was not denied that reform is possible , even desirable , if instituted , for example , by a rightly constituted
National Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Significant in con - nection with this whole subject , and encouraging also , is the recent refusal of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to follow the lead of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	in the matter of heterography .

		■ • `` The old '' Farmer 's Almanac '' is appearing at this new-year 's season as a welcome visitor in many households , especially in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	states .

		Its respectable antiquity and unchanging form make it almost an American institution .

		Worthy of Poor
Richard	PERSON	himself are some of its maxims , as for ex - ample : '' Every man should attend well to his own business ; but this does not mean that he should never go from home . '' ''

		Economy is a virtue ; but there is a true and a false economy . '' ''

		While the hay should n't be shaken out when the morning dew is heavy upon it , you need not lie abed for the dew to dry ; there is plenty to do . ''

		Obvious at a glance is the wider application of the following : '' It used to be thought that anything in the shape of apples would do for making cider ; but if you want a first - class product , you must use good stock . ''

		The house - wife is warned that '' making mince pies is a serious matter and not to be lightly undei-taken .

		All the materials should be of the best quality , each ingre - dient have its due proportion , and the aggregate be blended into a harmonious whole . ''

		Weather pre - dictions in this almanac are eminently safe and conservative .

		The likelihood of '' cold , raw winds '' in early
March	DATE	will be disputed by none , nor the probability of '' a few days of fine weather '' later on .

		The occm ` rence of '' a few warm days '' toward the middle of
May	DATE	is put down as not beyond the bounds of reasonable expectation .

		The unconscious humor of this historic annual makes it very cheerful reading .

		...
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's attempted overthrow of Shake - speare now attracts the attention of the literary world .

		The first instalment of this remorseless dis - section of Shakespeare -- whereby it is intended to tumble him down from a usm * ped eminence -- ap - pears in the
December	DATE	'' Fortnightly Review , '' and consists mainly in a picking to pieces of ''
King Lear	PERSON	'' in order to display all its absurdities , anachronisms , improprieties , and impossibilities .

		`` The unquestion - able glory of a great genius which Shakespeare en - joys , '' declares his latest critic , '' and which compels writers of om '' time to imitate him , and readers and spectators to discover in him non-existent merits -- thereby distorting their aesthetic and ethical under - standing -- is a great evil , as is every untruth . ''

		With that the Russian reformer girds himself to his self-appointed task of rectifying error and exposing sham , with all the narrowness and aU the devotion to one idea which we expect in a prophet but hardly desire in a literary critic .

		Of course what this honest unbeliever in Shakespeare fails to perceive , and what therefore puzzles him , is that literature and life , how - ever closely related , are not identical ; that in litera - ture the ideal element enters in to color and transform the bald reality , else poetry -LRB- whether lyric , epic , or dramatic -RRB- would be impossible .

		That his attack on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	will be taken seriously is not for a mo - ment to be apprehended , so amusing and at the same time so pathetic is this misdirection of great powers .

		... Alcohol as a stimulus to literary produc - tivity is the subject of recent research prosecuted by Dr.
F. van Vleuten	PERSON	, a German poet and medical student .

		In no country are the delights of wine , woman , and song more keenly appreciated than among the Teutons ; and as they are preeminently a writing and a wine and beer drinking people , their ideas on the relation of liquor to literature are worth considering .

		Out of one hundred and fifty leading German writers who were questioned on their habits and views in respect to the cup that cheers and also , occasionally , inebriates , one hun - dred and fifteen replied ; and the general nature of their replies is published in a
Berlin	LOCATION	literary journal .

		Ninety per cent avoid all alcoholic stimulants before work , but in hours of recreation find a glass of wine or beer refreshing and invigorating .

		The older men rather favor a moderate indulgence in drink even in working hours , while among the juniors total absti - nence is not without its followers .


Herr Adolf Wilbrandt	PERSON	, the novelist and dramatist , sends in a laconic answer : `` I drink wine , I also drink beer ,
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL because they increase my joy of living and intensify my emotions ; but I never take a drop of liquor in any form before work . ''

		On the whole , it is en - couraging to note a growing tendency in
Germany	LOCATION	to discriedit alcohol as an aid to good brain-work .

		The cold-water poets are gaining ground .

		• • • The people who do not read books are in so overwhelming a majority that it is a surprise , and a wholesome one , to readers to be reminded now and then of their own insignificant minority .

		One sin - gular fact is that writers of the greatest renown may have the fewest readers , -- as , for example ,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, MUton .

		Among eminent but little-read living authors , a clever English critic men - tions Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	and Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	.

		This writer -LRB- Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	-RRB- says : '' Few names could stand higher than his -LSB- Mr.
James	PERSON	's -RSB- , and yet it is prob - able that all the readers of his last novel could be comfortably housed in a town no bigger than Little - hampton .

		And if
Hitchin	LOCATION	were reserved for the genuine readers of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	there would prob - ably still be a number of empty houses . ''

		Those who really do read are these : '' Confirmed spinsters read books , studious bachelors read books , invalids read books ; dons and schoolmasters read books ; young men and women on their way to business read books ; school-girls and school-boys read books ; old-fashioned folk in the evening read books .

		And that is about all .

		The vast mass of persons that remain ... read no books .

		How can they ?

		Life comes first , and after life , play , and after play , sleep .

		Books are embroidery . ''

		• • • The Index Expurgatorius as a book-adver - tiser is demonstrating its merits in these days . ''

		Eve 's Diary , '' withdrawn fi'om circulation by a small country library , has leaped into something like national fame , and is in eager demand -- all because the artist illustrating this harmless skit of
Mark Twain	PERSON	's showed a natural disinclination to de - part from accepted tradition as to Garden-of-Eden fashions .

		Another of the same author 's works , a book on
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	, is awaited with redoubled interest because of the unwillingness so long felt , or said to have been felt , by the publishers to issue it .

		The
Hohenlohe	PERSON	memoirs have been speedily brought into world prominence by the German Emperor 's explosions of indignation and wrath at their publi - cation .

		The
Kaiser	PERSON	blames Prince
Philip von Ho	PERSON	- henlohe , the late chancellor 's eldest son ; he in turn blames his brother Alexander ; Prince
Alexander	PERSON	throws the blame on Professor
Curtius	PERSON	, the literary adviser ; the Professor passes it on to the publisher ; and the publisher -- what can we suppose him to do but throw up his cap and shout long life to the Emperor ?


Baron Munchausen	PERSON	's prototype has been found by Professor Wilamowitz-MollendorfP , or , rather , the professor has found a number of ancient ingenious liars of the Munchausen stripe .

		One of them is Anti- phanes of
Berge	PERSON	.

		Stephen of Byzantium says that `` to be a man of
Berge	ORGANIZATION	is to speak nothing true . ''

		-LRB-
Burge	ORGANIZATION	, by the way , is , as
Strabo	PERSON	tells us , '' a village in the land of the Bisaltians as thou goest up the Stry - mon , distant from
Amphipolis	LOCATION	about two hundred stades . '' -RRB-

		In a certain city , which is nameless , Anti- phanes , in the fourth centmy
B.C.	LOCATION	, '' heard the sounds , in
summer	DATE	, which had been frozen the previous win - ter . ''

		Splendidly mendacious also was
Antonius Diogenes	PERSON	, who lived about the time of
Alexander of Macedon	ORGANIZATION	.

		His '' True History '' is a masterpiece of plausible lying , though he blundered into an accidental verity in describing the

		The Travels of a Truth-Seeker .

		* Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's `` Earthward Pilgrimage '' -- his bursting of the bonds of superstition and supernaturalism -- has proved -LRB- so most of his readers must think -RRB- a heavenward pilgrimage , a rising into regions of light and freedom , of breadth of view and clearness of vision .

		In the '' Prolegomena '' to his latest book , '' My Pil - grimage to the Wise Men of the East , '' a work originally designed as a part of his Autobio - graphy , occur the following sentences , which well indicate the nature of the narrative : '' Grateful am I to sit at the feet of any master , and nothing could give me more happiness than to find a master in the field to which the energies of my life have been given , -- religion and religions .

		But herein my researches and experiences gradually developed eyes of my own .

		Whether they are strong or feeble , exact or inexact , they are my own organically , my only ones ; and if they can not weigh the full value of what they see , there is always the hope that others will derive from a truthful report some contribution to knowledge , -- if only an example of visual perversity ! ''

		Here we meet again that most engaging of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	's qualities -- a willingness , an eagerness even , to be found in the wrong , if thereby the cause of truth can be served .

		As to the immediate occasion of this circumterres - trial voyage in quest of light , it appears that in
1882	DATE	Mr.
Conway	PERSON	was invited to lecture in
Australia	LOCATION	, and as his South Place -LRB-

		and without estimating them by some tradi - tional standard of authority ? ''

		Few enough , certainly ; but of those few the volume before us may fairly be counted as one .

		In the days of Professor
Andrews Norton	PERSON	, and of Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's preparatory studies for the pulj -RRB- it , the Harvard divinity students , who used a well-known text-book of
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's , were wont to style his daughters the '' Evidences of Christianity . ''

		So also Mr.
Conway	PERSON	found in the beautiful ladies of the late Colonel IngersoU 's family , evidences of the benign influence of free thought .

		Of the famous free-thinker 's warm - heartedness and family affection , and of his at - tachment to
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, our author writes : '' On IngersoU 's last visit to
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, -- to whom he was bountiful , -- he said , `` Walt , the mistake of your life was that you did not marry .

		There ought to be a woman here , ' he added , looking around at the poor chaotic room .

		-LRB- IngersoU 's address at the funeral of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	was the grandest and most impressive utterance of that kind which I have ever heard . -RRB-

		One very intimate friend of the family told me that when - ever one of them applied for money , IngersoU never asked how much , or what it was for , but pointed to a drawer and said , ' There it is ; help yourself . ' ''

		Comparatively brief is the author 's account of his travels until he reaches
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	.

		To his far-eastern impressions let us therefore give the most of our attention .

		A certain highly-educated Singhalese gentleman had some interesting things to tell the stranger . ''

		Mr.
Perera	PERSON	, a highly educated Buddhist , told me that the story of some English authorities of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	's birth from a virgin is unknown in
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Buddha 's mother ,
Maia	PERSON	, died some days after
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	's death , and in popular belief she was born a male god .

		My expressed hope that
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	's father had become a god - dess amused him ... My friend was a loving reader of
Emerson	LOCATION	, but could not at all feel the interest of our phUosopher in immortality .

		Indeed , he said that he thought a belief that death was entire extinction would be to the vast majority of the human race glad tidings .

		What he said on this matter reminded me of Shake - speare 's thoughts as expressed by
Hamlet	LOCATION	, and also by the condemned youth in ' Measure for Measure . '

		The humble millions of the world fear death largely because they have been terrified by notions of torment after death , or of interminable journeyings through vile forms . ''

		A reflection with which the author closes one of his East-Indian chapters is noteworthy .

		After referring to the repulsiveness of certain clauses of the orthodox Christian creed , taken in their naked literalness , he concludes : '' To those who like myself desire to preserve and continue all the varieties of religion in their own struc - tural development , it is a satisfaction to realize the extent to which the literalism of missionaries prevents their doing much real harm . ''

		A visit to the '' Countess '' Blavatsky and
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL her little court of admirers at Adyar is enter - tainingly narrated .

		We quote a few passages . ''

		Another person present was Mr.
W. T. Brown	PERSON	of
Glasgow	LOCATION	, a young ihan of pleasant manners , who told me some of his marvellous experiences ; but when I in - timated that I would like to carry away some little marvel of my own experience , the reply unpleasantly recalled vain attempts made through many years to witness a verifiable spiritualistic ' phenomenon . '

		I was once more put off with narratives of what had occurred before I came , and predictions of what might occur if I should come again .

		There was a cabinet shrine in which letters were deposited and swift answers received from the wonderful Mahatmas ; but when I proposed to write a note , I was informed that only a few days before the Mahatmas had forbidden any further cabinet corre - spondence .

		I said that was just my luck in such mat - ters ; whenever a miracle occurs I was always too soon or too late to see it .

		My experience was that of Alice in the Looking-glass , -- ' Jam yesterday , jam to-morrow , but never jam to-day ... ' '' She -LSB- Mme.
Blavatsky	PERSON	-RSB- asked what was my par - ticular proposal or desire .

		I said , ' I wish to find out something about the strange performances attributed to you .

		I hear of your drawing teapots from under your chair , taking brooches out of flowers , and of other miracles .

		If such things really occur I desire to know it , and to give a testimony to my people in
London	LOCATION	in favor of Theosophy .

		What does it all mean ? '

		She said with a serene smile , ' I will tell you , because you are a public teacher -LSB- here she added some flattery -RSB- , and you ought to know the truth : it is all glamour -- people think they see what they do not see -- that is the whole of it . '

		It was impossible not to admire the art of this confession .

		Mme. Blavatsky , forewarned by Professor
John Smith	PERSON	of my intended investigation , had arranged precisely the one manoeuvre that could thwart it . ''

		Of course the cunning of the Indian fakirs failed to deceive this troublesome investigator , who , with persistence backed by rupees , soon arrived at an explanation of their mysteries .

		Passing to weightier matters , the author en - deavors to clear away some of our false notions in regard to various Oriental customs and beliefs .

		One of these erroneous impressions is that Jug - gernaut is a cruel god , and that self-immolation under the wheels of his car is acceptable to him , or indeed practised at all .

		On the contrary , Mr.
Conway	PERSON	found him to be a benign and amiable deity , the `` Lord of Life '' and not of death .

		Some accident due to the pressure of a too-eager throng of his worshippers may have started the rimior of his blood-thirstiness .

		Another false notion is refuted in the following : '' The most curious and obstinate error in
Christen	LOCATION	- dom is the notion that the Moslems are not Christians , and that Mohammed occupies the place of Christ .

		They are not only Christians , but the only ones in the
East	LOCATION	who maintain literally all of the miracles ascribed to Christ in the gospels , or relating to his birth .

		It is very rare to find among them a sceptic . ''

		Then follows a remarkable conversation with
Arabi	PERSON	, at that time a prisoner in
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	, on the expected reappearance of the
Mahdi	PERSON	to over - throw the powers of wrong ; '' and with him , '' added Arabi , '' will presently appear Jesus Christ , who will rebuke the errors of those who claim to be the only Christians , and will unite all in the worship of one God . ''

		Asked why Mohammed himself shoidd not appear instead of Christ , he said : '' ' Mohammed can not appear again on earth ; he is dead . ' '

		But is not Christ similarly dead ? '

		* No , Christ never died .

		There are two men who never died -- Elias and Jesus .

		He who hung npon the cross was a mere effigy of Jesus .

		The crucifiers were deceived . ' ''

		The comparative mythology of religions inter - ested the author throughout his journey , and many instructive details were gathered together by him .

		The prosecution of his researches in Pal - estine was for some reason impracticable , and in opening his last chapter he regrets this . ''

		My pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East , '' he writes , '' coidd not be continued in
Palestine	LOCATION	.

		What Wise Men were there ? ''

		And further : '' But what I had seen and learned in
Asia	LOCATION	inspired me with a feeling that I had not yet come close enough for personal recognition to the wise man to whom
Christendom	LOCATION	was crying Lord ,
Lord	LOCATION	, while doing the reverse of what he said .

		I had known him as the cru - cified , had recognized him in the oppressed slave , and in many a suffering cause , but my occasional tentative essays about the individual Jesus -- the flesh-and-blood man -- still left him a sort of figurehead .

		There re - mained then a pilgrimage to be made , and I settled myself down to make it on shipboard during our week -LRB- nearly -RRB- of quarantine .

		But that exploration has continued to the day when this volume goes to press , and from notes written from time to time during twenty years are selected those contained in this final chapter . ''

		Into these still-continuing searchings for re - ligious truth there is here no space to enter ; we must take a reluctant leave of the book .

		Like its predecessor , Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's Autobiography , the work shows him in the ripeness of his powers , and in the enjoyment of his fearless in - dependence as a free-thinker , but never playing the part of a scoffer ; a reverent seeker , rather , for light and guidance , if such there be other than the inner light and the guidance that is , after all , self-guidance .

		His perceptions have lost nothing of their keenness , his hand has not forgot its cunning in literary craftsmanship .

		In form and appearance the book is patterned after the two volumes of the author 's
Autobi	PERSON	- ography , of which it constitutes an essential part .

		It has numerous illustrations , a photo - gravure frontispiece portrait of the author , facsimile letters addressed to him , copious foot - notes , and a good index .

		10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, Inside IjIght on Reconstruction .

		* The great problem which confronted the North at the close of the Civil War was first of all polit - ical , how the States that had attempted secession should be restored to their proper places in the
Union	LOCATION	.

		Closely connected with this was a ques - tion at bottom social in its nature , but designedly made one of politics , -- the future of the slaves that had just been freed .

		The great problem confronting the South was primarily economic and social .

		The question of restoration to the Union was indeed important , but of greater mo - ment was the rebuilding of ruined homes and the proper adjustment of relations with the blacks .

		The political features of Reconstruction have been studied thoroughly , and have been presented fairly well in several cases ; but it is doubtful if the final word has been said on the subject .

		Indeed , it can not very well be said until the com - paratively neglected field of economic and social Reconstruction receives more adequate treatment .

		The comparative neglect of this field is not hard to understand .

		There is a certain spectacidar attraction about things done at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The material for the political side of the contro - versy , consisting of speeches of Congressmen , Presidential Messages , Acts of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and of
State	ORGANIZATION	conventions and legislatures , has been widely published and is easily accessible .

		The economic and social conditions , upon a knowl - edge of which legislative action ought always to be based , are often imperfectly known at the time and are not well described , and hence lose importance in the perspective .

		In view of the excellent work done by Mr.
Edward McPherson	PERSON	in collecting documents on Reconstruction , one may naturally ask , Why another collection ?

		In the first place ,
McPher	PERSON	- son 's has long been out of print and is now diffi - cult to secure .

		In the second place , compiling in the midst of the Reconstruction period , the author could not always distinguish the essential from the non-essential .

		And finally , the work is too '' official , '' and lays too little stress upon the eco - nomic and social features of the case .

		That Dr.
Fleming	PERSON	recognizes the importance of this ele - ment in our history is shown by the space allotted to it in his '' Civil War and Reconstruction in
Alabama	LOCATION	. ''

		As might reasonably be expected , his collection of Reconstruction documents is note - worthy for the same reason .

		Most accounts of Reconstruction begin with the plans and theories ,
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's of course coming * DocuMENTAKY HiSTOKY OF Keconstruction .

		first .

		The first chapter of Dr.
Fleming	PERSON	's '' Docu - mentary History of Reconstruction '' gives some idea of the destruction of property incident to the war and of the consequent destitution among both whites and blacks , and also of the general temper of both races , all consisting of contemporaneous accounts by Northern as well as Southern ob - servers .

		Regarding the feeling of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	whites over the residts of the war ,
Northern	ORGANIZATION	opin - ion was divided at the time ; but the verdict of history is that they accepted defeat and all it meant as gracefully as coidd have been expected .

		Their economic ruin was well-nigh complete .

		It is hard to see how statesmen could ever have hoped to improve their feeling for
the Union	ORGANIZATION	by a policy calcidated to prolong this bad condition .

		Yet surrender was followed by confiscation frauds and the cotton tax of
five cents	MONEY	a pound .

		The lat - ter was believed by the
New York Chamber of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	to be unjust and oppressive , and an appeal was made to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to remove it , but to no avail .

		Such a policy appears more like one of revenge and punishment than of conciliation .

		The so-called '' Black Codes '' of the South called forth many diatribes at the time , and no doubt had their influence in bringing on some of the harsh legislation of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		When one studies the laws , as printed by Dr.
Fleming	PERSON	in connection with a statement of the conditions they were designed to meet , they appear far less outrageous than when studied through the speeches of Congressmen , or in Blaine 's '' Twenty Years in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It is only to be regretted that the author did not see fit to print some of them in parallel columns with laws then on the statute-books of several
New England States	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	among them .

		A negro who lived at the time declared that while some of these laws were '' diabolical and oppressive , '' many of them were passed only to deter freedmen from crime .

		In a prefatory note , Dr.
Fleming	PERSON	speaks of these laws as never having been in force because suspended by the military authorities immedi - ately after their passage .

		In the very document from which we have just quoted , they are spoken of as being in force in
Florida	LOCATION	.

		However , they never were extensively or rigidly enforced , -- conditions might have been better if they had been .

		Eighty pages of Dr.
Fleming	PERSON	's book are devoted to the
Freedman 's Bureau	ORGANIZATION	and the
Freedman	PERSON	's Bank , revealing the good these in - stitutions did and the wreck and ruin they finally wrought to both whites and blacks .

		The docu - ments relating to the bank , in particular , are interesting .

		At the time of its failure the de -

		It was simply wrecked by '' political jobbers , real estate pools , and fancy-stock sjseculators '' who had no regard for the rights of the depositors .

		A document of interest in connection with the recent movement to limit the elective fran - chise in the South is one entitled '' A Southern Proposal for a Fourteenth Amendment . ''

		After the rejection of the amendment proposed by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, there was a meeting of Southern gov - ernors in
Washington	LOCATION	to propose a form which would be acceptable to the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	whites .

		It differs from the Fourteenth Amendment in that it leaves it open to the States to disfranchise on account of race or color , but imposes as a pen - alty for so doing the exclusion of the entire race or color so disfranchised from the basis of rep - resentation .

		The first volume of Dr.
Fleming	PERSON	's collection of Reconstruction documents takes the story down `` to the readmission of the States .

		On the whole , the work is very creditable to both pub - lisher and editor .

		However , one can regret that there were not a few more editor 's notes .

		In several cases , these were really necessary to throw light on the dociunents used .

		Grieg and Saint-Saens are still with us as stars of magni - tude ; the quality of

		Readers have found in him a trustworthy guide to what was really best in the annual '' offerings , '' and they will be glad to see this new book from his pen , addressed primarily to the student of singing , but furnishing very good reading for the finished artist and the inter - ested layman .

		However , the book is eminently practical ; and with a minimum of technical phraseology it explains to the student the prin - cipal physiological problems in voice-training and the best methods of solving - them .

		Yet vocal mechanics is only a means to an end ; and this end is found in Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's reiterated definition of the art of singing as '' the inter - pretation of text by means of musical tones pro- duced by the human voice . ''

		In this definition is found the gravamen of his charge against the Italian school of teaching -- that it made the production of beautifid tone the '' ultimate pur - pose of vocal technic . ''

		Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	has plenty of praise , however , for the great masters of teaching in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		He recognizes the forma - tive period of this art to have been the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ; its '' bloom-time , '' the eighteenth , when '' technics were at their apogee , in the golden age of the art of singing . ''

		Two chapters , somewhat broader in their scope , may be recommended to many an alleged '' artist . ''

		These are entitled '' The Artist and the Public '' and `` The Lyric in Style . ''

		The critics vainly thunder .

		No one pays any attention to them .

		The glorified vocalist has her little army of worshippers , and in the religion of musician wor - ship there is neither conversion nor apostasy ... Style is general ; interpretation is particular .

		Style is the character of a school or a master .

		Interpretation is the disclosure of an individuality .

		Style may embrace all the songs of a single composer , though it seldom does ; but interpretation can apply to only one at a time . ''

		Probably few Americans are aware of the existence of the Worshipf id Company of Musi - cians in
London	LOCATION	.

		But its tercentenary was celebrated in
June , 1904	DATE	; for it was in
1604	DATE	that its last definitive charter was granted , by 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, James I .

		The powers therein assigned of licens - ing persons to '' use , practice , or teach the arts , mysteries , or occupations of music or dancing for lucre or gain within the City of
London	LOCATION	or liberties thereof '' have naturally lapsed ; but the Company has taken an active and honorable part in encouraging the art in
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		It was very sensibly decided to celebrate the anni - versary by a loan exhibition of musical instru - ments illustrative of the progress of music in
England	LOCATION	during the three hundred years .

		The exhibition , which lasted three weeks , was a pro- nounced success .

		Seventeen lectures were given by well-known artists and musical writers , with illustrative programmes -- very much the same kind of entertainment that Mr.
Arnold Dol	PERSON	- metsch has made so popular in this country .

		These addresses have been gathered and pub - lished in a handsome volume forming one of the '' Music-Story Series , '' under the caption '' En - glish Music , '' with a reproduction of Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	's picture '' The Heavenly Choir '' for a frontispiece , and plenty of cuts of quaint old instruments , and facsimiles of musical scores .

		Of prime historical interest was the lecture on '' The Evolution of the Piano-forte , '' by
T. L. Southgate	PERSON	, tracing the development of our most familiar instrument from the ancient didcimer down to the day of
Broadwood	LOCATION	,
Erard	LOCATION	, and
Steinway	ORGANIZATION	.

John Howard Payne	PERSON	, the American , and the music was com - posed by our London-born
Henry Rowley Bishop	PERSON	, best known as Sir

		He then goes on to say : '' I would fain dwell on this union of race , this mar - riage of heart and voice , and will therefore call your attention to a song , the product of an Englishman , which has , by adoption , become one of the national songs of our kith and kin on the other side of the

		The Star-spangled Banner , ' beloved by all our brethren in the

John Stafford Smith	PERSON	, in
London	LOCATION	, about
1750	DATE	, for a club which met at the ' Crown and Anchor ' tavern in the

		The club was called the ' Anacreontic , ' and for its social gatherings the president ,

		This was first published without a composer 's name , but shortly afterwards
Smith	PERSON	brought out a collection of Canzonets , Catches and Glees , which he sold at his house , 7 War - wick Street ,
Spring Gardens	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this volume , which contained only compositions by himself , we find * To Anacreon in Heaven . '

		The music of the Anacreon ode and that of ' The Star-spangled Banner ' is the same . ''

		His observations range over the whole musical field , from '' On Listen - ing to Music '' to `` Is Opera Doomed ? ''

		* In the discussion of social subjects , the preacher has certain great advantages over all other teachers .

		He is sure of an audience at regular times , and sure of general sympathy and reverent hearing .

		There is a momentum of moral fervor in the spirit of the place , the hour , the theme .

		In the exposition of a sacred text which has a kind of authority even with the skeptical , the preacher can touch all aspects of human life .

		These advantages are finely illus - trated in the lectures , which are also sermons , which Dr.
Charles Reynolds Brown	PERSON	delivered at
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The main interest of the volume lies in the method by which the Biblical story of Exodus is made to suggest moral factors in the labor problems of our own time and land .

		While the audience is thinking of the ancient '' walking delegate '' who led a strike against Egyptian taskmasters , suddenly it finds itseH confronting modern instances of the same order .

		The lectures also illustrate the rigid limita - tions of the sermonic method of dealing with social questions .

		The audience is mixed , and the preacher must address the average man , not forgetting the young and the ignorant .

		The time is short ; the atmosphere is charged with emotion ; the demand for devotional effect is imperative ; and therefore a thorough and sys - tematic treatment is impossible .

		It is not so peril - ous to '' damn the sins we have no mind to , '' and the wrongs of cosmopolitan oppressors ; but the immediate effect may be slight .

		All this points to the necessity of organizing classes of young men for the free discussion of social ethics .

		In such classes the general statements of the pulpit can be criticized freely , a wider range of fact can be exploited , all sides heard , and representatives of conflicting interests given an opportunity to make defense , and the min - ister himself will find new materials for his ex - hortations .

		The sermons in the volume under review would be a powerful incitement to such study .

		In Mr.
Plantz	PERSON	's book on '' The Church and the Social Problem , '' we follow the same theme : What can the
Church	ORGANIZATION	do to promote the welfare of the wage-earners and further social peace ?

		There is no contribution to knowledge in the volume ; every fact and opinion has been worked over by numerous economic writers , and some very important elements of a large practical policy are not mentioned .

		Of this one can not complain , for the title does not promise a doc - tor 's thesis , but a practical man 's counsel in the light of contemporary knowledge .

		The social policy must be worked out in details by spe - cialists , not by sermon writers .

		The chapter on Socialism does not quite fairly separate the real economic issue from the metaphysical and ethi - cal eccentricities for which many of the leading Socialists have stood .

		One can believe in col - lective control of the instruments of production without a thought of atheism .

		The practical counsels to the Church and its leaders are gen - erally sane , discriminating , and intelligent , and the plea for the thorough instruction of minis - ters in social science is enforced by cogent reasons and trustworthy authority .

		Someone has thought it worth while to resuscitate from the ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' of ten years ago the dra - matic criticisms contributed to that journal by Mr.
G. B. Shaw	PERSON	.

		They made sparkling reading in those days , but that is hardly sufficient to justify the preservation of such current chroniclings in permanent form .

		We are not tempted to read them again , although we read every one of them with keen interest when it was written .

		But there are doubtless Shavians enough to provide them with an audience -- not of the fit but few who knew these mad outpourings from the start -- but of the gregarious multitude who read this author because he is the fashion of the day .

		Recent Fiction .

		* The fictional surprise of the season is offered by a novel entitled ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	, '' a long and delight - ful story cast in the form of an autobiography .

		The author is Mr.
William De Morgan	PERSON	, said to be a man of advanced years , well-known in the industrial world besides being related to the learned author of '' A Budget of Paradoxes , '' but a stranger to the annalist of literary affairs .

		Hamlet 's '' And there - fore , as a stranger , give it welcome , '' seems an approjjriate text for our reception of this singularly rich , mellow , and human narrative , which is gar - rulous in the genial sense , and as effective as it is unpretending .

		Possibly the author 's frequently re - iterated disclaimer of literary intent may be thought to savor of affectation , but we can not find it in our heart to say anything that has even the suggestion of harshness about a book that has given us so much pleasure .

		It is almost as if a new
Dickens	PERSON	had swum into our ken , but a
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	who knows how to curb the tendency to indulge in caricature and humorous exaggeration , a
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	whose sentiment escapes the touch of artificiality and mawkishness .

		The autobiographer is an Englishman of the peo - ple , born amid humble circumstances in the early Victorian years , making his mark as an inventor and engineer by force of native talent , and display - ing a gift for affection and friendship that gi'eatly endears him to us .

		His story is an intensely human one , a story of alternating failures and successes , of blended joys and sorrows , artfully contrived with what seems like an almost total absence of artistic design , and holding its readers by its great variety of incident and characterization , its humorous flashes and satirical sallies , and its deep and genuine pathos .

		The pathetic note is forced almost intolerably in •

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, the later chapters , for we are led to believe that the hero 's sacrifice of his dearest friendship upon the very altar of his affections is to remain undiscovered , but the device of certain supplementary documents appended to his own life-story relieves us from the strain of this apprehension , and the book ends in a sort of glow of sunset peace .

		If any readers have fallen into the habit of taking these reviews of ours as a means of escape from reading the novels them - selves , or as a substitute for that often toilsome and thankless task , we m ` ge them to make an exception to their rule in the present instance , and feel sure that they will be grateful for the suggestion .

		Some time ago , in reviewing a novel by Mr.
W. B. Maxwell	PERSON	, a name then unfamiliar to us , we ven - tured the opinion , based upon internal evidence only , that it was the work of a woman .

		This seems to have been a mistake , but we shall never cease to wonder at the insight with which the author of ''
Vivien	PERSON	'' assumed the feminine point of view .

		His new novel , '' The Guarded Flame , '' leads to no such suspicion as the earlier one , but has equally remark - able qualities , although of a different kind .

		The central figure is that of an English philosopher , grown old in the service of thought , the author of forty or more volumes that have earned for him the reputation of being the profoundest of living think - ers .

		He is a man of whom no one seems able to speak without bated breath , and in accents which are a mingling of reverence and awe in about equal proportions .

		One thinks of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	at times , some of the circumstances of whose life are worked into the pattern , and it is more than prob - able tliat the author has found some of his material in
Spencer	PERSON	's `` Autobiography . ''

		But even the most extravagant laudations in which the Spencerians indulge seem pale in comparison with the terms in which Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	's imaginary philosopher is set before us .

		This paragon of a hero , this superhuman incarnation of the intellectual life , is not easy for the novelist to live up to ; he is '' too bright and good '' for the companionship of ordinary mortals , and there is a striking incongruity between his imputed powers and the actual words that are invented for his utterance .

		In a word , Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	has over - done his philosopher , much as the poet was overdone in Miss Sinclair 's '' The Divine Fire , '' and the figure is not made convincing .

		The philosopher 's house - hold consists of three young persons , and out of these the tragedy of the book -- for it is essentially a tragedy -- is woven .

		They are his young wife , married to him out of gratitude before her womanly nature has awakened , a still younger niece who is practically his adopted daughter , and a brilliant young scholar who seryes him as secretary and as - sistant .

		Presently the niece discovers that she loves the secretary , and he becomes betrothed to her , mainly because it is the philosopher 's desire .

		But a guilty love for the philosopher 's wife lias been slowly taking possession of him , a love which is matched by her emotions , all the more violent because of their tardy development .

		The discharge of a Ley - den jar would afford an appropriate simile of what happens when the psychological moment arrives .

		Then the situation is made horrible by a stroke of paralysis that makes the philosopher helpless , and is followed by apoplexy , aphasia , and childishness .

		At this point the novel assumes the character of a study in morbid psychology , undeniably powerful , but almost unbearable to pursue .

		The girl learns of the infidelity of the betrothed , and ends her life with strychnine .

		The secretary departs , and ends his days wretchedly in a foreign country .

		The wife alone remains , to expiate her sin by devotion to her stricken husband during the long years which are needed to bring him back to activity and recollec - tion , and to learn in the end that he has all the time known and forgiven . ''

		Tout comprendre , c'est tout pardonner '' might be the text of this strong and painful story .

		The impressiveness with which its ethical teaching is enforced is the justification for much that seems at the time intolerable in the pre - sentation .

		The effect of the work is considerably marred by the frequent use of a scientific jargon which is not demanded by any artistic consideration .

		Readers of '' The White Company '' will need to be told nothing more of Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's '' Sir
Nigel	PERSON	'' than that it deals with the same period , and has the same hero , as the earlier romance .

		It is not a sequel , because it tells of the deeds of
Nigel Loring	PERSON	's youth , and of the services which won for him his spurs .

		These services are connected with the French wars , for the period of the romance is from
1348	DATE	to
1356	DATE	-- from
England	LOCATION	's slow recovery from the Black Death to '' The glittering horror of the steel-topped wood '' and the glorious victory of Poictiers .

		Next to the hero , we must praise his horse , who is a most faithful and fearsome beast .

		The figures of King and Black Prince appear conspicuously .

		The author has ac - quired great stores of learning respecting the period of these two novels , and exhibits it in rather bewilder - ing profusion .

		Since Mr.
Wells	PERSON	took to imagining Utopias he has become very tiresome .

		He used to spin capital yarns after an improved
Jules Verne	PERSON	fashion , but his recon - structions of society are neither exciting nor plausi - ble .

		We particularly resent the latest of them , because it comes in the guise of a novel , fascinatingly called `` In the Days of the Comet , '' which at once fills us with anticipations of the joy with which we read '' The War of the Worlds . ''

		But we are speedily doomed to disappointment , for the sociological pill has only a thin sugar-coating of fiction , and its substance is vain imagining and indigestible paradox .

		The comet , it seems , causes a chemical change in the atmosphere which makes all mankind unconscious for a few hours , after which it awakes with a miraculously transformed character , and knows henceforth neither selfishness nor folly .

		This is the fantastic invention which the author exploits as a device for setting forth his equally fantastic social theories .

		He has deceived us by false pretenses , and we shall hereafter regard his books with justifiable suspicion .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 Mrs.
Craigie	ORGANIZATION	's posthumous novel , `` The Dream and the Business , '' is prefaced by an '' appreciation '' of the writer from the pen of Mr.
Joseph H. Choate	PERSON	, in which deserved tribute is paid to her '' lightness and delicacy of touch , '' and to the '' chaste and fas - tidious taste '' which was always a controlling ele - ment in her work .

		The book itself gives us increased occasion to mourn the loss of this brilliant woman , nineteen of whose thirty-eight years were devoted to a literary activity that was all the time broaden - ing in its scope and deepening in its sympathies .

		The growth in technical artistry during these two decades was perhaps not so marked , for Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	knew how to write almost from the begin - ning , and her instinct for style seems to have been born with her rather than laboriously acquired .

		The new novel takes for its text the words of the Preacher : '' For a dream cometh through the multitude of business . ''

		It is a study of a group of modern men and women , whose relations are made to constitute a plot of considerable interest , but whose chief significance is to be found in the way in which they mirror , from their several points of view , the restless striving , the feverish existence , and the in - stinctive groping for light which are so characteristic of the life of our time .

		Something of a catholicis - ing tendency is perhaps traceable , which the wi'iter 's faith makes natural enough , but Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	was too true an artist to put religious bias into her stories , and her fairness in presenting views opposed to her own is conspicuous .

		To this the last of her novels a place must be accorded not far below that occupied by ''
Robert Orange	PERSON	'' and '' A School for Saints , '' her unquestioned masterpieces , and it is possibly a more remarkable production than either of those two in certain respects , as of its finished style , its economy of material , and its nice dramatic adjust - ments .

		`` The Ladder to the Stars '' gives us the fable of the Ugly Duckling as exemplified by a young Englishwoman of humble birth and provincial envi - ronment .

		The spark of genius has -LRB- after the unac - countable fashion of that element -RRB- been kindled in her soul , and it is fanned into flame by certain for - tunate accidents acting in conjunction with her o.wn persistency .

		She escapes from her depressing sur - roundings , goes to
London	LOCATION	, and achieves success as a writer .

		She nearly loses her balance through a temporary infatuation for an erratic foreign musi - cian , but shi'inks from taking the last fatal step , and is thus saved for the amiable young statesman for whom fate has really destined her all the while .

		She is an interesting figure , but hardly more so than some of the suspicious and vulgar persons who con - stitute her provincial entourage -- persons whose varied pettiness is described for us with searching particularity .

		Miss
Cholmondeley	PERSON	, after several years of waiting , has now given us a successor to her admirable novel , '' Red Pottage , '' but we can only characterize the new book as a disappointment . ''

		Prisoners Fast Bound in
Misery	LOCATION	and Iron '' is about as preposterous a title as could be imagined , and the story to which it belongs is both thin and unreal .

		There is , more - over , much padding in the form of neat but futUe description and vapid philosophizing .

		The narrative deals with a young Englishman and the English wife of an Italian nobleman .

		There is a love affair be - tween them , the product of feeling on his part and of fancy on hers , but it remains an innocent com - plication .

		Unfortunately , he happens to be paying her a secret farewell visit at just the hour when a murder is being committed outside the palace , and the man accepts the imputation of the crime to save the reputation of the woman .

		He is sentenced to a long term of imprisonment , and she is contemptible enough to permit the sacrifice .

		Thus we have the prisoners , one '' bound in iron '' and the other '' bound in misery '' -- the misery of such remorse as her shallow nature is capable of experiencing .

		Both escape from prison at last , he through the discovery of the assassin , and she by the confession which brings her relief , but the outcome is anything but satisfactory , for the woman gets into another senti - mental tangle and the man dies of a haemorrhage .

		It makes a dull and unconvincing tale that leaves no lasting impression .

		The reader of '' The Viper of
Milan	LOCATION	'' has supped full of horrors when he has reached the close of this ingenious romance .

		The tale is of that monster of iniquity ,
Gian Galeazzo Visconti	PERSON	, and of his war with the
Scaligeri	PERSON	and their allies .

		It closes fitly with the assassination of the tyrant , whereby the ends of poetic justice are attained , but this consummation is deferred -LRB- as history records -RRB- until the catalogue of his crimes has been lengthened out , and the imagin - ation has been given abundant opportunity to revel in their detail .

		The story makes up in action for the shortcomings of its style .

		Since it is the work of a young woman in her teens , it would be unreasonable to expect from it anything more than the lively in - vention and garish color with which it is well supplied .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has been writing books for a quar - ter of a century , and now has about fifty volumes -LRB- mostly fiction -RRB- to his credit .

		This is an evidence of his industry and of the fluency of his pen , at least , while some of the fifty offer evidence of something approaching distinction in conception and treatment .

		Few would deny that his best work is that concerned with the social life of modern
Italy	LOCATION	, and that the '' Saracinesca '' series of novels represents the high - water mark of his invention , description , and analyti - cal powers .

		Little need be said of his new novel , '' A Lady of
Rome	LOCATION	, '' beyond the statement that it moves in the social circles already depicted in many of its predecessors , and writes of them with the same sure - ness of knowledge and decorous interest of manner .

		It has perhaps rather less of plot and rather more of psychology than the author is wont to give us , but the story has both texture and strength , besides being thoroughly praiseworthy in its ethical implications .

		It is not often that the situation offered by a loveless union and an unlawful passion is handled with such delicacy and firmness of grasp .

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, The `` Affairs of State '' which constitute the basis of Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's mildly entertaining story relate to the succession of the
Principality of Schloshold	ORGANIZATION	-
Markheim	PERSON	.

		It is a case of Gulielmus contra mundum , for the German Emperor favors one can - didate , and the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	supports the other .

		Affairs approach a crisis when the allied opposition sends a diplomatic representative to the secluded Dutch watering-place where the head of the English foreign office is supposed to be recovering from an attack of influenza .

		In point of fact , this official is not .

		there at all , but has sent his younger brother to impersonate him , thus drawing , as it were , a herring across his trail .

		Now it so happens that an Amer - ican millionaire and his two charming daughters are sojourning at the same seaside resort , and the two young women are destined to become the dece ex machind in the solution of the diplomatic puzzle .

		Two courtly noblemen : two attractive and roman - tically-disposed young women -- the outcome is obvious .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	does not disappoint our expectations ; he settles the case of Schloshold - Markheim in the right way , and he makes four young persons happy .

		There are humorous episodes a-plenty , with a dash of the serious now and then , besides any amount of crisp dialogue .

		It makes a pleasant comedy .

		Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	has mastered the trick of popular narrative after a comparatively bi'ief ap - prenticeship to the trade , and is to-day one of the most effective of our story-tellers ; effective , that is , in the way of entertainment and excitement , and in the .

		skilful management of plot and dramatic sit - uation , for he makes no pretense of looking beneath the surface of character , or of exhibiting a style of any significance .

		His list now includes two romances of Indian days in the old
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, one of the Civil War , and his new book , ''
Bob Hampton	PERSON	of
Placer	LOCATION	, '' which is a story of the seventies , and has for its climax the
Sioux	LOCATION	uprising which resulted in the massacre of
Custer	PERSON	and his men on the
Little Big Horn	LOCATION	.

		The hero is a disgraced army officer who has become a '' bad man '' in the Western sense -- a gambler , brawler , and dare-devil generally .

		He had not been guilty of the crime which was charged against him when he was dismissed from the service , but the appearances were all against him , and he was unable to offer anything in rebuttal of their damning testimony .

		The heroine is his daughter , whom he has not seen since she was a child , and who , grown to be a young woman , is rescued by him from the Indians before he has dis - covered her identity .

		That discovery made , he un - dertakes to provide for her , reforms himself in va - rious ways , and renews the effort to trace out the history of the crime which has ruined his reputa - tion .

		The girl is placed in refined surroundings , and with amazing rapidity learns the speech and manners of the cultivated .

		But all this time
Bob	PERSON	does not reveal his relationship to her or tell her of his history .

		The necessity of doing so becomes urgent when she falls in love with a young officer who is a son of the man whom
Bob	PERSON	is reputed to have killed .

		Of course , the mystery is all cleared up in the end , the girl marries her lover , and her fathei * , having cleared his name , fights gallantly with
Custer	PERSON	and dies with his chief . ''


Ann Boyd	PERSON	'' may be described as a sort of minor masterpiece , and easily the strongest piece of work that Mr.
Harben	PERSON	has thus far produced .

		We have known him hitherto as the author of books in which various types of rustic Georgians entertained us by their quaint characteristics and the shrewd humor of their speech , but we have hardly thought of him as possessing the gifts of the construction novelist . ''


Ann Boyd	PERSON	, '' however , is a book with a well-contrived framework of plot to which all of its incidents and episodes are properly subordinated .

		It is , of course , a study of character also -- and in the case of the woman who furnishes a name to the book a very re - markable piece of characterization -- but the author keeps well in check the tendency of his imagination to indulge in desultory meanderings , and also holds himself fairly free from the control of sentimental impulses .

		Given , a young man who knows life as it really is , and a young woman who has never viewed it except through the smoked glasses of convention , and join the two in matrimony : you will then have material for a comedy or a tragedy , according to the degree of seriousness with which the situation is handled .

		In the case of '' The Poet and the Parish , '' by Miss
Mary Moss	PERSON	, there is at fii-st comedy of a very crisp and de - lightful sort , and then the situation develops until it verges closely upon tragedy , and is only saved from that consummation by a tonic application of common sense to relations that have been strained almost to the breaking point .

		The poet is
Felix Gwynne	PERSON	, who has spent his youth abroad , and returns to his American home to enter into an inheritance .

		He is a lovable but rather irresponsible person , the creature of impulse , but serious enough at heart to engage our sympathies .

		The young woman whom he marries is distinctly bornee , and her family and social environment are even more so .

		This makes difficulties , especially when
Felix	PERSON	goes wandering about the country with a band of gypsies , and be - comes entangled -LRB- innocently enough -RRB- in the affairs of a masquerading actress whom he meets in the gypsy camp .

		His wife , with the thoughtful aid of her outraged parents and most of the neighbors , magnifies these indiscretions into huge proportions , and abandons the hapless poet .

		It is the situation of `` El Gran Galeoto '' lowered somewhat from the tragic plane of the Spanish dramatist , but still seri - ous enough .

		It takes some plain speaking -LRB- or rather writing -RRB- on the part of Felix to bring his wife back , but his plea is effective .

		`` We are mismated , but we are mated ... How can you be so cruel to that unlucky girl ?

		... Why , the poor child hardly knows me , yet I 'm supposed There we sat , side by side , pelted by every filthy insinuation , ticketed , yoked .

		Was n't it enough to drive her -- and she 's pretty ,

		... Now I am waiting because there is an obstinate girl , twenty miles away , who is my wife , and to whom I 'm bound by a tie that does n't readily break .

		It seems to me , at this minute , that you have almost every fault in the world , dear .

		All but one I You are real !

		But in the name of the love we have felt for each other , do n't let the fragments of our happiness be shattered beyond re - pair , for unreality , for other people 's ugly dreams I '' One can not feel quite comfortable in reading Miss
Taylor	PERSON	's '' The Impersonator , '' because the heroine -LRB- who naturally demands our sympathies -RRB- is placed by her own deliberate act in a position for which no justification is possible .

		A wealthy woman in
Wash	LOCATION	- ington has written to a niece in
Paris	LOCATION	, whom she has never seen , inviting her for a lengthy visit .

		The niece in question , who is dabbling in art , does not want to go , and asks a friend to make the visit in her place and character .

		This friend , who is beau - tiful and accomplished , but extremely poor , weakly consents to engage in this proposed deception , allured by the prospect of a few months of luxury .

		The main body of the story tells us of this imper - sonation , successfully sustained through the social season , and at last rudely revealed by the sudden appearance of the woman to whom the name really belongs .

		But the heroine has played her cards skil - fully , and some of her friends remain loyal after the exposure of the fraud .

		One of these is a rising statesman who has fallen in love with her , and who at last persuades her , in spite of all , to become his wife .

		This consummation is facilitated by the dis - covery that the young woman -LRB- whose parentage has hitherto been a mystery -RRB- is the legitimate daughter of the Spanish minister , and that she is not plain
Mary Lang	PERSON	, but may claim the far more resounding name of
Maria Fraucesca Luisa Quevedo	PERSON	, Countess Por - tucarrero .

		Miss
Taylor	PERSON	's novel moves in a milieu with which she is well acquainted , and , barring the fundamental obstacle to complete sympathy , is a work of animated interest . ''

		Montlivet , '' by
Miss Alice Prescott Smith	PERSON	, is a romance of the old
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	in the days when
France	LOCATION	was so strengthening its strategic position in
America	LOCATION	as to forbode stubborn resistance when the inevitable struggle for supremacy should come .

		The exact year is
1695	DATE	, and the scene opens with Cad - illac in doubtful power at
Michillimackinac	LOCATION	.

		The future founder of
Detroit	LOCATION	is not , however , the hero of th ^ s story , but the French trader
Montlivet	PERSON	, who has a magnificent plan for a league of the Indian tribes in support of the French cause .

		So much for the historical setting .

		The fictional romance -LRB- aside from the historical -RRB- is provided by an English cap - tive , rescued from Indian captors by the hero , and taken with him on his mission to the tribes in the neighborhood of the
Bale	LOCATION	des Puants -- for thus pleasantly was Green Bay styled by its pioneer explorers .

		The captive turns out to be a woman in disguise -- a woman of proud birth and spirit -- and this the hero discovers after the expedition is well away into the wilderness .

		A variant upon the usual treatment of this theme is offered by their marriage early in the narrative , but the union is of expediency alone , and leaves all the wooing to be done .

		There are many exciting adventures and hairbreadth escapes from peril , with a suitably sentimental end - ing .

		Miss
Smith	PERSON	has produced an exceptionally interesting piece of work , one which may perhaps be described as similar to the romances of the late Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	with an added infusion of vu-ility .

		Mrs.
Dillon	PERSON	insists that her new novel , '' The Leader , '' is '' in no sense history . ''

		Nevertheless , it is chiefly concerned with the history of the
St. Louis	LOCATION	Democratic Convention of
1904	DATE	, and tells the whole story of the struggle between radicals and conservar tives , of the nomination , of Judge
Parker	PERSON	's famous telegram , and of Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	's activities .

		The hero is obviously Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	in disguise ; that is , in just enough of disguise to permit him to combine love with politics , and thus satisfy the imperative demand of the reader for a love-story .

		Although based upon familiar historical happenings , the story is artificial in a stagey fashion , and its vein of invention is too thin to yield anything very rich in the way of romantic ore .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	, Briefs ox New Books .

		Incentives to a P ^ ofessor
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	of
Yale hiiiher ranf/e of University	ORGANIZATION	has done well to unite literary study , under a suggestive title four '' occa - sional '' papers on `` The Higher Study of English '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		By the word `` higher '' is implied not merely the sort of systematic and philosophical research which Professor
Cook	PERSON	has done much to promote in this country .

		Two of the essays , the first and the last , do indeed bear more directly upon graduate study and teaching .

		Yet the obvious note in all four is a general elevation of standards , both ethical and aesthetic , throughout the entire cur - riculum of English -- a broadening and deepening of our national culture through an intensive appre - ciation of the best that has been handed down to us in literature .

		Higher study means study of the best things in the best way .

		The best way is not always , or perhaps often , the easiest , above all in the case of those who are to be teachers of English .

		For them the higher superstructure means the broader , deeper , more carefully laid foundation .

		Like specialists in other fields , they must know their subject from the bottom up ; they must know what is more important without slighting what the layman 's imperfect sense of values may deem to be less ; and they must know the relations existing between their own and allied disciplines .

		They must neglect neither the origins of the language in which their literature is enslirined , nor the ancient classics and the Scriptures from which it has drawn its chief inspiration , nor the brotherhood of languages and literatures among which it has grown up .

		They must strive to com - pass an ever widening realm ; to rise to an ever 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, mounting ideal ; and nobly to despise the so-called limit of the attainable .

		Yet they must be modest , too , and moderate , not hoping to exercise authority in scholarship until they are proved faithful in atten - tion to detail , nor by frantic haste to win the prizes of equable speed .

		It is not sufficient , thinks Professor
Cook	PERSON	, to say to the gi'aduate student , '' Here is the body of English literature ; come and read it , and then go and teach it . ''

		There must be order , dis - cipline , regulated toil .

		The professional teacher must possess the professional orderly will .

		Never - theless , `` he who has not been a passionate reader of good literature from the age of ten ... and who does not give promise of remaining a passionate reader of good literature to the end of life , should be gently , but firmly , discouraged from entering our profession . ''

		With reference to this volume we have but one regret : we wish that the author liad been able to include his notable essay on '' The Artistic Ordering of Life , '' which is germane enough to the papers here contained , in that it represents the final philosophy of a thinker who is also a great teacher of English .

		, ' .

		It has been said that each successive Qarrick and .

		, , .

		the social life epoch of theatrical history presents of his tune .

		the Same picturesque image of sto - ried regret -- memory incarnated in the veteran , ruefully vaunting the vanished glories of the past .


Gibber	PERSON	, surviving in the best days of
Garrick	LOCATION	,
Peg Woffington	LOCATION	, and
Kittie Clive	PERSON	, praised the days of
Wilks	PERSON	and
Betterton	PERSON	; aged playgoers of the period of
Edmund Kean	PERSON	and
John Philip Kemble	PERSON	believed that the drama had been buried , never to rise again , with the dust of
Garrick and Henderson	PERSON	, beneath the pavement of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	.

		But even to-day many of us still cling to the belief that
Garrick	PERSON	was the greatest of English actors , while realizing that he is as much a centre of legend as
King Arthur	PERSON	and that the ordinary
Garrick	PERSON	story rests on a veritable morass .

		Garrick lived in an age when public and national life was in a condition of great flux and pro- gress -- mirroring the decay of Jacobitism , the soften - ing of religious bigotry in
England	LOCATION	, and the growth of modern forms of political discontent .

		In ''
Garrick	PERSON	and his Circle '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Mrs.
Clement Parsons	PERSON	has embodied a true picture of the social life of the day , while weaving a portrait of her subject , a record of his triumphs and a study of his methods .

		In a strict sense , her book is not a biogi'aphy , -- her aim has been to make each one oi a series of vignettes illus - trate
Garrick	PERSON	's character or career in contact with this or that group of outside characters or events .

		She points out that the actor 's personality is an elusive one .

		Apart from his theatric art ,
Garrick	PERSON	's vivacity is his individualizing label for all time ; he was born with such a fund of animal spirits as rarely occurs in association with high mental gifts .

		He was a genius with the right amount of worldly ballast for worldly success , and remains the ruling figure of the stage in eighteenth-century annals .

		In
Burke	PERSON	's words , '' He raised the character of his profession to the rank of a liberal art . ''

		To quote Mrs.
Parsons	PERSON	, `` There have been many great actors , but never another great actor who was at the same time so great a personality out - side of the theatre .

		Garrick belongs to the history of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		With vivacity , fidelity , and keen dis - crimination , the author has presented a study of the theatrical society of the period -- its whimsicalities , vulgarities , frailities , and manners , as well as its esti - mable qualities .

		Her portraits have that fulness and unity which impart a conclusive notion of personality , set with a due sense of perspective against a well - balanced background .

		The inscrutable A book which undertakes to solve ` New ` vork * ^ ® problem of what
James Parton	PERSON	, in politics .

		his Life of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, written fifty years ago , described as '' that most unfathom - able of subjects , the politics of the State of
New York	LOCATION	'' is the Hon.
D. A. Alexander	PERSON	's two-volume '' Political History of the State of
New York	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , which we are told grew out of the difficulty experienced by the author in obtaining '' an accurate knowledge of the movements of political parties and their leaders in the
Empire State	ORGANIZATION	. ''


Oliver Wolcott	PERSON	, a member of
Washington	LOCATION	's Cabinet and later governor of Con - necticut , once wrote : `` After living a dozen years in
New York	LOCATION	, I do n't pretend to comprehend their politics .

		It is a labyrinth of wheels within wheels , and is understood only by their managers . ''

		Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	, himself a prominent figure in the polit - ical life of
New York	LOCATION	, does not claim to understand the politics of
the State	ORGANIZATION	any more then did
Wolcott	PERSON	, but he may justly lay claim to the distinction of possessing intimate knowledge of its political move - ments and familiarity with its leading politicians .

		He is not the only historian who has cherished the ambition to write an elaborate political history of the
Empire State	ORGANIZATION	.


Jabez Hammond	PERSON	's '' Political History of
New York	LOCATION	, '' completed in
1848	DATE	, covered the early field with remarkable thoroughness , although with less accuracy and system than characterized Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	's work .

		The latter 's method is rather that of the biographer than the historian .

		He clus - ters his facts around the careers of the great leaders , and makes them the central theme of his discussion of particular movements ; for , according to his view , '' the history of a state or nation is largely the his - tory of a few of its leading men . ''

		It is true , as he says , that it would be difficult to find in any common - wealth of the Union a more interesting or picturesque leadership than is presented in the political history of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Some of those whose careers he traces through '' the tangled web of
New York	LOCATION	politics '' are
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	,
George Clinton	PERSON	,
Aaron Burr	PERSON	,
DeWitt Clinton	PERSON	,
Martin Van Buren	PERSON	, and
Thurlow	PERSON	Weed , each of whom successively controlled the political destinies of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		In addition to the portraitures of these great leaders , the work is en - livened with entertaining sketches of the struggles between '' Bucktails '' and '' Clintonians , '' `` Hunkers '' and `` Barnburners , '' and other factions into which the leading parties were at different times divided .

		THE DIAL .

		19 Books dealing with the classification and activities of hirds , or handbooks to local or to of birds .

		more extended faunas , are numerous , and studies of birds afield with gun or camera have multiplied almost to the limit of popular interest .

		Fortunately , we have in Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	's '' The Bird , its Form and Function '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- a worthy treatise on the bird itself considered from the standpoint of its structure .

		The book is no dry assemblage of descrip - tive anatomical detail couched in technical terms which only the sj -RRB- ecialist in comparative anatomy can analyze .

		It is , rather , an untechnical study of the bird as a product of the process of organic evo - lution ; of a living structure wonderf idly adapted in manifold ways to the complex environments in which birds are found .

		Although the author deals constantly with the structural elements of the various organs of the animal -- with shaft and barb , feather and claw , syrinx and gizzard -- the anatomical skeleton is always clothed with a living interest and rendered full of meaning as illustrative of some broad bio - logical law , and is related to the significant funda - mental principle of the evolution of all life .

		The author marshalls his facts with the skill and judg - ment which are evidently the result of an adequate training in the biological sciences , and he has added to his knowledge the zeal of an enthusiastic lover of the feathered tribes .

		He loses no opportunity to inculcate a love for • • ' the little bundles of muscle and blood which in this freezing weather can transmute frozen beetles and zero air into a happy , cheery little Black-capped Chicadee , '' and to engender a respect for the living brain which '' can generate a sympathy , a love for its mate , which in sincerity and unsel - fishness suffer little when compared with human affection . ''

		The illustrations in the work are mainly from photographs -- most of them presented here for the first time , -- drawn often from sources in the
New York	LOCATION	Zoological Gardens or the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	.

		With a few possible exceptions , they really illustrate the text , and are well chosen and well executed .

		The work is a wel - come addition to the popular literature of ornithol - ogy , of substantial merit and permanent value for every lover and student of denizens of the air .

		Pleasant scenes ^ he fascination of
Japan	LOCATION	finds a sym - from familiar pathetic interpreter in A. Herbage Japanese life .

		Edwards .

		The sketches that make up the volume entitled `` Kakemono '' -- upon the supposition , it may be assumed , that the word , liter - ally '' hang-up-thing , '' signifies a picture or pictures , there being no plural form in Japanese , whereas it denotes the manner of mounting rather than the pictures themselves -- are charming word-paintings , wrought with a light touch and true poetic feeling .

		In their daintiness and half-veiled impressions , many of them seem to have been inspired by the hokku or short odes that play such an important part in the life of the people of that unique country .

		The subjects are all familiar ; indeed , nothing else could be ex - pected , so thoroughly have
Japan	LOCATION	and its inhabitants been written about .

		But in literary art , as in pictorial , it is the treatment that makes the difference .

		De - scriptions of the ascent of Fuji-san are so common that one 's first inclination is to skip another relation of the toilsome climb .

		Yet to pass by the account here given woidd be to leave unread what is perhaps the most delightfully written of them all .

		Even more impressive is the story of a trip to the summit of the ever active volcano
Asamayama	LOCATION	.

		The dismal horror of the experience , in striking contrast to the more arduous but tamer journey to the top of
Fuji	ORGANIZATION	, is made very real by a recital of the pleasing anticipations with which it was undertaken .

		These episodes occupy but a small part of the book .

		Religion , art , travel , the people and their customs , and personal experi - ences of the author , furnish the material for most of the sketches .

		Especially striking is the one entitled '' The Altar of Fire , '' in which the Shinto ceremony of hiwatari , or walking barefoot over a bed of live coals , is graphically described .

		No attempt is made to explain the seemingly impossible phenomenon : for that , the reader must have recourse to the pages of
Percival Lowell	ORGANIZATION	.

		The essay upon '' The Art of the People '' contains many observations worthy of serious consideration .

		A complete view of
Japan	LOCATION	, the book does not give ; the unpleasant features are left for others to portray .

		But that omission makes it the more agreeable to read .

		-LRB-

Florida	LOCATION	, '' even of
Florida	LOCATION	.

		^ j ^ h ^ j ^ g g ^ b-title `` Its History and Diplomacy '' -LRB- Burrows Bi'others -RRB- , does not quite comprehend the subject-matter of the work .

		What the author has attempted to do is to give an account of the conditions that made the acquisition of
Florida	LOCATION	by the
United States	LOCATION	imperative for her own peace and safety , and of the forcible seizures and diplo - matic negotiations that finally accomplished this result .

		He has given a very ftdl account of some .

		things which , so far as the main thesis is concerned , might have been dealt with much more briefly .

		On the whole , however , the work has been well done , and the book is a valuable contribution to our his - torical literature on this important subject .

		The style is easy and readable , and the author 's judg - ments are well balanced , in spite of occasional sharp words about the conduct of such men as
Jackson	LOCATION	,
J. Q. Adams	PERSON	,
Pickering	PERSON	, and EUicott .

		Of positive errors the writer has discovered only a few , and these are of minor importance .

		The change of the boundary of
West Florida	LOCATION	from 31 ° to 32 ° 28 ' was made in the commission of
George Johnstone	PERSON	, Gov - ernor of
West Florida	LOCATION	,
June 6 , 1764	DATE	, instead of in that of Governor
Elliott	PERSON	-LRB- p. 34 -RRB- .

		Owe could wish for a little more exactness in some of the statements , -- for example , that
Amelia Island	LOCATION	`` was soon abandoned by the American marines '' to escape yellow fever -LRB- p. 236 -RRB- .

		How soon ?

		It was occupied
December 24-26	DATE	,
1817	DATE	, and General
Gaines	PERSON	was there more than a year later .

		The chief defect of the book lies in its 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, paucity of references .

		Such a book must appeal first of all to the specialist ; and the specialist must have footnotes .

		The author has brought out a good deal of new and interesting matter for which he has given no authority whatever .

		References to diplo - matic papers are abundant , but often details are given which can hardly have been gathered from this source .

		The legal side ^ -RCB- ^ `` ^ pleasure to readers of Lincoln of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life literature to come upon a really in - and character , structive book in that much-worked field .

		There are books and articles without number , largely the result of working over the same old material , many of them with the same old miscon - ceptions and the dubious or disproved anecdotes .

		Mr.
Frederick Trevor Hill	PERSON	, in his '' Lincoln the Lawyer '' -LRB- The
Centm-y Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has developed some new points of interest in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life .

		Taking well - known facts and adding to them important new ones of his own discovery , he has combined what is known of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's legal career in such a way as to show conclusively that he was a lawyer of very superior ability both in working out his cases and in liis success in the courts .

		In competition with a bar remarkable for force and talent , he became the acknowledged leader , manifesting in the highest degree the various qualities demanded for success in his exacting profession .

		But more important than the fact of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's professional success is the bear - ing of his legal attainments on his great public career .

		It was his insight into the fundamental principles of law and logic , and the training that he had received from his long and successful practice , that enabled him to triumph over
Douglas	PERSON	in debate , to make the
Cooper Institute Speech	ORGANIZATION	that carried his reputation into the East , to '' dissect the slavery question so thoroughly , and to meet the various diffi - cult problems of his later career .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	has done well in bringing out this important side of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's training and equipment .

		Incidentally , he destroys some of the myths that have been handed down from one writer to another , some of them detracting from the real dignity of the man ; and for this also we are grateful .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Sig .


M. Esposito	PERSON	is the editor of a collection of '' Early Italian Piano Music , '' just added by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	to their '' Musicians ' Library . ''

		The introductory matter consists of biographical sketches of the composers represented , and descriptive notes on the harpsichord and clavichord , with full-page photographic plates .

		The composers , seventeen in number , range from
Ercole Pas	ORGANIZATION	- goini -LRB- 1580 -RRB- to
Muzio Clementi	PERSON	-LRB- 1752-1832 -RRB- .

		The two
Scarlattis	PERSON	have a large share of the space , Alessardro being represented by six pieces , and Domenico by the series of nineteen sonnets , with the '' Cati Fugue '' as an appendix .

		Readers of '' Cousuelo '' will be interested in the specimen fugue from
Porpera	LOCATION	, and students of
Browning	PERSON	by the piece from
Galuppi	LOCATION	-- a sonata and not a toccata .

		A new translation of '' The Nibelungenlied , '' made by the late
John Storer Cobb	PERSON	, and now edited by his widow , is published in a handsome volume by
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The form is a rhymed four-line stanza in iambic octometer , the rhymes being in couplets .

		It is a jog-trot movement , and grows very monotonous after a few pages .

		But a great poem , in the higher sense , tliis epic is not , and a fair sense of its historical importance is obtainable from the present version .

		Two new editions of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, each complete in a single volume , call for a word of hearty praise .

		One is added to the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' poets of Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and the editorial work has been done by Mr.
William Allan Neilson	PERSON	.

		There are upward of twelve hundred pages , with portrait , biography , glossary , and special introductions to the several plays .

		The other edition comes from the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	, and is edited by Mr.
W. J. Craig	PERSON	.

		This volume , with about one himdred more pages than the other , has portrait and glossary , but practically no editorial matter .

		Both edi - tions are clearly printed on thin paper , two columns to the page .

Le Roy Phillips	PERSON	for the latter .

		A new '' Encyclopedia of Familiar Quotations , '' com - piled by Mr.
Elferd Eveleigh Treffry	PERSON	, is published by the
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selections niunber five thousand , and if many of them may not properly be styled '' familiar , '' they are all likely to prove usefid for purposes of pointed illustration , and this is very largely what such collections are for . ''

		The Book of Love , '' compiled by Mr.
Adam L. Gowans	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is described as a collection of '' one hundred of the best love-poems in the English language . ''

		The description is fairly justified by the contents , although it would not be difficidt to collect another hundred lyrics of equal , or nearly equal , beauty .

		The
Chicago Madrigal Club	ORGANIZATION	, which has offered yearly prizes for musical compositions to accompany poems chosen by it for a musical setting , will this year vary its programme by offering its prize for an original lyric poem to be hereafter set to music .

		The prize is fifty dollars , and the competition is open to all writers residing in the

		BRIEFER MENTION 48 NOTES 48 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 49 FERDINAND BRUNETIERE .

		In one of the lectures which he gave in this country , when he visited us several years ago , Brunetiere used the following words : '' The first condition of disinterestedness is never to follow one 's tastes , and to begin by distrusting the things which give ns pleasure .

		The most delicious dishes are not the most wholesome ; we never fail to distinguish between our cooks and our doctors .

		In the moral world the beginning of virtue is to distrust what is most natu - ral to us , and the same is true in the intellectual world .

		To distrust what we like is the beginning of wisdom in art and literature . ''

		We quoted this passage at the time when the distinguished Frenchman was our guest , and we now quote it again because it illustrates so clearly the fundamental characteristic of Bru - netiere 's critical attitude toward literature .

		First and last he stood for authority in criticism as opposed to impressionism and caprice , for objective standards as opposed to subjective fancies , for law as opposed to anarchy in the appreciation of books .

		As the chief champion in our time of the principle of authority in criticism , Brunetiere occupied a distinguished position , and his loss is one of the most serious possible to the world of letters .

		He stood like a rock amid the flood of critical writing that has been steadily swelling of recent years , and that has no other creden - tials to offer for its acceptance than the posses - sion of verbal charm , the display of intellectual agility , and the appeal to the hedonistic impulses of our nature .

		In his resistance to the disinte - grating forces that seemed to him to be threat - ening disaster to the fine art of literature , he grew more and more uncompromising in his pronouncements , more and more reactionary in his attitude , and the end found him sending apart , in grim isolation , from most of the ad - vancing movements and liberalizing tendencies of his age .

		It was a stand that challenged admi - ration , even when it revealed him as the foe of justice in the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair , as the enemy of social and political progress in his ultramontane partisanship , and as the opponent , in the name of the classical seventeenth century , of those literary developments which , not wholly for good but assuredly not wholly for ill , were bestowing 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, a distinctive character upon his own age , and were preparing the way for the age that should come after him .

		The man who commits himself to the prin - ciple of authority in criticism incurs certain dangers , no doubt , which
Brunetiere	ORGANIZATION	's career illustrates .

		He is sure to be a conservative , and extreme conservatism is almost as much to be avoided as extreme radicalism .

		The conserva - tive view is pretty sure to be the soimd one in the majority of cases , because it results from the tested opinions of many minds ; whereas the radical view is always experimental , and stands a fair chance of being proved untenable .

		But no lesson drawn from the history of thought is plainer than that radical views are sometimes right , and that the conservative ideas they op - pose may be crusted prejudices rather than rea - soned judgments .

		The critic of to-day is the heir of all the ages , but he is also an observer from the vantage-point of the new time , with its more refined instruments and its broadened horizons .

		There can hardly be a doubt that
Brimetiere	PERSON	set his gaze too resolutely toward the past , and that his devotion to the ideals of Bossuet and
Racine	LOCATION	made him incapable of doing full justice to Renan and Hugo .

		There was , moreover , an irreconcilable con - tradiction between the critic in his character of laudator temporls acti and his character as the expositor of the principle of literary evolution .

		This principle was the philosophical basis of his later writings , and his defence thereof constitutes his chief claim to a permanent place in the his - tory of criticism .

		One of the many statements that he made of it may be quoted . ''

		A given variety of literature , for instance , the En - glish drama of the sixteenth century , or the French comedy of the seventeenth century , or the English novel of the eighteenth century , is in process of devel - opment , slowly organizing itself under the double influ - ence of the interior and exterior ' environment . '

		The movement is slow and the differentiation almost insen - sible .

		Suddenly , and without its being possible to give the reason , a
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, a Molifere , or a
Richardson	PERSON	appears , and forthwith not only is the variety modified , but new species have come into being : psychological drama , the comedy of character , the novel of manners .

		The superior adaptability and power of survival of the new species are at once recognized and proved , indeed , in practice .

		It is in vain that the older species attempt to struggle : their fate is sealed in advance .

		The suc - cessors of
Richardson	PERSON	, Molifere , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	copy these unattainable models until , their fecundity being exhausted -- and by their fecundity I mean their apti - tude for struggling with kindred and rival species -- the imitation is changed into a routine which becomes a source of weakness , impoverishment , and death for the species .

		I shall not easily be persuaded that this manner of considering the history of literature or art is calculated to detract from the originality of great artists or great writers .

		On the contrary , as is doubt - less perceived , it is precisely their individuality that is responsible for the constitution of new species , and in consequence for the evolution of literature and art . ''

		It is not difficult to see that the principle thus formulated must act as a solvent of the tra - ditional criticism of authority , and that its ac - ceptance must render obsolete , in very large measure , the method of judging contemporary products by the closeness with which they meas - ure up to classical standards .

		And it is also fairly evident to the reader of Brunetiere 's crit - icism of contemporary literature that his admi - ration of the past deadened his alertness to the possibilities of the present , and to no inconsid - erable extent dulled in him the prophetic sense .

		But the extremes to which modern impres - sionism has gone are such as to drive almost any judicially-minded critic into the camp of reaction ; and it is small wonder that
Brune	PERSON	- tiere 's balanced intellect , with its sense of his - torical perspective and its temper of essential sanity , should have been repelled by the restless extravagances of current critical expression , and should have sought refuge in the haven of a past of defined and realized ideals .

		The tide of recent criticism has set so strongly against any form of law or any sort of acceptance of authority that we can not but be grateful for the steadying influence exerted -- always forcibly if not ex - actly gracefully -- by the great critic who has just died .

		He has fought stoutly for thirty years in what must be admitted , despite certain defects of sympathy and aberrations of judgment , to have been a good cause , and his memory is de - serving of all honor .

		Whether or not his books will continue to be read far into the future , we can not foretell ; if they fall too speedily into neglect and forgetfulness , we feel bound to believe that it will be so much the worse for the future .

		THE MASTERNOTE IN LITERATURE .

		Death is the shadow which defines light .

		It is the mystery which underscores and emphasizes life .

		It is the negation which makes the assertion of existence valuable .

		The poetry of life , even the poetry of love , can not compare with the poetry of death .

		At the touch of death the common masks of life are dropped , the vulgar veils of flesh dissolve , and high and stately forms step forth , -- imagina - tions unembodied on earth , possibilities unhinted in the race we know .

		I have no desire to add a page to Drelincoiu * t on Death .

		But impatience consumes one at our modern attitude to the great , serious , and tragic themes of 190T . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 29 thought and art .

		Especially does our American hedonism , our love of pleasure , our fear of pain or shock , rebel at the best and highest in literature .

		We g ^ asp at the shallow criticism which speaks of the pessimistic , the melancholy , the gloomy , as the minor note .

		Even in music , from which this term is borrowed , it is not true that melancholy themes or notes which excite sad impressions are secondary .

		Most of the great symphonies , oratorios , requiems , are sad and stormy and terrible .

		And the same conditions are so plain in literature that a critic must apologize for pointing it out .

		But , our childish readers say , there is enough that is painful and shocking and horrible in life , -- why reiterate it in literature ?


Wordsworth	PERSON	prayed for frequent sights of what is to be borne .

		We do not acquire fortitude by running away from danger , and a literature of lollipops is not likely to make a strong race .

		The tragic part of literature is the most tonic and most inspiring .

		But to our task , which is to try to draw out the themes and situations in literature which have to do with death .

		First , there is the bier , the tomb , the grave themselves .

		Shakespeare frequently intro - duces the dead upon a bier .

		Antony comes to bury
Caesar	PERSON	, not to praise him .

		Richard wooes
Anne	PERSON	over the bier of her husband .

		King
Lear	PERSON	's heart cracks as
Cordelia	LOCATION	is borne in .

		Then there is the tomb of the Capulets , Hamlet at
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	's grave , the funeral of Imogen .

		Hugo has
Hernani	ORGANIZATION	amid the tombs of the kings ; and in
Byron	LOCATION	's '' Prisoner of ChUlon '' the prison becomes a grave .

		The grave yawned at every step in English eighteenth-century literature .

		Gray 's '' Elegy , ''
Blair	PERSON	's '' Grave , '' Young 's '' Night Thoughts , '' testify to the nerves of a people who were not afraid to face death .

		The Romantic school in
Germany	LOCATION	dealt so much in shrouds and cerements and fleshless bones that their literature is like an undertaking establishment .

		Burial alive is a theme which so fascinated the imagination of our greatest American literary artist that he made it the basis of several of his stories .

		Its possibilities are summed up , however , in
Juliet	LOCATION	's speech .

		Suspension of life by means of drugs is a common enough factor of plot .

		Juliet herself simu - lates death in that way .

		The deception of death is used by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in the ''
Winter	DATE	's Tale '' and '' Much Ado about Nothing . ''

		Temples , cathedrals , churches , are man 's tribute altars to deatli .

		From
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	and Stonehenge down they have been favored haunts of fiction , and in ``
Notre Dame	LOCATION	''
Victor Hugo	PERSON	has summed up and expressed the sentunent tliat attaches to them .

		Dead cities , ruins , relics of the past , these breathe forth the very odor of death .

		Marius meditating over the ruins of
Carthage	LOCATION	, Ossian apostrophising
Balclutha	LOCATION	, ChUde
Harold	PERSON	wandering among deserted fanes , -- these are figures that occur in this con - nection .

		Waste places , deserts , mountain tops , -- these are nature 's monuments of death .

		The first Christian anchorites , each one of whom was a memento m ^ ri , a living denial of life , retired to the edge of the Egyptian desert .

		Balzac 's '' Passion in the Desert '' expresses some of the sentiment of such places , and
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's
Tentation de St. Antoine	ORGANIZATION	gives the hal - lucinations which arise in them .

		Leopardi 's '' Ode to the Ginestra '' expresses the mountain desolation and much besides .

		Men are subject to partial deaths -- loss of limbs , decay of faculties , paralysis , age .

		Invalidism is in literature in a thousand forms .

		Two of its oddest figures are the hero of
Balzac	LOCATION	's Peau de Chagrin who had his life shortened every time he made a wish , and
Peter Schlemihl.who	PERSON	lost his shadow .

		There is a vast deal of poetry dedicated to the death of the year -- Autumn .

		I am inclined to think that the
Spring	DATE	poets are not so prolific , nor have they so good a subject .

		World engulfments , such as earthquakes , tidal - waves , volcanic destructions , are , like great wars , on too big a scale for literature to handle easily .

		Bulwer 's '' Last Days of
Pompeii	LOCATION	'' is an effort in this field , and there is a story of
Jules Verne	PERSON	's about the partial destruction of the earth by a comet .

		All these matters , however , are the mere fringe of our subject , the penumbra of the black eclipse .

		The centi-al body of tragedy is concerned with the agonies and deaths of single figures and selected groups .

		The wholesale massacres of war are , as I have said , at once too vast and too business-like to be of much use in fiction .

		The execution done by the ancient epic heroes was more interesting than anything of the kind since .

		As a fighter in the Iliad or uSneid , you had a rather intimate and engaging task before you .

		You met your opponent face to face ; you could select the special joint or organ you wished to carve or aim at ; you saw the blood gush and the death-spasm convulse him , -- and then you passed on to other work .

		In the middle ages , when your foe was a moving tower of steel , you were a great deal less in touch with him ; and in modern times , when unseen you pump lead at an invisible enemy a mile away , there can be no personal inter - est in the business at all .

		In the main , epic poetry is outward rather than inward , physical rather than spiritual , martial rather than tragic .

		The glitter of arms , sounding of trum - pets , neighing of horses , descriptions of apparel , houses , .

		cities , -- all the panorama of earth , ocean , air , -- these , ordered of course by some great event , are its subject matter .

		The deaths in it are inci - dental rather than inevitable .

		But in tragedy every - thing draws onward to the final stroke of fate .

		In the Agamemnon , all the incidents , -- the first glare of the beacon , the murmuring of the chorus about the dreadful past of the
House of Atreus	ORGANIZATION	, the shrinkings and vaticinations of
Cassandra	LOCATION	, -- lead up to the moment when the doors are thrown open and Clytemnestra is seen leaning on the blood - stained axe .

		The whispers of the Witches on the blasted heath fearfully presage the horrors that are to come in
Macbeth	LOCATION	.

		The ghost appears to
Hamlet	LOCATION	, and then there can be nothing but death and deso - 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, lation at
Elsinore	LOCATION	.

		It is this concentration of all effects upon a certain point , and that point the death of one or more great characters , which makes tragedy the most impressive work of man .

		There are deaths of high and holy mystery , -- such as that of
Moses	PERSON	, rapt away to his unknown grave ;
Elisha	LOCATION	, caught up hy the fiery chariot ; and CEdipus at
Colonus	LOCATION	, whose death , '' if ever any was , was wonderful . ''

		Another is the living death of Prometheus , chained to the rock , his vitals continu - ally eaten and continually renewed , until he consents to yield his secret to Zeus .

		Death scenes which hardly amount to high tragedy may yet rank as most pathetic and effective pages of fiction .

		How many tears have been shed over the death of
Little Nell er Paul Dombey !	ORGANIZATION

		What rather higher emotions have been roused by the passing away of
Lefevre	PERSON	or
Colonel Newcome !	ORGANIZATION

		And the death of Porthos , -- that scene alone would make
Dumas	PERSON	immortal .

		Newspaper writers invariably condemn the inter - est in murders as morbid .

		I am not sure I know what morbidity means , for I continually find myself applauding things in literature which persons of more delicate sensibilities tell me are tainted with that quality .

		I suppose the morbid is the abnormal , the unnatural .

		If this is so , the whole human race must be steeped in it , for there is nothing that so attracts and interests mankind as a murder .

		De Quincey 's grotesque papers on '' Murder considered as a Fine Art '' hardly overstate this interest .

		I suppose the feeling of the many in this matter is a compound of sympathy with the victim whose per - son and past is suddenly lifted into a glare of light , a sickening sense that the same thing might happen to themselves , a desire for revenge , and a shock of excitement which raises them for the moment above the dull routine of life .

		All these feelings are nat - ural .

		Probably three-fourths of the tragic pieces of the world , and a goodly share of the novels , are based on murder or suicide themes .

		Death overhanging but evaded , as in hair-breadth escapes , heroic histories , adventures by land and sea , forms a main strand of fiction .

		But death is the gate to the other world .

		Man - kind marches through its open portals , and comes not back .

		What do come back are troops of ghosts and gods , philosophies and religions , thoughts that assuage and assure .

		The scientific method has of late been applied to animism -- to occult and spiritual phenomena .

		Cases have been counted and tabulated , the credi - bility of witnesses investigated ; a vote has been taken , as it were , on the subject .

		Probably the re - sults will not convince anybody who did not believe before .

		But it is made certain that animism is as deeply rooted in the modern world as it ever was .

		And it is equally certain that its manifestations afford the best kind of literary material -- that they are the very bi-ood of awe and wonder and mystical predominance .

		Ghosts are the most natural , the simplest , of the spirit tribes .

		The human being desires or dreads companionship with the departed , and the Appear - ance comes .

		Or more frequently the Apparition is driven to walk the earth to expiate crimes commit - ted there , or to relieve itself of the burden of some secret .

		The ancients had such a fully equipped establishment of spiritual agencies that they did not have much recourse to ghosts .

		And these were too tame and gentle for the demonologists of the Dark Ages .

		Shakespeare really did most to propel them into literature .

		The ghost in
Hamlet	LOCATION	,
Banquo	ORGANIZATION	's spirit , the apparitions that rose before
Richard	PERSON	, these estab - lished the standing of the family in literature .

		The opposition between Good and Evil in the world was largely the origin of Demonology .

		People saw plainly enough that Evil usually had the upper hand , so they proceeded to worship or propitiate its deities .

		Eiirope kept a huge standing army of these things on foot for centuries , reaching from
Beelzebub	LOCATION	himself down to the humblest gnome or elf , with witches and warlocks for their human intermediaries .

		The Djinns , Afreets ,
Genii	LOCATION	, Ghouls of
Persia	LOCATION	and Arabia , were an allied race .

		Folk-lore and popular legend are full of such imaginations , and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	has pictured their
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	in
Faust	LOCATION	.

		Magicians , miracle-workers , interpreters of sig ^ ns , infest all ages .

		Such were the Enchanters who failed before
Aaron	PERSON	, or the Magi who had to give place to
Daniel	PERSON	.

		The early men of science were not only accounted miracle-workers by the populace , but themselves struggled to acquu'e occult powers .

		Pythagoras ,
Empedocles	LOCATION	, ApoUonius of
Tyana	LOCATION	, Par - acelsus ,
Friar Bacon	PERSON	, and even in recent times
Mesmer	PERSON	and Cagliostro , were probably half impos - tors , half seekers for the truth .

		The whole spirit of such personages is summed up in fiction by the single figure of
Faust	LOCATION	.

		Dumas 's '' Memoirs of a Physician '' is an immense and amusing explication of it .

		Gods are an integral part of the greatest litera - ture .

		In the big times of poetry , writers began from Jove and not from their neighbor in a street-car .

		And audiences took it as a compliment to them - selves to see divinities fighting , or conversing with , or making love to , their own ancestors .

		The vast elemental mythologies of
India	LOCATION	or
Greece	LOCATION	or Scan - dinavia tell yet on our imaginations .

		They tell more profoundly than anything that can be devised to-day .

		It can not too often be repeated that religion and philosophy and literature are one .

		They are synonymous terms for the same thing .

		Religion is sometimes the text , philosophy the comment , and literature the visualising agency ; but sometimes one precedes and sometimes another .

		The theogany of Hesiod came after the creation of ' Homer .

		The hymns of the Rig -
Veda	LOCATION	, the
Upanishads	LOCATION	, and the Hindu epics , followed in unknown order ; but they are all literature , and all religion , and all philosophy .

		The vast Catholic mythology was built up with scant reference to the Scriptures .

		The religious principles which have to do with death and the hereafter , the ideas of resurrection and immortality , have their philosophic counterparts
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 31 in
Plato 's Theory of Ideas	ORGANIZATION	and the Hindu thought of
Maya	ORGANIZATION	or Illusion .

		But the philosophical schemes are comparatively barren for literature ; whereas the religious ones burst out into creation everywhere .

		The final scenes of the Maha-bharata , the episodes in the Greek and Latin poets dealing with Hades and
Elysium	ORGANIZATION	, and , final summation of the whole ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's great poem , testify to the fruitfulness of those ideas .

		Multiplicity rather than unity is the ruling spirit of literature .

		It must have opposing forces , strife , varied pictures of life .

		The tribal systems of Indian cosmogany , the dualism of Zoroaster , the delicately divided mythology of
Greece	LOCATION	, are all conformable to its laws .

		Even when it gets a pure monotheism like the Jewish , it pi-oceeds as quickly as possible to transform it into a dualism and then into a trinity of good opposed to multiple powers of evil .

		For this reason , the Buddhistic idea of Nirvana can work little good for literature .

		There is a question whether the true doctrine of Nirvana is annihila - tion , or only resumption into God and the being freed from the pain of new birth .

		The latter inter - pretation is probably the Hindu one , while
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean thinkers who have accepted the doctrine --
Schopenhauer	PERSON	above all -- lean to the first .

		It is obvious that neither branch of this principle has any possibilities of literary growth and efflorescence .

		Modern science is also in some sense paralyzing to literature .

		When it discovers myriads of organ - ized creatures in a drop of water , and divides these again unto infinity into atoms and units of force , the human imagination is appalled and dismayed .

		Similarly , when it shows us streams of stars , clouds of nebulae , universe upon universe , floating like bubbles on the bosom of ether -- which substance itself is like death , a negation , yet the most potent thing there is -- we may be inspired , but it is with an insjiiration which can not realize itself in concrete terms .

		In beginning this series of brief inquiries into the root-ideas of fiction , I said that all literature is buUt up from a few scraps of nature and human experi - ence .

		This is not to say that it is , in its results , simple .

		Many , perhaps most , writers have a predilection for a certain set of impressions , a certain sphere of action or thought .

		They write love lyrics , and they think that love lyrics are the whole of poetry ; they pho - tograph contemporary life , and they insist that such work is all that is worth doing .

		But if from the two - score or more of syllabled sounds all the languages of the world have been built up , if from the eighty sim - ple elements there is made the whole universe , what are the possibilities of scheme and combination with the individual units of the human race ?

		The count of those that are or have been rise in their myriads to numbers beyond name .

		Yet no two have been alike .

		Each human being has viewed and reflected the uni - verse at a different angle and has been shuffled among his compeers in a different way .

		The possibilities of character and situation and plot are practically limitless .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Some of the problems of book publishing are brought out in a forcible way by Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	, the veteran
London	LOCATION	publisher , in an article in the
December	DATE	'' Contemporary Review . ''

		Referring to the '' Times book - war , '' and intimating that the `` Thunderer '' is grievously in error as to divers book-trade matters , Mr.
Murray	PERSON	passes on to points of general interest in con - nection with his business .

		Some of its difficulties are experienced in the sudden and mysterious dead stop that may occur in the sale of almost any book at any time ; in the unacknowledged and impaid-for editorial supervision that a work may call for after acceptance ; in the large demand for free copies of books -LRB- five for copyright purposes alone , in
England	LOCATION	-RRB- ; and m the doubling , in the last thirty years , of a publisher 's gen - eral establishment expenses .

		The popular belief that
Gladstone	PERSON	could secure the success of any book was proved false in the failure of three promising biographies published by Mr.
Miu-ray	PERSON	, two of them at
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's instigation , and all three puffed by reviews , speeches , and private commendation from the great statesman .

		Pride in producing works of lasting value prompted the issue of the '' Dictionary of Christian Biography , '' the ''
Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary of Hymnology , '' and the '' Classical Atlas '' ; but these praiseworthy undertakings still show a deficit of more thousands of pounds than the publisher cares to name .

		No business in
London	LOCATION	^ concludes the writer , except perhaps the management of a great newspaper , demands so much imremitting labor , alertness , and atten - tion to infinite detail , as the business of publishing books .

		• • • The revival of interest in the drama manifests itself in more ways than one .

		An encouraging symptom is the establishment in
Berlin	LOCATION	of a '' chamber theatre '' for the elect of cultured and discriminatingly apprecia - tive play-goers , those who enjoy '' intimate '' acting and to whom the conventional clap-trap of the stage is wearisome .

		In an oblong room panelled with mahogany , with no galleries or boxes , and without painted decora - tions , the spectator sinks into a luxurious arm-chair -LRB- for which he has paid twenty marks , by the purchase of eight tickets for the season -RRB- and is entertained by -LRB- let us say -RRB- a presentation of Ibsen 's '' Ghosts , '' in which the actors depend for effect wholly on their own intel - lectual and emotional equipment , foregoing the adven - titious aid of false hair on head or face , of paint , and of all the arts and devices employed in the ordinary stage '' make-up . ''

		Any forcing of the note would be out of harmony with the smallness and the tasteful simplicity of the '' chamber theatre , '' and there is nothing to mar the enjoyment of the play as the production of a master mind interpreted by gifted and sympathetic artists .

		The only regret is that the sphere of immediate influence of so praiseworthy an innovation should , of necessity , be so restricted .

		Yet even thus some measure of leav - ening downward may be looked for , as always in move - ments that make for the elevating of art and literature .

		• • • The endowment of '' lazyships '' at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	was once recommended by
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	.

		The wisdom of the learned man which cometh by opportunity of leisure , as the Preacher puts it , is not exactly the wisdom striven for by the late President
Harper	PERSON	's ideal professor who was to toil strenuously and gladly eleven months of the 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, year in order to recuperate -LRB- in a sanatorium -RRB- during the twelfth -- or perhaps to be cut off in his prime , as was Dr.
Harper	PERSON	himself .

		The decay of academic leisure is deplored by Mr.
Irving Babbitt	PERSON	in the current '' Har - vard Graduates ' Magazine . ''

		This writer aptly quotes Professor Bosanquet 's words : '' Leisure -- the word from which our word ' school ' is derived -- was for the Greek the expression of the highest moments of the mind .

		It was not labor ; far less was it recreation .

		It was that employment of the mind in which , by great thoughts , by art and poetry which lift us above our - selves , by the highest exertion of the intelligence , as we should add , by religion , we obtain occasionally a sense of something that camiot be taken from us , a real oneness and centre in the universe ; and which makes us feel that whatever happens to the present form of our little ephemeral personality , life is yet worth living because it has a real and sensible contact with some - thing of eternal value . ''

		The lesson is an old one , but not the less timely : what we are is more important than what we do ; wise passiveness is sometimes better than bustling activity .

		The present low estate of poetry has been ascribed to our lack of that contemplative leisure which is more and more difficult to find in the strenuous conditions of our modern life .

		Teaching the yoxxng idea how to shoot -LRB- with rifles -RRB- is a development that probably the poet did not so much as dream of when he penned his familiar line .

		Yet the advocates of general conscription in
England	LOCATION	, the '' Blue
Funk School	ORGANIZATION	, '' as they have been styled , appear to have inflamed the patriotic frenzy to such a pitch that the phrase '' children in arms '' now takes on a new meaning .

		A Devonshire vicar , evidently a repre - sentative of the church militant , is even quoted as de - claring : '' I would have every girl as well as every boy taught the use of the rifle , so as to be prepared , in case of emergency , to defend their homes , together with their brothers , husbands , and fathers .

		This is the spirit I inculcate in my parish .

		We want patriotic men and women , not cowards and sneaks . ''

		This reminds one of the turbulent paterfamilias and his blustering pronun - ciamento , '' I will have peace in the family if I have to fight for it . ''

		The educational imbroglio in
England	LOCATION	has its amusing aspects , especially as viewed from oiit - side ; but even an outsider can sympathize with the editor of '' The Westminster Review , '' who thus frees his mind : `` That rifle shooting should be taught in our elementary schools with the sanction of a Liberal Min - ister for education , affords an astonishing commentary upon our much-vaunted principles of ' Peace , Retrench - ment , and Reform . ' ''

		He trusts that the permission to add this new study to the curriculum will be speedily withdrawn -- a consummation devoutly to be wished by all who hold that the reading-book is mightier than the Krag-Jorgenson rifle .

		• • • Aspects of American cities , as seen by an English visitor , Mr.
Charles Whibley	PERSON	, best known as a sprightly essayist and the author of '' A Book of Scoundrels , '' '' The Pageantry of Life , '' and '' Studies in Frankness , '' have lately been receiving attention in ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		Of
New York	LOCATION	this observer says that '' the most vivid and constant impression that remains is of a city where the means of life conquer life itself , whose citizens die hourly of the rage to live . ''

		Visiting
Boston	LOCATION	, he is moved to declare that no more sudden or striking contrast can be found in
America	LOCATION	than between these two cities .

		Boston Common , the Old South Meeting-House ,
Faneuil Hall	PERSON	, the great university across the Charles -- these and other places and institutions he warmly admires ; but in asserting that
Harvard	LOCATION	'' still worships the classics with a constant heart '' he must be deceived as to how little of Latin and how much less of Greek -LRB- or is it now none at all ? -RRB-

		are at present required for a B. A. degree from our oldest imiversity . ''

		Culture , '' he says , '' has always been at once the boast and the reproach of
Boston	LOCATION	'' ; and he proceeds to criticise , with some deserved ridi - cule , the
Boston	LOCATION	passion for lectures , an American eagerness to acquire much in the least possible time .

		But he adds , referring to culture : '' Even now
Boston	LOCATION	, its earliest slave , is shaking off the yoke ; and it is taking refuge in the more modern cities of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Chicago is , I believe , its newest and vastest empire .

		There , where all is odd , it is well to be thought a ' thinker . '

		There , we are told , the elect believe it their duty ' to reach and stimulate others . '

		But wherever culture is found strange things are done in its name , and the time may come when by the light of
Chicago	LOCATION	's brighter lamp
Boston	LOCATION	may seem to dwell in the outer darkness . ''

		A CUKIOSITY IN COMMERCIAL LITERATURE , and at the same time a gratifying bit of evidence that , in these days of mammon-worship , of graft , of investigating committees , and of mud-rakers , we are not all gomg straight to perdition , is found in a seedsman 's trade catalogue from an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	business house .

		With a sub - lime trust in man 's -LRB- and woman 's -RRB- better nature , the head of this establishment has built up a prosperous business with none of the modern appliances of book - keeping and auditing , checks and balances , that seem to rest on the theory that everybody is presumably a rogue until he is proved honest .

		The following reads like a page from the description of trade methods in some Utopian Spotless-Town : `` The head clerks -LRB- they are ladies -RRB- pay themselves each week from the funds received by the one acting as treasurer .

		From year 's end to year 's end no receipt passes between us .

		When - ever the treasurer finds more money on her hands than she needs she passes it over to me , and I put it in my pocket without counting it .

		It is the same with the clerk below ; he pays off the men , and from time to time passes over to me the surplus , no receipt for moneys received or paid out ever being passed between us .

		The clerks at large have always been paid by the hour ; they keep their own accounts , hand these in to the lady in charge of their department at the close of each week , and are paid accordingly .

		During all my fifty years in business there has never been any reason to doubt the honesty of these weekly accounts . ''

		AH this , and more in the same pleasant strain , is in reply to a customer who , having sent money in an unregistered letter and failed to hear of its receipt , imputed dishonesty to some clerk in the firm 's employ .

		We are tempted to contrast with these humane methods the system in use at an institution of quite another sort , an institution dedicated to the cause of polite literature , -- a public library , in short , -- where the assistants are not free from the

		Even so cool a head as Professor

		Speaking at the

September	DATE	, he regretted the existing diversity of tongues as a hin - drance to international peace , and added : `` I express my strong conviction that this problem is on the way of being solved by means of an international auxiliary language . ''

		Hero-worship on the wane is the lament wafted to our ears from across the water .

		Shelley 's notebooks -- three little leather-covered memorandum books given by the poet 's widow to Sir
Percy Shelley	PERSON	, and by him to the late Dr.

London	LOCATION	to a rich American bibliophile , for

Auld Brig	PERSON	o ' Ayr '' immortalized by
Robert Burns	PERSON	-- before some odious American multimillionare shall appear on the scene and have the stones of the bridge numbered and carried off , to be built up again in his own back-yard .

		Another Scotchman whom it was some time ago proposed to honor with a monument in his native land is the great hero - worshipper himself ; for him a replica of the Chelsea statue was suggested , but at last accounts the originators of this plan were disposed to accept with thanks enough money to pay for a me - dallion portrait .

		As a gratifying exception to the rule , the preservation of the

		The right to publish private letters has re - cently become an interesting subject of discussion in
England	LOCATION	.

		A late decision of the Court of Appeal , whereby the right to publish certain letters of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	was declared to reside with their present pos - sessor or his agent , seems to entitle , in
England	LOCATION	, the receiver of letters to publish them without the consent of the writer , or of his executor or other legal represen - tative if he be dead .

		This , in the opinion of many , is a perilous state of affairs , and calls for legislative cor - rection .

		The persons most interested in the correspon - dence of a recently deceased celebrity are , manifestly , the surviving relatives and near friends , and not , in all cases , the recipients of the letters , or even the literary executor ; but the famUy and friends have at present no legal right to interfere with the publication of post - humous matter of this sort .

		Will the frankness and freedom of friendly correspondence suffer from all this something like a cold chill , and lose the charm of its careless informality ?

		The death of
Ferdinand Brunetiere	ORGANIZATION	is appro - priately noticed in a black-bordered leaflet inserted , evidently at the last moment , in the mid-December Revue des Deux Mondes , with which the eminent littera - teur was so long connected as contributor and editor .

		The obituary notice , from the pen of M.
Paul Leroy	PERSON	-
Beaulieu	LOCATION	, president of the magazine 's supervisory coun - cil , is merely preliminary to a longer and more studied article that is soon to follow .

		The Revue justly prides itself on havmg extended to Brunetifere the hospitality of its pages when he was poor and friendless , and on having retained and honored him until his death .

		That even in bodily suffering and decay he could still handle with an assured touch and a calm judgment the literary questions and contemporary problems that interested him , was evidenced by his latest contributions to the magazine which he conducted , and whose very last number of the year dying with himself was made up under his direction .

		... Record prices t-OR rare books , so far as this country is concerned , were paid in the year just closed -- another proof of commercial prosperity , if not of increased interest in literature .

		The '' Author of '' Ben-Hur . ''

		* It is nearly a twelvemonth since General
Lew Wallace	PERSON	died , in his seventy-eighth year .

		A full account of his long and remarkably eventful life , down to the
summer of 1864	DATE	, had been written by him in the preceding eight or nine years ; and this autobiography his widow , assisted by a friend .

		Miss
Mary H. Krout	PERSON	, now edits , with a continuation of the narrative .

		The whole is published in two octavo volumes of five hundred pages each , the final two hundred being the continuation .

		Portraits , facsimile letters , maps , and other illustrative matter , are amply provided , and the result is a work of more than ordinary interest , especially to the veterans of our great Civil War and to the survivors of the Mexican conflict .

		This earlier war takes up a hundred pages of the book , while the later one fills the
last half of the first	DATE	volume and two - thirds of the second .

		Besides being spirited and well written , this military narrative throws light on several matters of historic controversy .

		The pages devoted to the author 's early lit - erary aspirations and activity , and those describ - ing his rise and progress as a lawyer , a politician , and a diplomat , are thus cut down to compara - tively small proportions ; but this smaller sec - tion of the whole , especially the fraction of it that deals with the writer 's literary interests , may perhaps best be more particularly consid - ered in this review .

		The general outline of the author 's public life is too familiar , or at least too easily accessible in books of reference , to detain us here .

		What is less known is his early indication of artistic talent , which , combined with an equally early and pronounced passion for the paraphernalia of armed encounter -- a passion nourished by the Black Hawk War then in progress -- resulted in a series of battle - pictures such as by no means every boy could have drawn .

		Two of these spirited sketches are reproduced in the opening pages of the book .

		A fondness for poetry and romance , as for lit - erature generally ; a love of nature , especially of rivers , with an incurable tendency to play truant from sunrise to sunset ; and a delight in public oratory , whether set off by the imposing surroundings of a law-court or by the more turbulent accompaniments of a political gather - ing -- these youtlaful likings and affinities fore - shadow the varied pursuits and achievements •

		of the grown man .

		His education and shaping were largely his own .

		Though the son of one who rose to be governor of liis state -LRB-
Indiana	LOCATION	-RRB- and was afterward sent to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, young
Wallace	PERSON	's early environment was of the rudest , and the untimely death of his mother removed one of the few gentler influences that had soft - ened its asperities .

		Although he goes so far as to attribute wholly to his wife '' what of success has come to me , all that I am , in fact , '' a reser - vation must be made in favor of the mother , to whom he also pays tribute as follows : '' My mother , the Esther French Test already men - tioned , died in her twenty-seventh year , leaving me so young that her sweet motherliness is a clearer impres - sion on my mind than either her qualities or her appear - ance .

		Of the latter , all I can now recall are her eyes , large , sparkling , and deeply brown .

		They follow me yet .

		Indeed , through my seventy years there has never been a day so bright or a night so dark that , upon re - currence of the thought of them , I have been xmable to see them seeing me . ''

		The reminiscences of a rejected suitor supply us with details of her beauty and grace , the charm of her innocent coquetry , her fondness for dan - cing , and with it all her Puritan devoutness , her goodness and charity .

		The father too deserves more than a passing word .

		He had a fine taste in literature and could render effec - tively the productions of the great writers .

		A description is given of one of these family read - ings , of rare occurrence in
summer	DATE	, '' rather sovereign graces reserved for winter evenings , '' when solemn preparation was made by piling high the old-fashioned fireplace with fuel , and putting in place the table , lamp , and easy chair .

		Then at last '' we were ready ; so was the reader . '' ''

		My father had a face complementary of a beautiful head .

		A more serviceable voice for the carriage of delicate feeling I never heard .

		It was of all the mid - dle tones , and remarkably sensitive to the touch of the thought to be rendered .

		... He delighted , for ex - ample , in the Essays of
Elia	LOCATION	;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	he regarded with a kind of awe .

		It was from him I first had the full effects of '' The Lay of the Last Minstrel '' and ''
Childe Harold	PERSON	. ''

		He fixed my standard of pulpit eloquence by the sermons of Dr.
Chalmers	PERSON	,
Robert Hall	PERSON	,
Bossuet	LOCATION	, and
Bourdaloue	ORGANIZATION	.

		Once he gave an evening to Thucydides , and so powerful was his ren - dition of the retreat of the Athenians from
Syracuse	LOCATION	that it has since been one of my exemplars in historical writing . ''

		Another pen-portrait must be given .

		Lawyer
Wallace	PERSON	and his friend
Daniel W. Voorhees	PERSON	-- both of them recently established in their pro- fession at Coving-ton ,
Indiana	LOCATION	-- had taken advantage of a leisure day to hire a horse and buggy and drive to
Danville	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, where court was in session .

		In the tavern bar-room , after supper , sat three of the best story-tellers
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 35 of
Indiana	LOCATION	, '' swapping anecdotes '' with two '' famous lawyers and yarn-spinners of
Illinois	LOCATION	. '' ''

		The criss-crossing went on till
midnight	TIME	, and for a long time it might not be said whether
Illinois	LOCATION	or
Indiana	LOCATION	was ahead .

		There was one of the contestants , however , who arrested my attention early , partly by his stories , partly by his appearance ... His hair was thick , coarse , and defiant ; it stood out in every direc - tion .

		His features were massive , nose long , eyebrows protrusive , mouth large , cheeks hollow , eyes gray and always responsive to the humor .

		He smiled all the time , but never once did he laugh outright .

		His hands were large , his arms slender and disproportionately long .

		His legs were a wonder , particularly when he was in narration ; he kept crossing and uncrossing them ; some - times it actually seemed he was trying to tie them into a bow-knot .

		His dress was more than plain ; no part of it fit him ... About midnight his competitors were disposed to give in ; either their stores were exhausted , or they were tacitly conceding him the crown .

		From answering them story for story , he gave them two or three to their one .

		At last he took the floor and held it .

		And looking back I am now convinced that he frequently invented his replications ; which is saying he possessed a marvellous gift of improvisation .

		Such was
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	. ''

		Other reminiscences of Lincoln occur later .

		It was in one of the debates with
Douglas	PERSON	that the author first heard him address a large audience .

		After the first ten minutes all inclination to laugh at the orator 's grotesque appearance vanished . ''

		He was getting hold of me , '' says the writer . ''

		The pleasantry , the sincerity , the confidence , the amazingly original way of put - ting things , and the simple , unrestrained man - ner withal , were doing their perfect work ; and then and there I dropped an old theory , that to be a speaker one must needs be graceful and handsome . ''

		More follows , graphically descrip - tive of this memorable debate .

		Mrs.
Wallace	PERSON	has inserted a pen-picture , from an early friend of her husband , of his ap - pearance at the age of twenty-one .

		To complete this series of portraits , it may be well to give this one also .

		It is from an old letter of Miss
Mary Clemmer	PERSON	-LRB- afterwards the brilliant news - paper correspondent and author ,
Mary Clemmer	PERSON	Ames -RRB- . ''

		He is fashioned of the refined clay of which nature is most sparing , nearly six feet high , perfectly straight , with a fine fibred frame all nerve and muscle , and so thin he can not weigh more than a hundred and thirty pomids .

		He has profuse black hair , a dark , beautiful face , correct in every line , keen , black eyes deeply set , with a glance that on occasion may cut like fine steel Black beard and mustache conceal the firm mouth and chin .

		His modest , quiet manner is the only amende that can be made for being so handsome .

		In a crowd any - where you would single him out as a king of men .

		Marked for action rather than words , he is habitually reticent , yet when the time comes for speech is ready with eloquent words , given with a voice at once sweet and strong .

		A man of convictions , earnest in every nerve of his being , intensely earnest . ''


Wallace	PERSON	's early writing of `` The Fair God '' under the immediate suggestion of
Prescott	PERSON	's `` Conquest of
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' with no thought of printing , and its resurrection and publication long afterward , make a good story , but can not here be retold .

		One incident , however , con - nected with the book is too amusing to be passed by .

		A smooth-tongued gentleman , announcing himself as agent for a well-known
New York	LOCATION	publishing house , approached the young lawyer , engaged him in conversation on literary matters , incidentally betrayed a wonderful and enviable intimacy with aU the foremost writers of the day , then veered off to the subject of competi - tion among publishers , indicated the earnest desire of his house to hunt up and bring forward hidden talent , and finally begged to see the un - published novel which Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	was known to have in his desk .

		Then followed an exami - nation of the manuscript , enthusiastic praises of its merits , a promise to recommend it warmly for publication , and , last of all , a courteous demand of a fee -LRB- fifteen dollars -RRB- for services rendered .

		The fee was cheerfully paid , and the velvet - voiced gentleman departed .

		One knows not which to admire more , the ingenuity and skill of the self-styled agent or the frankness of his victim in telling the story .

		The Mexican War , whose outbreak the young
Indiana	LOCATION	law-student eagerly awaited , that he might be among the first volunteers to hasten to the front , he in his sober maturity does not hesitate to pronounce justifiable .

		Despite much inglorious hardship endured by him in a wretch - edly misanitary camp at the mouth of the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	, where hundreds died of a loathsome disease , and despite his smallness of opportunity to smell gunpowder , he unfalteringly declares , '' From that day to this I have never regretted the year left behind me as a soldier in
Mexico	LOCATION	; neither have I at any time since been troubled with a qualm about the propriety even to right - eousness of the war . ''

		In his detailed account of his Civil War experiences -- a military his - tory to be placed beside Grant 's and
Sherman	PERSON	's and
Sheridan	PERSON	's similar reminiscences -- the author gives a verbatim report -LRB- published prob - ably for the first time -RRB- of the findings of the commission that inquired into the conduct of the army under
Buell	PERSON	in
Kentucky	LOCATION	and Ten - nessee .

		Wallace , then a Major General , pre - sided at the sessions of this commission .

		His report , forwarded to
Washington	LOCATION	, was lost or stolen ; but luckily he had kept a copy , and this 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, copy is now printed .

		Its general tenor , as has long been known , was not favorable to
Buell	PERSON	.

		The book is excellent reading , especially for those fond of military history .

		Brisk and vivid in style , it has , if one may say so without un - kindness , the swing and vigor of '' a soul con - fident in itself | almost -RSB- to the superlative of vanity '' -- as the author writes in description of his yoimg manhood .

		Even Mrs.
Wallace	PERSON	's continuation of the narrative is so largely com - posed of letters and other matter from her husband 's pen -- including a reprint from '' The Youth 's Companion '' of '' How I Came to Write Ben-Hur ^ ' -- that we hardly notice the transi - tion .

		Errors of haste or negligence , including even lapses in grammar , and other more delib - erate faults , can be found by the critical ; but their enumeration would be a thankless task , and , now that the author is no longer living to profit by a friendly word of criticism , a motive - less one .

		Let the last word , then , be one of praise for this apparently faithful record ; for , as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	has said in words now familiar to many , '' There is no life of a man , faithfully re - corded , but is a heroic poem of its sort , rhymed or unrhymed . ''

		The Teaching op El , ementarx Economics .

		* Few fields of college and university activity have had so remarkable a development in Amer - ica during the last two decades as that enjoyed by the department ` of Economics .

		Although Political Economy had for years prior to
1885	DATE	held a place in the currictda of our colleges and universities , it was seldom pursued for more than one term , and its teaching usually devolved upon the professor of history , or more likely upon the president , who in addition to his ad - ministrative duties gave instruction in this sub - ject and in '' Moral Philosophy '' to the college seniors .

		Rarely indeed was the institution to be found which had the work in Political Econ - omy organized as a separate department .

		The character of the teaching in this subject was almost , if not quite , as backward as the organization of the work .

		The subject of Eco - nomic Theory was in all essentials the same as it had been left by
Kicardo	LOCATION	, MiU , and Senior .

		The cost theory of
Value	ORGANIZATION	, the abstinence theory of Interest , the Wage-fund theory , all had

		been subjected to little modification by the ep - igones who undertook to re-write and expound the doctrines of the masters .

		The discussion of most practical problems was equally ready - made .

		Only the subject of Protection awakened keen controversy , and here the teaching was that of the doctrinaire .

		The student might choose be - tween the free-trade doctrines of Sumner ,
Perry	PERSON	, and
Wayland	LOCATION	, or the protectionism of
Bowen	PERSON	and
Thompson	PERSON	; there was no middle ground .

		Bimetallism received some attention , and Tax - ation was not wholly neglected .

		The '' trust '' question had not yet begun to loom big on the horizon , trade-unionism was merely noticed as a desperate device of laborers to overthrow the laws of God and man , and railway rates and discriminations perplexed the shippers and the legislators more than they did the economic philosophers .

		In
1885	DATE
the American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	was founded by a small body of young men who had for the most part received their training in
Germany	LOCATION	, and who on their return to
America	LOCATION	placed themselves on record as opposed to the traditional methods of teaching Political Econ - omy then current in our coUeges .

		It is chiefly the work of these men which has made itself felt in the later-day instruction in economic science .

		There is no place within the limits of this re - view to discuss the ways in which the work of these men has modified the older doctrines and methods .

		This much , however , may be said : the teaching of Economics has ceased to be the work of doctrinaires , and is now almost every - where pursued according to the same methods tliat have proved so fruitful in the domain of the physical and natural sciences .

		This change in the methods of instruction has met with a hearty response on the part of both the general public and the student body .

		Peo - ple are boimd to become interested in a subject which occupies the attention of most men during the majority of their waking hours , and men of affairs welcome an analysis of business relations and institutions based upon historical research and statistical observation .

		There is abundant evidence of the growing confidence which busi - ness men and statesmen feel in the methods and conclusions of economic investigators and teachers .

		In all branches of the government service there is a pronounced tendency to utilize the services of men trained in the universities to conduct thorough and elaborate investigations into the workings of business institutions ; while within the university the latest development of the field of Economics is that which has been
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 prompted by the demands of the business world ,
viz.	LOCATION	, the expansion of the work so as to include instruction in accountancy , banking , commercial geography , commercial and industrial organi - zation , corporation finance , insurance , transpor - tation , etc. , for the purpose of training men for administrative positions in the industrial world .

		If we consider the fifteen or twenty leading universities in the country where the elective system has made most headway , we shall find that the elections within this department usually equal , if they do not exceed , those of any other department .

		Such an interest in the subject would not appear , were it not for the feeling that instruction in it is capable of yielding infor - mation which has for its possessors great practi - cal importance .

		The expansion of the field of Economics and the change in the mode of treating its subject - matter covdd not but react upon the pedagogical methods of the instructors .

		For some years after the revival of interest in the '' dismal science '' -- now no longer dismal -- the method of teach - ing was mainly by lectures .

		This was partly due to the fact that the text-books in existence were little more than re-statements of the doc - trines of the classical economist ; and , as already stated , these doctrines did not commend them - selves to the yoimger school .

		Another consid - eration which led to the selection of the lecture method was the fact that the majority of these younger teachers had been trained in the German universities and were desirous of introducing German pedagogical methods into this country .

		Experience showed , however , that the '' pouring in '' process did not succeed well with the aver - age undergraduate whose mind may be likened to a sieve rather than to a mould .

		The weak - ness of the lecture method became more appar - ent as the growth of the elective system pro- ceeded , and the ambition to increase the number and the size of the classes led to the gradual admission into the courses in Economics , first of the juniors , then of sophomores , and even in some cases of freshmen .

		The demand for a suitable text-book which should either displace the formal lecture or supplement this method of instruction made itself felt .

		The first works of this character to present modern views were those of the late
Francis A. Walker	PERSON	, in many respects the most original of American econo - mists .

		These text-books of General
Walker	PERSON	were weU written and were full of suggestion to pupil and teacher .

		They were produced , how - ever , before the more recent theories of
Value	ORGANIZATION	had made their influence felt on this side of the water , and as these theories gradually met with acceptance the
Walker	PERSON	texts were not easily reconciled with them .

		Furthermore , there were many points in
Walker	LOCATION	's theory of Distribution -- in particular , his residual claimant theory of wages -- which , while marking a decided advance over the older theories , proved unsatis - factory to many economists .

		An English trans - lation of one of the earlier editions of
Gide	PERSON	's '' Principles of Political Economy '' also met much favor for a time , but it too had been writ - ten before its author was thoroughly familiar with the marginal-utility theory of
Value	ORGANIZATION	, and it represented a very unsatisfactory attempt to harmonize the utility and cost theories .

		Pro- fessor
Marshall	PERSON	's weighty treatise on Economics was abridged for text-book purposes , but it covered only a part of the field , and proved difficult for many beginners .

		Professor
Ely	PERSON	's '' Outlines '' furnished a clear and concise state - ment of economic principles ; and the same may be said of Professor
Bullock	PERSON	's '' Introduction . ''

		Both of these books were widely used as text - books for some years , and are still in use in many of the smaller colleges where perhaps only one term 's work can be given to the elements of Economics .

		In the larger universities , however , where it is the custom to give four or five hours a week during a semester or even three hours for an entire year , these books furnished too brief an outline of the subject .

		Hadley 's '' Econ - omics '' served the purpose better , but this excellent work possesses some peculiarities of arrangement which have seemed to hinder its general adoption .

		Within the
last two	DATE	or three years there have appeared four text-books prepared with especial reference to their use in university classes .

		A new translation of Professor
Gide	PERSON	's book , which had been largely amplified and given an Ameri - can dress by its translator , Professor
Veditz	PERSON	, and two books written by two of the most bril - liant of our younger economists , Professor
Seager	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and Professor
Fetter	PERSON	of
Cornell	LOCATION	, made their appearance about the same time .

		These works were well received and have been widely adopted in university classes .

		The last of the four books to leave the publishers is that of Professor
Seligman	PERSON	of
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity .

		Professor
Seligman	PERSON	is the youngest of that group of scholars who , as already men - tioned , introduced the historical method of treatment of Economics into this country , and thus began a new epoch in its teaching and investigation .

		The value of any text-book will largely de - 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, pend upon the teacher who handles it ; and for this reason it is impossible to criticise such a work in a way which shall do much more than reflect the personal judgment of the critic .

		Of Professor
Seligman	PERSON	's scholarly abilities in this line of work there can be no difference of opin - ion .

		He has long ranked as one of the most patient investigators and keenest of critics now engaged in this field of knowledge .

		Having an easy command of four or five languages , and possessing the largest private library in Econ - omics in the world , Professor
Seligman	PERSON	has had splendid opportunities for becoming familiar with economic literature , and these opportunities have not been neglected .

		The advantages of his wide reading , probably not equalled by that of any other scholar on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, are in the present work shared with his readers .

		Perhaps the feature which commends it most strongly to the teacher is the carefully selected and well classified lists of books , periodicals , and government documents , which serve as an introduction to the book or appear at the head of the various chapters .

		Even the man who is pretty familiar with the literature of the sub - ject will be grateful for this accurate list of authorities and for the brief but pointed com - ments which accompany many of the titles .

		In the present reviewer 's opinion .

		Professor
Seligman	PERSON	's volume is likely to prove of more value to the teacher of Economics than to the beginner in the subject for whose benefit pri - marily it was written .

		This is not because of any lack of clearness or other defects of style .

		It is due rather to the fact that the author has attempted to cover too much ground and to introduce the student to too great a variety of subjects .

		It is true that a complete compre - hension of principles can not be had without considering all their ajjplications and all the institutions to which economic activities have given rise .

		This does not necessitate , however , introducing a beginner to a piecemeal consid - eration of all these subjects in order to furnish him an opportunity to get a firm grasp of fun - damental notions .

		In the present work , besides the subjects ordinarily covered in elementary treatises on Economics and formerly arranged under the general headings of Production , Ex - change , and Distribution , we have chapters on '' Economic Law and Method , '' '' The Economic Stages , '' '' The Historical Forms of Business Enterprises , '' including a discussion of theories concerning the clan and the family , '' The De - velopment of Economic Thought , '' '' Private Property , '' '' Competition , '' '' Freedom , '' '' Pov - erty and Progress . ''

		As brief statements , these chapters are excellently well done ; but in the case of most of these subjects it is not possible in the space allotted to give to the beginner such information as will enable him to comprehend the significance of these institutions or the part they play in economic life .

		The most unfortu - nate result of their introduction , however , lies in the fact that this necessarily curtails the space assigned to the treatment of the unsettled prob - lems of Economics , and this in turn leads to a rather dogmatic treatment of these problems .

		The discussion of the many vital and difficult questions which , taken together , constitute the so-called '' labor problem '' is compressed within nineteen pages .

		This means in the case of many of these questions only the barest outline .

		The subject of Industrial Cooperation , for example , covers less than a page of the text .

		Professor
Seligman	PERSON	expects very little from this move - ment ; but whatever one 's attitude of mind may be toward the practical results to be obtained , it is at least desirable that enough space shoidd be given to the subject to make the student realize the high ideal which Cooperation offers as a solution of the labor problem .

		The treatment of Credit is too briefly stated to be comprehended by a beginner , while the discussion of Socialism is almost superficial .

		In some instances , however , this brevity of treat - ment has proved conducive to lucidity , as , for example , in the case of the discussion of the rate of international exchange .

		The difficult subject of
Value	ORGANIZATION	, fortunately , commands more space than is assigned to it in any of the other text - books to which we have referred ; not less than one hundred pages -- one sixth of the book -- being taken up with its discussion .

		Nor is this a disproportionate emphasis when one takes into consideration the fundamental character of the subject and its difficulties for beginners .

		The discussion is not only thorough but clear .


Espe	PERSON	- cially commendable is the section which deals with
Social Values	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has been the experience of the reviewer that most text-book writers have failed to make clear to the student the distinc - tion between individual and social valuations ; or , rather , they do not make clear the fact that an individual 's valuation of a commodity is completely altered whenever it is possible to take advantage of other people 's valuations of the same commodity .

		One of the striking features of the book is the large place which is given to the influences of the physical and historical environment on the economic activities and theories of a people .

		THE DIAL 39 Professor
Seligman	PERSON	seems to have been influ - enced , more than most American economists , by the German historical school , though he is no blind follower of that school .

		As a general rule , there is no criticism to be passed upon this part of the book , but in some instances the author seems to have taken an extreme attitude , as when he seeks to explain the change from En - glish individualism to Australian socialism by mere differences in climate .

		Professor
Seligman	PERSON	follows closely the lead of his colleague , Professor
Clark	PERSON	, in his devel - opment of the theory of Distribution .

		Like the latter , he seeks to show the universality of the law of rent , and the return to each factor in production is calcidated according to the yield of its final unit employed .

		While not an un - qualified supporter of a protective tariff , the author attaches more weight to the arguments for protection than most economists have done , and he believes that a protective policy has been and still is a wise policy for the
United States	LOCATION	.

		His defense of what has come to be called the '' dumping policy '' of leading American manu - facturers , whereby a surplus at home is unloaded upon the foreign market at lower prices than these goods are sold for at home , is very weak . ''

		It does not follow , '' he says , '' that the lower foreign prices make the domestic price higher than it would otherwise be . ''

		But the price is certainly higher when a portion of the supply is withdi-awn to sell abroad than it would be if it were kept at home .

		It was because the whiskey producers coidd not prevent over-production during the early '80s that a pool was formed for the purpose of selling the surplus abroad in order to maintain prices at home .

		Always careful to avoid the criticism of being a blind partisan .

		Professor
Seligman	PERSON	does not hesitate to declare his position in regard to the perplexing problems of the present .

		His own treatment of these problems throughout the present work well illustrates the attitude of mind which on the closing page of his book he urges the student of Economics to take . ''

		The economic student , if he is worthy of his calling , will proceed without fear or favor ; he will be tabooed as a socialist by some , as a minion of capital by others , as a dreamer by more .

		But if he preserves his clearness of vision , his open - ness of mind , his devotion to truth , and his sanity of judgment , the deference paid to his views , which is even now beginning to be appar - ent , will become more and more pronounced . ''

		Echoes of a
Famous IjIterary Conflict	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In his preface to '' The Text of Shakespeare , '' Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	virtually admits that the title is a misnomer .

		.

		The volume is primarily a contribution to the literary history of the eighteenth century , and it wiU stand in our libraries among the commentaries on Pope .

		It is a long arraignment , based on the most ample evidence , of Pope 's mystifications and falsifica - tions of fact , his cowardly fighting from behind masked batteries , his unscrupulous malevolence in attack , and his astounding assumption of a severe and unassailable morality . ''

		His repu - tation as a poet , he asserted , or intimated , was but little in his thoughts ; what he desired to be considered was a man of virtue '' -LRB- p. 470 -RRB- . ''

		It is my morality only , '' he wrote to
Aaron Hill	PERSON	, '' that must make me beloved or happy '' -LRB- ibid . -RRB-

		.

		The occasion for this new exposure of Pope 's '' indirect , crook 'd ways '' is the story of his long quarrel with
Theobald	PERSON	over the constitu - tion of the text of Shakespeare -- if that can be called a quarrel which consists of unremitting and malignant depreciation and calumny on the one side , and an almost entire dependence upon the plain statement of facts on the other .

		The present volume is an attempt to reverse the decision of Pope 's case by his enlightened con - temporaries , and by aU but experts at the present day .

		The preternatural cleverness of Pope , the reverence in which he was held as the first poet of his age , the unscrupvdous zeal of his disciples , and the tendency of an uncritical public to accept as true whatever is rejjeated with suffi - cient frequency and emphasis , all contributed to bring about a miscarriage of justice .

		In the minds of any intelligent and attentive jury .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, though he declares that he does not hold a brief for
Theobald	PERSON	, must be considered to have secured a judgment for him , though at the eleventh hour .

		The book has , therefore , the additional merit of being an attack upon what its author calls , not unjustly , '' that collection of notions and fancies and prejudices and traditional beliefs which we dub with the title of literary criticism '' -LRB- p. 485 -RRB- .

		For it is tmdoubtedly true that the current opinion of
Theobald	ORGANIZATION	, so far as his name is known at aU , is the one of Pope 's creating .

		Many of his admirable emendations and inter - pretations of the text of Shakespeare have been •

		40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, apjDi-opriated by editors who have depreciated t ^ e man whom they phmdered .

		His own scru - pulosity in giving full credit to anyone from whom he took a suggestion has been so effectu - ally used against him that , as Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury wittily puts it , '' anyone who familiarizes himself with the practice he pursued , and the treatment which he received as a consequence of it , will become thoroughly disabused of any belief in the truth of the maxim that honesty is the best policy '' -LRB- p. 639 -RRB- .

		The authoritative edition of Pope 's works by
Elwyn and Court	ORGANIZATION	- hope says of Theobald : '' He was pedantic , poor , and somewhat malignant .

		He had at - tempted with equal ill-success original poetry , translation , and play - writing ; and had indeed no disqualification for the throne of Dulness except his insignificance '' -LRB- vol .

		iv. , p. 27 -RRB- .

		Yet Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	makes it clear that Theo - bald was no pedant , unless exact and extensive scholarship be pedantry , that he was not poor , and that his '' malignancy , '' when compared with Pope 's , strangely resembles generosity ; that his poetic gift was regarded as sufficient to entitle him to be considered for the laureateship , and that a play , written when he was twenty , was performed by the two principal tragedians of the time ; and finally , that he was as little en - titled to the '' bad eminence '' to which Pope raised him in the original Dunciad as the great
Bentley	LOCATION	himself .

		Theobald 's '' childlike confi - dence in the fairness of future generations , '' says Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, '' was never born of insight '' -LRB- p. 537 -RRB- , nor was his vmderstanding of human nature very acute when he wrote of his corrections of Pope 's text : '' Wherever I have the luck to be right in any observa - tion , I flatter myself Mr.
Pope	PERSON	himself will be pleased that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	receives some benefit '' -LRB- p. 191 -RRB- .

		But Mr.
Pope	PERSON	was not pleased .

		Instead , he prefixed , apparently for all time , the epithet '' piddling '' to
Theobald	ORGANIZATION	's name .

		The story of the quarrel is so interesting an illustration of '' the amenities of literature '' that a brief summary of Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's am - ple treatment may perhaps be welcome .

		In
1725	DATE	appeared Pope s long-heralded edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, about which , as Professor
Louns	PERSON	- bury remarks , '' everything was excellent but the editing '' -LRB- p. 82 -RRB- .

		Despite his professions .

		Pope had entirely failed to perform the plain duties of an editor .

		He had made no carefid collation of the original texts , and indeed had so little perception of the value of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	as to write , `` It is from it that almost all the errors of succeeding editions take rise '' -LRB- p. 82 -RRB- .

		He ignored or suppressed variants , he made silent emendations , he neglected to ex - plain difficulties in the text , or explained them wrongly .

		His chief contributions of value were certain verbal re-arrangements in the interest of metre , the addition to the Folio text of many lines taken from the quartos , and the elimina - tion from the canon of six non-Sliakespearean plays that had been included in the
Third Folio	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even the much-lauded poetical taste displayed by Pope as an editor , in which , despite his de - fects , he was and still is regarded as supreme , did not prevent him from suspecting that '' The
Winter	DATE	's Tale '' and `` Love 's Labour 's Lost '' were not wholly
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		Theo - bald 's '' Shakespeare Restored : or , a Specimen of the many Errors , as well committed , as un - amended , by Mr.
Pope	PERSON	in his late Edition of this Poet , '' etc. , which appeared in
1726	DATE	, was not , therefore , an impertinence .

		Moreover , says Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, '' his treatise surpasses in interest and importance any single one of its numerous successors '' -LRB- p. 155 -RRB- .

		It abounds in felicitous and what now seem inevitable emen - dations , among them the famous '' a babied of green fields '' ; and these emendations are not the resvdt of mere conjecture but are supported by parallels drawn from other plays . ''

		In short , '' as Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	says , '' his method was the method of a scholar , and wherever he erred it was the error of a scholar , and not of a hap - hazard guesser '' -LRB- p. 160 -RRB- .

		But one serious error he made from which scholarship could not save him , -- of which , indeed , scholarship was the direct cause , -- he proved himself to be , as an editor of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the manifest superior of the leading poet of the age .

		This would probably have been sufficient to gain Pope 's enmity , which was never merely passive ; but it must be granted that
Theobald	PERSON	was not inclined to depreciate or conceal his superiority to the poet in this particular , -- a failure , as the sequel proved , not more in civility than in discretion .

		For , in
1728	DATE	, he found hmiself elevated by the Dimciad to the very throne of Dulness .

		He was dethroned , to be sure , by the edition of
1743	DATE	, in favor of
CoUey Gibber	PERSON	, but this was too late for his fame .

		Thanks to Pope 's diligence and influence , most of the men whom he stigmatized as dimces are to-day regarded as deserving the title , and
Theobald	ORGANIZATION	is no exception to this rule .

		Nevertheless , it shovdd be remembered that , in Pope 's mind ,
Bentley	PERSON	too was a dimce , and
Theobald	PERSON	may well have felt consolation , if not pride , in being pilloried with that great scholar .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 In
1734	DATE	, he made a reply to Pope 's charges that all competent judges must deem sufficient : he brought out his own edition of the works of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, which , for correctness of method and felicity of emendation and explanation , was as superior to Pope 's as to most of its successors .

		Some of Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's most interesting and valuable pages are devoted to illustrations of these excellences .

		The attacks upon Theo - bald were not , however , on this account remitted , but continued in the pages of '' The Grub Street Journal , '' which `` owed its conception and crea - tion ... maiidy to Pope '' -LRB- p. 385 -RRB- .

		Such , in brief , is the history of the great '' Shakespearean War '' of the eighteenth cen - tury , the outcome of which was far enough from being a '' Judgment of God . '' ''

		The fate of Theobald , '' concludes Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, '' is likely to remain for all time a striking instance in the annals of literary history , of how suc - cessfully , to use the words of the author he did so much to illustrate , malice can bear down truth '' -LRB- p. 567 -RRB- .

		In style , this volume is delightfully clear and entertaining , despite some rather painful lon - gueurs .

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	wears his learn - ing lightly , and the reader , therefore , feels no burden .

		It is full of the personal touches , keenly or blandly satirical , which his readers always expect , and in which no American lit - erary scholar surpasses him .

		His luminous and personal style should be an example to all who practice the difficult art of criticism .

		The Tkade Organizations of MEDiiEVAL
Italy	LOCATION	.

		* To the general reader of history , mediaeval
Florence	LOCATION	is the city of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Petrarch	PERSON	, the home of the Renaissance , the birthplace of mod - ern culture .

		Early Florentine history is to him a long and important chapter in the story of European civilization ; from the city on the Arno the popular imagination views at the same time the splendors of the Athenian past and the still grander accomplishments of our own age .

		While it is true that the achievements of Flor - ence in the field of intellect constitute her chief glory , still her history is not wholly concerned with letters and art .

		Even genius has certain • The Guilds of

Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Illus - material wants that somehow must be satisfied .

		The city that first acquainted western
Europe	LOCATION	with the treasures of Greek learning was the city that coined the florin .

		In commerce and industry , as well as in matters of culture ,
Flor	PERSON	- ence was for several centuries one of the leading centres of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The material side of Tuscan history has been made the subject of an extended study by Mr.
Edgcumbe Staley	PERSON	, an enthusiastic student of the Florentine past .

		Mr.
Staley	PERSON	's investigations make a volume of about six hundred pages ; it is provided with a large number of splendid illustrations , nearly all of which are reproduc - tions of miniatures and are consequently of great historic value ; it also contains several excellent photographs of buildings and other his - toric survivals .

		The author groups his sources under four heads : manuscripts , printed matter , letters from authorities and friends , and per - sonal knowledge of the city and its people .

		The work is , however , to some extent a compilation merely , as the author , instead of making a per - sonal examination of the manuscript sources , seems to have depended largely on the conclu - sions of earlier students .

		There can be no doubt that the intention of the publishers was to produce a popular history rather than a strictly scientific work .

		The author 's intentions are not so clear , though the volume closely resembles the popular type in many respects .

		It is not provided with notes of any sort , and the literary style is too exu - berant to be that of an historian writing pri - marily for students .

		In his opening paragraphs the author speaks of the three young sisters that were fostered in the vale of Arno , -- Art , Science , and Literature , -- and continues as follows : '' No question ever arose as to whose was the subtlest witchery , but each developed charms , distinct and rare , yet not outrivalling one the other .

		With harmonious voices blended , and ambrosial tresses mingled , the three interlaced their comely arms , and tossing with shapely feet the flowing draperies of golden tissue , which softly veiled the perfect contours of their beauteous forms , they gaily danced along .

		Their enchanting rhythm was the music of the new civilization : -- it we know -- and them -- but what of their origin ?

		whence came they ?

		and who were their forebears ? ''

		It would only be doing justice to the author to say , however , that rhetorical outbursts like the one quoted are not general throughout the volume .

		The spirit of the writer seems in the main to be that of the true historian : he quotes freely from his sources , and at least aims to be 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, accurate in his statement of facts .

		To such an extent has he fillecl the work with details of all possible sorts , with dates and statistics , with Italian words and phrases , with allusions to laws and constitutional changes , with lists of merchants and bankers , and with other data both historic and scientific , that the reading of even these beautifully printed pages after a time becomes somewhat tedious .

		The author has presented top much of his materials in an undigested form : as a popular historian , he has not been entirely successfiU .

		The author introduces his subject in two chapters of a general nature in which he dis - cusses the extent of Florentine commerce and the methods of the mediaeval merchant .

		In the first he sketches the rise of
Florence	LOCATION	from com - parative obscurity in the days of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	to the high place that she held seven centuries later . ''

		From the twelfth to the sixteenth cen - turies
Florence	LOCATION	easily held the first place in the life and work of the known world : she was in fact
Athens	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	combined . ''

		This pre - eminence is ascribed to '' accidents of climate , geographical position , and pequliarities of race . '' ''

		The cumulative energies of the Florentines had their focus in the corporate life of the trade associations , and in no other community was the guild system so thoroughly developed as it was in
Florence	LOCATION	. ''

		The general history of this sys - tem is the principal theme of the second chapter .

		Ab to the origin of the guilds , the author be - lieves they have been '' rightly traced to the corporations of merchants and artisans which existed in
Rome	LOCATION	under
Numa Pompilius	LOCATION	. ''

		Ap - parently Mr.
Staley	PERSON	has no doubts as to the existence of that venerable monarch , or the credibility of the early traditional accounts of him .

		These corporations were revived in the Lombard region in 825 , although more than two centuries passed before they secured a firm footing in
Florence	LOCATION	.

		As the years went by and the guilds grew in importance they developed an elaborate constitution , or rather a type of guild government , as the various corporations had their own constitutional peculiarities ; of these matters the author gives us a fairly clear state - ment .

		In the same connection he also discusses the authority , exercised by the guild officials in the general government of the city .

		In the course of time the trade organizations of
Florence	LOCATION	came to be grouped into seven greater , five intermediate , and nine minor guilds .

		To each of the seven greater guilds the author devotes a chapter .

		First in rank was the cor - poration of judges and notaries ; next in impor - tance were the dealers in foreign cloth and the merchants engaged in the wool trade ; important also was the g-uild of bankers and the dealers in silk ; the guilds of doctors and apothecaries and of furriers and skinners held a somewhat lower place , but were still counted among the seven .

		In each case the author tries to famil - iarize us not only with the history of the guild , but with its work as an organization , with its opportunities and its limitations , with its meth - ods and its importance at home and abroad .

		We are told how cloth was woven and silk was dyed ; how furs were prepared and drugs were mixed ; how banks were conducted and lawyers were trained .

		The reader is taken into the courts , the counting-house , the apothecary shop , the market , and the factory , and in each par - ticular place the work is inspected with consid - erable care .

		Two chapters are devoted to the five inter - mediate guilds : those of the butchers , the black - smiths , the shoemakers , the masters of stone and wood , and the retail cloth-dealers .

		Three chapters are given to the nine minor trades .

		The same style of treatment is employed throughout , though naturally the lesser trades , which were of local importance only , are not discussed so fully as the gTeater guilds , whose agents and representatives were found in every commercial centre in the known world .

		It is not likely that very many readers will be able to plough through all of the twenty chapters of '' The Guilds of
Florence	LOCATION	. ''

		Too much technical matter has been inserted , and the details are often uninteresting and unim - portant ; at least they will seem so to all who have not made a closer study of the Renaissance period .

		But no one with any interest in the general subject can afford to miss the last hun - dred pages of the book , in which the author treats such matters as the market , the streets , the squares , and the bridges ; the religion , the patronage , and the charity of the guilds ; and the wealth and power of the great Tuscan city .

		In these pages , as well as elsewhere in the work , the reader is given a close view of Florentine life , and he can not fail to understand the later middle ages better from having read them .

		No doubt the author 's enthusiasm has led him at times to employ strong and vivid colors ; but the Florentine student can hardly avoid being enthusiastic , and the world understands and judges accordingly .

		The central cluster of buildings , crowning the summit and resplendent with its five golden pavilions on its roof , was of a dull crim - son , that gives it the name of the ' Red Palace , ' whilst those on the other flank were of dazzling white ; and the great stairway on each side , leading down to the chief entrance and gardens below , zig-zagging outwards to enclose a diamond - shaped design , recalled a similar one at the

		A mysterious effect was given to the central portion of the building by long curtains of dark purple yak - hair cloth which draped the verandahs , to protect the frescoes from the rain and sun , but which seemed to muffle the rooms in scenery . ''

		games , sports , sacred theatrical performances , and have an inordinate love of jewelry .

		There are but few children and few old people among them , the rigorous climate permitting only the survival of the strongest .

		The greatest interest that Colonel Wad -
dell	ORGANIZATION	found in this city of the
Great Buddha	LOCATION	was connected with the religious rites and ceremonies of the monks and the explorations among the scrupu - lously guarded secret places of the great palace .

		Here the author is most impressive , and does much toward lifting the veil that has so long hung over the mysteries of
Lhasa	LOCATION	.

		The connection between the book just noticed and the one entitled `` Western Tibet and the British Borderland , '' by Mr.
Charles A. Sherring	PERSON	, is more intimate than at first appears .

		That the treaty of
Lhasa	LOCATION	, consummated by the
Younghusband	PERSON	mission , marked a new era in the political and commercial relations between
Tibet	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	is evident from the cordiality and friendship extended by the native officials of
Western Tibet	LOCATION	, or
Nari	PERSON	, toward the mem - bers of Mr.
Sherring	PERSON	's mission .

		This mission , which was sent into
Nari	PERSON	for the purpose of inquiring into the commercial possibilities of that little-known country , met with a friendliness hitherto unknown .

		Its connection with the mission described in
Colonel Waddell	ORGANIZATION	's book is thus explained by Mr.
Sherring	PERSON	: '' These officials of ' The Forbidden Land ' were at first a little anxious to cast a veil of mystery over things generally , and especially over all matters religious ; and it was not for us to intrude where we were not wanted .

		But when the
Jongpen	PERSON	came to our camp another day I took
Waddell	PERSON	's ' Lhasa and Its Mysteries ' and systematically took him through all the photos , pictures of persons , officials , temples , and all the most sacred spots , and the most private details of the highest functionaries ... When he had seen pictures of all that used to be so secret and mysterious in
Lhasa	LOCATION	, there was , in the words of Holy Scriptures , ' no spirit left in him . ' ''

		Mr.
Sherring	PERSON	asserts that `` the concessions that have been obtained by the treaty at
Lhasa	LOCATION	in regard to
Gartok	PERSON	-LSB- the capital of
Western Tibet	LOCATION	-RSB- are of greater importance to the native subjects of His Majesty than the whole of the concessions in
Eastern Tibet	LOCATION	.

		By far the larger part of the popu - lation of
India	LOCATION	is composed of Hindus , who are not traders or miners , to whom wool and borax do not appeal ... But the Hindu is first and foremost a devotee , and to him the claims of this religion incomparably outweigh all else that is secular . ''

		Hence this treaty , which permits free ingress into
Tibet	LOCATION	, invites the Hindu to make pilgrimages to holy Kailas and to other equally sacred slu-ines in
Western Tibet	LOCATION	.

		Out of these pilgrimages may come , so thinks the author , an increase in commerce .

		But if Mr.
Sherring	PERSON	's own descriptions of
Western Tibet	LOCATION	are to be taken as evidence , it will be a long time before that country will be productive enough to repay commercial encouragement .

		Surrounded by rugged mountains , with a scanty population living on the wide wind-swept and waterless plateaux , and with an extreme elevation .

		Western Tibet offers lit - tle inducement to the trader .

		There is , to be sure , 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, gold in the mountains , but the physical difficulties are too great to mine it with profit .

		For these rea - sons it will probably remain , for a long time at least , only a dwelling-place of the Hindu gods .

		The best parts of Mr.
Sherring	PERSON	's volume are the chapters devoted to the legends and myths of the natives , especially the Bhotia tribes of the frontier , and to the quaint customs and manners of the British Borderland .

		Here Mr.
Sherring	PERSON	, who has for some years been Deputy Commissioner of
Almora	LOCATION	, is more at home than he is at
Tibet	LOCATION	, and he knows his subject so thoroughly that he writes with more fulness and freedom than when discussing the pos - sibilities of
Nari	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
T. G. Longstaff	PERSON	, who accom - panied the author on his journey , contributes an account of a week 's climb on
Gurla Mandhata	PERSON	, the highest mountain in
Western Tibet	LOCATION	.

		Like nearly all recent books on
Tibet	LOCATION	, this volume is exceedingly attractive in its make-up : there is an abundance of good pictures and excellent maps -- features that no doubt suggest the importance of
Tibet	LOCATION	to stay-at - home Britishers .

		The literature of
Tibet	LOCATION	has grown to large pro- portions in the past few years , and the imme - diate interest in the Tibetan situation is sufficiently acute to demand a handbook which will serve both as an introduction to and a summary of the various expeditions and travels , and of the geographical and political features of that well-nigh impregnable land .

		Such a book is '' Tibet the Mysterious , '' by Colonel Sir
Thomas H. Holdich	PERSON	.

		Colonel Holdich , although not an explorer or traveller in
Tibet	LOCATION	, has made an exhaustive investigation of all the litera - ture relating to that country , and has summarized his studies in an accurate and systematic manner .

		For those who wish to plunge in medias res con - cerning
Tibet	LOCATION	, his book will be most acceptable .

		The book opens with a description of the geo - graphical situation of
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		With the excellent map of the country before him , the reader can readily understand the various routes which open the way to the '' roof of the world . ''

		By far the most interesting and valuable part of the book is the summary of the classics of Tibetan adventure and exploration .

		All these expeditions -- from the time of the earliest Mongolian invasion , the eighteenth - century explorations by the monks , the mission of the
Englishman Bogle	PERSON	,
Thomas Manning	PERSON	's visit to
Tibet	LOCATION	and
Lhasa	LOCATION	,
Moorcroft	ORGANIZATION	's mysterious attempt .

		Hue and
Gabet	ORGANIZATION	's journey , and the more modern at - tempts of
Rockhill	ORGANIZATION	,
Prjevalski	LOCATION	,
Needham	LOCATION	,
Chandra Das	PERSON	,
Wellby	LOCATION	,
Bower	PERSON	,
Littledale	LOCATION	,
Bonvalot	LOCATION	,
Sven Hedin	PERSON	, Ryder ,
Rawling	PERSON	, and
Younghusband	PERSON	-- are chronologically described and amply examined for historical , geographical , political , and ethnological data .

		With
Lhasa	LOCATION	itself , however , the book has little to do .

		`` It is intended to illustrate to some extent the sequence of exploration in that great wilderness of stony and inhospitable altitudes which lie far beyond
Lhasa	LOCATION	. ''

		While
Colonel Holdich	PERSON	does not pose as a commercial prophet , he too , in agreement with Messrs.
Waddell	PERSON	and Sherring , holds forth the tantalizing bait of the great wealth of gold which lies so near the surface in many parts of
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		We note an easily corrected error on page 102 , where the author says that
Bogle	PERSON	's Mission returned from
Tibet	LOCATION	in
1874	DATE	, -- the correct date being
1784	DATE	.

		He evidently accepts the story that
Moorcroft	PERSON	reached
Lhasa	LOCATION	and lived there for some time before his death in
the first quarter of the last century	DATE	; but it should be remembered that the story is founded on circumstantial evidence .

		His assertion that '' the Tibetan men and women never wash their faces '' is contradicted by
Colonel Waddell	PERSON	, who tells about a Saturnalian feast where the women washed their faces , revealing their rosy cheeks .

		These minor errors , however , detract but little from the otherwise scholarly work of the author , which will be held in high esteem as a general reference-book for the his - tory of exploration and travel in
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		One need not go to the
Far East	LOCATION	, however , to find the spirit of mystery .

		The Near East -- in the
Balkans	LOCATION	-- presents a politico-religious problem as difficult as may be foimd anywhere in the world .

		Mr.
John Foster Eraser	PERSON	, an English newspaper cor - respondent , is one of the most recent travellers in that section of
Europe	LOCATION	, and his book entitled '' Pic - tures from the
Balkans	LOCATION	'' intensifies the general opin - ion that some sort of interference must be brought about to stop Turkish misgovernment on the one hand and the internal dissension of the
Balkan States	LOCATION	on the other .

		Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	went through the country , from
Belgrade	LOCATION	to
Sofia	LOCATION	, to
Plevna	LOCATION	,
Tirnova	LOCATION	,
Philippolis	LOCATION	, to
Adrianople	LOCATION	, thence southward through the ill-defined boundaries of
Macedonia	LOCATION	to
Salonika	LOCATION	, to
Monastir	LOCATION	,
Ochrida	LOCATION	,
Elbasan	LOCATION	, and
Berat	LOCATION	, and then northward to
Uskup	LOCATION	, and departed from the
Balkans	LOCATION	on the line he had entered .


Montenegro	LOCATION	was not visited .

		The keynote to the book is struck in the opening paragraph : `` Riding in
Macedonia	LOCATION	, I passed the village of
Orovsji	LOCATION	.

		The inhabitants had just buried seven Bulgarians and four Turkish soldiers who had killed each other the previous day .

		Otherwise all was quiet . ''

		Near the close of the book we read : '' Everybody is jolly .

		Murder is so commonplace that it arouses no shudder .

		In the night is the little bark of a pistol , a shriek , a clatter of feet . '

		Hello !

		somebody killed ! '

		That is all . ''

		These truly picaresque descriptions are indicative of Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	's style and tone .

		But in describing a land where democracy and aristocracy are in a death-grapple , where religion and bloodshed are synonymous terms , where '' natives occasionally die from disease , but generally from differences of opinion , '' and where the Powers are playing the part of hungry vultures waiting for the time of feasting , it is permissible for an author to be picturesque , cynical , and pessimistic , -- especially if he be a European .

		When the real struggle comes in the
Balkans	LOCATION	, it will be precipitated , asserts Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	, by the dour , sullen , stolid , unimaginative , unsenti - mental , but hard-working , plodding , and ambitious Bulgarians , who , he thinks , will prevail in the con - test .

		But when
Bulgaria	LOCATION	acquires the fruits of her
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 energy and victory over
Turkey	LOCATION	, then will come the tug of war among the European Powers ; for neither
Austria	LOCATION	nor
Russia	LOCATION	nor
Germany	LOCATION	, nor perhaps
Italy	LOCATION	, will acquiesce in the creation of another Power in the
Near East	LOCATION	.

		And when this political
Ragnarok	ORGANIZATION	is fought out to the bitter end , says Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	,
Germany	LOCATION	, in the event of the defeat of
Turkey	LOCATION	, expects to be the Power that will subjugate the rivals .

		On the other hand , if Turkish arms should prevail ,
Germany	LOCATION	will demand as her price for aid - ing Tm-key , first concessions , then protectorates , then possessions .

		The only glimmer of hope for the
Balkan States	LOCATION	lies in the great dream of perfection -- a Balkan Confederation with the Turks a party to the confederation .

		Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	's pictures of the
Balkans	LOCATION	are in oscuro -- so much so that two of the illustrations which reveal horrible scenes are printed on leaves provided with perforations , that they may he easily torn from the book by squeamish readers .

		Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	adds nothing particularly new to our knowledge of affairs in the
Balkans	LOCATION	, and for this reason we wish he had given us more chapters simi - lar to his pleasing and diverting ones entitled '' The Rose Garden of
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB- meaning thereby the rose plantations near Kasanlik -RRB- and `` His Majesty 's Representative , '' a description of a British consulate in the
Balkans	LOCATION	.

		Briefs on Ne ^ v Books .

		Education , - Professor Home 's new book on '' The is it a science Psychological Principles of
Educa	LOCATION	- oranartf tion '' -LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- contains much that is of uncommon value and significance .

		It is unfortunate that the first part of the book consists of a discussion of the somewhat worn question , '' Is there a Science of Education ? ''

		and adds nothing of importance to the debate , falling into the common error of confusing the question of the existence or possibility of scientific study of education with that of the existence of a science of education .

		The existence of a science of education does not dejjend upon the methods of educational study , but upon the question whether education constitutes an independ - ent and intrinsically unitary body of knowledge such as to form the groundwork of a science .

		We believe this question must be answered in the nega - tive ; nor is the dignity and importance of education one whit lessened by such a conclusion , -- indeed , its place is rather elevated by the belief that it is not a science , but a great life-art , ministered to by a circle of auxiliary sciences .

		The very question with which Professor Home 's discussion opens is damaging evidence : '' Is there a science of educat - inff ? ''

		-LRB- page 3 -RRB- .

		If so , why not a science of box - ing , or any other indubitable art ?

		The conception of normative science falls into confusion in that the normative is declared to be based upon the descrip - tive .

		`` The best in the descriptive , '' we read , `` is the basis for the normative '' -LRB- page 17 -RRB- .

		But how can we have any knowledge of what is best without first possessing the norms ?

		Again , we are told that universal validity is not one of the inalienable char - acteristics of science -LRB- page 9 -RRB- .

		On the contrary , universal validity is just the one characteristic that marks the truth for which science strives ; whereas , as Dr. Home agrees , the knowledge at which edu - cation aims is relative and changing .

		The fact that both science and the arts must be always content with approximations does not affect the fundamental difference in their ideals .

		The definition of '' con - cept '' in Chapter XII .

		wavers perceptibly .

		First we read , '' Conception is the knowledge of general objects '' -LRB- page 155 -RRB- ; on the next page , '' We can now have a concept of the
John Smith	PERSON	we perceived on the street . ''

		What we have in this case is of course a memory ima -LRB- / e , -- or , in the better and more recent phrase , a centrally excited perception .

		The real strength of Dr.
Home	PERSON	's book is found in its treatment of emotional , moral , and religious educa - tion ; these vital subjects are handled with breadth , warmth , and frankness , and with an unusually full comprehension of their supreme importance .

		Par - ticularly refreshing is the emphasis laid upon aesthetic culture , in Chapter XX. ; the author reproves our neglect , in these industrial days , of the education of those powers of higher appreciation which the Greeks so well knew how to value and to nourish .

		Our only disagreement with the author would be that he does not go far enougli , either in the scope of the field or in the appraisal of its value for economic , social , and eth - ical development .

		But he has taken a commendable step in the right direction .

		The style of the book is clear , simple , straightforward ; we have not found an obscure or ambiguous sentence .

		But why should any educated man , even an American , say mad when he means angry -LRB- pages 220 and 224 -RRB- .

Preston Stearns	PERSON	's `` Life the
Hawthorne	PERSON	and Genius of
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	'' centenary .

		-LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- has Somewhat the air of a belated contribution to the
Hawthorne	LOCATION	centen - nial literature .

		Perhaps its length and its fulness of detail may partly explain its tardiness .

		The lack of critical comment in previous lives of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	is given as the raison d'etre of this additional bio - graphy .

		Messrs.
Lathrop	PERSON	,
Julian Hawthorne	PERSON	, and
Conway	PERSON	are , however , the only biographers men - tioned ; while Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, whose work , con - tributed to the '' English Men of Letters '' series , is of the very essence of literary criticism , and Pro- fessor
Woodberry	PERSON	, whose study of Hawthorne in the '' American Men of Letters '' series is nothing if not scholarly and critical , are wholly overlooked .

		Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	's book contains much interesting mat - ter , and shows marks of faithful and loving labor ; its citations and references and illustrations are varied and sometimes illuminating ; but its style is rambling and diffuse -- a fault not offset by any keenness of criticism in the chapters devoted to what he proclaims as the distinctive feature of his work .

		Little less than wanton are such divagations as that 46 THE DIAL -LSB-

London	LOCATION	fog , which , we are gravely informed , '' is composed of soft-coal smoke , which , ascending from innumerable chimneys , is filtered in the upper skies , and then , mixed with vapor , is cast back upon the city by every change of wind .

		It is not unpleasant to the taste , and seems to be rather healthful than otherwise . ''

		He suggests that

		Fannie
Kem	PERSON	- ble , as she was universally called , '' looks a bit strange in that spelling .

		In her the author thinks he dis - ■ covers
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' antipodes . ''

		Horatio Bridge 's offer to guarantee the publisher against loss on a volume of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's short stories is called a '' proposition . ''

		Why will educated writers and speakers persist in making this word do double duty , to the neglect of '' proposal , '' which we can not afford to lose ?

		The portraits and other illustrations in this volume constitute its not least valuable feature .

		We have been com - menting , from time to time , upon the journals of the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Congi-ess , as the volumes of that note - worthy undertaking have come to us from the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	; and we now have much satisfaction in calling attention to another work of similar character and almost equal impor - tance .

		This is nothing less than the full text of the manuscript called the '' Court Book , '' which contains the records of the
Virginia	LOCATION	Company of
London	LOCATION	from
1619	DATE	to
1624	DATE	.

		This manuscript was pur - chased , in the latter part of the seventeenth century , by Colonel
William Byrd	PERSON	, from the estate of the
Duke of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	, to whom it had come by inheritance from the
Earl of Southampton	LOCATION	, whom we all know as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's friend and patron .

		Colonel
Byrd	PERSON	's descendants owned it for about a century , and then it came into the possession of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	buying it after his death .

		It is a work of fundamental im - portance to the student of American history , and its present publication has the special timeliness of just preceding the tercentenary of the first settlement made by the
Virginia	LOCATION	Company .

		The editorial work of this publication has been done by Miss
Susan Myra Kingsbury	PERSON	, under the general supervision of Professor
Herbert L. Osgood	PERSON	.

		Miss
Kingsbury	PERSON	pro- vides a historical and bibliographical introduction of over two hundred pages .

		There are two large quarto volumes , handsomely printed on special paper with broad margins .

		Another important publication from the same source is the '' Portrait Index '' upon which the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	has been engaged for some ten years .

		A few figures will give an idea of the comprehensiveness of this work .

		It fills over 1600 pages , indexes
1181	DATE	titles and
6216	DATE	volumes , and tells the inquirer where to find about 120,000 portraits of about 40,000 people .

		Both of the works which we have here described are withdrawn from free distribution , but may be pur - chased at nominal prices from the
Superintendent of Documents	ORGANIZATION	.

		They will prove a boon to workers of many kinds .

		Sketches from Mr.
G. W. E. Russell	PERSON	's pen-portraits tJie note-book of of a great variety of social types are a Journalist .

		reprinted in a handy and attractive volume with the title '' Social Silhouettes '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , which well fits the unelaborate form of the sketches .

		The chapters average but seven pages in length , and the method of treatment , as well as the space devoted to each type , is nearly uniform .

		A rapid backward glance , with references to and brief quo - tations from standard authors , especially
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, is followed by more immediate and personal observations and illus - trations -- the whole executed in a brisk , chatty , effective style that shows the facility engendered of long practice .

		Besides being an able journalist , the author is something of a reformer , and confesses that he has pleaded `` with equal passion for all -LRB- or nearly all -RRB- the Fads . ''

		Thus we find him deploring the unequal lot of the servants of the Church : '' Such are the conditions of life in the ministry of a Church which enjoys a secm * ed and acknowledged income of nearly six millions , and of which the chief pastor has # 15,000 a year , the finest house in Lon - don , and an agreeable residence at
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In justifying his choice of '' The Quidnunc '' rather than '' The Gossip '' as heading to his 38th chapter , the author incidentally remarks : ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, as far as I remember , recognizes no male gossips . ''

		The captious critic might reply by citing
Helena	PERSON	's speech in '' All 's Well , '' i. 1 , where Cupid is spoken of as gossipping ; also the Duke 's speech in '' Comedy of Errors , '' v. 1 , '' With all my heart I '11 gossip at this feast '' ; and again -LRB- a not very apt illustration from a doubtful play -RRB-
King Henry	PERSON	's words to his courtiers in ''
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, '' v. 4 , '' My noble gos - sips , ye have been too prodigal . ''

		The skilful coining of needed words is often pardonable , but '' hubristic '' seems superfluous ; and moreover , being evidently from the same Greek word that gives us '' hybrid , '' it should , consistently , be '' hybristic . '' '

		But as there is always a first time when the coming connoisseur of both wine and poetry needs direction , there are bushes over wine-shops and '' interpretations and appreciations '' in the book - shops .

Root	PERSON	's `` The Poetry of Chaucer '' -LRB-

		This inter - esting study avoids both the iridescent foam of clever but shallow appreciation and the dead calm of unanimated learning .

		THE DIAL 47 attention to the demands of pure scholarship in matters of form , dates , sources , etc. , as is necessary to make clear the nature of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's development .

		Disputed questions are touched upon briefly or rele - gated to the footnotes , but not without a succinct statement of the author 's position .

		Each poem is taken up separately , single chapters being given to `` The Romaunt of the Rose , '' `` Troilus and
Cris	PERSON	- eyde , '' `` The House of Fame , '' and `` The Legend of Good Women , '' and four -- nearly half the book -- to '' The Canterbury Tales . ''

		In his treatment of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's literary art , Mr.
Root	PERSON	is eminently suc - cessful ; throughout he is sane and impartial .

		Not all that
Chaucer	PERSON	did is on that account good , not even some of the things for which the ungodly praise him .

		Our author has high ideals for art , and not even Chaucer may violate them with impunity .

		It is with peculiar affection that Mr.
Root	PERSON	regards his author , and we are not surprised that he should take issue with the Wordsworthians for
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's right to the third place after the matchless two ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	.

		It is because Chaucer grips our affections that we give him this place , so much more of our own human nature has he than the rapt and solitary
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		A streak of the preacher , the ser - Freacher .

		^ monizer , runs through us all , and most of us dearly love to hold forth in an edifying strain if we can only capture an audience , or even a single auditor , to listen .

Robertson NicoU	PERSON	, the accomplished editor of the
London	LOCATION	''
Bookman	PERSON	, '' is no exception ; but his congregation is made up of willing hearers .

		His late collection of essays , or sermonettes , or edi - torial homilies , whichever one chooses to call them , has the oddly alluring title , '' The Key of the Blue Closet '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , and is composed , at least in part , of reprinted pieces , as readable as they are brief .

		The chapter that gives the book its title is the third , which opens with a reference to '' The Mill on the Floss '' -- to Mrs.
Pullet	PERSON	's apprehension lest her husband should fail to find the key of the Blue Closet after her death . ''

		The Blue Closet '' seems to mean , in Dr.
NicoU	PERSON	's book , the inner and secret chamber of the soul , and also the less obvious side of things in general , although the title is only loosely and partially applicable to the chapters grouped under it .

		Four good personal sketches -- of
Alex	PERSON	- ander
Bain	ORGANIZATION	,
R. H. Hutton	PERSON	,
James Payn	PERSON	, and
Robert A. Neil	PERSON	-- based on some actual acquaintance with these men , and written on the occasion of their sev - eral deaths , are particularly to be commended .

		The late
George Macdonald	PERSON	is also noticed in a rather more perfunctory sketch .

		The essayist 's high praise of the letters of his intimate friend
Neil	PERSON	, of which he possesses many , and which he finds more Lamb-like -LRB- so to speak -RRB- than any he has ever read , makes one wish they might be published , under his editorship .

		So wholesome and enjoyable a book as this little volume of essays should find many readers , as it doubtless will .

		Beainning of ^ / `` ^ J ^ ^ '' ^ ^ go Professor
Charles	PERSON	a history of Seignobos , the well-known French Civilization .

		The work was popular from the beginning , and soon became widely used .

		Not long ago the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	announced an English version of this history , the translation to be the work of Pro- fessor
A. H. Wilde	PERSON	.

		The first volume of the series has appeared .

		It is a plain straightforward account of civilized life in the
Orient	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Rome	LOCATION	, , one that is easily within the intellectual range of the average high school pupil .

		The translation seems to have been carefully made , and the editor 's notes , though not numerous , are of distinct value .

		Never - theless the book is something of a disappointment .

		In his effort to cover the entire field the author has naturally been compelled to include a great deal that is already found in the high-school text-book .

		The advanced student will probably not find very much material that is new to him , at least not so much as a book designed for supplementary reading ought to contain .

		It may be that in
France	LOCATION	the makers of text-books content themselves with giving an account of political matters only ; and in such a case this work would be found very satisfactory .

		But our own authors are more ambitious , and insist on making the growth of culture a prominent part of their manuals .

		Their discussions need to be sup - plemented with more detailed accounts of the more important topics and periods , rather than with a general survey .

		The short life of
Thomas HiU Green	PERSON	, written by his pupil and friend the late

Mrs. Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a thinker who reconciled philosophy with religion on the one hand and with practical poli - tics on the other , the distinguished professor of moral philosophy and author of '' Prolegomena to Ethics '' and other writings is an interesting figure to readers of serious and speculative turn , and they will wel - come this convenient and attractive reprint .

		Nettle - ship 's memoir of
Green	ORGANIZATION	, as an authoritative reviewer said at the time of its first appearance , '' fairly finds him out . ''

		He was a man , his friend
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	has observed , '' whose homely exterior , reserved manner , and middle-class radicalism were combined with singular loftiness of character .

		He recalls in different ways
Wordsworth	PERSON	, of whom he was to some degree a disciple even in philosophy , and Bright , whom he followed in politics .

		In youth he was impressed by
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and
Maurice	PERSON	.

		He developed the philosophical ideas congenial to him from the first , ' by a sympathetic study of
Kant	PERSON	and
Hegel	PERSON	. ' ''

		An apparently excel - lent portrait of a different sort appears as frontis - piece to this inviting volume .

		Memoir of a philosopher and historian 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
B. H. Blackwell	PERSON	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, sends us a small volume called '' Westminster Versions , '' being translations of English verse into Latin and Greek made by a score or more of scholars , and collected under the editorial super - vision of Mr.
Herbert F. Fox	PERSON	.

		The translations are from many poets , including such moderns as
Henley	LOCATION	and
Swinburne	PERSON	, and one venturesome Oxonian has even done
Lowell	PERSON	's '' The Courtin ' '' in Latin elegiacs .

		A second volmne of similar character comes from
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and contains the '' Translations into Latin and Greek Verse '' made by the late
H. A. J. Mimro	PERSON	.

		These versions were printed for private circulation in
1884	DATE	, but are now published for the first time .

		Dante and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, besides a great number of English poets , are included among the subjects of these experiments .

		Messrs.
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American pub - lishers of the translation of
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's works which was undertaken by the late
Charles G. Leland	PERSON	, and carried to completion after his death by other hands .

		The edi - tion makes up a set of twelve volumes , the first eight of which give us the prose writings in
Leland	LOCATION	's version .

		Of the four volumes of verse , one -LRB- the '' Book of Songs '' -RRB- was translated by Mr.
T. Brooksbank	PERSON	, who died before the volume was published .

		The remainmg three have been done by Miss
Margaret Armour	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
W. B. Macdougall	PERSON	-RRB- , and , considering the extraordmary diffi - culty of the task , in an unexpectedly satisfactory man - ner .

		The best of
Heine	LOCATION	evaporates in translation , no doubt , but readers who possess no German may be con - gratulated upon having offered to them so close an approach to the original as is found in the present version .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	pubUsh a translation , in modern French prose , of '' La Chanson de Roland , '' edited by Professor
J. Geddes	PERSON	, Jr. .

		The apparatus , consisting of introduction , bibliography , notes , manuscript readings , and index , is very extensive , and there is also a series of highly interesting illustrations from various sources .

		Other French texts are
Racine	LOCATION	's '' Les Plaideurs , '' edited by Professor
C. H. C. Wright	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and a volume of '' FeuiUetons Choisis , '' edited by Mr.
Cloudesley Brereton	PERSON	, and pub - lished by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		Two German texts from the Messrs.
Heath	PERSON	are '' Wilkommen in
Deutschland	LOCATION	, '' a reader prepared by Professor
W. E. Mosher	PERSON	, and ''
Munchhausen	PERSON	's Reisen und Abenteuer , '' edited by Professor
F. G. G. Schmidt	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish ''
Das Edle Blut	PERSON	, '' a tale by
Herr Ernst von Wildenbruch	PERSON	, edited by Professor
Ashley K. Hardy	PERSON	.

		The new edition of
Keats	PERSON	's poems prepared by Mr.
H. Buxton Forman	PERSON	for the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	is neither an exhaustive variorum edition nor a mere unedited text ; but aims to present the complete body of
Keats	PERSON	's verse illustrated by the most significant of existing variant readings and cancelled passages .

		Thus the reader is able to obtain a good general view of the processes and results of
Keats	PERSON	's creative faculty without becoming submerged in minutice .

		A long and inter - esting introduction describes the various sources and materials upon which the authoritative text of Keats now rests .

		Needless to say , no one is more thoroughly familiar with this material than Mr.
Buxton Forman	PERSON	, and it is not likely that his labors in
Keats	PERSON	's behalf will ever be superseded .

		The present volume is uniform in make-up with the recent
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	editions of Shelley and
Blake	PERSON	, which is to say that it is in every detail a model of conservative book-making .

		There is a photogra ^ vure frontispiece of Keats at
Wentworth Place	ORGANIZATION	, after Severn 's painting ; a title-page vignette from a tracing by
Keats	PERSON	of a Grecian urn -LRB- not the urn , however -RRB- ; an etching on steel by
William Bell Scott	PERSON	of
Severn	ORGANIZATION	's poignant death-bed portrait of the poet ; a reproduction of
Haydon	PERSON	's life-mask of
Keats	PERSON	placed in the position of Severn 's death-bed sketch ; and a facsimile leaf from a holograph draft of '' The Eve of St.
Mark	PERSON	, '' containing sixteen lines not hitherto published in any other edition .

		The arrangement is alphabetical .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons publish the volume .

		Gifford 's translation of Juvenal faces the Latin text on alternate pages of the latest volume to be published in the '' Temple Greek and Latin Classics . ''

		The intro - duction and notes are credited to Mr.
A. F. Cole	PERSON	.

		The freedom of this old translation is brought out by the leading required to enable Juvenal to keep pace with
Grfford	PERSON	, the average being three English for two Latin

		49 The quest of American literature for the British market is an interesting sign of the times .

		In estab - lishing a
New York	LOCATION	branch of its business , the well - known publishing house of
Chatto & Windus	ORGANIZATION	, which has existed for over two hundred years in
London	LOCATION	, frankly announces that it has been '' moved to take this step by the fast-increasing importance of American literature , both grave and gay , which is now eagerly sought by British readers . ''

		This is a decided reversal of the old order prevailing in the days when it used to be scorn - fully asked , '' Who reads an American book ? ''

		KEEPING UP WITH THEMAGAZINES without giving all one 's time to them is a task of ever-increasing difficulty .

		CThis is decidedly the magazine age .

		The number , variety , and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than amazing .

		The master-minds of the world go to their making , -- the greatest of living thinkers , workers , story-tellers , poets , and artists .

		One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand .

		By limiting oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year , all but a very small portion of the field is overlooked .

		C.The only sensible plan is to buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the things one wants most to see .

		This plan has been made practicable by What 's in the Magazines , a monthly publication which renders the mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy every-day reader .

		Each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the maga - zine-contents of the month , with the aid of which one may gain in ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as though he had personally examined a copy of each .

		C .

		It is not a mere list of contents ; neither is it a complicated and confusing library index .

		Everything is arranged and classified , simply but exactly ; whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ - ers or merely looking out for good things in general , the arrangement is equally convenient .

		C .

		It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine - land , -- a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person .

		We could fill ^ genuine inspiration .

		BRIEFER MENTION 84 NOTES 85 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 85 HOURS IN A LIBRARY .

		A good many readers have lately been renew - ing their acquaintance with
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's '' Hours in a Library , '' that series of sane and delightful essays in literary criticism , -- readers whose attention has been thus happily reclaimed by reason of the reappearance of the four vol - umes in a new edition , and the recent publication of the author 's '' Life and Letters . ''

		His own opinion of the work , as expressed in a letter to a friend , was characteristically modest . ''

		I did not send it because -- it is a very foolish rea ^ son -- I am -- do not mention it to any one -- rather ashamed of it .

		I do n't know why , but I have a sus - picion that I am not a good critic , or perhaps it is merely a case of distorted vanity .

		Lowell bullied me out of a copy ; but I regretted it , and could wish that the book should not have crossed the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		However , you will be merciful as a critic of mine .

		Do n't say anything about the book when you write again , or it will seem to me as though I had been fishing for a compliment .

		This is written on the understanding that you will preserve a judicious silence in the interests of my moral health .

		Publicity , as you truly say , is a poison , and private flat - tery is not much better . ''

		The whole tenor of
Stephen	PERSON	's thought makes it obvious that theie was no affectation in these words of self-deprecation , but justice to a book depends upon the public 's verdict rather than the author 's , and it has been rendered , in this instance , in terms that emphatically contradict
Stephen	PERSON	's own estimate .

		We are not , however , at this late day reviewing the '' Hours in a Library , '' but have merely taken the title as a peg upon which to hang a few dis - cursive general remarks .

		The expression ' ' hours in a library '' means many things to many minds , and what it means in any particular case depends wholly upon personal associations and experi - ences .

		To readers of old memoirs , and even more to those fortunate men and women who have the precious memory of a quiet period of youth and adolescence spent in some old-fashioned house with generous furniture of old-fashioned books , it means rich treasures of recollection , fond remin - iscences of exploration and discovery and wonder , as the mind reciu-s to those old days with their at - mosphere of delightful studies .

		To others , again , whose early joy in the companionship of books has been preserved as something more than a fading memory , who have not permitted the cares 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, of the workaday world to sever them from that source of primary inspiration , but still keep them - selves surroimded by good literature and their daily lives sweetened by its ministry , the thought of '' hours in a library '' has a vital content , and expresses the occupation which still makes life best worth the living .

		A few are themselves pro- ducers of literature , and pay direct tribute to its beneficence , as Mr.
Allen	PERSON	to Malory in '' The Choir Invisible , '' and Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	to Rabelais in '' Sir
John Constantine	PERSON	. ''

		But most of those who continue through all their lives to find in literature an ever-availing solace are con - tent to absorb without giving out -- except in the natural reactions of thought upon environment , -- and the world never learns what their `` hours in a library '' have meant , and still mean , to them .

		But the lapse of time works portentous changes in most human conditions , and in none more so than in this relation between men and books .

		The connotations of the term '' library '' have become so transformed that most men now advanced in years find themselves compelled to readjust both their ideas and their habits .

		In the old days , the word meant the private collection of books , upon which the personality of the col - lector was impressed , and which was hallowed by all sorts of tender and intimate associations .

		The qualifying adjectives '' public '' and '' circu - lating '' were used to indicate inferior kinds of libraries , that might be found usefid upon occa - sion , but that could not touch the heart .

		They represented the utilitarian as opposed to the sen - timental , and whenever those two appeals come into rivalry , we know which will win with all persons of gentle instincts .

		But to-day the li - brary , in the good old sense , has become a rare phenomenon ; for the word would surely be mis - applied to these simulacra of libraries , filled with expensive and unread sets of '' standard authors , '' which occupy certain conventional quarters in the homes of the rich , and are obviously nothing more than a part of the general scheme of lux - urious decoration .

		And the public library in its typical form -LRB-
Bibliotheca Carnegiana	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is what most men think of nowadays when they think of libraries at all , is not a good substitute .

		It is housed in an imposing but cheerless build - ing ; it buys the books named in the A. L. A , model catalogue ; it classifies them upon the
Dewey	LOCATION	system ; and it has rules .

		To spend '' hours '' in such a place may be profitable for many practical purposes ; it is not likely to feed the contemplative spirit , or prove stimulative to the production of essays in
Stephen	LOCATION	's manner .

		Along with this -LRB- probably inevitable -RRB- evolu - tion of the library into an institution , there has come into existence the modern librarian , -- a very useful person , highly accomplished as an administrative officer , an expert in accession - listing and catalogue-making , a man alert to grasp and weigh every idea new to his craft , an admirable factor in an admirable scheme of organization .

		And yet something seems to be lacking .

		He is so completely a custodian of books , he is necessarily so occupied with their accidents , that he does not have the time , even if he have the disposition , to become their inti - mate .

		And since this is so , he can not become the wise and helpful intermediary that his old-time predecessor was wont to be .

		The seeker for counsel will get from him bibliographical infor - mation in copious draughts ; he will hardly get that fertilizing inspiration which flows from a mind saturated with humanistic culture .

		In this respect , the evolution of the type of the modem librarian has been analogous to that of the modem type of university president ; it has been an in - evitable evolution , we repeat , but it leaves us with a sort of wistful regret for the type that has vanished .

		This subject was brought to the attention of the
Narragansett Conference	ORGANIZATION
last summer	DATE	in the address of President Hill of the American Li - brary Association , who used the following words : '' There are those who claim that the old style libra - rian who knew books has disappeared and his place has been taken by the modern librarian , who acts as the executive officer of the institution .

		Such critics sigh for the library of old , with its musty tomes and its air of seclusion and repose ; they long for the return of the librarian with his quiet , dignified , studious air , and they resent the change to the utmost . ''

		And then the speaker suggested a possible re - conciliation of the two ideals , probably the only one possible for the large municipal library of our times . ''

		To reach the highest degree of perfection the great public library must have not only its executive whose guiding hand will steer the craft through all kinds of business dangers , but also scholarly , studious men and women who know books and how to use them .

		Both are necessary to the welfare of the large library .

		The wise administrator is the one who , while keeping his eyes upon the needs of the whole system , has the ability to discover the specialists who are needed to round out the work of the library , and to place each in his own particular niche . ''

		This is what Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	has done with excel - lent results in our national library at the cap - ital ; it is what several of our larger cities are doing to the extent of which their resources will permit .

		- r '' ^ Discussing the same subject upon still broader grounds , President
Faunce	PERSON	urged upon the Asso -
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 elation the importance of encouraging the old '' fattening '' use of libraries as no less important than their use for purposes of research . ''

		The library must encourage slow , painful , thoughtful reading ... The habit of reading as a substitute for thinking is worth nothing , but is sheer damage to the mental fibre ... Our students need to use books not only as tools , but as friends .

		In the old days , when the reading of college students was far more promiscuous than to-day , they were accustomed to regard books al - most as personal acquaintances , and there was a genuine exchange and reaction of writer ai \ d reader .

		The modern method of reading is far more accurate and definite than the older method , and is obviously eft ` ective in securing results .

		But it must be supplemented by the ' browsing ' of former days , by the large horizons which come from being set free in the companionship of great minds . ''

		The '' hours in a library '' which are spent in hunting down references and verifying citations are by no means wasted , but they are not the hours that contribute to the strengthening of the tap-root of the intellectual life , nor are they the hours which , in the retrospect , are recalled as hours of unadidterated delight .

		THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AND THE CHILDREN .

		It was not so very long ago that children in the public libraries , like dogs in the parks , were unwel - come unless kept in leash by a responsible attendant .

		If one of tender years happened to stray into those awful precincts alone , he was gently but firmly shown to the door and told to run away .

		But all this is changed now , and some of our public library authorities are even raising the question whether the children are not getting more than their just share of attention , to the neglect of their elders .

		The '' story hour '' which has come to be a recog - nized institution in our best libraries is doing as much as any other library influence to interest children in good reading .

		A certain period is set aside , -- sometimes regularly each week , sometimes on special occasions or holidays , -- when the chil - dren 's librarian , or an expert story-teller from with - out who has both sympathy and discrimination , gathers the children about her and tells them the tales that form the basis of our best literature .

		Listening to stories is the natural approach to reading from books , and is the first step toward the acquisition of cultiu'e .

		But it is not only in the reading-room that chil - dren are made to know and to love books .

		As Mahomet to the mountain , so the library goes to the child if the child will not come to it .

		The idea of the peripatetic library -- the '' travelling library '' as it is now generally called -- is in line with mod - ern progress .

		In these twentieth-century days , space has been annihilated by rail and steam , inertia has been overcome , locality has been destroyed ; the world is on wheels .

		What , then , so natural as the travelling library ?

		We are probably indebted to the Scotch for the germ which has developed into this important sys - tem of book-distribution .

		Early in the last century -LRB- in
1810	DATE	, I believe it was -RRB- , a collection of religious tracts was circulated in
Scotland	LOCATION	, augmented a few years later by books of standard literature and science .

		These '' itinerant libraries , '' so-called , flourished for more than two decades , but finally died a natural death .

		Thirty years after their disap - pearance ,
Australia	LOCATION	developed a peripatetic system , and somewhat later the
Universities of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	sent out university extension libraries ; but the travelling library in this country dates from
1889	DATE	, and owes its origin to Mr.
Melvil Dewey	PERSON	, Director of the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	.

		The travelling library is simply an extension of the state library , or in some cases -LRB- as in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	-RRB- of the county library , twenty-five or fifty or a hun - dred books being sent out at once and entrusted for three months or six months to the care of a respon - sible person who becomes a local or sub librarian .

		This local librarian loans the books -- to children as well as to adults -- under a simple code of regu - lations , returning the entire library when it has served its purpose , and receiving in exchange a new selection of books , thus keeping alive the interest of the readers and stimulating them to read .

		Stations are established in village shops and postoffices , often in farm-houses at some distance from the towns but conveniently located with reference to the rural population .

		In a number of states , travelling libra - rians are employed .

		The travelling librarian is a real literary evangelist , preaching the gospel of good books .

		He strengthens the hands of the local librarian , revives the flagging interest , establishes new centres of culture , and carries light into the dark places .

		What a field of usefulness is open to him !

		Coming into personal contact with hundreds of people , young and old , to whom the world of books is a terra incognita , he rescues many a country youth from intellectual starvation , fans in some the spark which shall kindle into genius , and in others not so gifted stimulates the intelligent use of the powers which they possess -- insuring at least better crops and broader citizenship .

		The transportation of the libraries from place to place offers a problem which each state is working out for itself .

		In some localities , notably in the South , the railroads , recognizing the philanthropy in the idea which underlies this library movement , are shipping the libraries without charge .

		In other parts of the country , the local centre pays a nominal amount to cover the cost of freight .

		Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	strongly advocates , and has already put into commis - sion in
New York	LOCATION	, a type of library wagon , driven by a trained librarian , who , after the manner of the religious colporteur of a former generation , goes from station to station carrying his books with him .

		It may be asked how large a part the children have 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, in the travelling library .

		I answer , a very large part .

		In most libraries from one-foui * th to one-third of the books are adapted particularly to children 's use , and children are among the most devoted readers .

		In a small village in
New York State	LOCATION	, a girl of thirteen recently drew from a travelling library during the six months of its stay thirty-two books .

		A boy of fifteen drew twenty-five books .

		The statistics at other points show an interest almost as great .

		Several of our large city libraries , notably the
Carnegie Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Pittsburg	LOCATION	and the
New York City Public Library	LOCATION	, have adapted the travelling system to urban conditions , and are sending out into the tenements trained children 's librarians bearing good books .

		The books , in libraries of from twelve to twenty volumes , known as '' home libraries , '' are placed in the hands of certain families who agree to take care of them for a specified time and to loan them to such neighbors as may wish to read .

		Little circles are thus formed -- for the most part of chil - dren , though grown-up members of the families join in them too .

		The library visitor comes once a week and talks to them , telling them stories , such stories as are told to the library children dm-ing the '' story hour . ''

		Then she makes the connection between the story and the book , taking a volume from the case and reading a few interesting pages from it .

		After a friendly hour , she goes away leaving the seed to germinate .

		When one set of books are read through , she brings a new set and takes the old ones back -- a little soiled , perhaps , but the city can well afford to burn them and buy more , for the books are mak - ing citizens , and these children who are learning to read good literature will not need as many police - men to loojt after them a few years hence , thanks to the library visitor .

		Nor does this far-reaching philanthropy stop with the reading of books .

		The library worker gains the confidence of parents as well as of children .

		She learns the troubles and discouragements of the lower strata of society , and is able to give help .

		She does much of the work usually accomplished by the '' friendly visitor '' of the charitable organizations , and does it more effectively ; for the class that of all others is most in need of aid and sympathy is shy in the presence of charity and often suspicious of the church .

		Another important movement in library extension has to do with the placing of libraries in the schools , its aim being to bring into accord the work of the two great educational influences of the present age -- the public library and the public school .

		When one stops to consider the many points at which the work of the librarian and the teacher overlap , it will be seen that a great saving of energy and an enor - mous gain in efficiency must result from this union .

		The function of the library is to put the right book into the right hands , -- not only into the hands that are outstretched for it , but into those that most need it .

		The librarian , busied with the details of admin - istrative work , -- purchasing , classifying , catalogu - ing , keeping in order , -- though she may have , and must have , sympathy with the children who frequent the library , can not come into that close relationship with them which is enjoyed by the teacher , who has them with her six hours in every day ,
Sundays	DATE	and holidays excepted , who directs their intellectual progress and comes to know their needs more intel - ligently and often more sympathetically than even the parent .

		These considerations have led to the development of a system in which the public library places its resom ` ces at the command of the schools , the libra - rian giving of her practical knowledge of the books and the teacher of her knowledge of the child .

		The librarian visits the school and talks to the children , tells them how to '' find things '' in books , tells the younger ones a few good classic stories and suggests where they may find others , tells the older ones how to use a card catalogue , how to run down a refer - ence , where to find good material to help them in their history and geography .

		The teacher makes individual application of the librarian 's generalities , and fits a particular book to a particular want .

		The librarian is the specialist : she has at her fingers ' ends the entire literary pharmacopoeia , and is skilled in the uses of all sorts of material ; but the teacher is familiar with the child 's constitution and habits -- a sort of knowledge quite as important .

		Consulta - tion of this sort is in accord with modern practice , and is yielding pronounced results in schoolrooms where it has been tried .

		The books are supplied from the school library so far as the school library can meet the demand , but beyond that point the public library is drawn upon , and offers from its greater resources a wide range of reference material , and books on special subjects appropriate either to the work of the class or to the celebration of the annual festivals and the birthdays of great men and women .

		These books are sent to the schoolroom for reference or distribution , and the school is thus made , in effect , a branch library , -- or , if you please , a travelling library station .

		If the public library is convenient to the school , and in villages it always should be , -- the refer - ence work is often best done in the library itself .

		This method has the double advantage of affording a quiet place in which the pupil may work without distraction , and of familiarizing him with the library -- helping him to acquire the '' library habit . ''

		If the alliance of school and library accomplished nothing beyond this , it would be well worth all the efforts that have been put forth in its behalf .

		The object sought by both librarian and teacher is the culture of the child , particularly the develop - ment in him of a discriminating love of books ; for this is the straight road to culture .

		The child is placed , by law , under the influence of the teacher during just those years when , if ever , the reading habit is formed and the trend given which deter - mines the child 's intellectual life .

		It is a critical period , and no agency shoidd be overlooked which can contribute toward the end in view .

		In such ways as these the public library is reach .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 ing out after the children .

		In the country farm - house , in the city tenement , and in the schoolroom , as well as under its own roof-tree , it is bringing to them the knowledge of a gi'eat new world -- a world of opportunity , of encom-agement , of delight .

		It is extending their vision over distant lands and bygone centuries , acquainting them with the secrets of nature and the mysteries of science , opening their hearts to the sweet influences of poetry , and point - ing out to them the paths of wisdom and of right - eousness .


Walter Taylor	PERSON	Field .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The prices of English novels , more particularly the prices at which they sell best , are discussed in a re - cently reported interview with that veteran publisher of sixty years ' experience , Mr.
Edward Marston	PERSON	, whose octogenarian reminiscences were lately reviewed in our pages .

		His observations are pertinent at tliis time of a sup - posed demand for a reduction in book-prices -- in strik - ing contrast with the marked advance in all the costs of manufacttu-e .

		Many of
Wilkie Colluis	ORGANIZATION	's novels were pub - lished by the firm with which Mr.
Marston	PERSON	was so long connected ; and it is a curious fact that , whereas these works had an enormous sale in their three-volume form at half a guinea a volume , and generally a good sale in the one-voliune form at six shillings , at two shillings they fell flat .

		-LRB- Query : might not this have been partly diie to their having been already widely read in periodicals ? -RRB-

		In the same way , all of Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's novels were very successful as `` three-deckers , '' and afterward not unsuccessful as six-shilling one - volume books ; but they sold much less readily when offered for half a crown -- with the single exception of ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	. ''

		And thereby hangs a tale .

		The issue of this ever-charming story chanced to fall at the time of the marriage of Princess
Louise	PERSON	to the
Marquis of Lome	ORGANIZATION	, and the im - pression prevailed that
Lorna	LOCATION	and
Lome	ORGANIZATION	were in some way connected , -- a mistake that proved advantageous to all concerned .

		In the case of
Black	ORGANIZATION	's novels the same pronoimced disinclination to buy cheap editions mani - fested itself , and the half-crown reprints caused a serious loss to the publishers .

		Mr.
Marston	PERSON	's experience seems to show that , leaving out of accoimt the '' penny dreadfuls '' and the '' shilling shockers , '' the British public prefers to buy its favorite fiction at a fair price , or about six shillings ; and this preference is further illustrated by the poor sale of short novelettes unless they are made up and offered in six-shilling form , even though the matter con - tained be but a third or a quarter of that in the ordinary novel ... Why Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is to give us a new life of Pater is explained in the publisher 's announcement of the forthcoming volume .

		The biographer wishes to correct a number of '' staggering errors '' said to have been committed by previous biographers . ''

		-LRB- 1 -RRB- It has been asserted that ux boyhood and youth Pater showed no precocious signs of a desire to write .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	shows that he was perhaps the most voluminous boy - author who ever lived .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- It has been asserted that in childhood Pater never wrote poetry except a few humorous verses .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	has in his own posses - sion many hundreds of lines of serious poetry written by
Pater	PERSON	in his early years , and can show that he wrote thousands of such lines .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- It has been said without contradiction that
Pater	PERSON	was popular at school .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	shows on the contrary that nobody could have been more unpopidar there .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- It has been set down again and again in print that
Pater	PERSON	's chief interest in his early life was philosophy .

		It was not so .

		His chief interest durmg his youth and early manhood was En - glish literature .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Students of Pater will remember that a biographer asserts that his metaphysical studies did not destroy his strong religious instinct .

		On the contrary they did , and for many years Pater was quite severed from religion .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- The legend fotmd in most accounts of Pater -- the legend that he wrote very few letters -- is proved quite a falsification of the facts in Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's ' life . '

		He wrote an enormous number of letters -- as many as four hixndred to a single friend , and most of them long letters . ''

		Well , we shall see what we shall see .

		As to the fifth item , Mr.
Wright	PERSON	would seem to have set himself a difficult task , -- to read the mind 's construction in the writings of a man , and to read it so accurately as to tell just when faith and when skepticism predominated .

		It is pretty well known that at
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's death he was thinking seriously of taking orders , , '' • `` Subterranean literature '' in
Germany	LOCATION	appears to have as large a sale as in our own and other coun - tries .

		The monster editions of such hair-raisers as ''
Jack the Ripper	PERSON	, '' and similar manuals for the fitting of vagrant youth to follow careers of crime , pass unno - ticed , in fact imsuspected , by the readers of
Walter Pater	PERSON	, of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, and of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		But a German authority says that issues of seven himdred thousand copies of what we used to know here as '' dime novels '' are not unusual .

		Indeed , the dime novel , now apparently suffering a decline in this country , is ravag - ing the land of the Teutons , where most of the boys are said to prefer an American Indian story to any other tale .

		The frontier adventures of trappers and scouts , the prairie perils from wolves and redskins , the mighty encounters with the formidable grizzly bear -- all these make the young heart of
Germany	LOCATION	beat with rib-rending throbs .

		This interest in stories of the
Mohawk	LOCATION	brand dates back as far as
1823	DATE	, when
Cooper	PERSON	's novels began to fire the blood of the juvenile reader .

		Imitators were not slow in following the trail blazed by the master ; and now he is a feeble writer who can not out-Cooper
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	by several hundred thrills per volume .

		There are said to be at present in
Germany	LOCATION	some five hundred firms engaged in the production of Cooperesque tales , with three thousand travelling salesmen to place the direful output on the market .

		The illustrations vie with the text in sensational quality , and -LRB- alas ! -RRB-

		a book of about two hundred and fifty pages can be bought for less than our dime .

		.

		, , An irritating practice among library workers is touched upon by the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript '' in the coui ` se of some recent commendatory remarks about that energetic and indispensable library monthly , `` Public Libraries , '' which has just entered upon its twelfth year .

		The practice referred to is that of libra - rians and library journals in the use , or rather the non - use , of capital letters and quotation marks .

		`` What good does it do , '' asks the '' Transcript , '' '' to omit these from book titles , until an appearance of almost entire illiteracy is obtained ?

		If it saves the time of the compositor it wastes that of the reader , for he has 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, to go back and read the title a second time to find out where it begins and ends .

		We know that this is the result of a library philosophy which taught that anything on earth could be sacrificed in order to save a few seconds ' time , but that does not endear it to us ... Because our ancestors used what seems now an unnec - essary number of capital letters , we are not justified in trying to abolish them altogether , any more than the fact that those ancestors wore lace , frills , and long wigs justifies us in suddenly rushing into the street without any clothes at all . ''

		It is sincerely to be hoped that '' Public Libraries '' may see fit to take the lead in doing away with some of these confusing , distressing , and freakish practices which , along with certain orthograph - ical deformities , have crept into tolerance among library workers .

		• .

		.

		Dreams of an endowed theatre may still be per - mitted to hopeful souls , in spite of the fact that some recent local experiments in that direction could hardly be called inspiring .

		It may be that the idea may yet be worked out on a national basis ; and it is to this form of it that Mme.
Ristori	PERSON	addresses herself in her article in the
January	DATE	'' Putnam , '' written but a few weeks before her death , -- - an article prompted by her interest in and her enthusiastic recollections of Amer - ica , and by her reading in the theatrical journals some annoimcements of a project to establish an endowed national theatre in
New York	LOCATION	.

		She deplores the present state of affairs in the theatrical world , with its numerous '' stars '' and countless companies , all scrambling for a livelihood , to the detriment of high art and the dis - comfort of artists . ''

		Should the example of
Rome	LOCATION	and
Milan	LOCATION	be generally followed , '' she writes , in very hope - ful vein , after referrmg to the endowed theatres in those two cities , `` the art of acting will steadily advance ; we shall have fewer stars , but more really good com - panies .

		This is the solution of the difficulty that we have reached in

America	LOCATION	. '' ''

		• • Brunetiere 's successor in the French Academy is yet vmnamed , and the question of a choice is of interest to many outside of
France	LOCATION	as well as within .

		Mistral has been spoken of , and doubtless deserves the honor .

		But there is a difficulty .

		Our
Provence	LOCATION	poet is seventy-six years old , and at that age the grooves are commonly worn so deep that there is a rude jolt in getting out of them .

		He would have to visit
Paris	LOCATION	at least once if he accepted Academic honors , and
Paris	LOCATION	he has never loved .

		In fact , he has seldom left his pa - ternal acres since the day when , asked what he meant to be , he replied , '' A poet . ''

		With remarkable and admirable persistency he has remained true to his high calling and has lived the life he purposed to live .

		A lonely and even pathetic figure he may appear , holding himself aloof from the great world and deploring the mad rush of his countrymen from rural quiet and peace to urban din and strife ; but there is grandeur in his solitude , and sublimity in his high ideal of religion and beauty as inseparably connected with a peaceful coimtry life .

		An announcement from Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	which will interest Americans , and especially those who are students of the race question , is found in the following words attributed to him . ''

		I have dealt , '' he says , in speaking of his writings on
America	LOCATION	, '' very frankly with the color question , and it is quite possible that I may ultimately make it my subject and give a large portion of my life to it . ''

		Surely there is need of a prophet 's wisdom in treating our vexed negro problem , and who knows what this prophetic novelist may accomplish if he carries out his half-formed plan ?

		Half the serious - ness he bestows on his mammoth rats and long-tailed comets and all the marvellous creations of the marvel - lous future might well be given to a few of the pressing problems of the living present .

		• • • Bibliographical work in libraries can be made both creditable and useful , as is shown by the
Cambridge	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library , which has expended a part of its surplus energy in preparing and publishing a biblio - graphy of Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	.

		Few writers live to see a bibliography of their work that covers sixty-three years of literary activity , as this one does ; and it is still more remarkable that in using this little book , as the veteran author has used it since its appearance , he is reported as unable to find a single error of importance .

		Four of Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	's books have been translated into French , three into German , one into Italian , and one into modem Greek .

		Considering the difficulty , the impossibility rather , of turning dialect into another tongue , one notes with surprise a French '' Vie Militaire dans un Regiment Noir . ''

		Seventy-eight books and articles about Mr.
Hig	PERSON	- ginson are entered in this interesting list .

		• • • Rural free delivery for libraries is following in the wake of rural free delivery of letters , and , ac - cordmg to reports , with equally happy results .

		A good illustration is furnished by the
Free Library of Hagers	ORGANIZATION	- town ,
Maryland	LOCATION	, whose library-wagon is now in the third year of its beneficent work of dispensing intellectual pabulum to the neighboring rural regions .

		Besides this , over sixty deposit stations are maintained throughout the county , and supplies of books are sent out regularly to numerous day schools and Sunday-schools .

		Although but five years old , this enterprising library circulates more than eighty-five thousand volumes annually with only about seventeen thousand volumes wherewith to achieve this result .

		Can a better record than this be shown ?

		... The public library as an educational force is evidently growing in importance .

		An aggressively managed institution of this sort is that at
Grand Rapids	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, as appears from a recent circular issued by it under the title , '' The Right Start , '' which is sent out to the yomig people of the city , with a personal letter from the librarian . ''

		Have you ever thought of con - tinuing your education while you are at work ? ''

		asks the circular ; and it proceeds to make known the great educational opportimity open to all who choose to fre - quent the library , attend its free lecture courses , inspect its exhibitions , and read its books and periodicals .

		Such enterprise speaks well for the institution , and for the community in which it is located .

		THE DIAL 71 t l ^ to l00ks .

		The
Hohenlohe Memoirs	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Since the publication of
Busch	PERSON	's life and let - ters of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, no book has created the stir in official
Germany	LOCATION	that has been roused by the '' Memoirs of Prince Chlodwig of
Hohenlohe	PERSON	- Schillingsfuerst . ''

		Lieutenant Bilse 's '' / / i einer kleinen Garnison '' provoked indeed a tempest , but the teapot was small and soon emptied .

		This time , however , the matter is more serious .

		The Emperor has reproved the eldest son of the late Prince for permitting the indiscretion of publication ; he has shifted the responsibility upon his brother ,
Prince Alexander	PERSON	, and he in turn upon Professor Curtius ; while the latter blames the importunate publisher .

		Doubtless the printer 's devil is the one idtimately to blame .

		Prince Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillings - fuerst was a Bavarian statesman , and during the important years 1867-1870 was at the head of the Bavarian ministry .

		Prior to that time he had filled a series of diplomatic positions that took him , first or last , to nearly every European capital .

		As a prince of the blood and related to various royal houses , connected by intimate family ties with Protestantism though himself a Roman Catholic , possessed of great wealth and broad culture , he was not only brought into intimate connection with all the leading men of his time , but in his diplomatic career he was informed as to the negotiations that led to many a check and counter-check in the political game of modern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		As a member of the
Reichs	PERSON	- tag after the establishment of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, then as Ambassador at
Paris	LOCATION	from
1874	DATE	to
1885	DATE	, and from
1885	DATE	to
1894	DATE	as governor at
Strassburg	LOCATION	, he was not only in close touch with
Bismarck	PERSON	up to the latter 's retirement from office , but was intimately associated with the Emperor
William I.	PERSON	and his successors .

		From
1894	DATE	tiU almost the end of his life he was Imperial Chancellor , resigning from that office in the
Autumn of 1900	DATE	.

		Upon the occasion of his eighty-second birth - day , in
March	DATE	following his retirement from office , the Prince requested Professor
Friedrich Curtius	PERSON	to help him write his memoirs .

		He did not , however , live even to begin the work , and the task of fulfilling his wishes was left to his son , Prince
Alexander	PERSON	, with whom
Professor • Memoirs of Prince of Chlodwig Hohenlohe-Schillings	ORGANIZATION	- FUEKST .

		Authorized by Prince
Alexander	PERSON	of Hohenlohe-Schil - lingrsfuerst , and edited by
Friedrich Curtius	PERSON	.

		English edition supervised by
George W. Chrystal	PERSON	,
B.A.	LOCATION	.

		In two volumes , with photogravure portraits .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Curtius collaborated .

		We have , then , not an autobiography , nor in the ordinary sense a bio - graphy , but instead an annotated compilation of material upon which the Prince had expected to draw in refreshing his memory and in round - ing out the story of his life .

		Private letters and journals constitute the bulk of this material , which has been made public , '' so far , '' to quote
Curtius	PERSON	, `` as publication seems advisable . ''

		This limitation appears to have been taken somewhat easily , for certainly very much is included that so tactful a diplomat as Prince von
Hohenlohe	PERSON	would have hesitated to give to the public .

		The struggle , resulting from aggression , compro - mise , and concession , out of which the national unity of
Germany	LOCATION	was born , is still so recent that it possesses personal rather than historical interest .

		To the historian of the next century these memoirs will be invaluable in portraying the characters of
William I.	PERSON	,
Bismarck	LOCATION	, and other leaders and participants in it ; but to-day many a statement must seem to those person - ally interested as a slur upon the memory of dear friends .

		A few instances of such indiscretion may be of interest .

		Thus , in speaking of the eightieth birthday of
William I.	PERSON	, the Prince mentioned in his diary a dinner at
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's at which
Marie von Bismarck	PERSON	told him that he was the only man upon whom her father could rely , and that he had often thought of him when he was tired of vexations and wanted to resign .

		The diary continues : '' Afterwards I spoke with Gontaut .

		I think the Im - perial Chancellor attaches much too much importance to him .

		He is , after all , an insignificant chatterbox .

		In the same way
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	makes too much of the claptrap of the Empress . ''

		Agaui , in
1880	DATE	, he sketches the situation as follows : '' The Chancellor is at Varzin in a nervous state , and hesitates to come because he is afraid that the
Kaiser	PERSON	and everyone else will give him too much to do here .

		The
Kaiser	PERSON	is losing his memory to some extent , does not remember what he has signed , and becomes rude at times when he hears that something has happened which he thinks he has not been told about . ''

		Bismarck 's feigning illness , and his continual threats of resigning , are repeatedly mentioned .

		Thus , in
1872	DATE	the Prince states : '' Yesterday a rumor was spread that
Bismarck	PERSON	was again unwell , and that he would have to retire to the country for six months .

		As I had seen him some few days previous looking fresh and healthy , I thought this was curious , and I expected he was simply playing truant .

		This was the case .

		Bismarck has difficulties with the Emperor .

		His powerful and imperious nature can not stand the pressure which the old gentleman brings to bear upon him . ''

		72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, But enough ; such passages are of frequent occurrence .

		Whatever else they amount to , they certainly tend to obscure '' the awe and majesty of kings '' by bringing them down to a very human level ; and so they certainly do not tend to further the desire of
William II	PERSON	.

		to have his grandfather go down to posterity as '' WiUiam the Great . ''

		Indeed , one most inter - esting thing in the book is the way in which Prince von
Hohenlohe	PERSON	was constantly called upon to be the '' buifer '' between
Bismarck	PERSON	and
William I. Sometimes	PERSON	his influence was sought by one party , sometimes by the other .

		Thus , in
1879	DATE	, in the matter of the alliance with Aus - tria ,
Bismarck	PERSON	summoned the Prince , talked him over to his view , and then sent him to the Emperor .

		Bismarck was threatening to resign , the Emperor to abdicate ; but the Prince was able to settle the matter .

		In
October , 1874	DATE	, the Chancellor and the Emperor had some diffi - culty over the speech from the throne .

		The Emperor wished to '' water down '' what
Bis	ORGANIZATION	march had written in regard to foreign affairs .

		The Prince thus reports his conversation with the Emperor : `` The Emperor quoted the passage from memory , and said he feared it was open to the construction that we were prepared to make war again upon
France	LOCATION	.

		And this was out of the question .

		He was too old to begin another war , and feared that Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	was try - ing to drag him little by little into fresh hostilities .

		This was why he was so suspicious .

		I said that if the Prince had any such intention I must have been the first to know of it , but that I had not the faintest inkling of anythmg of the kind .

		That passage of the speech referred not to coalitions against us , but to the insinua - tions that had been got up against us .

		The Emperor stroked his beard , and said , without replying to my argument , * I shall fall out with Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	again over this matter , and it would gratify me if you would put it before him once more from my point of view . ' ''

		But to turn from this phase of the memoirs to those features that give the book more per - manent interest .

		One of the characteristics of statesmanship is the ability to read the signs of the times .

		This ability Prince von
Hohenlohe	PERSON	possessed .

		Thus , in an article on the political condition of
Germany	LOCATION	in
1847	DATE	he points out that `` It is a mistake to try to dam the Revolution by liberal reforms in the individual States with - out reforming
Germany	LOCATION	as a whole . ''

		He sin - cerely desired a united
Germany	LOCATION	, but what he wanted was '' a real , politically efficacious unity , '' and till the various governments would approach the problem in a serious and self-sacrificing spirit he was opposed to the so-called progress and to concessions which he felt led directly to revolution .

		At this time he took the ground of an ultra-Conservative and opposed the
Frank	PERSON	- furt resolution calling for a
Constituent National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, for he regarded it as practical an - archy .

		The subsequent course of events fuUy justified his position .

		His feeling toward the Church was much the same .

		In faith , he wanted something vital .

		Speaking of the fact that many educated men are either devoid of faith or accept the ordinances of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	only as a matter of form , he says : '' But will such conventional homage to the
Church	ORGANIZATION	endure ?

		Will not the effects of this knowledge without faith spread to those classes of society which can have no interest in subordinating themselves to the Church and hei ^ dogmas , to the discipline and mortification which she imposes ?

		Will not a total collapse be the end , or rather has it not even now begun to spread among the lower classes ?

		... And if this result comes about , we must face the bankruptcy of faith , a catas - trophe which must infallibly lead to the collapse of the whole structure of modern civilization .

		For all that , it would be childish to regret the discoveries of natural science .

		They are for a wise and useful end , because they have their place in the development of mankind . ''

		At about the same date the Prince said , in another discussion of the same problem , '' I be - lieve that mankind will create for itself a form of faith adapted to it , and become religious again . ''

		This certainly shows a broader outlook upon re - ligious matters , as well as a saner forecast of half a century 's development , than can be claimed for many less orthodox believers than was
Hohen	PERSON	- lohe ; indeed , he never seems to have shrimk from any advance that meant true progress .

		His attitude as a member of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	and as a German patriot is strikingly shown in the following paragraph regarding the expulsion of the Jesuits : '' I can never admit that a Jesuit can do anything independently of his superiors .

		The discipline of the Order is much too strict for that .

		... If the Jesuits agitate in
Posen	LOCATION	and in
Alsace	LOCATION	, they do this under the command of their superiors , empowered by their Order ; and for this it is answerable .

		When the Jesuit Father
Schrader	PERSON	, in his book , The Pope and Modern Ideas , advanced a whole system of theories dangerous to the State ; if the
Civilta Cattolica	LOCATION	and the Korrespondenz of
Geneva	LOCATION	-- the first under the eyes of the Pope , and the latter with his expressed approval -- both being edited by Jesuits , both proclaim the sovereignty of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	over the
State	ORGANIZATION	; when the local Bavarian papers , under the control of the Jesuit Father
Weisser	PERSON	, daily preach the shattering of the
State	ORGANIZATION	; when the Osservatore Homano , conducted by Jesuits , reminds us that no heretic can be Emperor of
Germany	LOCATION	, that the Pope must dethrone him and the people drive him away , -- then these are no ` rash journalistic excesses , ' but facts of such impor - tance that no one can shut his eyes to them .

		From the Catholic standpoint , it may be regrettable that we are not a Catholic country with a Catholic dynasty .

		But this objective complaint must not be made the
spring	DATE	of political action , and it can still less be tolerated that
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 anyone in
Germany	LOCATION	makes it the starting-point of an attack upon the Empire .

		Tliis the Jesuits have done since the institution of their Order , and to this they are committed , -- that is , to the violent extermination of Protestantism .

		What will happen if we tolerate ten - dencies for which we have to thank the Thirty Years ' War , and which can lead to nothing else than a renewal of the
Wars of Religion	ORGANIZATION	?

		I am therefore always of the opinion that the German people must expel the Jesuits in self-defence ; and if you object that I , as a Catholic Prince , have no right to participate in this , I answer that I am in all things a German Prince , and as svich must do my duty . ''

		One exceedingly interesting feature of the memoirs is the light thrown upon the relations of
Bismarck	PERSON	and the present Emperor of Ger - many .

		The question has been much discussed and much befogged , but in a passage in the journal is an account of a conversation in which the Emperor gives his version of the affair . ''

		The Emperor related the whole story of his differ - ence with
Bismarck	PERSON	without interruption .

		He said that relations had become strained as early as
December	DATE	.

		The Emperor then desired that something should be done upon the question of the workmen .

		The Chancellor objected .

		The Emperor 's view was that if the Govern - ment did not take the initiative , the
Reichstag	LOCATION	-- in other words , the Socialists , the Centre , and the Pro- gressives -- would take the matter in hand , and that the
Government	ORGANIZATION	would be forced to follow them .

		The Chancellor desired to bring the Socialist law , including the provisions of exjiulsion , before the new Reichstag once again , to dissolve the Reichstag if it rejected the law , and to take energetic measures in the event of a revolt .

		The Emperor objected to this policy , saying that if his grandfather had been forced to deal with rebels after a long and glorious reign , no one would have thought the worse of him .

		But he was himself in a different position , for he had as yet achieved nothing .

		... He was ready enough to act , but he wished to be able to act with a clear conscience , and first to make an attempt to satisfy the legitimate grievances of the workmen , and at least to do everything that was possi - ble to fulfil their justifiable demands .

		In a conference with his ministers , the Emperor therefore demanded that decrees should be drafted containing those pro- visions which the decrees afterward secured .

		Bismarck declined to hear of it .

		The Emperor then brought the matter before the Cabinet Coimcil , and eventually se - cured the proposal of the decrees notwithstanding
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck 's opposition .

		Bismarck , however , was secretly working against him ... This friction had consider - ably disturbed the relations between
Bismarck	PERSON	and the Emperor , and these were further strained by the ques - tion of the Cabinet Order of
1852	DATE	.

		Bismarck had often advised the Emperor to grant the ministers access to himself ; and this was done .

		But when communication between the Emperor and his ministers became more frequent ,
Bismarck	PERSON	took offence , became jealous , and revived the Cabinet Order of
1852	DATE	in order to break communications between the Emperor and the minis - ters .

		The Emperor protested , and demanded the repeal of the Cabinet Order ;
Bismarck	PERSON	made a show of con - sent , but nothing was done in the matter .

		The Emperor therefore demanded that he should either issue an order of repeal or hand in his resignation .

		This decision the Emperor communicated through
Hahnke	PERSON	.

		The Prince hesitated , but gave in his resignation on
March 18	DATE	.

		• .

		.

		The question at issue was , as the Emperor went on to say , whether the HohenzoUern dynasty or the Bismarck dynasty should reign . ''

		The memoirs afford delightful glimpses of the Prince 's private life , of his genial and imperturb - able good temper , of his cultured appreciation of poetry and art .

		Space forbids further cita - tions , even when that is the only way to give a just impression of the work .

		The translation , supervised by Mr.
George W. Chrystal	PERSON	,
B. A.	PERSON	, is satisfactory and apparently adequate .

		The typography is worthy of special commendation .

		The chief source of regret is that Prince
von Hohenlohe	PERSON	did not live to supervise the
prepa	LOCATION	- ration of the work ; in that case those elements that have provoked censure would doubtless have been omitted , and the whole work rounded out into a biography in the ordinary sense of the term .

		The IjIbrariast and his Charge .

		* As long ago as the middle of the seventeenth century , to go no further back , the '' librarie - keeper '' was conscious of the dignity of his call - ing and the precious nature of his charge .

		A quaintly interesting series of reprints , styled collectively , '' Literature of Libraries in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries , '' is now appearing , under the careful editorship of Mr.

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, translations , in both French and English , have appeared .

		The version now printed claims to be only partly new , but it commends itseK to the reader as a scholarly piece of work .

		A selected passage emphasizing the librarian 's high calling and needed qualifications will convey an idea of the whole .

		Throughout the treatise , its author shows himseK awake to his possibilities of use - fulness , and at the furthest possible remove from the position taken by that ease-loving Bodleian librarian who felt that his post would not be so very disagreeable if only the ed visitors would keep away . ''

		Your librarian , gentlemen , is in some sort your official representative .

		To him is remitted the deposit of your glory ... Thus , therefore , your librarian should be , above all , a learned and profoimd theologian ; but to this qualification , which I shall call fundamental , should be imited vast literary acquisitions , an exact and precise knowledge of all the arts and sciences , great facility of expression , and , lastly , that exquisite polite - ness which conciliates the affection of his visitors while his merit secures their esteem .

		A librarian truly worthy of the name should , if I may be permitted the expression , have explored in advance every region of the empire of letters , to enable him afterwards to serve as a faithful guide to all who may desire to survey it . ''

		Emerson 's slighting reference to the librarian as a man in whom we are not to look for learning merely because he lives among books , would have certainly incensed the erudite Abbe .

		His discourse , though not exceeding two thousand words in length , is full of sensible ideas , and ideas which , however familiar now , must have appeared '' advanced '' in the speaker 's day .

		The editors ' bibliographical and prefatory mat - ter is all that could be desired ; and the compo - sition , press-work , and binding of the book are equally excellent .

		The Letters of
John Durie	PERSON	-LRB- 1596-1680 -RRB- on '' The Reformed Librarie-Keeper '' antedate the Abbe 's little tract by a century and a quarter .

		The writer 's active and somewhat troubled life as a religious reformer receives due attention in an introductory '' Biographical Sketch '' by Miss
Ruth Shepard Granniss	PERSON	; but the occur - rence of the word '' graft , '' even in quotation marks , tends to give one a slight shock , as a little out of keeping with the tone , the atmos - phere , the sober decorum of the little volume as a whole .

		Durie 's friendship with
Samuel Hart	PERSON	- lib , and his family connection , as father-in-law , with
Henry Oldenburg	PERSON	, bring him indirectly into interesting association with
Milton	PERSON	.

		The biographical sketch informs us that '' in
1649	DATE	Bidstrode
Whitelock	PERSON	was appointed keeper of the king 's medals and library , '' and that
John Durie	PERSON	was soon afterward named as his assistant .

		Strictly speaking , of course , at the time of these appointments the medals and library could not be called '' the king 's '' , - but whether serv ing king or parliament or commonwealth ,
Durie	PERSON	was assistant library-keeper for a few years before he resumed his restless wanderings and - his unsuccessful labors for Protestant unity .

		No whit less than our French Abbe did he feel the dignity of his calling and the great future opening to all library workers , as a brief extract will make evident . ''

		For if Librarie-keepers did understand themselvs in the nature of their work , and would make themselvs , as they ought to bee , useful in their places in a publiek waie ; they ought to becom Agents for the advancement of universal Learning : and to this effect I could wish , that their places might not bee made , as everie where they are , Mercenarie , but rather Honorarie ; and that with the competent allowance of two himdred pounds a year ; som emploiments should bee put upon them further than a bare keeping of the Books . ''

		What some of these '' emploiments '' are , he proceeds to specify ; and it almost startles the reader to find how many modem ideas are clothed in his quaint and antique phraseology and spelling .

		He very sensibly favors an expan - sive system of book location , but his scheme of classification is amusingly rudimentary to a twentieth-century librarian .

		This little volume , like its companion , is irreproachable in style and finish .

		Yet one queries why the editors chose to depart from the old spelling of
Durie	ORGANIZATION	's name , printing it ''
Dury	PERSON	, '' which would have looked strange to its owner . ''

		An Overture for Founding and Maintain - ing Bibliothecks in every Paroch throughout the Kingdom , '' published anonymously at Edin - burgh in
1699	DATE	, is now , we are assured by its present editors , a tract of great rarity .

		Its authorship is traced to the Presbyterian minister ,
James Kirkwood	PERSON	-LRB- 1650-1708 -RRB- , a brief sketch of whose life precedes the reprint of the above - named tract , to which is added a second , dealing with the same general subject , and entitled '' A Copy of a Letter anent a Project for erecting a Library in every Presbytery , or at least County , in the
Highlands	LOCATION	. ''

		It is by means of this second little treatise that the authorship of the first is determined , but when or where it was originally published , the editors do not say ; nor do they venture any assertion as to whether our philan - thropists endeavors bore fruit .

		Undoubtedly he was ahead of his age : the times were not ripe for public libraries .

		Yet the ultimate results of his zeal may have been considerable .

		Among other curious details of his scheme is one whereby the time allowed for retaining each volume was
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 76 to depend on its size and the distance of the borrower s home from the library .

		Our first subscription library , that founded by
Franklin	PERSON	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, had a somewhat similar rule .

		The exalted motives to
Kirkwood	LOCATION	's exertions in this field find partial expression in the following sentence : '' Seeing God hath made all men by nature desirous pf Knowledge , undoubtedly the satisfying of this desire , must be a considerable part of our natural felicity ; for the only delight of our Souls , which are our better part , in which the Body doth not partake , is the delight She taketh in Knowledge and Contemplation . ''

		Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	's pleasant essay , '' In the Name of the Bodleian , '' which forms ` the title-chapter to his latest collection of essays , must have aroused in many readers a fresh interest in Sir
Thomas Bodley	PERSON	-LRB- 1544-1613 -RRB- , foimder of the famous
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	library that bears his name .

		The fourth number of the series under review contains his '' Life , '' written by himself , and his '' First Draught of the Statutes of the Public Library at
Oxon	LOCATION	. ''

		A preface by Miss Granniss gives further details about both the man and his library to eke out the modest record he himself has given of his doings .

		Of his benefactions to the imiversity where he both studied and taught , he says very little , according more space to his honors and achievements as a diplomat , but limiting his entire autobiography -LRB- written in
1609	DATE	-RRB- to some three thousand words .

		His '' Statutes '' run to nearly twice that length , and from them we take a short passage to illustrate the benevolent writer 's old-fashioned charm of style . ''

		Above all things , that may concern the Preservation of this our publick Place of Study , or the Benefit , Use , and Ease of those that shall frequent it , it is deemed expedient , that some one be deputed to the Custody of it , that is noted and known for a diligent Student , and in all his Conversation to be Trusty , Active , and Discreet ; a Graduat also , and a Linguist , not encumbred with Mar - riage , nor with a Benefice of Cure .

		For it can not stand with piety , that such a Charge should admit the continual Society of other publick Imployments ; and Marriage is too full of
Domestical Impeachments	ORGANIZATION	, to afford him so much time from his private Affairs , as almost every Day 's necessity of his private Presence will require . ''


Bodley	PERSON	's regard for books amounted almost to reverence .

		Remembering the sad fate of previous public collections of books at
Oxford	LOCATION	, he prescribed a penalty of instant and igno - minious ejection from the university for so much as making '' any Change in any Line or Lines , Word or Words , Syllable or Letter , in any Author whatsoever , '' or for being even an involuntary witness to such wicked act without denouncing the offender within three days .

		This volume is marked by the same excellence of workmanship that characterizes the other three .

		The Red Planet Mars .

		* During the present year the planet Mars , which has given astronomers so merry a chase during the past few years , arrives at one of the favorable oppositions when its distance from the earth will be less than forty millions of miles , and details upon its surface will therefore be more easily seen than they usually are .

		Since public curiosity will soon be aroused , there is a certain timeliness in the nearly sim - ultaneous publication of two books upon our interesting neighbor .

		The first of these is an essay by Professor
E. S. Morse	PERSON	, who has spent most of his long life in zoological studies .

		The study of life upon the earth has produced in him an intense interest in the question as to whether intelligent life exists in other worlds .

		Believing that any man pos - sessing a fair amount of intelligence is compe - tent to make a critical estimate of the work of astronomers upon Mars , he has essayed the task of sitting as judge upon their labors , of sifting the observational evidence at hand and pro- nouncing judgment in no hesitant fashion .

		The reader must not expect to find in the book the calm attitude of the man of science who looks at the matter in hand from all sides , examines the evidence pro and con , and then states his conclusions with the modesty which befits one who is aware of the uncertainties pertaining to the subject .

		The present author takes the view - point , rather , of the special pleader , marshals the evidence that bolsters up the theory he is advancing , ridicules opinions divergent from his own , and leaves the reader in a state of wonder as to what argmnents might be advanced on the other side of the question .

		Such a course , how - ever , when adopted by a man whose rhetorical ability is undoubted , at least leads to the pro- duction of a very readable book .

		76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, ment is as follows : First , life in other worlds is inherently probable .

		Second , a network of lines marks the surface of Mars .

		Third , the lines are most easily accoimted for on the sup - position that they mark the courses of irrigating canals .

		Fourth , these irrigating canals have been constructed by intelligent beings .

		This simple line of argument the author elaborates , enlivening nearly every chapter with personal allusions to well-known astronomers who have had the fortime , or the misfortune , to express opinions upon Mars .

		He has apparently overstepped the limits of polite language vhen he makes the following comments upon some astronomers and astronomical writers whom he mentions by name : '' But what could we expect of the mentality of the senior assistant of the
Royal Observatory	ORGANIZATION	at
Greenwich	LOCATION	, who , with the great vault of heaven crowded with enigmas awaiting an answer , should waste a particle of gray matter in trying to ascertain precisely where
Joshua	PERSON	stood when he commanded the Sun to stand still so that he could have a little more time for his bloody work . '' ''

		I appeal to any honest and unprejudiced mind if a more incompetent person of the class to which he belongs could have been foxmd in
England	LOCATION	for the Directorship of such a body . ''

		`` His attempt is as childish and ridiculous as the theory he conjures up . '' ''

		This is certainly a happy thought of the reverend author , only it would seem in this case that a larger and more diversified corps of specialists , including alienists , is needed to attend to that class of astronomers who are suffering from mental strabismus .

		It might be advisa - ble to call in the services of a bacteriologist to make cultures of new forms of microbes which may be in - volved in rendering men incapable of estimating the value of evidence . ''

		Professor
Morse	PERSON	spent a month at the
Lowell Observatory	ORGANIZATION	in
Arizona	LOCATION	, where he was given opportunity to observe Mars on every clear night with the 24-inch telescope .

		Here he came to ap - preciate the difficidties connected with the study of the system of canals .

		On pages 80-81 he describes his initial sensations . ''

		Imagine my surprise and chagrin when I first saw the beautiful disk of Mars through this superb telescope .

		Not a line !

		not a markuig !

		The object I saw could only be compared in appearance to the open mouth of a cru - cible filled with molten gold .

		Slighter discolorations here and there and evanescent areas outlined for the tenth of a second , but not a determinate line or spot to be seen .

		Had I stopped that night , or even a week later , I might have joined the ranks of certain observers and said ' Illusion , ' or something worse .

		And right here it was that my experience with microscopic work helped me ; for , remembering the hours -- nay , days -- I had worked in making out structural features in delicate organisms which my unprofessional friends could not see at all , I realized that patient observation would be re - quired if I was to be successful in my efforts .

		My despair , however , was overwhelming when Professor
Lowell	PERSON	and his assistants , looking for a few moments at the same object , would draw on paper the features which had been plainly revealed to them , consisting of definite shaded regions , a number of canals and other markings , of which , with the utmost scrutiny , I could hardly detect a trace . ''

		In replying to the natural objection that physical conditions on Mars may be so very different from those on the earth that such forms of life as we know may not be able to exist there , the author has written a very interesting chapter in which he shows the astonishing va - riety of circmnstances under which life of various forms exists upon the earth .

		Animals of mar - vellous delicacy live at the bottom of the ocean in darkness and imder a pressure of many tons to the square inch .

		Some forms of plant-life thrive in water nearly at the freezing point , and others exist in that which is almost ready to boil .

		Even men live in temperatures ranging from 130 ° in the shade to 70 ° below zero ; they can work at an altitude of 19,000 feet , or under an atmospheric pressure of twenty-five or thirty pounds to the square inch , without injury .

		Anyone who is at all interested in the ques - tion of the existence of intelligent life in other worlds may well pass a pleasant evening in perusing the pages of this entertaining book .

		Of a very different sort is Professor
Lowell	PERSON	's latest book on '' Mars and Its Canals . ''

		Eleven years ago he issued a very attractive popular work on this subject , and during this interval he and his assistants have assiduously observed the ruddy planet at every favorable opportunity .

		These observations have strongly confirmed the opinions originally expressed by Professor LoweU , and have enabled him to fill in details in gratifying fashion .

		The observations have been made at his private observatory at Flag - staff ,
Arizona	LOCATION	, where a 24-inch glass , of
Alvan G. Clark	PERSON	's workmanship , is mounted at an ele - vation of eight thousand feet above the sea .

		In order to make out delicate planetary detail , it is absolutely necessary that the atmosphere at the observing station be both clear and steady .

		One who merely works with a microscope in the quiet air of a laboratory has no adequate conception of the difficulty of seeing minute details when one has to look through many miles of an agitated atmospheric ocean , laden with dust and water vapor , and often charged with ice-spiculae in its upper layers .

		Apart from the question of the existence and function of the Martian canals , the author be - lieves that the following conclusions , from his own observations and those of others , are reasonable : First , that Mars has days and seasons substan - tially like our own .

		Second , that its enveloping
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 atmosphere contains water vapor , carbonic acid , and oxygen , and is quite rare , the barometric pressure being probably no greater than four inches .

		Third , that water is very scarce , as shown by the infrequency of clouds and the rapid melting of the polar caps in
summer	DATE	.

		Fourth , that the temperature is colder than ours , but above the freezing point of water except in
winter	DATE	and the extreme polar regions .

		Fifth , that vegetation springs up when the polar snows melt , and dies away in due course .

		The difficulty of the observations which lie at the basis of all reasonable theorizinsr about the much-discussed system of canals and the existence of intelligent beings on the planet , may weU be described in Professor
Lowell	PERSON	's own words . ''

		When a fairly acute-eyed observer sets himself to scan the telescopic disk of the planet in steady air , he will , after noting the dazzling contour of the white polar cap and the sharp outlines of the blue-green seas , of a sudden be made aware of a vision as of a thread stretched somewhere from the blue-green across the orange areas of the disk .

		Gone as quickly as it came , he will instinctively doubt his own eyesight , and credit to illusion what can so unaccountably disappear .

		Gaze as hard as he will , no power of his can recall it , when , with the same startling abruptness , the thing stands before his eyes again .

		Convinced , after three or four such showings , that the vision is real , he will still be left wondering what and where it was .

		For so short and sudden are its apparitions that the locating of it is dubiously hard .

		It is gone each time before he has got its bearings .

		By persistent watch , however , for the best instants of definition , backed by a knowledge of what he is to see , he wiU find its comings more frequent , more certain , and more detailed .

		At last some partic - ularly propitious moment will disclose its relation to well-known points and its position be assured .

		First , one such thread and then another will make its presence evident ; and then he will note that each always appears in place .

		Repetition in situ will convince him that these strange visitants are as real as the main markings , and are as permanent as they ... Not everybody can see these delicate features at first sight , even when pointed out to them ; and to perceive their more minute details takes a trained as well as an acute eye , observing under the best conditions . ''

		Our author has devoted haK his book to a detailed description of observations of the canals and to theories as to their nature and origin .

		These tantalizing objects were even photo - graphed ; joyfvd was the day when this feat was accomplished ! ''

		The eagerness with which the first plate was scanned as it emerged from its last bath may be imagined , and the joy when on it some of the canals could certainly be seen !

		There were the old configurations of patches , the light areas and the dark , just as they looked through the telescope , and never till then otherwise seen of hu - man eye , and there more marvelous yet were the grosser of those lines that had so piqued human curiosity , the canals of Mars .

		... By chance on one of the plates a temporal event was found registered too , the first snow -
fall	DATE	of the season , the beginning of the new polar cap , seen visually just before the plate happened to be put in and reproduced by it unmistakably .

		Upon the many images thirty-eight canals were counted in all , and one of them , the NUokeras , double .

		Thus did the canals at last speak for their own reality themselves . ''

		We are now ready to ask for an explanation of the nature of these delicate markings .

		The author shows that their complex behavior may be accounted for by a theory which he unhesitat - ingly advocates .

		This theory is that there are narrow waterways extending in a complete net - work over the surface of Mars ; when the polar snows melt , the released water flows equator - wards through these waterways , quickening vegetation along their banks and causing it to develop from the polar regions onward .

		This vegetation flourishes for a time , dies out , and is again renewed seasonally .

		If we grant that vegetation somewhat similar to our own exists , the author asks us to admit that animal life , which is closely coexistent with vegetable life on the earth , is likewise associated with it on Mars .

		On page 358 he says : '' Once started , life , as palaeontology shows , develops along both the floral and faunal lines side by side , taking on complexity with time .

		It begins so soon as secular cooling has condensed water vapor into its liquid state ; chromaceafe and confervse coming into being high up toward the boiling point .

		Then with lowering temper - ature come the sea-weeds and the rhizopods , then the land plants and the lunged vertebrates .

		Hand in hand the flora and fauna climb to more intricate perfecting , life rising as temperature lowers . ''

		Professor
Lowell	PERSON	believes that the water would not flow along the canals from a pole downward across the equator unless artificially helped ; this help he ascribes to beings of a high order of intelligence , who have fashioned the canal system .

		He calls particidar attention to the fact that the canals connect small round dark spots which are scattered over the planet 's face , going with geometrical precision straight from one '' oasis '' to another .

		These '' oases '' he considers centres of population .

		The popu - lation he esteems '' necessarily intelligent '' and of a '' non-bellicose character . ''

		How firm his conviction is may be judged from the first sen - tence of the last chapter , which reads as follows : '' That Mars is inhabited by beings of some sort or other , we may consider as certain as it is uncertain what those beings may be . ''

		Whether the reader can accept the author 's conclusions or not , he will at least be forced to admit , after reading '' Mars and Its Canals , '' that the book is an exceedingly able and inter - esting exposition of the subject .

		* The life of a scholar in nineteenth-century
England	LOCATION	, inclined by temperament and iU-health to the quiet content to be sought far from the madding crowd , leaves a literary record without stir of adventure or thrill of triumph , but one eagerly appreciated by such as are sympathetic with the charm of letters .


George Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	, best known for his notable edition of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's
Johnson	PERSON	, found in heredity and environment a potent shaping of his fate .

		Son and grandson of a schoolmaster , he , along with his brothers , was early initiated into preceptorial service in the family 's large boarding-school for boys , of which for eighteen years he in turn served as partner or master .

		The natural path for the career led through
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, which he entered in
1855	DATE	at the age of twenty .

		There the deter - mining influences -- a not uncommon experi - ence -- were his companions , a notable group of young men who presently formed themselves into a club which they called the '' Old Mor - tality . ''

		The names of the original members are , almost without exception , now in the rolls of the distinguished : Professor
Nichol	PERSON	, Pro- fessor Dicey , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, Professor
Thomas Hill Green	PERSON	, the Right Honorable
James Bryce	PERSON	, Dr.
Caird	PERSON	-LRB- Master of Baliol -RRB- , Dr.
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	, and Mr.
Justice Wright	PERSON	.

		An equally intimate companion was
William Morris	PERSON	.

		A contemporary , not of the club , records that `` they were a revolutionary set , and read
Browning	PERSON	. ''


Young Hill 's Oxford	ORGANIZATION	letters were divided between his father and
Miss Scott	PERSON	-LRB- to whom he was early engaged , and who became his helpful life-mate -RRB- , with a natural preponderance , both in number and intimacy , in favor of the latter .

		Here is one of them : '' Yesterday I was in
Swinburne	LOCATION	's rooms .

		I wish yon knew the little fellow ; he is the most enthusiastic fellow I ever met , and one of the cleverest .

		He wanted to read me some poems he had written , and have my opinion .

		They are really very good , and he read them with such an earnestness , so truly feeling everything he had written , that I for the first time in my life enjoyed hearing the poetry of an amateur . ''

		In
1857	DATE	the '' Old Mortality '' club became responsible for a magazine , to the first issue of which Birkbeck Hill contributed his maiden literary effort in the form of a story .

		Though we had not the satisfaction of having the paper itself , we still managed to drink its health in very good claret , as well as the health of each contributor , and the absent editor -LSB-
Nichol	PERSON	-RSB- also .

		So we made very merry indeed ; and though the baby was not there , still the christening was very successful . ''

		The arduous labors connected with the man - agement of the school at
Bruce Castle	ORGANIZATION	,
Totten	PERSON	- ham , and the cares of their own large family , became ever more wearing .

		In
1877	DATE	Dr.
Hill	PERSON	and his wife gave up the ^ chool and removed to
Burgfield	LOCATION	, near Reading .

		His life from now on was that of a man of letters with precarious income , rendered more so by the almost chronic interruptions of ill-health .

		While yet a school - master he had become a constant reviewer , and in
1874	DATE	had brought out a little book , '' Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, his Friends and his Critics , '' a venture upon which , according to Mrs.
Hill	PERSON	's careful accounting , he lost just <

		In
1879	DATE	his uncle Sir
Rowland Hill	PERSON	died , and Birkbeck Hill be - came the biographer of the founder of
Penny Postage	ORGANIZATION	.

		The next year he performed a similar service in bringing out the
Letters of Colonel Gordon	ORGANIZATION	from
Central Africa	LOCATION	.

		The three years from
1883	DATE	to
1886	DATE	were devoted wholly to the magnum opus , the six-volume edition of
Boswell	PERSON	; and in the last of those years , in the interests of the work , he removed to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		An edition of `` Rasselas , '' also of `` The Traveller '' and the Letters of
Hume	PERSON	, and a selection of
John	PERSON	- son 's writings imder the title '' The Wit and Wisdom of Dr.

		Some lectures given by Dr. HiU in
1891	DATE	were made up into a little volume , `` Writers and Readers . ''

1893	DATE	Dr.
Hill	PERSON	visited
America	LOCATION	; and the experience bore fruit in an accoimt of ``

		You shall be
Moses	PERSON	and the spokesman , and I will be a chorus . ''

		Dr.
Hill	PERSON	's candor and sincerity of thought and speech made it quite impossible for him to deal tolerantly with presumption , duplicity , privilege , or dogmatism .

		He was liberal in politics and re - ligion , as in letters .

		Accurate , considerate , with a scholar 's standards and ideals , the whole - 80uledn6ss of his interest made him as eager in one occupation as in another .

		The most delightful of companions , an adored friend of children -LRB- some of his charming writings to the little ones have been gathered in '' Letters of a Grandfather '' -RRB- , he carried with him the subtle attraction of hav - ing only to be himself to be at once your friend .

		Straightforward in thought , and with keen in - sights , his opinions were sound as well as incisive , while over all there played the genial humor of a kindly simplicity .

		Good talk he enjoyed , and practised his own preaching . ''

		It ought to be taught as one of the chief duties of life that each one is bound so to train and store his mind that he may take his part in pleasant and general talk . '

		Thou shalt not bore thy neighbor ' might well be added to the Commandments . ''

		These qualities impart to his letters -LRB- which , it must be remembered , are for the most part the intimate communion of husband and wife , of a father with his children -RRB- at once a sterling interest and a personal charm .

		Always ready for foolery and the lighter vein , he ever gave a serious sub - ject serious attention .

		Thoughts , as men , he valued for their real worth .

		Reputation , conven - tion , the sanction of majorities or superficial consideration , influenced him little .

		His com - ment upon a bit of fine writing in Renan is char - acteristic : '' There is one passage about beautiful women which might have been written by at least ten thousand French fools , and so should not have been written by Renan . ''

		His interest in
America	LOCATION	, though brought to the venture of two trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	journeys through the marriage of a daughter to Professor
Ashley	PERSON	, sometime professor at
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, was dominantly in a land in which worth had an un - trammelled chance to assert itself . ''

		There are four great cradles of liberty in the world -- so I reckon them --

		He focussed his attention upon one of our institutions which it was well that the English cousin should comprehend .

		He willingly records , '' What progress
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is making !

		She strides while our Universities crawl . ''

		Yet he equally brought forward the benefits of seeing ourselves as others see us ; and a dozen years ' experience vindicate the sharp-sightedness of the Oxonian spectacles .

		Not the least of our short - comings -- the reviewer may be permitted to add , not out of harmony with the spirit of Dr.

		Ten years hence I may have the courage only of other people 's opinions .

		My environment -LSB-
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- is one where the ' shades of the prison-house ' too early close in upon youthful enthusi - asm .

		Sooner than elsewhere , one ceases to be * on his way attended by the Vision splendid , ' and begins to think and feel and speak conventionally and academically .

		Everywhere around me I hear the praise of the ' middle course , ' of compromise , of suspended judgment ; and I see the love of truth corrupted into the sophistic pas - sion for believing both sides of a contradiction .

		I see the folks of my little world the victims , all of them , of one or two diseases -- the disease of having no opinions -LRB- ' the balanced mind ' -RRB- or the disease of not expressing them -LRB- ' moderation ' -RRB- .

		Yet we all know that the just balance is motionless : nor have we ever seen in history intellectual progress born of an elegant laissez-faire . ''

		And so , secretly aware of the cheerful -- nay , enthusiastic -- permission of the discriminating , and scornful of the protests of the multitude , this extraordinary Fellow proceeds to correct some of the most ancient misunderstandings of our Christian world .

		In the first section , headed '' Christian , Greek , or Goth , '' it is maintained that in addition to Christianity and Hellenism we have a third but little-recog-nized force , which is Northern or Gothic in origin .

		It is suggested that whereas historical Christianity has in the past come in for a great deal of criticism , it is now rather ethical Christianity that is being called into question .

		Both Christianity and Hellenism have been tried and found wanting ; or if not so found , it has been because they have been combined with another element essentially distinct in its nature and origin , though not recognized as such . ''

		The ideal of Christianity is what we may call holi - ness .

		The ideal of Hellenism may be said to be under - standing , or intelligence ... Two ideals , chivalry and honor , are neither Greek nor Christian : I take them to be the peculiar property and creation of the northern races .

		I may call them the cardinal virtues of Gothic morality . ''

		And again : '' Christianity has said , ' In my flesh dwelleth no good thing . '

		... Against that , chivalry is a brilliant and pow - erful , though erratic , protest .

		... It had also accounted those alone blessed who , in the cause of Christ , had made themselves * as the filth of the world and the off - scourings of all things unto this day . '

		... Against all that , so unnatural , so pusillanimous , so impossible , the ideal of honor is a righteous and necessary and enduring protest . '

		I am a man of peace , ' says
Clough	PERSON	's Dipsychus : ' I am a man of peace , And the old Adam of the gentleman Dares seldom in my bosom stir against The mild plebeian Christian seated there . '

		But it is to the motions in the blood of this old Adam that European society , as I believe , owes , and has always owed , its salvation . ''

		To most , this will seem in some degree ex - travagant , ; and yet , who can suppose that the northern civilization , so rich in the mingling currents of humanity , has not contributed some - thing to the religious life of its members ?

		In the language of the naturalist , should there not be some endemic forms within this territory ?

		-- and if so , are they not likely to be the most characteristic , the most precisely adapted to this pecidiar environment ?

		In a later chapter , '' Christ the Forerunner , '' Mr.
Garrod	PERSON	sets forth a new view of Christ and his mission , which explains in many ways his attitude toward Christianity , and his circum - scription of it regarded as an original force .

		Christ , it is urged , taught and believed that the end of the world , or at least the end of ordinary human institutions , was close at hand .

		Paul was of the same opinion .

		Consequently , their religion , as actually held and presented , is by no means applicable to the life of normal men and women .

		Nor is this all .

		Numerous and apparently plausible reasons are adduced for believing that Christ did not so much as claim to be the Messiah , and that the '' Son of Man , '' so frequently referred to by him , was not him - self but another .

		It is impossible here to sum - marize the argiunent , but the least we can say of it is that it is extremely interesting ; and we can not deny the fact , urged by the author , that whereas the Gospel is everywhere read , few there are who examine it critically .

		What , then , of Christianity , after all ?

		If it has been crassly misunderstood , and made to cover in name quite other things , if it is in itself unsuited for human needs , what of it ?

		Was the mission of Christ a failure ?

		Not so . ''

		In the long and learned introduction prefixed to his edition of the Bible -LRB- dated 1813 -RRB- , by the Rev.
John Brown	PERSON	, I read that ' Perhaps about A. D. 2860 or 3000 Satan will be again loosed from his long restraint ; and , after corrupting the members of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, will assemble the Turks , Russians , or others of a savage temper , to destroy her : but the fearful vengeance of God shall overtake them in their attempt .

		Then cameth the end of the world , at what distance we know not . '

		This irruption of Satan , tliis high-handed action of

		The year 2860 is ever upon us daily : daily is Satan unloosed , and peoples ' of a savage temper ' arm them - selves against the truth of God : the end of aU things is ever staring us in the face .

		It comes daily to all who , without losing interest in life , or the healthy sense of the world , yet feel that all their actions look to an end that is not on earth ; to the man who through the day keeps his eyes upon the duties of the day to do them , who is just , kind , moderate , healthy-minded , who also at the close of each day goes out at his door , and , lifting his eyes from the earth , looks awhile at ' the unnumbered stars of God , ' though he stand there without speech or prayer -- to such an one the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	comes daily .

		For that which sent
John	PERSON	to the dungeon , Christ to the
Cross	ORGANIZATION	,
Paul	PERSON	to the block , each filled with the faith of the instant coming of the Lord , was none else than this -- the sense , which should be in each one of us , of a perfection ever about to be attained , a joy and peace ever about to be realized .

		He who has not this sense of the ideal may , as truly as he that lacks ' charity , ' be counted dead before God . ''

		I have tried to present all this without dis - pute , not because there is any lack of oppor - tunity for controversy , but because I think the worth of the book very far outweighs such faults as it may possess -- these latter being , indeed , such necessary accompaniments of per - fect straightforwardness that we could not wish them absent .

		It will do any man good to read such virile words , -- and if they harm him , he is not worthy to withstand the gods .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		Briefs on
Neav Books	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the hunter of antiques . ''

		The true collector , '' says Mrs.
N. Hudson Moore	PERSON	in one of the chapters of her delightful '' Collector 's Man - ual '' -LRB-
F. A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , '' when once embarked on his career , is seldom content to keep in one narrow path , but strays out in many directions , and finds pleasure in them all . ''

		Many a '' true collector '' will agree with Mrs.
Moore	PERSON	, and be grateful to her for offering him in one volume information about a number of the main branches of that complex and fascinating subject , the collecting of antiques .

		Mrs.
Moore	PERSON	has already written in separate volumes , and more ex - haustively , of china , brass and pewter , lace , and old furniture ; but the true collector is generally poor , because of the temptations that collecting offers , and he will be glad , particularly if he is a beginner in need of general information , to be able to get so much of it , concisely put and lavishly illustrated , in one mod - erate-priced volume .

		About half the book is given to various articles of furniture .

		An account of the origin of each article is given , and extracts from old wills , diaries , or inventories prove its existence and importance at early dates .

		Various good styles are illustrated , as well as a few `` faked '' or '' restored '' ones , to put the novice on his guard .

		Mrs.
Moore	PERSON	aims to arouse enthusiasm as well as to cultivate taste .

		She does not forget that the quest of a bargain and the amusing and sometimes amazing adventures that the quest entails make up a good part of the fun for the '' true collector '' ; so she sprinkles her pages with lively anecdotes of her own and her friends ' experiences .

		Her own pet fad , she confesses , is the collecting of `` cottage ornaments , '' which is the trade name for the quaint
Staffordshire	LOCATION	figures of shepherds and shepherdesses , well-known people , or animals , particularly sheep and dogs .

		This is a field comparatively new to the average collector , and almost nothing has hitherto been written about it .

		Old glass - ware , brass and copper , pewter , and a few of the best-known English chinas , are Mrs.
Moore	PERSON	's other topics .

		These are all subjects which a lover of an - tiques , in pursuit of his own particular hobby , is sure to become interested in , or at least to want a little information about .

		Mrs.
Moore	PERSON	writes definitely and concisely , and her wide acquaintance among English and American collectors enables her to offer her readers a particularly complete and helpful set of illustrations .

		A curious little book , fraught with S ^ aS '' ' ^ '' ^ ' * interest both as a historical study and a human document , is the collec - tion of the '' Love-Letters of
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		to
Anne Boleyn	PERSON	, '' now issued by
Messrs. John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a small leather-bound volume , with fanciful frontispiece and incidental decorations in black and white .

		A note by Mr.
Halliwell Phillips	PERSON	, reprinted from another edition of the letters , gives an account of the earliest appearance of the letters in print , and a justification for the accepted order of arrangement .

		The order in the present edition , which is explained in a second note of anonymous authorship , is radi - cally different , following that of Mr.
Brewer	PERSON	's
Cal	LOCATION	- endar of
State Papers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each letter is dated as exactly as the evidence warrants , and there are a • few textual notes .

		A perusal of the letters shows
Henry	PERSON	in the character of a fairly ardent though not passionate lover , with a strong tendency to moralize and to lay emphasis upon the practical rather than the sentimental aspects of his affection .

		There is nothing here to kindle
Anne	PERSON	's cold heart , but much to assure her of her royal lover 's devotion , and of his pious dependence upon divine
Providence	LOCATION	to bring their affairs to a happy issue .

		These emotions seem a little forced in view of the facts , and the colorless phrasing is due , possibly , to the fact that more than half of the letters were written in French .

		Besides ,
Henry	PERSON	lived before the dawn of the art of letter - writing .

		He evidently regards correspondence as a mere necessary means of communication , and does not dream of being personal or expansive in a letter .

		His scholarship shows only in a polished style and in chance bits of
Latin	LOCATION	; while of the wit and versatility that made Erasmus wonder , there is no sign .

		So there is nothing in these rather commonplace epistles to cause the most sensitive reader to raise a cry of confidence violated .

		And yet , as a work of a moral monster and a great king , the collection is not with - out a unique interest for modern readers , though most of that interest must be read between the lines .

		82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, To journey through
Denmark	LOCATION	, Nor - iSn `` ; r ' ^ ^ ^ y ' ^ `` d
Sweden	LOCATION	, to cross the
Baltic Sea	LOCATION	and the
Gulf of Finland	LOCATION	, getting a glimpse of Helsingf ors , to ^ o to
St. Petersbiirg	LOCATION	and
Moscow	LOCATION	, and then to scamper back to
London	LOCATION	, the starting-point , by way of
Berlin	LOCATION	,
Hamburg	LOCATION	,
Amster	PERSON	- dam , and
Den Haag	PERSON	, all in five weeks , is to invite some musty comparisons with the personally conducted tourist who helter-skelters round
Europe	LOCATION	in a limited vacation time .

		Mr.
William Seymour Edwards	PERSON	took his honeymoon trip over the route outlined , and de - spite the shortness of the time given to it he appears to have seen much more and to have assimilated it better than the average tourist does .

		His book en - titled `` Through
Scandinavia	LOCATION	to
Moscow	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , while commonplace in many respects , is saved from mediocrity by the author 's remarks on the people he observed -- especially in
Scandinavia	LOCATION	.

		In
Norway	LOCATION	he was struck with the sight of many newly-built farm-houses and their substantial and modern improvements , all made with the aid of American dollars sent home by prosperous Nor - wegians living in our
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		An interesting contrast between the Norwegian and the Swede is pointed out . ''

		The Norwegian looks out upon the
Twentieth Century	ORGANIZATION	and finds his inspiration in the example of free
America	LOCATION	and the universal equality of man .

		The Swede looks ever backward to the glorious days of
Gustavus Vasa	PERSON	,
Gustavus Adolphus	PERSON	, and
Charles XII.	PERSON	, and sighs for a return of the good old times when the half of
Europe	LOCATION	trembled before
Sweden	LOCATION	's military might ... Thus have the cousin peoples swung wide apart .

		The one , free and open - minded ; the other , still dazed by the faded glories of a long dead past , turns ever a wistful eye toward the military tyrannies of Czar and
Kaiser	PERSON	, and finds in the inequalities of landed noble and landless yokel , in official military caste and enthralled peasantry , the realization of his
Fifteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	ideal . ''

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	's comments on the relations of the Slav and the Jews , and their much advertised conflicts , are very sensible , much more so , indeed , than many accounts which purport to treat the matter at great length with more extended data .

		The Jew in
Russia	LOCATION	, according to Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	, '' prospers without and in spite of the fostering care of the autocracy , '' and hence he incurs the Slav 's envy and jealousy .

		Like a loyal American , Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	closes his book with thank - fulness that he and his bride were '' born and bred beneath the Stars and Stripes . ''

		Th letters of a '' ^ ^ ^
Thomas LawTcnce	PERSON	's Letter-bag '' famous artist -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , edited by Mr.
George	PERSON	a7id gallant .


Somes Layard	PERSON	, and supplemented by some pleasant recollections of the artist by a con - temporary .

		Miss
Elizabeth Croft	PERSON	, is offered as a sort of corrective to '' An Artist 's Love Story '' which Mr.
Oswald G. Knapp	PERSON	edited two years ago from certain of Lawrence 's letters , and those of Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	and her daughters , that had to do with the painter 's coquettish attentions to the two Misses Siddons .

		This earlier work has already been noticed in these columns .

		Now , out of '' five immense vol - umes '' of unpublished letters to and from the artist his present editor and apologist has selected a goodly number of very correct and proper epistles wherein affairs of the heart are seldom mentioned , to show us the man in a more favorable light .

		That Law - rence was now and then vexatiously dilatory in filling orders for his pictures , is made plain ; but no worse charge can be brought against him from this pub - lished correspondence .

		Of Mr.
Layard	PERSON	's book it may truly be said that the end crowns the work : the concluding '' Recollections '' of the painter 's friend
Elizabeth Croft	PERSON	, who survived him by twenty-six years , give a more intimate and attractive picture of him than do his own letters .

		Twenty-two illustra - tions , mostly from
Lawrence	PERSON	's paintings , enliven the volume and convey a good idea of the artist 's peculiar excellence -- that of an incomparable draughtsman of faces and hands .

		These prints are all the better for leaving out , by necessity , the painter 's defects of coloring , which has been censured as hard and glassy , though brilliant and effective .


Campbell	PERSON	used to say of his work : '' This is the merit of Law - rence 's paintings -- he makes one seem to have got into a drawing-room in the mansions of the blest , and to be looking at oneself in the mirrors '' ; and
Opie	PERSON	, less kindly : ''
Lawrence	PERSON	made coxcombs of his sitters , and his sitters made a coxcomb of him . ''

		Of the '' dangerous fascination '' of the old flirt ,
Fanny Kemble	ORGANIZATION	long ago told us her experience .

		Planning the ^ ^ ^ modest volume by Loring Un - garden and its derwood , entitled '' The Garden and accessories .

		j ^ g Accessories '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is not so much out of season as it might ap - pear , for it is the often reiterated advice of expert gardeners to plan the garden well in advance in order to have it a success .

		If this is the case with the trees , shrubs , and flowers , certainly it is even more important where the permanent settings of the garden are concerned ; since on those , as not only landscape gardeners but home-builders are beginning to see , the final beauty of the picture and its satis - fying qualities are most apt to depend .

		The book contains only about a hundred pages of text , but there is an illustration , and an excellent and really illustrative one , for nearly every page of reading matter .

		The author , who is a landscape architect , writes with knowledge and love of his subject , and emphasizes a point too often lost sight of -- the necessity of proportion , harmony , suitability , if the result is to be beauty .

		The descriptions and pictures of the different types of garden-houses , pergolas , trellises , and arches , the garden gazing-globes , sun - dials , stone lanterns , seats , tables , bird-houses , and what-not , the lily-ponds , the walls , terraces , and fences , will be studied with interest by those who are planning a garden , whether large or small , for - mal or informal .

		Likewise the chapter on suitable materials for these accessories may be read with profit .

		But the most important advice is given in the beginning , -- on the wisdom of providing our
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 88 gardens with such permanent settings as shall make them attractive all the year round , and of not copy - ing the styles of other times and lands , but so adapt - ing them that American gardens shall have a charm and an individuality of their own .

		It is not every reader that can sym - ^ ZTa : Z '' `` V ^ thize with
Charles Lamb	PERSON	in his avowed preference for books about books ; and even of those that can , comparatively few will be familiar enough with the ancient classics to turn with intelligent interest the leaves of Mr.
Hugh E. P. Piatt	PERSON	's ciirious little volume entitled `` A Last Ramble in the Classics '' -LRB- Oxford : B. H. Black - well -RRB- .

		This is not merely a book about books , but it is even to some extent a book about books that are themselves about books -- bookishness raised to the third power , so to speak .

		Among all sorts of matters pleasantly treated , with apt quotations from authors classical and post-classical , we meet with sections devoted to '' Sport in the Poets , '' ''
Melo	PERSON	- dious Verse , '' '' False Quantities , '' '' Some Quaint Mistakes , '' `` More Proverbial Phrases '' -LRB- in addi - tion , that is , to similar phrases in the same author 's '' Byways in the Classics '' -RRB- , '' Words and Manners , '' '' Sundry Questions , '' etc. .

		The following legal wit - ticism , classic in flavor , is one of the many quotable things in the book . ''

		Once , when plaster came tumbling down as he was hearing a case , Mr. Justice Chitty ejaculated , '
Fiat	ORGANIZATION	justitia , ruat ceiling ! ' ''

		Lacking Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	's professed fondness for verify - ing references , and also the time necessary to verify his very numerous references -- which might claim more hours of work than he spent in writing the book -- we must assume , as we gladly do , that his careful scholarship has kept him from error in his multitudinous citations .

		His zeal and industry in this his chosen field of labor -LRB- or relaxation -RRB- are admirable , although to most readers his little book may well appear to bear somewhat the same relation to live literature of real life as it is to-day that cherry-stone carving does to sculpture .

		But it is not given to everyone to carve cherry-stones with distinction .

		The remarkable deeds of six remark - able men , told by a writer also ac - counted remarkable , furnish reading that should be and is remarkably interesting . ''

		Real Soldiers of Fortime '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , from the same pen that has already depicted the imaginary '' Soldiers of Fortune , '' presents in brief compass the striking adventures of Major-General
Henry Ronald Douglas Maclver	PERSON	,
Baron James Harden-Hickey	PERSON	, Mr.
Winston Spencer Churchill	PERSON	, Captain
Philo Norton McGiffin	PERSON	, General
William Walker	PERSON	, and Major
Frederick Rus	PERSON	- sell Burnham '' the king of scouts . ''

		Not in every instance does Mr ,
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	write from intimate personal knowledge of his hero ; but he always seems so to have caught the spirit of the man he is describing that dulness and unreality have no place in his pages .

		The chapter on Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	-LRB- the English Six noted heroes of adventure .

		Churchill , be it noted -RRB- , soldier , war correspondent , lecturer , author , and politician , gains pecvdiar fresh - ness and actuality from the writer 's near acquaint - ance with and admiration for his bold and talented young hero .

		But the last chapter of aU , that on Major
Burnham	PERSON	, rivals it as an interest-awakener .

		The sketch of
General Maclver	ORGANIZATION	, which opens the book , might perhaps have gained by the addition of fuller details concerning his life since
1884	DATE	, when he pub - lished his autobiography entitled '' Under Fourteen Flags . ''

		Brought up to date , says Mr.
Davis	PERSON	, the book would properly be called '' Under Eighteen Flags . ''

		What are the four additional flags ?

		The twenty-one illustrations , especially the portraits , add much to the attractiveness of these true stories of daring deeds .

		The vital part of ^ new edition of Professor
J. Mark	PERSON	psychic processes
Baldwin	PERSON	's well-known volume with m Evolution .

		which , ten years ago , he began his exposition of a genetic psychology is appropriate and welcome .

		As an aid to the dissemination of interest in and appreciation of the vital share that psychic processes occupy in evolution , his books on '' Mental Development '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have done good service ; and it is well that the opportunity has been embraced to incorporate such modifications and amendments of the text as the increasing insight of recent knowl - edge makes possible .

		The systematic appearance which it is attempted to give to this volume , and to those that followed it in the author 's writings , is some - what misleading .

		They form a record of the author 's successive change of interests in the several problems capable of attack from the genetic point of view ; as such they are suggestive , and the treatment of some of the problems is distinctly valuable .

		It is , however , quite impossible for one so devoted to following the bent of his own interests , and of giving himself great latitude in the prominence of favorite phases of dis - cussion , to achieve a fair perspective of the field as a whole .

		The announcement is accordingly timely that the author is engaged upon a single volume that will have for its central object the setting forth of the principles of genetic psychology .

		It is always fairer to record an appreciation of a work for what it really accomplishes than to render it subject to criticism by setting it in a class to which it does not belong .

		^ An up-to-date ^ ^ ^ ' ^ ^ ^ y ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ?

		`` ' General Greely handbook of issued the first edition of his '' Hand - Polar research , ^ ^ ^ y ^ ^ f - polsiT Discoveries . ''

		The third edition has been revised and enlarged , and now appears brought down to
1906	DATE	-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is , as its name implies , simply a. compendium , in preparing which 70,000 pages of original narrative have been summarized and classi - fied .

		Polar expeditions have been carried on from three motives .

		At first commercial interests fur - nished their incentive , as when
England	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	competed in endeavors to find a short route to the Indies .

		Later , the desire to enlarge geographical 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, knowledge gave the needed impetus .

		At the present time all expeditions are equipped with scientific instruments and are expected to add to the sum of scientific knowledge .

		The actual contributions to science which have been made by polar ex ; peditions are by no means inconsiderable , but the irresistible desire for conquest and the spirit of adventm-e are powerful factors in recent expeditions as well as in many a past exploit in the frozen North .

		The last thirty pages of
General Greely	ORGANIZATION	's book are devoted to Antarctic research .

		An extensive bibliography and an excellent index enhance the value of this handbook , and serve to indicate to the reader the sources of practically our entire knowledge of Arctic regions .

		Problems and ' ^ ^ - ^ - H - Forbes-Lindsay has written progrets of the a Very useful and instructive little
Panama Canal	LOCATION	, volume on ''
Panama	LOCATION	, the Isthmus and the Canal '' -LRB-
J. C. Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In his preface the author writes : '' I have endeavored to relate the story of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal from the earliest explo - rations to the present time , with as much avoidance as possible of technics , and in a manner that shall be comprehensible to the general reader . ''

		Every feature of this vast undertaking is pictured in detail with simplicity and intelligibility , and without undue argumentative discussion .

		In an appendix the author tells the story of the '' Great Canals of the World , '' a story extracted from a monograph under this title issued by the
Department of Commerce and Labor	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The book will serve a useful pur - pose as an introduction to a study of the problems involved in the construction of the canal , and in sum - marizing the things already done there .

		Although the book is written in topical style , an index would enhance its usefulness .

		Two excellent maps help one to understand the discussion concerning the re - spective merits of the sea-level and the lock systems of construction .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Readers of Father
Sheehan	PERSON	's admirable novels of Irish life and character -LRB- to say nothing of his striking poems -RRB- will be glad to make his acquaintance as an essayist .

		For this the opportunity is nowoffered by the publication -LRB- Longmans -RRB- of a volume of his '' Early Es - says and Lectures , '' wherein he discourses instructively and with fine intelligence upon such men as
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, and
Aubrey De Vera	PERSON	, and upon such themes as '' The German Universities , '' '' The German and Gaelic Muses , '' and '' Irish Youth and High Ideals . ''

		Mr.
Edmund G. Gardner	PERSON	's book on
Ariosto	LOCATION	, which he calls by the rather cheap title `` The King of Court Poets '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , is a continuation of his ''
Dukes	PERSON	and Poets of
Ferrara	PERSON	. ''

		It treats , in the first part , of the political conditions in
Italy	LOCATION	in the early decades of the sixteenth century ; and in the second , of
Ariosto	PERSON	's works , the ''
Orlando	LOCATION	Fm-ioso , '' the minor Latin poems , and the comedies .

		The poet is at times so lost sight of in the complex manoeuvres of Italian politics that the work reminds one of the famous criticism of
Masson	PERSON	's '' Mil - ton . ''

		Mr.
Gardner	PERSON	, however , seeks to keep us in touch with his subject by illustrating , from the ''
Orlando	LOCATION	'' and other works , the poet 's attitude toward the events of his time .

		The chapters dealing with the poetry of
Ariosto	PERSON	are pleasing , but on the whole rather inconclu - sive .

		The style of the book is without distinction , and it occasionally lapses into inelegance .

		The twentieth annual volume of '' Book Prices Cur '' rent , '' covering the English auction season of 1905-6 > comes to us from Mr.
Elliot Stock	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The sea - son here dealt with has not been a sensational one ; hut a number of important collections , such as those of the late Mr.
Truman	PERSON	and Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	, were disposed of , and the prices realized showed a very fair average .

		Full descriptive entries of over seven thousand items are recorded .

		The excellent editorial judgment and wide bibUographical knowledge displayed in the preparation of '' Book Prices Current '' are too well known to call for comment here .

		For the librarian and collector it is an invaluable reference work ; to the bookseller it is quite mdispensable .

		A work much needed , not by students alone , but by general readers as well , has been done by Professor
Arthur G. Canfield	PERSON	in his selection from the ' < Poems of Victor Hugo '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		Although the book is published as an educational text , with the usual apparatus of in - troduction and notes , we hope that it will find its way into the hands of many people who are out of school , for the work of the greatest of French poets is scattered through so many volumes that English readers have scant chance of knowing it at all , unless they avail themselves of the sort of help Mr.
Canfield	PERSON	offers them .

		The various volumes of the poems are taken in their chronological order , and from each of them a brief but judicious selection is made .

		From the
Librairie Sansaisha	ORGANIZATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	, we have a '' Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Geographic du Japon , '' a substantial volume of a thousand pages with three hun - dred cuts , the work of
M. E. Papinot	ORGANIZATION	.

		The words '' history '' and '' geography '' are hardly adequate to describe the contents of this work , which is also a bio - graphical dictionary and a compact encyclopsedia of most Japanese matters .

		It contains articles , for ex - ample , upon such subjects as
Bushido	LOCATION	and
Harakiri	LOCATION	, to name two of those most familiar to Western rea - ders .

		An appendix of eleven '' Cartes G ^ ographiques , '' which are excellent specimens of cartography , comes with the work as a separate pamphlet , not having been completed in time for their insertion in the bound volume . ''

		Original Narratives of Early American History '' is the title of a new collection of reprints , fathered by the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, and published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The first volume has for its subject '' The Northmen ,
Columbus	LOCATION	, and
Cabot	PERSON	, '' the editing of the Norse texts being the work of Pro- fessor
Julius E. Olson	PERSON	, and that of the
Columbus	LOCATION	and
Cabot	PERSON	texts being done by Professor
Edward G. Bourne	PERSON	.

		The volume could not have fallen into more competent hands than these .

		The second volume gives us '' Early English and French Voyages , '' largely taken from
Hakluyt	LOCATION	, and covering the period from
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	's first journey up the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	to the ill-fated
Popham Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		In between , we have the voyages of
Hawkins	PERSON	and
Gilbert	PERSON	, and the early voyages to
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Henry S. Burrage	PERSON	is the editor of this volume .

		The multiplication of worthy periodicals within the past few years has meant a serious embarassment to those who try to keep in touch with cui ^ ent literature , and despair was heretofore the portion of the man who disliked to miss articles of value wherever produced .

		As a handy guide to the things one needs or desires , What 's in the Magazines is a veritable path through the forest .

		The value of such a convenient and reliable guide to the magazine literature of the country will be rapidly appreciated by the student , the teacher , the specialist in any field of research , the general reader and the man of affairs .

		It is a publication that will admirably supplement ''

		SEX AND SOCIETY Studies in the Social Psychology of Sex By
WILLIAM I. THOMAS	PERSON	,
Associate Professor of Sociology	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		THIS volume approaches the question of woman and her position in society from a new standpoint .

		It recognizes that sex is a fundamental factor in the origin and development of social institutions and occupational activities , and that a number of social forms and forces are of sexual origin .

		After a preliminary paper in which the organic differences of the two sexes are analyzed , there follows a series of studies on the relation of sex to social feeling and • stimulation , and the influence of sex in securing a system of social control ; the psychology of the maternal system of tribal organization ; sex as a factor in the differentiation of occupations in early society , and the relation of woman to early industry and invention ; the relation of sex to the origin of morality ; the origin of exogamy ; the origin and psychology of modesty and clothing .

		In the last two papers , on `` The Adventitious Character of Woman '' and `` The Mind of Woman and the Lower Races , '' modern woman is interpreted from the stand - point of certain conventions and prejudices which emanate from the fact of sex , and which have excluded her from full participation in the activities of the '' white man 's world , '' with the result that she develops a type of mind and character not represen - tative of the natural traits of her sex .

		Former treatises on the '' woman question '' have dealt in the main in a descriptive way with the history of marriage , or at least only with the details of the development of the marriage system , and have failed to present a theory which makes clear the significance of the present position of woman in society .

		The volume of Professor
Thomas	PERSON	is the first attempt made to estimate the influence of the fact of sex on the origin and development of human society .

		BRIEFER MENTION 117 NOTES 117 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 118 CHEMISTRY AND CRITICISM .

		The classification of human beings as bro - mides and sulphites , a product of the whimsical invention of Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	, is explained in considerable detail in his suggestive little book , '' Are You a Bromide ? ''

		For those not yet acquainted with this contribution to anthro - pology -LRB- or psychology -RRB- , a few words of explana - tion may be offered .

		Bromides , who are the majority of mankind , '' all think and talk alike , '' their '' minds keep regidar office hours , '' and they '' may be depended upon to be trite , banal , and arbitrary . ''

		They are known by their use of such '' bromidioms '' as these : '' I do n't know much about Art , but I know what I like . '' ''

		I want to see my own country before I go abroad . '' ''

		It is n't so much the heat -LRB- or the cold -RRB- as the humidity in the air . ''

		Sulphites , on the other hand , '' are agreed upon most of the basic facts of life , and this common luiderstanding makes it possible for them to eliminate the obvious from their conversation . ''

		A sulphite is a per - son who does his own thinking ; he is a person who has surprises up his sleeve .

		He is ex - plosive .

		One can never foresee what he will do , except that it will be a direct and spontan - eous manifestation of his own personality . ''

		Hamlet ,
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, and Mr.
G. Bernard Shaw	PERSON	are typical sulphites ; examples of equally typical bromides may be foimd in Polonius ,
Amelia Sedley	PERSON	, and Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	.

		Since reading the author 's instructive expo - sition of this new method of classification , our thought has been taking a chemical cast , and we have found a certain satisfaction in dwelling upon other symbolisms of the same general na - ture , having in view books rather than persons , -- a distinction without much difference , how - ever , since -LRB- to use a common bromidiom -RRB- a man 's writing is sure to be the reflection of his personality .

		There is the old fancy of the four elements , for example , now superseded by the fourscore of which we have exact knowledge , with occasional additions to the list .

		Is not a parallel offered by the structural simplicity of the older literatiu-e as compared with the com - plexity of the modern product ?

		May we not suggest that the old books -- the primitive sagas and epics and myths -- are compounded of four 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, elements ?

		It does not seem to be forcing the analogy overmuch to discover the element of earth in the hunger-motive , that of air in the love-motive , that of fire in the fighting-motive , and that of water in the nature-motive .

		These fundamental motives , as embodied in literature , have been ricHly illustrated in Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	's recent contributions to our pages .

		On the other hand , modern books are inadequately described in such simple terms .

		They exhibit the fundamental elements , but also many others , and the variety of their com - pounds would be bewildering were we not sup - plied with a critical chemistry for their proper ordering .

		Take the element of love alone : it is a comparatively simple matter in Homer and the Niebelungenlied and the balladry of the middle ages , but in the modem novel its forms are innumerable .

		Here is the opportunity for our suggested chemical method of criticism , which trimnphantly responds to the exigency .

		For in the new chemistry of the carbon-com - pounds we have an exact parallel to the new amorism of our ingenious modern novelists and poets .

		Once started upon this flight of chemical analogy , fancy finds abundant material for exer - cise .

		Collaborative books , for example , usually illustrate the fundamental fact of chemical com - bination , the fact that the elements in such a union lose their distinctive properties , the pro- duct being like neither of its constituents .

		Again , many a writer exhibits the phenomenon of aUotropism , having under different conditions modes of expression so diverse as hardly to suggest the same personality .

		Isomerism is fre - quently exemplified in literature .

		We may find two books compoimded apparently of the same elements in the same proportions ; yet one of them may be an inspired creation of genius , and the other but the dullest of fabrications .

		The old theory of phlogiston affords another parallel of highly suggestive character .

		According to that ingenious doctrine , combustion -LRB- which modern chemistry knows to be oxidation -RRB- meant the loss of phlogiston -- an element having negative gravity -- whereby the resultant sub - stance was made heavier than the unconsumed original .

		How many a writer , by a similar loss , has grown ponderous and inert !


Wordsworth	PERSON	was evidently dephlogisticated when he wrote the '' Ecclesiastical Sonnets , '' and most sequels to works of genius show that the volatile element has escaped .

		The synthesis of organic compounds , which so definitely separates the new chemistry from the old , has its literary analogies .

		The work of literature , which was once supposed to be a work of creation , springing from the personality of its maker , now tends more and more to be - come the product formulated by rule and shaped from materials collected for the purpose .

		The old injimction of poet to poet , `` Look in thy heart , and write , '' has given place to the modern counsel -LRB- not of perfection -RRB- , '' Look in thy scrap - book , and piece together . ''

		Thus are produced the countless imitations of old patterns that now clamor for our attention , imitations having a nicety of adjustment calculated to deceive all but the elect few .

		No '' vital principle '' is longer needed for the production of song or ballad ; the literary laboratory has become inde - pendent of that old-fashioned agency , reproduc - ing all the old typical forms in flask or alembic , and supplementing them with countless varia - tions of its own devising .

		Just as scientific chemistry has taken the place of romantic alchemy , so has the craftsman method of literary production taken the place of the old free play of creative imagination .

		And the cherished impossibilities which were the ideals of the alchemist -- if we may be per - mitted a still greater confusion of metaphor than has hitherto been indulged in -- are now realized in literature .

		Is not the modern maga - zine the exact analogue of that universal solvent which the alchemist sought in vain , and is not the modern novel the very type of his philoso - pher 's stone that should transmute the baser forms of matter into gold ?

		If his ideal of the elixir of life still eludes our modern poets , there are at least many of them who are fully con - vinced of having made that discovery also ; and this cheerful delusion is a very fair substitute for the reality .

		As a conclusion to this series of f ancif id diva - gations , we wish to bring forward , by way of supplement to the Bourgeois philosophy of bromides and sulphites , a classification of our Ours is a classification of writings rather own .

		than of persons , -- which does not , however , set it essentially apart from the other , for it is by expression that the bromide and the sulphite are respectively indicated .

		There is known to chemists a classification of substances into crys - talloids and colloids , and the method of strain - ing through a membrane whereby they may be distinguished and separated is called dialysis , which fact seems to justify us in claiming a cer - tain proprietorship in the critical analogue of this physical process .

		Only the briefest of characterizations is here possible .

		THE DIAL 99 writing has a distinctive form which it usually assumes if free to make the proper molecular adjustments , and which it always tends to as - sume .

		It has angles and facets , is subject to laws of internal strain , and offers marked re - sistance to external forces .

		Colloid writing , on the other hand , is essentially amorphous and gluey ; its molecules seem to recognize no laws of symmetry , and are ready to shape themselves in accordance with whatever pressure , internal or external , may be exerted upon them .

		To name a few contrasted pairs of writers is the best way to illustrate our meaning .

		Tennyson and
Browning	PERSON	,
Tourguenieff	PERSON	and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, Brunetiere and
Lemaitre	PERSON	,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and
Schelling	PERSON	, may be suggested as such pairs .

		Himdreds of others will occur to the reader upon a little reflection .

		Since the function of this journal , as we take it , is dialytical in the sense here indicated , we have allowed ourselves the above exposition -LRB- `` Marry , how ?

		Tropi - cally '' -RRB- of an original principle of applied chemistry as related to literary criticism .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The commercialization of literature is again forcibly treated by Mr.
Henry Holt	PERSON	, the vet - eran publisher , whose paper in the current '' Put - nam 's '' is a sort of supplement to his earlier utterance on the subject which was published in the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' of
November , 1905	DATE	, exciting much comment and discussion .

		His latest word is in the nature of a reiteration , with courteous replies to hostile critics .

		Many slurs upon publishers are rightly resented by him as a self-respecting member of the guild , while he also undertakes to plead the cause of self-respecting authors and to show that the literary agent is a personage that can commonly be dispensed with .

		The distinction between matter that can place itself and matter that needs placing goes to the bottom of the whole question : matter of the first kind needs no agent ; that of the second no agent has any use for .

		But Mr.
Holt	PERSON	admits that the agent can sometimes be of service in selling serial and dramatic rights , and the rights to publish in foreign countries or in the colonies .

		With these exceptions any business between author and pub - lisher that the author prefers not to attend to in person can better be placed in an honest lawyer 's hands than in a literary agent 's .

		The '' some of the time '' that all the people can be fooled by the lit - erary agent has passed , says Mr.
Holt	PERSON	; and the `` some of the people '' that can be fooled all the time are too few to fxu-nish the agent lucrative employment .

		Answering the objection that Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's publisher is an ideal creation , non-existent in the flesh , he says : '' I have suggested no ideal that I have not known in actual practice , and although the publishing business in
America	LOCATION	is in a lower estate than it has been before since I knew it , I have had , and have , the privilege of knowing sev - eral men in it who live up to the best that I have claimed , and find their account in it despite the com - petition of methods that they scorn . ''

		If all pub - lishers and all authors lived up to Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's high ideals of commercial honor , what a happy life the literary life would be !

		• • • The decay of academic courage is the subject of some plain words by a college professor , in a recent number of the '' Educational Review . ''

		The sting of the text lies not in the implication that the professor is losing his valor , but that the conditions of control in the higher education are so autocratic and intolerant that it requires an uncommon amount of courage to stand up and point out the dangers and injustice of the status quo .

		The editor of the '' Review '' rejects these conclusions , and declares that '' It must be an unquestioned fact to any but the totally and wilfully blind that the academic career was never so dignified , so respected , so hon - ored , so courageous , so independent , so free , as at the very moment of writing these words .

		Any statement to the contrary is absolutely unjustified , unwarranted by the facts , contrary to the facts . ''

		Notwithstanding the sweeping and vehement char - acter of this rejoinder , we can hardly regard the discussion as thereby closed .

		There are various ways of conducting the complex affairs of state , and in any fair consideration of the dignity and comfort of the college professor 's position this useful if modest functionary has a right to say how the thing looks to him .

		The enormous progress of our uni - versities and colleges appeals to the popular admi - ration of success , and there is little danger of a lack of appreciation of the man with his hand on the throttle -- the man who makes things go .

		But there are some burning questions -LRB- particularly as to the woeful poverty of teachers ' and professors ' incomes -RRB- that must soon occupy , in a very practical temper , a prominent place in the discussions of academic welfare .

		.

		An endowed journal of literary criticism has appeared , and in a quarter where we should perhaps least look for it -- the Republic of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		It is the
Revista Critica	PERSON	, and makes the interesting announcement that the government of
Vera Cruz	PERSON	has extended to it a generous financial support .

		It is thus probably the first periodical of its kind in our hemisphere to receive State aid .

		It is also the official organ of the
Associacion Literaria Internacional Americano	ORGANIZATION	, a society which has for its purpose the fostering of literature in all the Spanish American countries .

		The headquarters of this
Association	ORGANIZATION	are at
Havana	LOCATION	.

		In
Havana	LOCATION	, too , there is just launched a new magazine , ''
America	LOCATION	, '' in whose pages the poets and romance writers of the league will try to gain a public .

		There seems to be a genuine awak - 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	; ening of literary interest and literary talent in the great Southlands .

		There is a stirring of many wings and a chorus of voices .

		But indeed , to one who knows anything of these beautiful regions , who remembers their picturesque history , it is a matter of wonder that they have not sooner challenged and caught the world 's attention by great works .

		These peoples inherit the Latin art instinct , and in the Spanish language have one of the most beautiful and harmonious instruments of expression mankind has yet invented .

		And their special qualities of bravery , courtesy , and hospitality , which rise to romantic heights , are a guarantee that there will be no failure of literary material or makers .

		It is time that our North American indifference to the intel - lectual life of our nearest neighbors should cease . ''

		'T is ignorance which makes a barren waste Of all beyond ourselves . ''

		Perhaps the real
Athens	LOCATION	or
Florence	LOCATION	or
Weimar	LOCATION	of our
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	world may some day find itself located on the borders of the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, in an island of the
Carribean Sea	LOCATION	, or under the shadow of the
Andes	LOCATION	.

		... A TEAR OF MAGAZINE POETRY is the Subject of an interesting study contributed by Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	to the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript . ''

		Six leading American monthlies , the same half dozen that furnished material for a similar article last year , have again been overhauled , their poems counted and graded and classified , and some gen - eral deductions drawn .

		The writer declares that '' students and lovers of poetry know conclusively there is written to-day infinitely better verse than nine-tenths of what gets printed in magazines .

		And they know that these pieces are being constantly rejected by editors . ''

		This exclusion of good poetry is supposed to be due to an editorial regard for what the public presumably demands , and also to space requirements in the make-up of a magazine page according to traditional rules .

		In matters of more detail , let us quote : '' The space devoted to verse by these periodicals against that of prose in
1906	DATE	varies little from that of
1905	DATE	.

		The average is about 9700 pages of prose to 220 of verse .

		The poems in the six magazines numbered 340 , the total being appor - tioned as follows :
Lippincott	PERSON	's 88 pieces .


Harper	PERSON	's 78 , Century 61 ,
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's 51 ,
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly 35 ,
McClure	PERSON	's 27 .

		Lippincott 's , publishing the largest number , presented the lowest order of ability or merit ; 8 out of the 88 come within the standard of acceptance by intrinsic merit , though only 3 pos - sess any distinction to appeal impressively through some single quality .


Harper	PERSON	's is second by num - bers , printing 78 , 11 attaining the merit class from which 4 elevate themselves through essentially poetic achievement .

		The Century stands third with 61 , 10 of which above the merit average include 8 of decided poetic distinction .

		Scribner 's follows in fourth place with 51 , 7 of which are worthy of classification , with 4 distinctively excellent .

		The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	contained 35 , 9 having merit , of which 5 possess distinction . ''

		These poems of '' dis - tinction '' are then named , their authorship - given , and the magazines in which they appeared desig - nated .

		Of course the element of personal bias is not to be overlooked in all this ; but Mr.
Braith	PERSON	- waite has already done good work for the cause of poetry -- witness his recent excellent compilation of '' Elizabethan Verse '' -- and his authority as a critic is not contemptible .

		• • • The sneeze in literature , and more especially in folk-lore , might be made the subject of a curi - ously interesting and probably voluminous treatise .

		To begin with , the Arabs tell us that the universe itself is the happy result of a sneeze by AUah , which at once delivers us from a tangle of philosophical and metaphysical argument and disputation .

		A Norwegian scholar has lately made some researches in the customs and superstitions that have to do with sneezing , and a few of his discoveries are worth noting .

		In
China	LOCATION	, where etiquette rules supreme , whenever the premonitions of a sneeze make them - selves manifest all present fold their hands in prayer and bow to the earth until the explosion is over ; then they all voice their pious hope that the bones of the sneezer 's illustrious ancestors have not been disturbed by the earth-spirit .

		Contrariwise , the Japanese consider it not good form to take any notice of a sneeze unless its author chance to belong to the
Fox Clan	ORGANIZATION	, in which case sacrifices are offered to the Fox God .

		This is not unlike our own polite practice of repressing or muffling the sneeze if possible , and of taking little notice of it if it escapes control .

		Some European nations , as the Germans , have a formula to avert the ill omen of a sneeze , or to make sure that it be of happy omen to the sneezer . ''

		■ Prosit ! ''

		greets the ears of the aston - ished Anglo-Saxon upon his first sneeze in Teutonic territory .

		Some peoples use a phrase equivalent to '' God help you ! ''

		or '' God bless you ! ''

		-- ^ the latter form dating from
Saint Gregory	PERSON	's time .

		It was while he was pope that an epidemic -LRB- probably the influenza , or , as we should say now , the grippe -RRB- broke out in
Italy	LOCATION	and set aU the people to sneez - ing .

		This attack was called '' the death-sneeze , '' and Pope
Gregory	PERSON	issued an edict that all who sur - vived this paroxysm of sneezing should exclaim , `` God bless my soul ! ''

		All of this , and much else more marvellous , may be read in the book of the sneezer out of
Norway	LOCATION	.

		• • • Fiction-reading as a '' rest cure '' is not likely soon to go out of vogue .

		Indeed it may be said to have a great future before it .

		The hurried and worried , the nervous and distracted , the business and professional men who see much of the seamy side of life , all demand , and will continue to de - mand , in the leisure hour of dressing-gown and slip - pers , a bright and brisk and optimistic picture of things as they should be but are not , in the form of fiction .

		In addition to these classes of novel -
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 101 readers is the large number of ladies -LRB- and gentlemen too -RRB- of elegant leisure who make a serious business of novel-reading , visiting the circulating library pei ' - haps every day but
Sunday	DATE	to exchange the next - to-the-last for the very latest new novel .

		A bright young lady , entering a
London	LOCATION	library and asking for the very latest new novel , was requested to be more specific , as eight new novels had come in that morning , '' Oh , '' she replied , '' then I '11 have the one that came in last . ''

		Ste.
Beuve	PERSON	used to deplore the increasing vogue of the novel , as a form of lit - erature destined to swallow up all other varieties ; and already it has encroached on the domain of history , of sociology , of psychology , of religion , of finance -LRB- witness Mr.
Lawson	PERSON	's forthcoming ``
Friday	DATE	the Thirteenth '' -RRB- , and even of natural science .

		Those who watch the signs of the times in the lit - erary world predict an increasing demand for books in the coming years ; and of these books the greater number must , while human nature continues to be human nature , be books that amuse rather than instruct .

		The outlook for the novel is therefore a bright one .

		In the increasing complexity and inten - sity and strenuosity of modern life , the novel 's chief mission may well prove to be that of a '' rest cure '' -- a name first applied to it by Mrs.
Cecil Thurston	PERSON	.

		• • • Low-priced novels and the circulating li - braries seem to represent conflicting interests in
England	LOCATION	.

		Word comes from
London	LOCATION	that one large publishing house is now issuing works of fiction at half-a-crown instead of six shillings -- a reduction of over half its former price and the price still asked by other publishers .

		With this reduction , the standard of manufacture being kept up , it is evident that only large editions will pay ; hence novels unlikely to command a good sale would be barred from publication .

		This low price could be afforded only if the novel-reading public should cease to de - pend so largely on the circulating library , and buy books direct .

		A general reduction of price among publishers of fiction would thus become a serious matter to the circulating libraries .

		• • • The annual report of the Library of Con - gress is not the least interesting reading imaginable .

		As was recently remarked of this library by a Lon - don literary journal , its size and importance do not seem to be generally realized , at least outside
the United States	LOCATION	.

		According to Librarian Putnam 's latest figures , the library now has 1,379,244 books , 89,869 maps and charts , 437,510 pieces of music , 214,276 prints , besides a large number of manu - scripts that are not yet counted and catalogued .

		Among the many interesting additions of the year are Professor
J. P. MacLean	PERSON	's collection of Shaker litera - ture , believed to be the largest in existence ; a mass of Van Buren papers , comprising about
1700	DATE	letters and political documents ; and some five hundred letters and other documents dating from
1777	DATE	to
1810	DATE	, from the papers of Senator
James Brown	PERSON	of
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		The daily average attendance of readers was
2243	DATE	.

		The inaccuracies of an historical novelist -- namely , Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	-- are resented by a newspaper of Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's adopted state .

		He is reported from
Washington	LOCATION	as sending back word to
New Hampshire	LOCATION	that he is still alive , and as telling the reporter in the same breath that '' ever since
New Hampshire	LOCATION	has been a state it has been owned by the railroad . ''

		To this a
Concord	LOCATION	-LRB- N. H. -RRB- newspaper indignantly replies : `` Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	of late never loses his character as an historical novel - ist , and his interviews , like his novels , are curiously and unnecessarily inexact .


New Hampshire	LOCATION	has been a state since
1784	DATE	.

		Its first railroad was chartered about
1840	DATE	.

		Yet Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	says the railroad has owned us ' ever since we have been a state . ' ''

		This is inexact enough , surely ; but some allowance is doubtless to be made to a young man so recently defeated by the railroad in his heroic effort to purify the politics of his state and to get himself elected its chief magistrate .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THE
LONDON	LOCATION	TIMES AND THE PUBLISHEKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Having followed the '' Times Book War '' with keen interest , I naturally read your recent article '' O Tem - pora !

		O Mores ! ''

		with much appreciation .

		Two state - ments in it , however , do not accord with the facts so far as I have been able to gather them .

		-LRB- 1 -RRB- '' The book publishers made the modest request that ' The Times ' shoidd not resort to under-cutting dur - ing a period of six months from the date of a book 's first appearance .

		This was flatly refused .

		... '' On this I have to remark , -LRB- a -RRB- that the request referred only to net books ; -LRB- b -RRB- that it was not a modest request confined to under - cutting the sale of new books , but an ultimatum that no net book , however damaged by wear or otherwise second - hand , should be retailed at one farthing less than its full price within six months of its publication ; ' -LRB- c -RRB- that neither the modest request nor the dictatorial rule were flatly refused , for '' The Times '' claims that it has not sold and does not sell new net books on any other terms than those laid down by the publishers .

		In this matter I have every reason to believe that '' The Times '' is speaking the truth ; and the
PubUshers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	has faUed to prove the contrary .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- '' ' The Times ' retorted by declaring a boycott . ''

		This is very nearly the opposite of the truth .

		So far from '' The Times '' boycotting the pubhshers , it has made every effort to obtain their books , and has pur - chased them at full retail prices rather than disappoint its subscribers .

		It has , indeed , appealed to its subscribers not to force it to purchase these books at such a loss ; but I repeat , it has not boycotted the book publishers , either in trade , or in its reviews , or in its correspondence columns .

		Forgive this intrusion by a stranger ; but your senti - ments are so admirable that I thought you might be glad to have your facts correct as well .

		The volume on Hobbes , contributed to the '' English Men of Letters '' series in

		Few of us recall the earlier designation , and the later one never be - came widely familiar , because it was the visible sign of an honor conferred near the close of the author 's life .

		But the name ''
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, '' unadorned by any mark of artificial distinction , has meant a great deal to readers of many kinds , from mountaineers to philosophers , for the past thirty or forty years ; and when the famous Alpinist , literary critic , biographer , historian , and agnostic died , not quite

		His life was an example of so many of the virtues that it afPords an imusually worthy object for our contemplation , and the biograplxy now published should be the most welcome of books to all whose interests are engaged in the highest ideals of thought and conduct .

		The task of portraying this rich and many - sided life has fallen into the best of hands .

		The late
Frederic William Maitland	PERSON	, who completed the work
last October	DATE	, and whose own death we have since been called upon to deplore , was one of
Stephen	PERSON	's most intimate friends during the
last quarter-century	DATE	of his life .

		He was one of that goodly company of ''
Sunday	DATE	tramps '' who for fifteen years explored under
Stephen	PERSON	's lead - ership the highways and byways of
England	LOCATION	; he became
Stephen	PERSON	's kinsman by marriage ; and he was designated in
Stephen	PERSON	's dying message to his children as the one who should prepare whatever '' short article '' or '' appreciation '' or '' notice '' might be called for .

		Almost the last words pencilled by
Stephen	PERSON	upon his death-bed were these : '' Any sort of ' life ' of me is impossible , if only for the want of materials .

		Nor should I like you to help anybody to say anything ex - * The Life and Letters op

Maitland	PERSON	.

		He might write a short article or so . '

		That the '' short article '' has become a stout volume , telling in much detail the story of
Stephen	PERSON	's life , and preserving a large amount of his revealing and altogether delightftd corre - spondence , will hardly be held chargeable as a fault to the biographer , although in under - taking so large a task he exceeded
Stephen	PERSON	's modest instructions .

		He says : '' I feel that in writing so much as I propose to write , I shall go beyond , though certainly I shall not trans - gress , the letter of his expressed wish ; and it seems well for me to say why this is done .

		That ` short article or so ' about somebody else he could have writ - ten to perfection ; but I can not write it even imperfectly !

		The powers , natural and acquired , which enabled him to sum up a long life in a few pages , to analyze a char - acter in a few sentences , are not at my disposal , nor did I observe
Stephen	PERSON	as some expert in psychology , or as some heaven-born novelist might have observed him .

		... I do not think that the public will be entitled to complain if it gets some first-hand evidence instead of my epitome of it , and if
Stephen	PERSON	himself saw the ' short article or so ' swelling to the size of a book , he would shake his head , it is true , but he would acquit me of anything worse than clumsiness and verbosity . ''

		One of the most interesting chapters in this book is that which is devoted to
Stephen	PERSON	's first visit to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It was undertaken chiefly for the purpose of studying the Civil War at close range , and collecting controversial anununition for use at home .

		Stephen had a deep-seated -LRB- and even hereditary -RRB- hatred of slavery and aU its works , and he was one of the small group of Englishmen , the group which included MiU and Bright , who understood the American situation clearly , and who knew that , whatever questions of theoretical politics might be raised to obscure the issue by
Southern	ORGANIZATION	sympathizers , the practical question at stake was that of the '' peculiar institution . ''

		In the
summer of 1863	DATE	, having stoutly championed the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	cause during the first two years of the conflict ,
Stephen	PERSON	started for
America	LOCATION	that he might make observations on the spot .

		He knew little of American public men and writers , and '' had not any notion that he was going to make acquaintance with American men of letters , still less that some of them were to be his most intimate friends . ''

		If it were not for his later correspondence with the friends whom he made during this visit , the volume now under review would have a greatly diminished interest , and not for Americans alone .

		The score of letters addressed to
Lowell	LOCATION	, and the fourscore to Mr.
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, make up a highly impor - tant part of Mr.
Maitland	PERSON	's work .

		Stephen reached this country just after
Lee	PERSON	's retreat from
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's capture
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 103 of
Vicksburg	LOCATION	.

		He landed at
Halifax	LOCATION	, and at once proceeded to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		His first letter home speaks of meeting ''
Holmes	PERSON	, a rather well-known literary gent , '' and receiving cards from Field and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		A week later he finds himself much at home with his new friends , and describes them as '' really very pleasant , well educated men , like the best class of
Cambridge	LOCATION	men . ''

		Lowell '' really is one of the pleasantest men I ever met . ''

		Holmes is '' very kind and wonder - fully talkative , but with a good deal of sense and really impressing me as an extremely clever man . ''

		The note struck by this repeated use of the word '' really '' is a sufficient index of that '' condescension in foreigners '' about which
Lowell	PERSON	wrote with such lambent satire ; and we make no doubt that it was many times uncon - sciously sounded by
Stephen	PERSON	during these early
New England	LOCATION	days .

		It is amusing to come upon the ending to the letter from which we have just quoted . ''

		I know you will think I have spoken too favourably of my friends over here .

		I am , of course , in the best and most English part of the country .

		Perhaps I shall find things worse as T go on . ''

		This apprehension became sadly justified when
Chicago	LOCATION	was reached a few weeks later .

		He says of the denizens of that frontier community that '' their manners are those of bagmen and their customs are spitting . ''

		A few other fragments relating to this visit may be quoted .

		Newport was responsible for a splenetic outburst : '' It is hatefully flat and apparently devoid even of good bathing .

		However , I could not stay in it long , for I felt that disgust arising which always comes to me at
Interlaken	LOCATION	or any of those vile haunts of all that is most contemptible in humanity , called watering-places . ''

		A few days in
Washington	LOCATION	brought him into contact with
Seward	PERSON	and
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		Of the latter we read : '' In appearance he is much better than I expected .

		He is more like a gentleman to look at than I should have given him credit for from his pictures .

		He has a particularly pleasant smile , a jolly laugh , and altogether looks like a benevolent and hearty old gentleman . ''

		Seward did not make so good an impression . ''

		He is a little , rather insignificant-looking man , with a tendency to tell rather long-winded and rather point - less stories , and to make those would-be profoundly philosophical observations about the manifest destiny and characteristics of the American people , of which Americans have got a string ready for use on all occa - sions , and all of which I now know by heart .

		He ... rather provoked me , as I was telling him something of the friends of the North in
England	LOCATION	and mentioning Mill , by calling him '
Monkton	LOCATION	Mill ' -- a depth of de - liberate ignorance to which I should have hoped no decent human being on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	would have descended . ''

		Stephen found it hard work explaining to Americans the state of English '' barbarian '' opinion upon the subject of the war . ''

		1 rjeally do n't know how to translate into civil laur guage what I have heard a thousand times over in
England	LOCATION	: that both sides are such a set of snobs and blackguards that we only wish they could both be licked , or that their armies are the scum of the earth and the war got up by contractors , or that the race is altogether degenerate and demoralized , s ^ nd it is pleasant to see such a set of bullies have a fall .

		I really ca n't tell them all these little compliments , which I have heard m private conversation word for word , and which are a free translation of ' Times ' and '
Saturday	DATE	Review , ' even if I introduce them with the apology -LRB- though it is a really genuine apology -RRB- that we know nothing at all about them . ''

		Stephen made a trip to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and was oppressed by the hospitalities of his lawyer-host . ''

		Whenever we meet any one he knows in the streets , he clutches hold of him and introduces ' the Rev. Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	, the nephew of the celebrated lawyer , ' or ' the son of the celebrated historian , ' according to the sup - posed proclivities of the victim , and begs him to take me to his extensive coalyard or to his lunatic asylum or his world-famous book-store , or his church , or in fact to anything that is Ids . ''

		An invasion of
Girard College	ORGANIZATION	was escaped by pleading benefit of clergy . ''

		The founder , gaining my eternal gratitude thereby , but being , I fear , a shocking old scapegrace , declared in his will that no clergyman was ever to set foot in this building , and you have to give yoiir honour that you are not in any sense a priest before entering it .

		I joy - fully declined , and avoided presentation to the orphans . ''

		After making a brief visit to the seat of war in
Virginia	LOCATION	,
Stephen	PERSON	returned to
England	LOCATION	, and poured hot shot into the '' Times '' by publish - ing a pamphlet on the American War .

		The story of
Stephen	PERSON	's separation from the church in which he had taken orders was related in the deeply interesting reminiscences which he wrote several years ago , and the present biog - raphy supplements in various ways the personal confession made upon that occasion .

		The process does not seem to have been a particularly distress - ing one .

		He sloughed off the theological integu - ment of his early life as naturally as a crustacean casts off its outworn shell , and if there were any '' growing pains '' attendant upon the change , he kept them to himself . ''

		In truth , I did not feel that the solid groimd was giving way beneath my feet , but rather that I was being relieved of a cumbrous burden .

		I was not discovering that m -RCB- ^ creed was false , but that I had never really believed it . ''

		The separation did not take place with any startling dramatic accompaniment , but was a gradual process covering a period of several years .

		It was nearly completed at the time of the first visit to
America	LOCATION	.

		He wrote to his mother 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, that subscription to the Episcopal Church in
America	LOCATION	'' must be pleasingly lax . '' ''

		A bishop asked a candidate for ordination the other day whether he believed the thirty-nine Articles .

		Can - didate said he did n't .

		Bishop asked whether he agreed with the principal articles .

		Candidate replied that he would rather not commit himself .

		Candidate was passed , the bishop saying that he had no authority to inquire into anything but his willingness to use the Liturgy .

		I wish bishops had as much sense in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		When
Stephen	PERSON	ceased to be a parson and be - came a philosopher he had perhaps , all told , preached some twenty-five sermons .

		An amus - ing incident of the parliamentary campaign for the election of his friend Fawcett seems to show that while still a clergyman he was a human being .

		It was the day of the election . ''

		The language became loud ; the ' chairman of the room , ' one X , not a tall man , scattered his big D 's about freely .

		Stephen entered , he had lost himself , and his language was such that it sobered X , who crept up to him , took his left arm in both hands , and said : ' Oh , Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	, do n't take on so ; the
General Election	ORGANIZATION	will come in a year , when we shall want a second candidate to run with
Fawcett	PERSON	, and we have made up our minds that you are the man we should like . '

		Stephen tore his left arm so roughly away that he nearly threw X on the ground , while he shouted -LSB- something about X 's soul , and then -RSB- * Do n't you know that 1 'm a parson ? ' ''

		It was in
1866	DATE	that
Stephen	PERSON	became engaged to
Miss Thackeray	PERSON	, and we may quote a few characteristic remarks from the letter in which he announces the event to Mr. -LRB- now
Justice	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	. ''

		As for
Miss Thackeray	LOCATION	, I believe that it would be proper that I should give you some description of her , or , at least , quote poetry about her .

		I ' U see you damned first ... '' Do you know what it feels like to be engaged ?

		The experience of three days or so of the state enables me to say that it is psychologically interesting : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Because it is incredibly pleasant -- I did not think four days ago that I could contain so much happiness .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Because it makes an absohite breach of continuity in time .

		About
December 3	DATE	, in this year , the current of my life was parted by a chasm of inappreciable breadth .

		I should say at a guess that about ten years came in between two consecutive seconds , or rather , though we metaphysicians say that time should be represented by a line , this part of time seems to be fairly represented thus .

		-LSB- A diagram . -RSB-

		Intelligisne domine f -LRB- 3 -RRB- Ever since this dislocation , time has been going Uke a clock with the pendulum off , at the devil 's own pace .

		How many weeks or months go to a day is beyond my arithmetic .

		I wo n't bother you with any more of my feelings , but I know that you are an admirer of
H. Spencer	PERSON	, and might like a little psychological analysis . ''

		In a later letter to Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	, written just after marriage in the following
summer	DATE	, we find these philosophical reflections : '' To say the truth , I believe myself to have been very much in want of a wife , and to have been not a little spoiled by my donnish existence at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		It always tends to shrivel up a cove 's faculties to live as a bachelor in a bachelor society with very little external communication .

		One gets rusty and stupid and morose , and even a comparatively family and social existence in
London	LOCATION	had not undonned me .

		I was wanting much to take root , and am truly thankful I have done so to my heart 's content .

		In short , I am very happy indeed , and do n't mind saying so . ''

		A visit to
America	LOCATION	in
1868	DATE	yields many notes upon places and personalities , among them this about a call from Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	: '' He is considered to be a great prophet in
Yankee	LOCATION	- land , though I do n't much worship him .

		However , he has the merit of being a singularly mild , simple kind of old fellow , who does not presume in the least upon the reverence of his worshippers ... He was so kind * and benevolent , and talked so much like a virtuous old saint , that we could not help liking him . ''

		In connection with this note , we may quote what
Stephen	PERSON	wrote a few years later about
Carlyle	PERSON	.

		He was speaking of his brother ,
J. F. Stephen	PERSON	, and said : '' Oddly enough , he has been , in my opinion , a good deal corrupted by old
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	.

		I never before had so much respect for the extraordinary vigour of that person , till I saw how much influence he could exercise over a man who is little enough disposed to sit at anybody 's feet .

		I see the prophet pretty often myself , and though I am not so independent a character as
J. F. S.	PERSON	, I am almost equally repelled and attracted by him .

		Personally , indeed , I am simply attracted , for he is a really noble old cove and by far the best specimen of the literary gent we can at present produce .

		He has grown milder too with age .

		But politically and philosophically he talks a good deal of arrant and rather pestilent nonsense -- • that is , of what I call nonsense .

		He is indeed a genuine poet and a great humorist , which makes even his nonsense attractive in its way ; but nonsense it is and will remain , and , though it is as well to have a man of genius to give one the corrective of the ordinary twaddle , it is a pity that he is not comprehensive enough to see the other side as well . ''

		Stephen 's letters are so rich in so many kinds of intellectual and human interest -LRB- even more human than intellectual -RRB- that one is sure of `` pickings '' at whatever page the biography may chance to be opened .

		A few bits , taken at random , may give some further idea of its qual - ity , and fill up our remaining space . ''

		As a matter of fact ,
Switzerland	LOCATION	in the winter is just as accessible as
England	LOCATION	, and much pleasanter in some ways , owing to the comparative scarcity of Englishmen . '' ''

		I must now turn to certain wretched
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		and put their authors out of misery .

		It is not right , I fear , to toss up , as it would save me a great deal of trouble , and come to much the same thing in the end . '' ''

		I like some particular boys ; but the genus boy seems to me one of nature 's mistakes .

		Girls improve as they grow up ; but the boy generally deteriorates , and , in our infernal system , has to be sent away to school and made into more or less of a brute . '' ''

		I said nothing to you of politics ; because , in truth , that department of the world seems to me to be given over for the present to the devil , in whom I entertain a
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 106 kind of provisional belief , so long as things go on in this perverse fashion . '' ''

		The female student is at present an innocent ani - mal , who wants to improve her mind and takes orna - mental lectures seriously , not understanding with her brother students that the object of study is to get a good place in an examination , and that lectures are a vanity and a distraction . '' ''

		Of other books , I have got on my table
William James	PERSON	's new essays .

		They look bright , like all his writings .

		He is the one really lively philosopher ; but I am afraid that he is trying the old dodge of twisting ' faith ' out of moonshine . '' ''

		You spoke of the ' X ' critic who took
Poe	PERSON	and
Walt Whitman	PERSON	for the representatives of your literature .

		That seems to me -- pardon the remark -- that you have not kept yourself posted up in the youthful British critic .

		Some time ago he took up the pair in question because they were both rather naughty and eccentric , and it seemed original to put them above their betters .

		Poe was , I think , as
Lowell	PERSON	said , ' 3 parts of him genius and 1 part sheer fudge ' -LRB- perhaps ' 3 ' is too high a pro- portion -RRB- -- at any rate , a man of genius , though he ruined it very soon .

		W. W. always seems to me Em - erson diluted with Tupper -- twaddle with gleams of something better .

		But I quite agree with you that the critic was silly , or rather a young gentleman misled by a temporary ' fad ' -- I have written so much criticism alas !

		that I have acquired a disgust for the whole body of it -- including my own . ''

		With these miscellaneous bits we send our readers to the storehouse from which they came -- to the wonderfully discreet and sympathetic record of a lovable character and a noble life . ''

		Many are alive and will say with me , '' remarks the biographer in closing , '' that to have known
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	is ' part of our life 's unalterable good . ' ''

		And many others , now coming to know the man for the first time in the revelations of these pages , will give the sentiment a heartfelt ^ ^ '' ^ '

		The Dual Structure of the Germai ^ ^ Empire .

		* While there is no lack of learned works on the constitutional law of the German Empire by German writers -- such as the commentaries of
Laband	LOCATION	,
Zorn	PERSON	,
Meyer	PERSON	, and
Schulze	PERSON	-- we have hitherto had no systematic treatise pub - lished in the English language .

		Dr.
Burt Estes Howard	PERSON	, an American scholar who , we are told , has been a close student of German history and politics for many years , has done much to sup - ply this want in his excellent book on '' The German Empire , '' which will probably rank among the standard briefer treatises of the Ger - mans .

		It is based entirely on German sources , * The German Empire .

		By
Burt Estes Howard	PERSON	.

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		mostly original , and afPords abundant evidence of wide and painstaking research .

		The only criticism worth mentioning relates to the title of his book , which is misleading , since the work relates almost entirely to a single aspect of the
German Empire	ORGANIZATION	, its constitution .

		The German Empire is the only nation in the world to-day in which a federal system of government is combined with the monarchical principle .

		In this respect , and also in the con - stitutional inequality of the constituent members of which it is formed , it differs widely from the federal republics of the western hemisphere .

		But in other notable particulars it possesses striking similarities .

		The difficult problem of adjusting the relations between the central power and the individual units has there been solved in a manner very different from that oi any other state having a dual system of govern - ment under a common sovereignty .

		Some of its contributions to the solution of the problems of this sort of government are wholly original , and , we believe , in thorough accord with sound prin - ciples of political science .

		The lessons which they teach therefore merit the careful study of citizens of the great federal republic of
North America	LOCATION	, who must needs find solutions for some of the unsettled problems of our dual political system .

		The topics of Dr.
Howard	PERSON	's treatise are prin - cipally these : The founding of the Empire ; its relation to the states composing it ; the Impe - rial Legislature -LRB- Bundesrath and Reichstag -RRB- ; the Emperor ; the Chancellor ; Citizenship in the Empire ; the Judicial system ; the gov - ernment of the Reichsland -LRB-
Alsace Lorraine	LOCATION	-RRB- ; the Imperial Fiscal system ; and the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The treatment of each of these subjects is lucid , accurate , and discriminating .

		It is especially in the exposition of legal and con - stitutional relations that Dr.
Howard	PERSON	is at his best .

		He has a preeminently juristic bent of mind , as
weU	ORGANIZATION	as a faculty for clear and concise statement .

		In the brief compass of this review , no at - tempt will be made to do more than state the position which the author takes on several im - portant matters of German constitutional law .

		Concerning the legal structure of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, he maintains that its constituent elements are not citizens or subjects , but states ; and that sovereignty resides not in the Emperor , nor in the people , but in the totality of the states , i. e. , in the
Bundesrath	LOCATION	.

		This is the view also of the abler German commentators .

		The
Kaiser	PERSON	is not monarch q / * the Empire , but monarch in 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the Empire ; not
Kaiser	PERSON	von Deutschland ^ but
Deutscher Kaiser	PERSON	.

		He is not an authority of residuary powers with the customary monarch - ical prerogatives , but as Kaiser he possesses only derivative powers .

		He has some of the elements of both a monarch and a President ; yet he is neither of these .

		His position is unique , and it is impossible to classify him with other rulers .

		But , owing to the importance of the military power in
Germany	LOCATION	, his position as
Kaiser	PERSON	, in - dependently of his royal office , is one of enor - mous power .

		The office of Imperial Chancellor , created by
Bismarck	PERSON	for himself , is equally unique , and something of a puzzle to political students .

		Dr.
Howard	PERSON	insists that the only way to avoid misapprehension as to the real nature of the office is to distinguish between its dual nature -- i. e. , between the Chancellor 's position as a Prussian member of the Bundes - raili on the one hand , and his position as the Emperor 's only responsible minister and the highest imperial official on the other .

		Whether his responsibility is legal or political , as Dr.
Howard	PERSON	points out , is purely an academic ques - tion , since there is no means of enforcing it .

		The Socialists are demanding that he should be made responsible to the Imperial Parliament ; but as yet he acknowledges responsibility to no one except the Emperor .

		The discussion of German citizenship is full and illuminating .

		Like all states having the federal system of government ,
Germany	LOCATION	has had to deal with the difficidt problem of a dual citizenship -- one local , the other national .

		Most commentators recognize the existence of a citizenship of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and also a state citizenship .

		Dr.
Howard	PERSON	is among the num - ber , although he maintains that the two forms of citizenship are not coordinate and independ - ent , occupying distinct spheres , but that the re - lation is one of subordination and dependence .

		Contrary to the American ride , state citizen - ship in
Germany	LOCATION	is primary and imperial citi - zenship secondary ; that is , the latter is derived from the former , and is lost when that is lost .

		Nevertheless , it is characteristic of the German conception of the importance of uniformity among the states , that the conditions govern - ing the acquisition of state citizenship -LRB- and , in consequence , of imperial citizenship -RRB- should be regulated by Imperial law .

		This insures a common citizenship for all the states of the Empire , and does away with local divei `` sities and inequalities .

		The German theory of centralization in leg - islation is also well shown in the organization of the judicial and legal system , which constitutes the subject of an important chapter in Mr.
Howard	PERSON	's book .

		By successive statutes enacted since the founding of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, a common judicial system for all the states has been pro- vided -LRB- except for non-contentious jurisdiction -RRB- ; and so have codes of law and procedure .

		Thus there is uniformity of law , of judicial organiza - tion , and judicial procedure , throughout the Empire ; although , with the exception of the
Imperial Court	ORGANIZATION	at
Leipsic	LOCATION	, all courts are re - garded as state courts , the judges being ap - pointed and paid by the local governments .

		But here again the states are under certain restrictions , for they are required to provide the judges with adequate salaries , and the min - imum qualifications for eligibility to judicial stations are prescribed by imperial law .

		Dr.
Howard	PERSON	does not discuss the various special courts -LRB- hesondere gerichte -RRB- wliich are not regu - lated by Imperial law , nor the administrative courts , nor the bar , nor the state-attorney ship .

		A real defect in his discussion of the judicial system is the omision of all reference to the questipn of the power of the courts to declare statutes unconstitutional .

		The question is not entirely academic , particularly when there is a case of conflict between the state law and the imperial constitution or an imperial statute .

		In his discussion of the military side of the Empire , the author points out the interesting fact that there is no imperial army , but only a collective imity made up of contingents of the several states .

		This would be considered a fatal weakness in the military organization of the Empire , were it not for the fact that the con - tingent of each state is recruited , organized , equipped , and drilled , in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Empire .

		Likewise , the liability to military service , as well as the whole matter of discipline , rests upon Imperial law , and the supreme command of all contingents is vested in the Emperor .

		Another weak spot in the military organization of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	is the special privileges enjoyed by a number of the states .

		The smaller of these have ceded their special privileges to
Prussia	LOCATION	, so that reaUy there are but four contingents -- namely , those of
Prussia	LOCATION	,
Bavaria	LOCATION	,
Wurtemberg	LOCATION	, and
Saxony	LOCATION	.

		The navy , imlike the army , is in the strictest sense an Imperial affair .

		When the Empire was formed ,
Prussia	LOCATION	alone had a navy ; she brought it with her into the union ; and it has remained under the control of the
King of Prussia	LOCATION	, who is at the same time the German Emperor .

		THE DIAL 107 Thoreaf IX HIS Journals .

		* Seldom does it happen that the journals of a private citizen , a quiet man of letters , are published in a dozen volumes , especially in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The
Adams	PERSON	family , with their turn for both politics and literature , and their im wearied industry with the pen , have given us volume after volume of the diaries of the two Presidents of that fanaily ; and doubtless much is coming of the same sort from the copious papers of
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, first of that name .

		But among literary Americans diary publication has been comparatively small .

		A century after his death , the so-called '' Literary Diary '' of President
Stiles	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	has been edited at
New Haven	LOCATION	, and quite recently has appeared the first -LRB- perhaps the only -RRB- volume of Dr.
S. G. Howe	PERSON	, covering his active youthful years in the Greek Revolution .

		But
Emerson	PERSON	's journals liave as yet come forth only in frag - ments , though they are extensive ; and the fifty or sixty volumes of
Alcott	ORGANIZATION	's Diaries remain on the shelves at
Concord	LOCATION	, undisturbed .


Theodore Parker	PERSON	's copious Journals of a quarter-century have been much drawn upon by his biographers , and are to go finally to the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, after which publication in fidl may fol - low , -- but not , probably , until half a century after
Parker	PERSON	's death at
Florence	LOCATION	, in
May , 1860	DATE	.

		Most of the diaries just mentioned are records of foreign travel , at least in part .


John Quincy Adams	PERSON	had ranged over
Europe	LOCATION	from the Orient to
Moscow	LOCATION	;
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	twice or thrice visited
Europe	LOCATION	, and even -LRB- in
1872	DATE	-RRB- went as far eastward as to the Sphinx of
Egypt	LOCATION	, though he made few notes of that final journey , taken as he was ap - proaching the age of seventy , and disinclined to write even a journal .

		Parker had noted , in his Journal of 1843-44 , his interviews with famous scholars , and the lectures he heard in
Paris	LOCATION	and in
Germany	LOCATION	; in
Florence	LOCATION	, where he is buried , he met the Brownings , and in
Switzerland	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	, in 1859-60 , he had foreign incidents and manners to relate .

		Even
Alcott	PERSON	had one brief visit to
England	LOCATION	to record , as veU as those many volumes which lie filled with what his satirical neighbor ,
Ellery Chan	PERSON	- ning , called his ' • • Encydopedie de Moi-meme ^ Cinquante Volumes . '' ''

		But
Thoreau	PERSON	's only for - eign travel was for ten days , from
Concord	LOCATION	to

Thoreau 's Journals	ORGANIZATION	, to warrant their publication in four - teen well printed , illustrated , and indexed vol - umes , containing in the aggregate 6700 pages , exclusive of 70 pages of Mr.Gleason 's admirable photogravures , six pages of his map and key , and 110 double-columned pages of index In all , the volumes faU little short of 7000 pages , or eight times as much as White 's '' Selborne '' and
Izaak Walton	PERSON	's '' Compleat Angler , '' the two authors with whom
Thoreau	PERSON	is perhaps most often compared .

		What is it that warrants so full a publication of writings which in the au - thor 's own time were so generally overlooked or contemned ?

		Two qualities especially , -- their wonderful variety of topic and treatment , and the charm of their style when at its best .

		Back of both lies
Thoreau	PERSON	's chief quality -- his power of exact and minute observation ; and still fur - ther back and deeply original with him , the power of profound thought and comprehensive imagination applied to the most commonplace objects and events .

		Hardly any writer can be named , ancient or modern , who devoted such high powers so studiously to such a cyclopaedia of themes .

		Seneca ,
Pliny	LOCATION	, and Aristotle , among the ancients , Montaigne and Goethe of the mod - erns , come readily to mind , and each has some gifts and accomplishments that
Thoreau	PERSON	had not .

		But , on the other hand , so had he gifts and industries which they had not .

		Perhaps he comes nearest to
Montaigne	LOCATION	, for , like that learned and irregular
Gascon	PERSON	, he made the world of fact and deed revolve about himseK , instead of sharing its revolutions and following its fash - ions , like the most of us .

		Of course there are marked divergences one from the other .

		Where Montaigne is nonchalant and obscene ,
Thoreau	PERSON	is fastidious and fuU of exalted sentiment .

		Though their loyalty in friendship is much the same ,
Thoreau	PERSON	has a loftier and more unprac - tical ideal of his friend ; while in secular mat - ters he was far more widely practical than the landlord and magistrate in his chateau or his province .

		Emerson once , in
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, advised a young friend to `` know Mr. C , -- there is nothing he may not say . ''

		Of Thoreau it may be declared there was nothing he might not do , with his hands or with his head .

		He was a good boatman and boat-builder ; a mechanic and phi - 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, losopher ; a stoic , a cynic , a pencil-maker , and a poet ; good at mathematics , at merchandizing , at abstractions , paradoxes , and land-surveying .

		To none of his many avocations did he surrender himself , but stood back of and above them all in a proud leisure derived from the simplicity of his tastes and the singularity of his ambitions .

		Those foolish critics who call him indolent never knew him , nor any of his kind among men .

		His activity , whether physical or intellectual , was unceasing .


Emerson	PERSON	, his neighbor and friend , had intervals of mental inefficiency , when the pen refused its task , and even his startling fac - ulty of perception seemed to slumber or be far away .

		But
Thoreau	PERSON	was always , as the Yankee phrase is , '' up and coming . ''

		His most intimate friend and best biographer ,
Ellery Channing	PERSON	, describing his personal traits , says : '' His clenched hand betokened purpose .

		In walking he made a short cut if he could , and when sit - ting in the shade or by the wall-side he seemed merely the clearer to look forward into the next piece of activity .

		Even in the boat he had a wary , transitory air , his eyes on the outlook , -- perhaps there might be ducks or the Blanding turtle , or an otter or sparrow . ''

		Thoreau 's Journals intimate this tireless activity and vigilance ; and yet how many things and events , that he might have been expected to mention , are passed by in silence !

		Thus , in the
autumn of 1854	DATE	, when he was making the acquaintance of his English admirer ,
Thomas Cholmondeley	PERSON	, who lived with him in the same house for weeks , and in
December	DATE	went back to
Shropshire	LOCATION	to enlist volimteers for the Crimean war , the Journal contains no allusion to his new friend ; and when he came over again in
1859	DATE	, and went with
Thoreau to New Bedford	ORGANIZATION	to call on his friend
Ricketson	PERSON	, there is a very slight allusion to
Cholmondeley	ORGANIZATION	in the Journal .

		In the same way , when
John Brown	PERSON	of
Kansas	LOCATION	was introduced to Thoreau in
1857	DATE	, dined with him , and made a vivid impression , so that his con - versation was recalled in the Journal two and a half years afterward , there is no mention of
Brown	PERSON	in the entries of
1857	DATE	.

		Nor is Whit - man much mentioned in the Journal of
1856	DATE	, when
Thoreau	PERSON	first met him and described him in a letter to
Blake	PERSON	.

		His letters are often sub - stitutes for the Journal entries , and sometimes are copied from the Journal , as was
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's habit occasionally .

		Thoreau 's use of his Journals , which he be - gan to keep regularly about
1838	DATE	, was original , like everything about him .

		He used them to make magazine articles and books from ; and then he destroyed them , reserving such pages or fragments as he had not used , and preserving these scraps all his life , often using them years afterward in essays .

		In the latter case he did not destroy them , so that those who have bought his
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		of late years may often find the scraps and pages among them which long since came out in some of his posthumous books .

		In the same way it has happened that the publishers of these fourteen volumes lack original pages of the Journal , enough perhaps to make a small volume ; they have been sold , and most of them are in the possession of Mr.
W. K. Bixby	PERSON	of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, who has allowed the
Bibliophile Society of Boston	ORGANIZATION	to print them in their two volumes called '' The First and Last Journeys of Thoreau . ''

		Other Journal pages remain im - printed , but may come out hereafter in connec - tion with reprints of '' Walden '' or '' A Yankee in
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		There are also many verses that have not been brought into any collection , some of them in the Journals , and others in loose leaves , or written on the back of lecture sheets or pages from some destroyed journal .

		But it is time to quote from these rich and unusual transcripts of the meditations and ob - servations of a man of genius .


September 19 , 1854	DATE	, he writes : '' Thinking this afternoon of the prospect of my writ - ing lectiu'es and going abroad to read them the next
winter	DATE	, I realized how incomparably great the advan - tages of obscurity and poverty which I have enjoyed so long -LRB- and may perhaps still enjoy -RRB- .

		I thought with what more than princely , with what poetic leisure I had spent my years hitherto , without care or engagement , fancy-free .

		I have given myself up to Nature : I have lived so many springs and summers , autumns and win - ters as if I had nothing to do but live them , and imbibe whatever nutriment they had for me .

		I have spent a couple of years , for instance , with the flowers chiefly , having none other so binding engagement as to observe when they opened ; I could afford to spend the whole Fall observing the changing tints of the foliage .

		Ah J how I have thriven on solitude and poverty !

		I can not overstate this advantage .

		I do not see how I could have enjoyed it , if the public had been expecting as much of me as there is danger now that they wUl .

		If I go abroad lecturing , how shall I ever recover the lost winter ?

		It has been my vacation , my season of growth and expansion , -- a prolonged youth . ''

		This was said in consequence of the good recep - tion given to ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' then just published , and bringing him invitations to lecture here and there , even as far away as
Nantucket	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		But he was not a `` taking '' speaker ; his lectures were best heard by a small company in a parlor ; the miscellaneous audi - ence of a public hall went away unimpressed .

		He was presently left as uninvited as before ,
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 109 except in
Concord	LOCATION	,
Worcester	LOCATION	, and
Plymouth	LOCATION	, where he had admiring friends .

		In contrast with the above passage , take this concerning one of his rather disreputable friends ,
G. M.	PERSON	, who had skill in boating , fishing , and hunting , but neglected the domestic duties .

		There were several such in his list of ac - quaintance : '' He follows hunting , praise be to him !

		as regularly in our tame fields as the farmers follow farming .

		Per - sistent Genius !

		how I respect it and thank him for it !

		I trust the Lord will provide us with another
G. M.	PERSON	when he is gone .

		How good in him to follow his own bent , and not continue at the Sabbath-school all his days !

		What a wealth he thus becomes in the neighbor - hood !

		Few know how to take the census .

		I thank my stars for M. I think of him with gratitude when I am going to sleep , grateful that he exists , -- that M. who is such a trial to his mother .

		Yet he is agreeable to me as a tinge of russet on the hillside .

		I would fain give thanks morning and evening for my blessings .

		Awk - ward , gawky , loose-hung , dragging his legs after him , -- he is my contemporary and neighbor .

		He is one tribe , I am another , and we are not at war . ''

		Thoreau had , however , more intimate friends than these , whose class Channing hit off in his '' Near Home '' -- grateful he says , -- '' The while our fisher dreams , or greasy gunner Lank , with ebon locks , shies o'er the fences , And cracks down the birds , -- game-law forgot ; And still , upon the outskirts of the town , A tawny tribe denudes the cranberry-bed . ''

		Thoreau 's best and longest friends were Chan - ning and
Emerson	LOCATION	, -- the latter the earlier , but not finally the more intimate , and at one time -LRB- in
1857	DATE	-RRB- regarded with pathetic aversion , as having broken the abiding tie of friendship by his lofty manners .

		The passage referring to this was surprising when Mr.
Blake	PERSON	printed it , some ten years ago ; and here it is again in parts , alluding unmistakably to
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		The date is
February , 1857	DATE	. ''

		And now another friendship is ended .

		I do not know what has made my friend doubt me , -- but I know that in love there is no mistake , and that every estrangement is well fomided .

		What a grand signifi - cance the word * never ' acquires !

		I am perfectly sad at parting from you .

		I could better have the earth taken away from under my feet than the thought of you from my mind .

		... A man can not be said to suc - ceed in this life who does not satisfy one friend .

		... I say in my thought to my neighbor who was once my friend , ' It is of no use to speak the truth to you ; you will not hear it .

		What , then , shall I say to you ? '

		... You cheat me , you keep me at a distance with your manners .

		I know of no other dishonesty , no other devil .

		Why this doubleness , these compliments ?

		They are the worst of lies .

		A lie is not worse between traders than a compliment between friends .

		Lying , on lower levels , is but a trivial offense compared with civility and compli - ments on the level of Friendship ... Friends !

		they are united for good and for evil .

		They can delight each other as none other can .

		They can distress each other as none other can .

		... I have not yet known a friendship to cease , 1 think .

		I fear I have experienced its decaying .

		Morning , noon , and night , I suffer a physical pain , an aching of the breast , which unfits me for my tasks .

		It is perhaps most intense at evening .

		That aching of the breast , -- the grandest pain that man endures , which no other can assuage .

		... If I should make the least concession , my friend would spurn me .

		I am obeying liis law as well as my own .

		... At the instant that I seem to be saying farewell to my friend , I find myself unexpectedly near to him ; and it is our very nearness and dearness to each other that gives depth and signifi - cance to that ' forever . '

		Thus I am a helpless prisoner , and these chains I have no skill to break .

		While I think I have broken one link , I have been forging another . ''

		Naturally , between men so noble , this misimder - standing , which had been growing for months , soon gave way , and the old relations were re - sumed .

		It may have been in that very call made by
Emerson	PERSON	on
Thoreau	PERSON	, the afternoon of
March 13 , 1857	DATE	, when he found
John Brown	PERSON	of
Kansas	LOCATION	talking with
Thoreau	PERSON	-LRB- to whom I had introduced him -RRB- , that the ice was broken ; for we do not find any more of these sad entries in the Journal .

		The occasion for the coldness was , I suppose , the occasional roughness of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's manner , which was usually polite , if odd , met by a cer - tain formality and suavity in
Emerson	LOCATION	's manners that betrayed a long inheritance of etiquette from generations of clergymen .

		Many will read these books for the informa - tion they furnish on a thousand points of natural history ; many for their singular beauty and brevity of description , wherever the common - place was shown to have the elements of wonder and beauty ; many , but fewer , for their phi - losophic or poetic significance ; most of all , perhaps , for their racy humor , by which
New England	LOCATION	life and the rustic or mercantile Amer - ican character is so sympathetically portrayed . '

		But they also have the interest of an autobiog - raphy , and will be read for more light upon one of the most piquant and romantic careers among American scholars and reformers .

		For the full understanding of this part of the copious work , many more notes and explanations are needed than the editors had room to afford even had they the needful knowledge .

		The five and forty years since
Thoreau	PERSON	's death have removed most of his coevals in literatiu-e and life ; and , while they have brought the
Concord	LOCATION	school of au - thors -LRB- among whom may be included , for certain traits , Jones Very ,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, and
John Burroughs	PERSON	-RRB- more into the foreground of our lit - erature , they have deprived the present genera - tion of the best means of judging them , whether as authors or men .

		Hence superficial and ridic - ulous estimates of the men and their work .

		The 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, publication of these Journals will do much to repair this defect , which shows itself most fre - quently in manuals of American literature .

		Much might be said of the good fortune of the publishers in securing for the sympathetic and pictorial illustration of the twenty volumes in this edition of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's writings the services of
H. W. Gleason	PERSON	in photographing the scenes and natural incidents of his surroundings in Con - cord , at
Monadnoc	LOCATION	,
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, and in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		For years before this edition was decided on Mr.
Gleason	PERSON	had been loyally visiting and iden - tifying , with the aid of his excellent camera , the places and conditions mentioned , and had accu - mulated more than two hundred fine photo - graphs .

		From these a hundred were selected to be engraved for this edition .

		Socialistic Principles and Problems .

		* Notwithstanding the amount of attention given to modem socialistic movements , there is a lack of definite knowledge and understanding of the subject on the part of the general public .

		It is with a hope of remedying this condition that Mr.
John Spargo	PERSON	has written his '' Sum - mary and Interpretation of Socialistic Princi - ples , '' giving the essentials of this phase of modern life as it has evolved historically and economically .

		The key-note of the book is the so-called '' materialistic conception of history . ''

		Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	states that '' Socialism , in the modem scientific sense , is a theory of social evolution . ''

		Having pointed out the distinction between the `` Utopian Socialism '' of
Owen	PERSON	, Saint-Simon , and
Fourier	PERSON	, and the '' Scientific Socialism '' of
Marx	PERSON	and
Engels	PERSON	as set forth in the ''
Commu	PERSON	- nist Manifesto , '' he concludes his work by giving a chapter on the Outlines of the
Socialist State	ORGANIZATION	, and adds in an appendix the
National Platform of the Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	, though tolerant of a certain amount of super - vision of private production and exchange , and at the same time less speculative as to the pre - cise form the state of the future will take than were the authors of the '' Manifesto , '' neverthe - less is essentially a '' Marxist , '' and regards as • Socialism .

		He shows himself conversant with current economic thought , and in quoting various theories he carefully credits them to their originators .

		In spite of the brevity of his work -- the result of conciseness rather than of superficiality -- Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	gives a satisfactory general view of his subject , and his book is to be recommended especially as a foundation for a more detailed knowledge to be afterwards acquired .

		Of quite a different character from Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	's work , yet dealing with the same gen - eral subject , are
M. Jean Jaures	PERSON	's '' Studies in Socialism . ''

		Most of the papers making up the volume appeared originally in a Socialist daily paper in
Paris	LOCATION	, from which they have been trans - lated into English by Miss
Mildred Minturn	PERSON	, who has supplied an introduction explaining the significance and prospects of Socialism in
France	LOCATION	as well as
M. Jaures	PERSON	's position there .

		Extremely eloquent and earnest in upholding the Socialist movement ,
M. Jaures	PERSON	is neither a '' Marxist '' nor a '' Revolutionist , '' but be - longs rather to the school of '' Reformists , '' or '' Opportunists . ''

		A follower in many respects of Liebknecht , he denounces the scheme of rev - olution upheld in the '' Manifesto '' as both unnecessary and ineffectual , and holds that it is by '' the methodical and legal organization of its own forces imder the law of the democracy and universal suffrage '' that the proletariat will gain supreme power . ''

		The transformation of all social relations can not be the residt of a manoeuvre . ''

		The principle upon which he most insists is the universality of the Socialist con - ception , urging that under present conditions '' it can succeed only by the general and almost unanimous desire of the commxmity . ''

		A de - cided growth of the proletariat '' in numbers , in solidarity , and in self - consciousness , '' he be - lieves to be inevitable .

		Optimistic yet sane , of strong convictions yet conservative ,
M. Jaures	PERSON	has not laid himself open to the familiar accu - sation that Socialists beg the question , for he has gone to its very roots .

		The beauty of his dic - tion has been well preserved by his translator .

		It requires more than an ordinary amount of mental adjustment to descend from the intel - lectual regions whence
M. Jaures	PERSON	carries his readers to '' A Practical Programme for Work - ingmen , '' published anonymously .

1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 111 of private property and competition on the one hand and the present impracticability of '' orthodox '' Socialism on the other , he makes an amazing suggestion ,
viz.	LOCATION	, that the `` unwealthy '' classes organize in order to secure a candidate for the next Presidential election , possibly ab - sorbing the Democratic party !

		The '' practical programme '' itself is then discussed , and a na - tionalization and mimicipalization of industries is considered expedient in opening the road to cooperation .

		Of the book as a whole it may be said that a superabundance of rhetoric has somewhat usurped the place of scientific reason - ing , and it can hardly be regarded as a serious contribution to sociology .

		It is to this spectacular array of the unwealthy against the wealthy , more quietly referred to by Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	as the `` class-struggle theory '' and subtly suggested by
M. Jaures	PERSON	in his faith in the power of the proletariat , that Mr.
Robert Flint	PERSON	so strenuously objects in his book on '' Socialism . ''

		The Socialist leaders , he believes , by exaggerating the evils of present conditions and beguiling their followers by futile hopes , have done more harm than good to the work - ingman .

		Written from a non-Socialistic view - point , his book is evidently intended as an antidote to what he believes to be noxious the - ories running riot ; for he states that he proposes to discuss Socialism in a way that will be intelli - gible to workingmen .

		It is a keen , scholarly , comprehensive work , and presents arguments which no Socialist can afford to pass by unchal - lenged .

		It contains , however , one rather serious fault as a present-day document : more than half of it was written fifteen years ago , when the conservative Socialists were less important in their class than they now are .

		Mr.
Flint	PERSON	says : '' It -LSB- Socialism -RSB- is not a system merely of amendment , improvement , reform , -- it dis - tinctly pronounces every system of that sort to be inadequate , and seeks to produce an entire renovation of society . ''

		This statement is hardly applicable to all Socialists to-day , as their pro- gramme in
England	LOCATION	, for instance , bears witness .

		As a criticism of the ideals of
Karl Marx	PERSON	and his followers , Mr.
Flint	PERSON	's work is successful in showing their fallacies and in pointing out the incompatability of Socialism with Democracy .

		In Socialism , he concedes , there is a large amount of good , but '' it does not contain any truth or any good principle which is exclusively its own . ''

		In individualism , he sees many faults , but fewer from an economic as well as ethical standpoint than in any other system yet evolved .

		It is to be noted that the author 's attitude toward Socialism in its relation to religion -- a subject to which he attaches very great importance -- shows the strong influence upon him of the
Established Church of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Flint	PERSON	's own arguments are carefully supplemented by those of Socialistic and of other non-Socialistic writers , making his work comprehensive and comparatively free from prejudice .

		It is a valuable asset , not only to sociologists , but to all readers who are interested in social problems and who are open-minded and intelligent .

		The Greatest of French Dramatists .

		* To judge by the absence of books about Moliere in English , the English-speaking world has been strangely indifferent to the person and life of the greatest of French dramatists , the one whose name is most often linked with that of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Until very recently , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's article in the `` Encyclopaedia Britannica '' was the most substantial biography of Moliere accessible to English readers .

		Ac - counts of the man were few and woefidly inad - equate .

		In English books and periodicals there was very little to bear witness to the eager and fruitful search for all kinds of personal knowl - edge about the great author , manager , and actor , which , from
1867	DATE	to
1890	DATE	, brought to - gether the materials for the two voluminous collections molieresques and kept the monthly magazine le molieriste going for ten years .

		But the last few years have seen encouraging signs of a wider and livelier interest in the great Frenchman .

		The frequency with which
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	is drawn upon to furnish the repertory of our amateur Thespians of the French clubs in our universities may be such a sign in one direction , and the interesting production of '' The Misan - thrope '' by Mr.
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	last year may be one in a different quarter .

		Less im - peachable evidences , however , are seen in the books on Moliere that have appeared .

		Mr.
Leon Vincent	PERSON	, after affording us a little glimpse of the satirist of the affectations and over - refinements of the precieuses in his Hotel de
Rambouillet	LOCATION	, returned to the theme to offer us , in
1902	DATE	, a full-length portrait of Moliere in a slight but weU-inf ormed and readable biography .

Feb. 16	DATE	, pagon , and proved how closely he followed the course of Moliere study and criticism in
France	LOCATION	, gave to the public , in
1905	DATE	, a life of Moliere that for the first time in English put with ful - ness -LRB- perhaps with too great fulness -RRB- within the reach of readers the large mass of detailed fact , of gossip and legend , of more or less plausible conjecture , and of controversy over moot points , that the patient and industrious study of the poet 's life in
France	LOCATION	has accumulated .

		Last year we had the Moliere of Mr.
Marzials	PERSON	in the
Miniature Series of Great Writers	ORGANIZATION	; and last , and in many ways best , we have the
Moliere of Mr. Chatfield-Taylor	ORGANIZATION	.

		In calling his book '' a biography , '' Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	has put the emphasis upon the man rather than upon the works , and he has kept it there pretty consistently throughout .

		This does not mean that he has tried to separate the man from his works , or has at all forgotten or obscured the fact that the main business of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's life was the creation of plays .

		Per - haps he has even failed to make the separation as clear as in fact it was , and has been too ready to see the man and the circiunstances of his life reflected in the works , and to make the works confessions of their author 's dearest hopes and bitterest disappointments .

		He has treated the plays as biographical documents that inter - pret and portray the man .

		Whatever dangers this may have in the case of a dramatic author , -- and especially one like Moliere , whose great gift and habit of observation our biographer rightly dwells upon , and whose art is so largely objective , -- it has the advantage of keeping us in the region of biography rather than of lit - erary criticism .

		It is the man that we keep all the time in view .

		This story of Moliere the man , in his mani - fold relations as player , manager , author , court - ier , lover , husband , friend , of this career so crowded with activity , so full of worthy accom - plishment , so absorbed in the pursuit and cap - tiire of the comic and so touched with profound and tragic pathos , Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	has told on the whole very well , -- more adequately than Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	and Mr.
Marzials	PERSON	, more clearly and engagingly than Mr.
Trollope	PERSON	.

		There was no need of the words of Professor
Crane	PERSON	, in the Introduction that he contributes to the book , to assure us that the author has long been a devoted student of Moliere .

		He shows himseK familiar with the large mass of special Moliere literature -LRB- at least that in French ; the neglect of the Germans is of less consequence here than it generally is -RRB- , and his a
$ Coimt	MONEY	is thoroughly well informed .

		The na - ture of his task , -- which was to trace a clear and life-like portrait of the man for the larger public of readers , and not to make a complete collection of material for the special student , -- forbade hmi to burden his pages with a con - siderable apparatus of dociunentary evidence or to enter into the minute details of the questions in dispute , as Mr.
Trollope	PERSON	has done ; yet nothing essential has been overlooked , and the student will find in the book the main evidence on aU controverted matters , and the views and argu - ments of the opposing advocates .

		The conclusions that Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	has reached in these debated questions will mainly commend themselves as sound .

		They are generally the ones most favorable to our good opinion of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		We can only approve the biographer 's wish to believe the best of his hero , and we agree that in
Moliere	LOCATION	's case this wish is for the most part justified .

		There has been altogether too much of a ten - dency among his compatriots to admit a sub - stantial basis of truth for the malicious gossip and downright slander of unfriendly tongues .

		It is quite improbable that the critic of society who reveals such moral earnestness in the plays should have so flagrantly outraged the sense of common decency as some of his biographers charge him with doing .

		We may safely agree that '' his philosophy was certainly too pure , his ideals too exalted , for him to have been the vile man his enemies and unwitting friends portray . ''

		We wonder , however , whether this consideration has not been pressed too far in the discussion of the great crux of Moliere biography , -- the question of the parentage of
Armande Bejart	PERSON	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's wife .

		It is rather overstating the case to say , as the author does in summing up : '' If
Armande	PERSON	was not
Marie Herve	PERSON	's daughter , then
Moliere	PERSON	, his wife , and all her family , must be classed together as forgers ; and he , the greatest literary genius in
France	LOCATION	, the friend of the
King	PERSON	, be accused either of the most abject of crimes , or of an utter dis - regard of common decency . ''

		But just what is '' common decency '' ?

		Is it defined in identi - cal terms in
America	LOCATION	and in
France	LOCATION	-- and in
Bohemia	LOCATION	?

		In deciding whether
Armande Bejart	PERSON	was the daughter or sister of
Madeleine	LOCATION	, it is possible to suspect that the Anglo-Saxon is not so likely as the Frenchman to divine the truth that lies behind the tangle of conceal - ment and falsehood which that fascinating yoimg woman seemed from her birth destined to pro- voke .

		Demonstration is here impossible .

		One
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 is left to a balancing of probabilities , and into this many subjective elements are likely to enter .

		We wish to believe that which is most favorable to
Molifere	ORGANIZATION	's moral elevation and delicacy of feeling .

		Here is where the French critics have the advantage of us ; and the fact that the ma - jority of them incline to the opinion opposite to that upheld by Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	must make us think that they would not concur in his statement of the alternative .

		Has not
M. Maurice Donnay	PERSON	recently , in V Autre danger , condoned after a fashion the offense against delicacy of feeling that is here in question ?

		And will delicacy of feeling protect Alceste against the witchery of Gelimfene , when all his philo - sophy and good common sense are powerless to do so ?

		But however we may judge in this matter , it is comforting to have to do with a biographer who is so loth to believe evil , who renders such substantial justice to Madeleine Be j art , and who finds good things to say even of the incorrigible coquette Armande .

		In one respect our author 's commendable effort for clearness has had an unfortunate con - sequence .

		We question whether , in presenting the plays in groups rather than in the order of their production , he has not confused a little the outlines of his story and given a somewhat wrong idea of the relation of the various groups to one another .

		In spite of the accompanying dates , it is hard to avoid the impression that the various groups mean different periods in
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's dra - matic career .

		This impression is distinctly given when the '' histrionic plays '' are referred to the last years of his life , '' the period when
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, worldly wise , experienced as a manager , and less zealous as a crusader , was content to write plays to fill the coffers of his theater . ''

		But the truth is that in the years here included ,
1668	DATE	to
1773	DATE	, we have the same kind of plays as he had been producing ever since his talent had appeared in its maturity , with VEcole des maris .

		There was the comedy with accompaniment of music and dancing which he was bound to provide as pur - veyor of amusements to his royal patron ; there was the play that appealed primarily to the comic sense and the source of laughter ; there was the serious comedy of satire , whether of local or uni - versal weaknesses ; and there was the play that united in various proportions the characteristics of aU three .

		One can not see that the plays of these five years show a very marked difference from those of the previous seven .

		An experienced di - rector he had been since his return to
Paris	LOCATION	; his millitant zeal , against the doctors at least , showed no abatement in his very last comedy .

		His va - rious types of comedy were first and last dictated by his circumstances and his ideals , which re - mained constant .

		Moliere was director of a com - pany , and as such was bound to provide for its financial maintenance , which meant attracting the great public to his theatre .

		He was , like everyone else , a servant of the
King	PERSON	's pleasures , and was bound to furnish the kind of entertain - ment that his master called for .

		But he was also primarily and always a dramatist , holding firmly to ideals of dramatic art of great intellectual and moral elevation , and pursuing their realization .

		He was never , last nor first , content to write plays merely to fill the coffers of his theatre .

		The fact that he found it possible so often to pursue the realization of these ideals to the successful end without endangering the material prosperity of his theatre has a corollary that the bio - grapher of Molifere might well point out .

		It testifies in no uncertain way to the quality of the great public on whose support the theatre depended .

		When we reflect what large de - mands '' The Misanthrope '' puts upon the intel - ligence of the listener , how completely absent are all the spectacular features that count for so much with us , as well as everything that savors of the horse-play of low comedy , how single and unsupported is its intellectual appeal , we must wonder how many American cities would furnish it as long a run as it had on its first appearance .

		Great as was
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's gen - ius , his achievement was made possible by the high intellectual interests of the society around him .

		But one may challenge Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	's presentation of his materials in these and other points , and still assert that his book is the best that we have so far in English for the general reader who wishes to know the life and work of the master of comedy .

		May the number of such increase .

		The book is mechanically satisfying , -- only we should be glad to exchange the ten original illustrations for as many reproductions of por - traits of Moliere , or of old drawings of his theatre and of dramatic representations of the * ™ e -

		114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Briefs on ISTeav Books .

		A summary of ^ he fifth and concluding volume of contemporary Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	's `` History of English history .

		Modern England '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- cov - ers the period from
1885	DATE	to
1895	DATE	, and treats pri - marily of
Ireland	LOCATION	, the two Home Rule Bills , the fall of
Parnell	ORGANIZATION	, and of Church affairs .

		When the first volimie appeared there was an inclination to believe , from his treatment of free-trade questions , that the author had in mind a polemical history that should have an influence on the present-day agitation for a return to some sort of a protective system in En - gland .

		But this idea was a mistaken one ; and it is now evident that Mr.
Paul	PERSON	, though inevitably some - what biased by his career as a Liberal politician and by his present position as a Liberal journalist , has merely sought to present a readable chronological history of the last fifty years in
England	LOCATION	.

		In this it may be said that he has succeeded , if one be not too critical of what a `` history '' demands .

		Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's work is , in brief , a readable journalistic en - terprise , sufficiently accurate in details , but lacking in study , in erudition , and in thought , and largely deficient in all save avowed political information .

		His sources are simply a few important biographies like that of Gladstone by Mr.
Morley	PERSON	, and the de - bates in
Parliament	LOCATION	.

		In the present volume there is a note of haste as of one pushing eagerly for - `` ward toward the end of a task that has grown irk - some ; but even here there is attraction for the reader , arising from the author 's gift in terse and striking , if not convincing , characterization .

		Esti - mated as history in its best form , Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's work has no great value ; but regarded as a rapid sum - mary of political events and questions , written in a readable style and conveniently arranged for refer - ence , it certainly merits commendation .

		And in one particular the author has added to American understanding of English contemporary history , -- for in this volume , as in the preceding ones , he emphasizes and makes clear the great political significance of , the Church of
England	LOCATION	, the ques - tions that concern it , and its continued importance as a political storm centre .

		Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	^ s Among the many interpretations of interpretation of
Lord Randolph Churchill	ORGANIZATION	that have
Lord Churchill	PERSON	, appeared since the publication of the notable biogi'aphy of him by his son , Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	, that now presented by
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is especially valuable for its candid tone and its critical judgment .

		Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	was a po - litical opponent and yet a close personal friend of
Lord Cliurchill	PERSON	, and shortly after the latter 's death he was asked by
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's mother to write some estimate of her son 's career .

		Until now he has refused to do this ; but with the appearance of the former biography Lord Rosebery feels more free to give voice to his own impressions .

		His book is in reality an essay , to be read easily in an hour or so .

		The historical back - ground is very briefly sketched , -- so briefly , in fact , that to one who has not read the more formal biog - raphy much wUl be unintelligible ; so that the main interest lies in a comparison of the characteristics and abilities here state 'd with those emphasized by the former biographer .

		Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	brings out , what is not clearly indicated in the eai-lier work , the love - ableness of
Lord Churchill	PERSON	when among his friends ; the nimbleness of mind and quickness of wit that made him an enjoyable companion ; and also the dog - matic self-assertion and self-confidence in political matters that ultimately wrecked his career .

		There is entire agreement between the two authors , that
Churchill	PERSON	was one of the cleverest political tacticians and one of the best political fighters that
England	LOCATION	has produced in the
last half	DATE	- century .

		But of his real statesmanship
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	is not so sure , -- by in - ference at least leaving the impression that
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's statesmanship had not yet developed , and that by un - fortunately forcing a quarrel with his chief he lost forever the chance to make manifest his higher qual - ities .

		In effect , the present author affirms that states - manlike qualities of a high order probably existed in
Lord Churchill	LOCATION	, but had not time to ripen ; and here , as elsewhere in the essay , the seemingly adverse judg - ment is expressed with affection , almost with regret .

		Students of modern English history , especially those who have read Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's biogi'aphy of his father , will certainly find pleasure and profit in a perusal of this discriminating essay .

		^ ^ e final step was taken toward put - ting an end to an intolerable condition in theatrical affairs that had existed ever since

		Dr.
Watson Nicholson	PERSON	in his '' Struggle for a Free Stage in
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- gives an excellent detailed account of the conflict between the patentees , the successors of D'Avenant and
Killigrew	PERSON	, and their opponents , a conflict waged with varying success for nearly two hundred years .

		Up to 1720 the sovereigns felt free to interfere as they chose with the old patents , and to grant new ones .

		The prerogative of the Crown was unchecked , and the
Lord Chamberlain	PERSON	had matters wholly in his own hands .

		Exclusive privileges in theatrical affairs ceased to be , and the power of the sovereign sank into abeyance from lack of exercise .

		As a consequence , unlicensed theatres sprang up , and , until they proceeded to attack the government and offend public morals , were let alone .

		Their scurri - lous performances , however , led to the Licensing Act of
1737	DATE	, which recognized only the patent houses and destroyed all competition .

		Dm-ing the
next half century	DATE	the monopoly was absolute , more so than at any previous period of its history .

		By the close of the eighteenth century , however , certain minor theatres arose under Parliamentary authority to give musical performances and the like , but not to present the legitimate national drama .

		these theatres had become so important , the patent theatres having meanwhUe sunk to the level of the minors , that it was only a question of proper legis - lation to wipe away all distinctions .

		This came in the Theatre Regulation Bill above referred to .

		The history is by no means an uninteresting one , and is not without its parallels to-day .

		Professor
William H. Schofield	PERSON	's `` English Literature from the Nor - man Conquest to Chaucer '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- purports to fill a gap in a series projected
several years ago	DATE	, which covered the later periods of our literary history with three volumes , the work of Messrs. GU -RRB- sse and
Saintsbury	LOCATION	.

		The series as planned was to make four volumes , and the history of pre-Elizabethan times was to be done by Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	.

		But when Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	set to work he adopted a much more comprehensive scale than his predecessors , and when his volume appeared it was found to come down only to the
Norman Con	ORGANIZATION	- quest .

		The gap thus left has remained for a long time , and Mr.
Schofield	PERSON	has now undertaken to close it up .

		Since the volume he now publishes -LRB- although a large one -RRB- fills only a part of the vacant space , leaving the age of Chaucer still unaccounted for , it is evident that he has gone into even greater detail than his predecessor , and that the entire six-volume history , when completed by the addition of the
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	volume , will constitute an extremely ill - balanced work .

		This is to say nothing in dispraise of any single section of it , and of the section now published we can speak only words of commenda - tion .

		It offers an exceptionally thorough treatment of its period , done in the light of a scholarly tradi - tion that runs from
Gaston Paris	LOCATION	to Child , and from
Child to Professors Kittredge	ORGANIZATION	and
Norton	PERSON	.


Essen	LOCATION	- tial features of Mr.
Schofield	PERSON	's method are the inclusion of all works written in mediaeval
England	LOCATION	in whatever language , the grouping of works of allied character , and the large use made of the com - parative method .

		The volume has a bibliographical appendix of great value .

		It is rather a collection of anecdote and gossip about him , his friends , sitters , and acquaintances ; and is thus an entertaining centre-table book , as it could not help being when it serves up so many interesting things about the leading characters that made the golden age of
England	LOCATION	's drama , literature , and art .

		It is true that we learn nothing about these people that we have not known before , and it may be true also that there is nothing new to be learned about them .

		Mr.
MoUoy	PERSON	has re-told the old stories fairly well , and produced the sort of book that very many people like to read .

		The lack of an index is a serious disadvantage .

		The most ' ^ ^ ® most majestic of all the ancient majestic of oriental poetry is that left us by the all poetry .

		Hebrews ; and the choicest of it is that found in the Psalms .

		These lyric productions have held their place undisputedly at the head of all religious poetry .

		Their universal character and their popularity among all religious bodies of Bib - lical believers have led scores of scholars to produce commentaries and other treatises for their better understanding .

		The latest and most complete treat - ment is '' The International Critical Commentary on the Psalms '' -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Professor
Charles A. Briggs	PERSON	of
Union Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		This work is encyclopaedic in character .

		It goes thoroughly into a discussion of the text , the higher criticism , the canonicity , and the interpretation of the Psalms .

		The Introduction , covering 110 pages , is the fullest treatment we have seen on all the questions that concern a critical study of the Psalter .

		Particularly noticeable is Professor
Briggs	PERSON	's theory of Hebrew poetry .

		For a score of years he has advocated a regular metrical form that has continually gained favor with Hebrew scholars all over the world .

		This theory is applied with great care in this commentary .

		Professor
Briggs	PERSON	follows up the minutiae of every word and point in such a manner as to convince the reader that his work is exhaustive .

		Another thing that strikes the mind of the reader forcibly is the absolute certainty with which he assigns the com - position of the Psalms to different periods of history .

		In the commentary proper the author 's strength is shown , in the main , in his treatment of the theo - logical questions that arise in the individual Psalms .

		On this point , rather than on the date or linguistic phases , this commentary is of especial value to scho - lars , for of course it is a book preeminently for them .

		The authors D ^ ;
Frederick Riedl	PERSON	of
Budapest	LOCATION	has a7id literature written '' A History of Hungarian of
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		Literature '' for the series of books called '' Literatures of the World , '' published by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	, and now numbering upwards of a dozen volumes .

		The writing of the book was commissioned by the Hungarian Academy for the 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, - express purpose of filling a gap in the series , and representing the national literature of the Magyar by a thoroughly authoritative treatise . ''

		The book is unique in its kind in that it has been wi-itten entirely for the English public , and has never ap - peared in Hungarian ; indeed , no such work exists in
Hungary	LOCATION	, and it will be as new to the Hungarian public as it is to the English . ''

		The translation of the prose text is the work of Mr. and Mrs.
C. A. Ginever	PERSON	-LRB- the latter a daughter of the Hungarian poet GjOry -RRB- , and the interspersed poetical illustra - tions are mainly the work of Mr.
G. Hagberg Wright	PERSON	, upon whose initiative the book was under - taken .

		Upon examination , it proves to be an ex - tremely readable volume , exhibiting scholarship without pedantry , and resisting the temptation to dwell at too gi-eat length upon the formative period of the literature .

		After eighty pages , or thereabouts , we get down to the nineteenth century , which gives ample space for an adequate account of the really significant modern poets , dramatists , and novelists .

		We extract one amusing bit about the poet Csokonai .

		After his death -LRB- 1805 -RRB- , the inscription '' I too have been in
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' was suggested for his tombstone . ''

		The poet 's fellow-townsmen , the worthy matter - of-fact burgesses of Debreczen , did not know what it meant .

		They looked up the name
Arcadia	LOCATION	in
Barth	LOCATION	^ lemy 's ' Le
Jeune Anacharsis	PERSON	, ' and there dis - covered the following statement : ' In
Arcadia	LOCATION	there were excellent fields for the rearing of domestic ani - mals , especially asses . '

		They felt hurt , and the ensuing controversy would have furnished a suitable theme for Csokonai 's muse . ''

		Belated admirers of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now that
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is dead , and has con - sequently '' arrived , '' it is curious to note the rush of the critics , profes - sional and amateur , to the discussion of his work .

		The former kind of critic , after ignoring the dram - atist during all the years of his struggle and his slowly-ripening triumph , now seems to be saying : '' This man was really of considerable importance , and it is my professional duty to the public to appraise him . ''

		The recent essays of Professor
Dowden	PERSON	and Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	are cases in point .

		They have '' gotten up '' their subject too hm-riedly to have anything particularly weighty to say about it , but their manner is impressive , and we may credit them with the discharge of an obligation imposed by the sense of their own importance as mediators between poet and public .

		To the amateur critic , Ibsen offers , not so much the chance of performing a public duty as the chance of attracting attention by exploiting a subject of special timeliness .

		He affords a fine corpse in which to flesh their bright new surgical instruments .

		Mr.
Haldane MacFall	PERSON	, who has just published a book on Ibsen -LRB-
San Francisco	LOCATION	:
Morgan Shepard	PERSON	-RRB- , is a typical example of this sort of critic .

		His method is very simple .

		He takes the plays and the letters of the dramatist , and has at hand a few standard books -LRB-
Jaeger	PERSON	,
Brandes	PERSON	,
Gosse	PERSON	,
Archer	PERSON	, Boyesen -RRB- ; with these ma - terials he concocts a running narrative , composed of the plots of the plays and the incidents of the biography .

		His individual contribution is a jerky emotional commentary , which makes a brave pre - tense of being impressive , but exhibits no particular insight or sense of perspective .

		The one really original thing Mr.
MacFall	PERSON	does is to give
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's great contemporary -LRB- whom he mentions repeatedly -RRB- the weird name of ''
Byornsterne Byornsen	PERSON	. ''

		This amazing exhibition of bad taste -LRB- for we can not char - itably ascribe it to ignorance -RRB- needs no comment .

		Some brilliant ^ -RCB- ^ ^ readable sketches of five brU - and eccentric liant and eccentric ladies , cleverly court ladies .

		translated from the French of
M. Arvede Barine	PERSON	, are published in a handsome volume entitled '' Princesses and Court Ladies '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The title is inclusive enough to make room for
Marie Mancini	PERSON	,
Christina	PERSON	of
Sweden	LOCATION	, the Duchess of
Maine	LOCATION	, the Margravine of
Bayreuth	LOCATION	, and an Arab princess who left her father 's harem and gave up her title to become plain
Frau Reute	PERSON	, wife of a German merchant , -- and always regretted it .


M. Barine	PERSON	is already known to English readers through two volumes about another princess , la
Grande Mademoiselle	ORGANIZATION	.

		He writes in a popular style that does not obtrude its background of scholarship , but nevertheless depends upon it to avoid any suspicion of cheapness or superficiality .

		He presents mooted issues , but does not discuss them , aiming to cast verified facts into picturesque and dramatic form rather than to propound new theories .

		He has the Gallic eye for type , with evidently a keen interest in the particular one that he chooses to delineate .

		All his fine ladies have much in common : a brilliant but unbalanced mind , a violent temper , superb ego - tism , an irresponsible child-like zest for pleasure , and a freakish love of romance , which , coupled with their other qualities , often leads to wild extrava - gances and strange adventures .

		`` That there has been an awakening of the American people during the opening years of the twentieth century is now an accepted fact , '' says Mr.
Allen	PERSON	; and he might have added that it was certainly time for one .

		This awakening , he thinks , '' has manifested itself in two main forms , the warfare against political bosses and the warfare against specially privileged corporations .

		And yet the story of the great move - ment for political and business honesty can not be told in the mere list of rascals jailed and new officials elected .

		Above and beyond these concrete achieve - ments , there has been a bracing of the moral sense of the country that is none the less real because it can not be accurately measured . ''

		The book is an attempt to measure the extent and reality of this moral bracing , through personal studies of the lives and political careers of the men who most aided it ,

		HEKRY W. SAVAGE OFFERS
Raymond Hitchcock	PERSON	IN A NEW COMIC OPERA A Yankee Tourist Shakespeare '' There is an easy answer now to the question often put to every student of the stage , ` What is the best edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	for a reader of moderate means who has not much room for books ? '

		This new edition by Professor
Neilson	PERSON	is easily the best single-volume edition that has yet been published .

		It is the best not merely because its editor has wide learning , sound judgment , and fine taste , but also and chiefly because it takes a step in advance in that it gives us the text of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , distinguishing sharply between the real text as we find it in the quartos and in the first folio , and the false text , with its misleading and arbi - trary indication of changes of scene and of scenery which have been foisted in by later editors ignorant of the conditions of the Elizabethan stage .

Feb 16	DATE	, The Magazine Reader 's Friend JN each monthly issue of What 's in the Magazines the contents , for the same month , of nearly one hundred leading peri - odicals are classified , indexed , described , and commented upon , -- all in the simplest and most convenient way imaginable .

		It makes accessible to the busy every-day reader the entire mass of current periodical literature as it appears .

		Each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the magazines of the month , that will give one in five minutes the information hitherto to be obtained only by long and tedious examination of contents-pages on the news-stands .

		It is a periodical that brings the other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so must prove indispensable to everyone who would keep in touch with current affairs .

		A labor and time saving device that promises to attain an almost universal popularity .

		The multiplication of worthy periodicals within the past few years has meant a serious embarassment to those who try to keep in touch with current literature , and despair was heretofore the portion of the man who disliked to miss articles of value wherever produced .

		As a handy guide to the things one needs or desires , What 's in the Magazines is a veritable path through the forest .

		--
Brooklyn Daily Eagle	ORGANIZATION	.

		The value of such a convenient and reliable guide to the magazine literature of the country will b ^ rapidly appreciated by the student , the teacher , the specialist in any field of research , the general reader and the man of affairs .

		It is a publication that will admirably supplement ' ^
Poole	PERSON	's Index '' and the '' Guide to Periodical Literature . ''

		--
Detroit Evening News	ORGANIZATION	.

		So great is the reliance placed upon What * s in the Magazines that the bu ^ y man and woman wonders how in the past he did without this valuable little periodical that comes each month and places the contents of the high-class magazines in easy access to the reader .

		It is not .

		however , a mere list of contents , nor a complicated index , but each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the maga - zine contents of the month .

		Its valus to busy men and women is incalculable .

		NOTES 149 LIST OF NEW BOOKS .150 A THEATR ICAL AUTOPSY .

		After a fitful existence of four months , the
New Theatre of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has closed its doors , and the playhouse which has been the scene of its praiseworthy enterprise has fallen into the hands of the
Philistines	LOCATION	, to become the resort of those for whom dramatic art means no more than vapid or vulgar entertainment .

		The ex - periment thus brought to an untimely end has cost its promoters upwards of fifty thousand dollars , besides other sacrifices that can not be measured in monetary terms .

		It was an illus - tration of honorable endeavor in a deserving - cause ; and if that cause seem lost for the time being , the outcome must be attributed to mis - taken means and methods rather than to any inherent defect in the actuating motive .

		The enterprise was prompted by a fine sense of pub - lic spirit , and an unselfish desire to contribute toward the redemption of our stage from its present low estate ; those who were responsible for it , and who have seen their hopes rudely shattered , have at least the poet 's consoling thought , '' Not failure , but low aim , is crime , '' to cheer them in the retrospect .

		Readers of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	know how persistently it has always stood for the higher ideal of the drama , both as literature , and , in its stage - production , as an ethical agency .

		The aims of the New Theatre were so clearly in the right direction , and its purpose so consonant with what we have urged for so many years , that we should not be misunderstood if , in analyzing the present case , we may seem to speak with something like severity of the way in which the enterprise has been conducted .

		All the way from start to finish , there were such evidences of mismanagement , such an obvious lack of intelligent direction , that failure was almost a foregone conclusion with the impartial outside observer .

		It is best not to mince matters in dealing with this subject , because the experi - ment which has now failed is going to be tried over again -- perhaps many times , -- and is eventually going to prove successful .

		And the best way to hasten its success must be to under - 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, stand the causes of the previous failure , in order to avoid their repetition .

		To begin with , there was an element of un - due haste in the starting of the New Theatre .

		Eagerness to be first in the field -LRB- of which more anon -RRB- was responsible for a lack of the neces - sary deliberation , and for putting into effect a plan that had not been carefully matured .

		This haste was manifested in the choice of both busi - ness manager and dramatic director .

		In both cases the selection made was unfortimate , although for different reasons .

		The business manager was too practical , and the dramatic director was not practical enough .

		The associa - tions of the former were entirely with theatrical affairs of the type to which the New Theatre sought to stand in the sharpest possible con - trast , which made his sympathetic furtherance of its aims weU-nigh impossible .

		The latter was a gentleman of remarkable knowledge and technical equipment , who nevertheless failed in comprehension of the immediate problem pro- vided for his solution .

		He offered the best of reasons for the things he did , but they often proved to be the wrong things in spite of their intellectual defence .

		And the men who stood back of these two executive figures constituted an ill-assorted body .

		Their intentions were of the best , but their ideas were illustrative either of an innocent helplessness or of an excess of the academic spirit , which meant confusion of counsel and the inability to define their means as definitely as their idtimate purpose was de - fined .

		There was thus inherent in its organiza - tion such a lack of harmonious coordination among its parts that the enterprise was fore - doomed , if not to absolute failure , at least to a difficidt course and the making of a blurred impression upon the public .

		Now the public has to be taken into account very seriously in such an experiment as this ; but the new venture was so untactfully heralded as to alienate the public at the outset , and to make it feel , all the time the experiment was in progress , that its cooperation was not partic - idarly desired .

		The idea got abroad that the new playhouse was the resort of a coterie , that it was a '' society '' affair , that visitors would feel uncomfortable unless they wore evening clothes and diamonds .

		Its sponsors were largely of a class better known for the possession of worldly goods than for other qualities , and their names were advertised much more extensively than the names of the performers .

		They seemed to think that the sanction of their presence was all that was needed for success , that the stamp of their approval woidd magnetize the undertaking .

		They made the fatal mistake of establishing a scale of prices that only an extra - ordinary attraction could justify , and the sup - port of the public -- even of that section of the public which had been in a receptive mood -- was forever lost .

		The opening night filled the theatre with a briUiant audience ; the night fol - lowing found it comparatively empty .

		It was an '' endowed '' theatre , so the playbUls said . ''

		Very well , '' replied the public , '' those who have endowed it may keep it for their own play - thing ; it does not interest us , and has no need of our encouragement . ''

		As for the claim of '' endowment , '' it was of course unjustified ; all it really meant was that a sufficient sum of money had been pledged to provide for a part of a single season .

		When the doors of the New Theatre were at last opened for the initial production , there were revealed a prettily-decorated hall , a stage of toy dimensions , and a company of actors most of whom had good records as individuals , but whose collective performance was hopelessly mediocre and even amateurish .

		As for the opening bill , its character was such as to leave fairly aghast all serious sympathizers with the undertaking .

		Instead of selecting some strong and vital play of the sort for which the institu - tion was supposed to exist , the director had patched up a progrannne by taking
Gilbert	PERSON	's '' Engaged , '' mutilating it almost beyond recog - nition , and associating with it two small pieces , one an insignificant trifle from the French , the other a character-sketch by a popular humorist of the day .

		The defence urged for this extra - ordinary hodge-podge was that it enabled every member of the company to have a part in the opening performance .

		We spoke a little while ago of the director 's gift of finding excellent reasons for doing the wrong things ; this is a typical illustration of what we meant .

		Never did a mountain 's labor bring forth a more ridiculous mouse .

		From that moment the fate of the enterprise was sealed .

		During the four months of life for which it was destined , the playhouse conducted a series of opportunist experiments which discovered no trace of unity of purpose .

		A play a fortnight was the ride , which was followed mitil near the end .

		After the unfortunate first fortnight , a really great play --
Senor Echegaray	PERSON	's '' El Gran Galeoto '' -- was produced .

		Now this is exactly the kind of play for which the New
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 131 Theatre was supposed to be created ; had it been boldly given at the start , or any other work of similar rank , the fortunes of the en - terprise might have been vastly different .

		At the worst , its eventual failure would have been dignified , had such a beginning been made and such an ideal been consistently pursued .

		A few good plays were given during the follow - ing months -- such plays as
Herr Fulda	PERSON	's `` Maskerade , ''
Augier	PERSON	's `` Poirier , '' and Heme 's ``
Margaret Fleming	PERSON	'' -- just such plays as should have been given .

		The other productions ranged from the passable through the barely admissible to the wholly inexcusable -- the lowest depth having been reached with a cheap melodrama -LRB- an adaptation of '' The Spoilers '' -RRB- ; which was not '' playing the game , '' although the house was packed for the first and only fortnight during its career .

		Further analysis of the case is unnecessary .

		The mistakes already catalogued are enough to account for the failure many times over .

		It provides one more example of disinterested devotion made futile by hasty effort and faidty judgment .

		The experience has been profitable for correction , and the next enterprise of the kind will know many definite things to avoid , although likely enough to make new mistakes of its own .

		That next enterprise is already much more than a dream .

		It is an effort that has been deliberately nurtured for several years , that has evolved a comprehensive plan covering both the administrative and the artistic aspects of the undertaking , and that is now announced , with considerable show of definiteness , for in - auguration next autumn .

		It has for its respon - sible backing the
Chicago Woman 's Club	ORGANIZATION	, a very large and influential organization with many good works to its credit , that usually accomplishes what it undertakes .

		The plan would probably have been put into practical effect
last year	DATE	, had not the New Theatre cut the wind out of its sails , for its course was charted long before that misadventure was conceived .

		Its friends would not have begrudged the success of the rival enterprise , had that been possible ; but since it has proved impossible , they expect to benefit by the lesson the failure has taught them .

		We are optimistic enough to hope that a year from the present date we may be able to report the proposed Players ' Theatre as an or - ganization in active existence , perhaps not over - prosperous , but at least assured of continuance through the season and through other seasons to follow .

		GIOS U E CAR D UCCI .

		One by one the stars go out in the poetical firma - ment ; with each extinction the night grows more cheerless , and the pilgrim 's track , no longer control - led by its guiding skymark , is made less certain of its goal .

		This modern world of ours is not so rich in poets that it can mark the passing of one of them without a pang , and when the voice that is stilled is one of such authentic utterance as the voice which spoke from the lips of
Carducci	PERSON	, the news brings with it a sense of grievous and irretrievable loss .

		He was one of the great poets of modern times ; with the single exception of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, he was the greatest poet living in the world when the nineteenth century gave place to its successor .

		And now he is dead , after reaching the scriptural limit of man 's years , and the whole world joins in paying reverent tribute to his memory .

		The association of
Carducci	PERSON	's name with that of his great English contemporary -LRB- less than a year his junior -RRB- is more than fortuitous .

		The two poets are linked by their common devotion to the cause of free
Italy	LOCATION	, for the years of their early manhood were those in which that ideal became realized , the years of what
Frederic Myers	PERSON	calls '' the last great struggle where all chivalrous sympathies could range themselves undoubtingly on one side . ''

		And they are also linked by certain fundamental principles common to both , by their hatred of all forms of tyranny , their efforts to bring poetry back to its classical modes of expression , their intimate feeling for nature , the high seriousness of their thought , and the sustained elevation of their poetical flight .

		Giosu ^
Carducci	PERSON	was born in
1836	DATE	, a Tuscan of ancient and distinguished lineage .

		His father was a physician by profession and a Manzonian by intel - lectual affinity , which meant that the romantic spirit , sought to claim the youth for its own .

		But the in - fluence of that spirit , at least in its mediaevalizing and catholicizing aspects , was already far spent in
Italy	LOCATION	, and the boy 's idealism slowly groped its way from
Giusti	PERSON	and
Manzoniback	ORGANIZATION	to
Leopardi	LOCATION	, then to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and then to the Romans , where it took refuge , not , however , in any pedantic or servUe sense , but in the sense that the freedom and sanity of the classical spirit were instinctively felt by the youthful poet , when he came into close contact with them , to be his soul 's own birthright .

		Meanwhile , his country was prepar - ing for its resui ` rection .

		The leaven of
Mazzini	PERSON	's gospel was spiritualizing the life of young
Italy	LOCATION	, and the first shock of the upheaval had come with the great year of revolution , the memorable year of
1848	DATE	, which brought only immediate disaster , yet nevertheless thrilled the whole world with hope .

		It left the boy of twelve an ardent republican , urging upon the petty political leader of his village the duty of raising the war-cry , ' ■ ^ Abasso tutti i re : viva la republica ! ''

		And a republican in spirit he re - mained all his life , serving his country as such in both houses of the legislature , although unwilling 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, to assume the intransigeant attitude of
Mazzini	PERSON	, and accepting the constitutional monarchy of the Re Gal - antuomo as a working compromise in the country 's political progress to its predestined ultimate good .

		His academic career -LRB- for he was a professor more continuously and steadfastly than he was a poet -RRB- hegan at the early age of twenty-three , when he was appointed to the
University of Pisa	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1861	DATE	he entered upon his duties at the
University of Bologna	ORGANIZATION	, which remained the scene of his academic activities for upwards of forty years -- practically the rest of his life .

		There he lectured year after year , im - pressing upon the fortunate youth of new
Italy	LOCATION	the stamp of his rugged and austere personality , incul - cating upon their minds his own hatred of shams and love of truth , his feeling for all that was worthy in the traditions of the race , his devotion to the noblest ideals of art and thought and conduct .

		And there , as he grew gray in the service of his nation , he drew upon himself , by the might of genius , the eyes of
Italy	LOCATION	and the world , until the Italian people came to realize that his modest dwelling in the ancient towered city of
Bologna	LOCATION	housed their greatest man , and united in paying tribute to his fame .

		That fame was , of course , for the world at large , primarily the fame of the poet ; yet those who knew the poet also as teacher and as friend must have felt that theirs was a doubly rich possession , for there is much testimony to indicate that the mortals thus favored were hardly able to tell whether it was for
Carducci	PERSON	the poet or
Carducci	PERSON	the man that they felt the greater reverence .

		And it is well for the millions of his lovers who never saw him in the flesh to be assured that , had they known him in person , or been acquainted with the more intimate aspects of his life , their ideal would have suffered no impairment .

		He was , like our own
Milton and Tennyson	PERSON	, one of the poets who order their lives with '' Close heed Lest , having spent for the work 's sake Six days , the man be left to make . ''

		He once wrote that '' the poet should express him - self and his moral and artistic convictions with all the sincerity , the clearness , the resolution in his power ; the rest is no concern of his . ''

		If we read this passage with a heavy emphasis on the word '' himself , '' it will be an exact statement of the sum of
Carducci	ORGANIZATION	's poetical activity .

		There was certainly no lack of sincerity , clear - ness , or resolution in the famous '' Hymn to Satan , '' the poem which first made him a national figure .

		It was written at a single sitting in
1863	DATE	, and ap - pearing in print
two years later	DATE	was hurled like a bombshell into the camp of reaction and obscurantism . ''

		Salute , o
Satana	LOCATION	, ribellione , O f orza vindice De la ragione ! ''

		Sacri a te salgono Gl ` ineeusi e i voti , Hai vinto il Geova De i sacerdoti . ''

		The note of uncompromising defiance sounded in these closing stanzas found an echo in all ardent and generous soids , and the advance guard of liberal thought throughout
Italy	LOCATION	turned instinctively toward its new leader and rallied about his standard .

		The poet was vilified , of course , misrepresented , and mis - understood .

		He became the storm centre of a fierce conflict which is even yet something more than a memory .

		Time has softened the earlier asperities of that struggle , and now even those who are the poet 's intellectual opponents are willing to recog - nize the sufficiently obvious fact that the hymn is by no means a glorification of evil , but merely the expression of a firm determination to inarch with '' the avenging force of reason '' upon the intrench - ments of superstition .

		The volume of
Carducci	PERSON	's poetry is very con - siderable .

		It includes the `` Rime '' of
1857	DATE	, the ''
Levia Gravia	PERSON	'' of
1867	DATE	, the '' Decennalia , '' '' Nuove Poesie , '' and ''
Giambi	PERSON	ed Epodi '' of the next decade , and the three volumes of '' Odi Barbare '' published from
1877	DATE	to
1889	DATE	.

		These titles represent the landmarks in his poetical career ; but the biblio - graphy of the subject is very complicated , owing to many republications and rearrangements .

		The ''
Odi Barbare	PERSON	, '' which occasioned as much con - troversy -LRB- although in different circles -RRB- as the polit - ical and philosophical poems , represented a highly interesting attempt to write modern Italian verse in classical metres -- alcaics , sapphics , and elegiacs .

		This subject would need a volume for its discussion ; but we may reproduce
Carducci	PERSON	's statement that he called the poems `` barbarous , '' for the reason that '' they would so sound to the ears and judgment of the Greeks and Romans , although I have wished to compose them in the metrical forms belonging to the lyrical poetry of those nations ; and because they will , too truly , so sound to very many Italians , although they are composed and harmonized in Italian verses and accents . ''

		The experiments thus characterized have certainly borne the practical test of public approval ; many of the poems written in these `` barbarous '' measures are among his best - beloved productions .

		The majority of
Carducci	PERSON	's poems have not been translated into English ; many of them it would be unwise to attempt to translate .

		Now and then his English readers have found the temptation irresist - ible , and thus a number of the poems may be read in creditable English versions .

		The best of these versions with which we are acquainted have been made by Mr.
Frank Sewall	PERSON	, Mr.
G. A. Greene	PERSON	, and Mr.
M. W. Arms	PERSON	.

		We regret that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
William Everett	PERSON	did not come down as far as
Carducci	PERSON	in their books on modern Italian poetry .

		There is still an excellent choice remain - ing for the judicious and competent translator .

		And of
Carducci	PERSON	's prose , which is of large volume and great intellectual significance , there is no rea - son why we should not have an adequate English ■ translation .

		THE DIAL 133 CASUAL COMMENT .

		Books and the moral coxsciousness have inter - relations of more kinds than one .

		The acquisition of coveted volumes by methods other than purchase or gift has long been held a venial sin , a mere peccadillo , in fact , that should no more cause prickings of con - science than do similar modes of acquiring umbrellas .

		The open-shelf system now gaining favor with public - library managers and patrons offers extraordinary temptations to book-lovers of an easy conscience .

		The librarian of the
Oakland	LOCATION	-LRB-
Cal	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		Public Library reports
1808	DATE	books missing at the annual inventory -- a sad testimony to the innate depravity of human nature .

		Comfort , however , may be derived from his confidence that these hmidreds of volumes are not all lost to the library , but that most of them will come back with the same informality that marked their exit .

		Yet the least abuse of a valuable privilege is to be deplored .

		Do open shelves breed contempt for the rights of literary property ?

		A return to chained books would perhaps awaken the cidprits to a proper sense of the benefits they now so lightly esteem .

		But there are cheering signs in other quarters that not all book-reading com - munities are so lax in bibliothecal ethics .

		The
Trenton	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library , for example , allows its patrons unparalleled privileges : they have free access to a large selection of books and may take home as many as they wish -- first having them properly charged , of course -- except that in fiction a borrower must solace himself with only one ' work at one time .

		We have , too , the librarian 's personal assurance that this generosity is not abused .

		And this from the state of
New Jersey	LOCATION	, almost from that palace of political iniquity the
New Jersey	LOCATION	state capitol !

		, , .

		Browning in
Seattle	LOCATION	has as queer a sound as `` Cicero in
Maine	LOCATION	, '' the book-title with which Mrs.
Martha Baker Dunn	PERSON	startled her readers two years ago .

		But that the city on Puget Sound is not so Klon - dike-crazy , so Alaska-mad , so exposition-eager , as not to see charms in ''
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	'' and '' The Ring and the Book , '' all may convince themselves by reading , in the
February	DATE	'' Cornhill , '' the interesting article on ''
Brown	PERSON	- ing out West '' which is contributed by Professor
Frederick Morgan Padelford	PERSON	at the instance of Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Padelford	PERSON	's unexpected and highly - gratifying success in conducting a
Browning	PERSON	elective at the state university of
Washington	LOCATION	is agreeably narrated by him .

		Browning , he believes , more than any other English poet , appeals to the American love of strenuous endeavor , to the inquisitive American interest in charac - ter-unravelling , the national aggressiveness , curiosity , bent for psychological analysis , and fondness for so - ciological problems .

		While the English university ideal is culture , and the German university ideal is scholar - ship -LRB- of the Dryasdust brand -RRB- , the writer holds that the American university ideal is public service , the betterment of society .

		The younger generation wishes to become men and women who do things , not who have things ; and these yoimg men and women find their creed worthily formulated in
Browning	LOCATION	, in his philo - sophy of life and his clarion call to spiritual conflict and ultimate spiritual triumph .

		Even his harshness and roughness -LRB- artistically considered -RRB- would seem to work for and not against him ; at any rate they do not rej ^ el his stalwart disciples of the far Northwest as they tend to repel readers in whom the artistic sense predominates .

		The emoluments of authorship have rarely been large , but have always furnished a theme for curious discussion .

		Some statistics recently collected con - cerning the savings of authors show that seven eminent writers , lately deceased , including
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	,
George Gissing	PERSON	, and
William Sharp	PERSON	, left estates that together amounted to about
$ 65,000	MONEY	, or an average of
$ 9,285	MONEY	apiece -- not a prfncely fortime , surely .

		But they have their reward , we must believe , even if it be not in the coin of the realm .

		And of those writers whose works are produced solely with a view to mon - etary returns , we can truly say that '' they have their reward '' also .

		The modern saw that '' to die rich is to die disgraced '' has a measure of truth for others besides ironmasters .

		At any rate , the books that have sold by the hundred thousand copies , and have filled the authors ' pockets , are often not the books to look back upon with unmixed satisfaction .

		... Shakespeare and
Raleigh	LOCATION	are two illustrious Elizabethan names that are again to be associated in the f oi-thcoming life of the bard of Avon for the '' English Men of Letters '' series by Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	.

		Strange enough is it that the greatest name in English literature -- or in all literature , for that matter -- has so long been conspicuous by its absence on this roll of honor , headed , twenty-nine years ago , by
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's life of Johnson '' Is it that some dim sense of the absurdity of calling Shakespeare a `` man of letters '' has hitherto deterred the publishers from adding his name to their list ?

		Or has the difficulty lain in finding a biographer of the exceptional qualities requisite for the task in hand ?

		Except perhaps Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, no one is better fitted to write the projected volume than Professor
Raleigh	LOCATION	.

		Ninety-six novels from the same pen is a remark - able record , but that is the number now credited to ''
John Strange Winter	PERSON	, '' or Mrs.
Stannard	PERSON	, as she is known in the world of fact .

		Other work , too , has come from her busy hand and brain ; and now she confesses that she is '' tired of writing novels , '' but that '' it does not do to be tired of earning one 's living . ''

		She has certainly earned the right to be weary of novel-writing .

		There are those who would be excessively wearied if they had even to read ninety-six novels , not to speak of writing them .

		... Shakespeareana manufactured in
England	LOCATION	for THE American trade are now said to lure the dollars from the pockets of unwary book-collecting American millionaires visiting
England	LOCATION	-- a neat reprisal for our heartless carrying off of so many literary treasures from that country , notably and very recently the Shelley notebooks which our English cousins may well have grieved to lose .

		An ostrich appetite for costly rarities can hardly be attended with an Epicurean nicety and dis - crimination in picking and choosing .

		134 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, Some Famous IjIteraby Apostles .

		* Mrs.
Charles Brookfield	PERSON	, who with her hus - band recently gave us a very pleasant account of `` Mrs.
Brookfield	PERSON	and her Circle , '' has sup - plemented this with another volume of the same readable , literary-gossipy sort , containing still further reminiscences of her father-in-law , Will - iam
Henry Brookfield	PERSON	, and his friends -- chiefly those whose friendship dated back to the '' golden age '' at
Cambridge	LOCATION	and his student days at Trin - ity College .

		The '' Apostles , '' as is well known , were certain bright young men , poetic in tem - perament , speculative , inquiring , and whoUy fearless , who formed an association called the ''
Cambridge Conversazione Society	ORGANIZATION	, '' at whose meetings essays and poems were read , and un - tramelled discussion was carried on concerning all things in heaven and earth , and a few other matters besides .

		Minuses of these meetings were never published , if indeed they were reg - ularly kept ; and whether or not the club was a hot-bed of radicalism , atheism , and worse , was left to the anxious or amused conjecture of university authorities and others .

		Its vigorous prime covered the years 1824-1840 , and it was in this period that , as
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	was observed to contribute the main support of the society , its meetings came to be held in that coUege ; and as its membership was limited to twelve , it ac - quired the jocose nickname of '' Apostles . ''

		Of those who were members of the society in its golden prime , Mrs.
Brookfield	LOCATION	gives sketches and letters and traditions of thirteen , her father - in-law -LRB- who , however , another authority de - clares , was not a member at all -RRB- claiming first place and having more space accorded him than anyone else .

		A bright light he undoubtedly was , being a popular preacher , a wit whose presence enlivened any company , a Shakespearean reader hardly excelled by the Kembles , father or daugh - ter , and a thoroughly good-hearted , high-minded , pleasant-tempered gentleman .

		But the distinc - tive quality of his wit seems to have been untrans - ferable to the printed page : we are repeatedly assured of its delicate and delectable flavor , but somehow never quite succeed in getting a tooth - some morsel into our mouth .

		Other men 's good things , which he was fond of repeating , are offered us in some abundance , and these help one to judge of his taste in such matters .

		example , concerning an estimable man who was said to be of exemplary modesty , someone ventured to ask , '' What has he done to be modest of ? ''

		This pleased
Brookfield	LOCATION	, as also did
Douglas Jerrold	PERSON	's saying , after reading
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	, '' There is no God -- and
Harriet	PERSON	is his prophet . ''

		We can imagine him enjoying such Elian absurdities as the famous question put to the man carrying home a rodent of the genus lepus , '' , Is that your own hare or a wig ? ''

		In short , one surmises that
Brook	LOCATION	- field 's wit had that delicately subtle and deli - ciously unexpected quality that often expresses itself largely in gesture and facial expression and tone of voice , and that depends for its thorough enjoyment on atmosphere and associa - tion -- on the context , so to speak .

		Venables , a competent authority , says : '' In irresistible hu - mor none of the ' Apostles ' rivalled
Brookfield	LOCATION	. '' ''

		He had infinite humor , '' says
Kinglake	PERSON	, '' but humor resulting -- like
Shakespeare	PERSON	's -- from mastering of human characters , and not from any love of mere shallow , mindless drollery ... I never heard him say a bitter thing . ''

		Besides
Brookfield	LOCATION	, whose biography has been fully given in '' Mrs.
Brookfield	PERSON	and her Circle , '' the '' Apostles '' selected for notice , each in a separate chapter , are Blakesley ,
Buller	PERSON	,
Hallam	PERSON	-LRB- of `` In Memoriam '' -RRB- ,

Venables	PERSON	.

		Some excerpts are now in order ; first one about the '' Apostles '' col - lectively . ''

		But trivial assaults the ' Apostles ' could afford to ignore , for if they had detractors they had also admirers and imitators .


W. E. Gladstone	PERSON	founded an
Essay Club	ORGANIZATION	at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	on the model of the ' Apostles ' and boasted of it -- though he owned it never quite satisfied him . '

		The Apostles , ' he said , ' are a much more general soci - ety . '

		Blakesley leaves it recorded that it was
Arthur Hallam	PERSON	who founded this
Club	ORGANIZATION	, and he probably thought this because
Hallam	PERSON	had given
Gladstone	PERSON	help in the drawing up of its rules . '

		The Sterling ' was certainly inspired by the ' Apostles , ' as were numerous other societies ; and , indirectly , the
London	LOCATION	Library , an insti - tution of an entirely different kind , grew out of it . ''

		Thackeray , who , though intimate with mem - bers of the society , appears never to have be - longed to it , was a warm friend and admirer of
Brookfield	LOCATION	, if one may judge from the following : ''
Thackeray	PERSON	admired
Brook	PERSON	eld with the ardour of a generous nature ; he loved to hear him talk , and would unweariedly listen to him a whole night through .

		He went to hear his sermons and his readings whenever he could ; he loved his wit and took it up and used it and illustrated it ; as also , by the way , did Leech . ''

		Thackeray has immortalized
Brookfield	LOCATION	as '' Frank Whitestock '' in '' The Curate 's Walk . '

		THE DIAL 135 And all this warmth of regard was reciprocated by its object , even to the extent of disliking the novels of Dickens . ''

		Unredeemed trash , '' is his verdict on '' The Old Curiosity Shop . ''

		Of
Brook	LOCATION	- field as a pulpit orator it may be worth while to cite
Lord Lyttleton	LOCATION	's assertion that he had '' never heard anyone so easy , almost colloquial , insomuch that there was a sort of temptation to forget that it was preaching , and get up and answer liim . ''

		Greville records in his diary : '' A magnificent sermon from
Brookfield	LOCATION	.

		He is one of the few preachers whose sermons never weary me , however long , ... and the elocution perfect . ''


George Stovin Venables	PERSON	is perhaps best known as the man who in boyhood , on the Charterhouse playground , met his schoolmate
Thackeray	PERSON	in fistic combat , in response to the other 's challenge , and did such execution that the embryo novelist came out of the engagement with a broken nose -- and also a lasting affec - tion for the breaker , an affection that was warmly returned .

		Venables , barrister and after - ward judge , contributed to the literature of his day chiefly in the form of anonymous journal - ism .

		The ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' and the '' Times , '' among other papers , profitted by his scholarly attainments .

		That he had a ready wit , in addi - tion to his other accomplishments , is made pleasantly apparent . ''

		Once when
Venables	PERSON	was leaving a dinner party where Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	also had been he took up his hat in the hall , saying , ' Here 's my Castor -- where 's
Pollock	PERSON	's ? '

		Always a favoured guest at the Grange , he said at a time when he and the world in general were much excited over inland travellers , that Mr.
Parkyns	PERSON	' book on
Africa	LOCATION	was the most successful attempt on record of a man being able to reduce himself to the savage state . ''

		Concerning
Hallam	PERSON	, that youth of rare prom - ise who died at twenty - two , on the eve of wed - ding
Emily Tennyson	PERSON	, it must here suffice to quote
Gladstone	PERSON	's enthusiastic encomium . ''

		There was nothing in the region of the mind which he might not have accomplished .

		I mourn in him , for myself , my earliest near friend ; for my fellow-creatures , one who would have adorned his age and country , a mind full of beauty and of power , attaining almost to that ideal standard of which it is presumption to expect an example .

		When shall I see his like ? ''

		None of the baker 's dozen of attractive per - sonalities portrayed in Mrs.
Brookfield	LOCATION	's pages is more attractive and more lovable than
James Spedding	PERSON	, the man who wasted his best energies -LRB- as many thought -RRB- in whitewashing
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		To
Brookfield	LOCATION	he was '' Spedding the Sublime '' ;
FitzGerald	PERSON	called him '' old
Jem Spedding	PERSON	'' and '' my Sheet - Anchor '' ; while
Thackeray	PERSON	playfully dubbed him '' Jeames Spending '' and '' that aged and most subtile serpent . ''

		Sped - ding 's early baldness , and the gentle raillery evoked thereby , he took with philosophic amia - bility .

		It is pleasant to read
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's friendly and admiring allusions to the Baco - nian 's lofty and depilated brow , which he some - where likens to
Shakespeare 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Says Mrs.
Brookfield	PERSON	: ''
Spedding	PERSON	was a favorite subject for his friend
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's banter .

		He writes for instance , '
Spedding	PERSON	is all the same as ever , not to be improved , one of the best sights in
London	LOCATION	. '

		When he went to
America	LOCATION	with
Lord Ashburnham	LOCATION	,
FitzGerald	PERSON	said : ' Of course you have read the account of
Spedding	PERSON	's forehead landing in
America	LOCATION	; English sailors hailed it in the Channel mistaking it for Beachy Head . '

		And later on in this visit he mentions that he begins to feel sure that Sped - ding would be safe in
America	LOCATION	, because ' to scalp such a forehead was beyond any Indian 's power . ' ''

		Except
Henry Lushington	PERSON	, each of the '' Apostles '' sketched by the author 's pen is also presented in pictorial likeness , the half-tone reproductions being from paintings or drawings .

		Spedding 's portrait is drawn by his own hand .

		The book , like its predecessor , is handsomely made , with clear type , good paper , and an index , whose five pages , however , do not con - tain all the entries one might have occasion to look for -- not even all the names of persons mentioned in the work .

		If the book has still another fault , it may by the more serious be thought to be an unduly generous inclusion of pleasant trivialities .

		However , they entertain -- or , if not , they may be skipped .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		A Book of Spanish Phantasies .

		* To the lover of
Spain	LOCATION	, every new book de - scriptive of the country comes as a fresh delight . ''

		The Cities of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Edward Hut	PERSON	- ton , is one of the last and outwardly one of the most attractive of last year 's large output .

		Twenty-four full-page illustrations in color by Mr.
A. Wallace Rimington	PERSON	, together with a nearly equal number of photographic copies of paintings from the
Prado	LOCATION	gallery , make the volume well worth possessing .

		This afPords some comfort to the purchaser who , upon open - ing the book , reads the following statement of the author : '' It is the art of Literature that I practice , and by my achievement or failure in this art I am to be judged .

		Therefore , if I prefer not to speak of
Spain	LOCATION	at all within * The Cities of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		By
Edward Hutton	PERSON	.

		With illustra - tions in color and photogravure .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		136 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, the chapters of my book , it is that I do not wish facts to become of too much importance there , of more im - portance , that is , than I , the artist , choose , and because I will not speak of what I have loved without knowledge . ''

		Of course if Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	prefers not to speak of
Spain	LOCATION	because of insufficient knowledge , well and good ; but why , then , label his work '' The Cities of
Spain	LOCATION	'' ?

		After reading the book , the reviewer suggests , as a more fitting title , '' Span - ish Phantasies '' or , '' Sobs of the Desert . ''

		In his practice of the art of literature , the author tells us that the country about
Toledo	LOCATION	is ' ■ ' - fulfilled with an immense energy , the en - ergy of silence . ''

		Speaking of a chapel in the cathedral at
Burgos	LOCATION	, he says : '' To pray in such a place if one were sorry might seem impossible , and if one were glad one would go to the hills . ''

		He gazes upon the '' tawny passionate land - scape , '' and the '' latent groinings of the hUls . '

		He loves the very look and sound of the words `` desert , ' '' `` sun , '' and '' stars , '' and sprinkles his pages with them until they resemble a chart of the starry firmament itself . ''

		For while some have loved women and others have sought for fame , and others have flung everything away for money , '' he says , '' it is the smi that I have loved , the sun which is the smile of God . ''


Spain	LOCATION	, through this medium , makes an especial appeal to Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	, who thus further ex - presses himself : '' And , though for no other cause , yet for this I find
Spain	LOCATION	the most beautiful country of
Europe	LOCATION	: that with her abide the mountains and the desert and over all the sun ... Now , therefore , let us rejoice together , that there remains to us a land where these things are ; for there the wind blows on the mountains , and in the de - sert there is silence , and at dawn and at noon and at evening we may behold the sun . ''

		There come times , however , when our author finds the sun so hot that he is '' afraid '' ; but we feel less concerned about him when we read that he is also sometimes frightened at the lack of smi .

		Upon his return to his
London	LOCATION	home , he writes : '' And a sort of twilight everywhere in this city of me ^ streets continually makes me afraid and is heavy upon me , and there is no sun . ''

		In other respects he seems an imeasy , restless body .

		When in
England	LOCATION	, he yearns to escape from the '' trumpery cities '' to the '' land of the sun and the desert , '' where '' the very boulders are writhing in agony to find expression . ''

		In
Spain	LOCATION	, however , he longs for
England	LOCATION	.

		At the
Escorial	LOCATION	, after wandering through the immense corridors , he says : '' I was thinking of the
spring	DATE	far far away in the world where the peach-blossoms flutter over the gar - dens like pink butterflies , and the willows are laughing together beside the rivers , and the wind is blowing over the sea ; and I was weary because I was so far away . ''

		The book , then , is subjective throughout .

		It records Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's sentiments and impres - sions , when he is weary , or frightened , or merely '' sorry . ''

		Burgos he finds to be the first city he has seen '' that verily believes in Christ . '' ''

		She is an image of Faith , of Exaltation in a world that is overheated and full of lies and greatly desirous . ''

		AvUa is '' the visible image of the word Amen . ''

		In the Mosque of Cor - dova he '' remembered only beautiful things and joy . '' ''

		I lost myself in a new contempla - tion ; I kissed the old voluptuous marbles ; I touched the strange , precious inscriptions , and with my finger I traced the name of God . ''

		In order better to receive the message that
Spain	LOCATION	has for him , Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	frequently travelled on horseback .

		In approaching
Avila	PERSON	, he says : '' What she means to those who come to her by rail - way , I know not , who saw her like a mirage in the , desert after many days .

		Lost in the infinite silence , under the sun and the sky , I had longed for her as of old men longed for the
Holy City	LOCATION	, and when I found her at last , I came to her on foot leading my mule over the stones . ''

		Let those disposed to pity Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	for the hardships that he must have endured upon such a trip read the following passage from his Intro - duction : `` Night fell -- a night of large , few stars -- and cov - ered us with her coolness ; even yet we were far from any city .

		And at last I could go no further , and told my guide so , who without any expression of surprise lifted me from my beast , laid me under a great rock , covered me with my rug , tethered the mules and began to prepare supper .

		I shall not forget the beauty of that night , nor the silence under those desert stars . ''

		After comforts like these in the open , is it any wonder that the failure of the electric light in the hotel at
Valladolid	LOCATION	fairly unmans him ?

		He speaks thus of this fearful experience : '' The horror of the toilet , in an unknown room , the search for the bed with the help of a match , I will not describe . ''

		It is surprising to note , in a book with the title '' The Cities of
Spain	LOCATION	'' and containing 324 pages , the amount of space allotted to each city .

		The chapter dealing with
Cadiz	LOCATION	numbers two and one-haK pages ; that which treats of
Jerez	LOCATION	, one and one-half pages by the author , together with a wholly irrelevant quotation from an En - glish diary of the seventeenth century .

		Four pages are given to
Cordova	LOCATION	, and four to the Escorial , nearly one-half of which is quoted .

		The description of the
Alhambra	LOCATION	is reprinted from
Swinburne	LOCATION	's eighteenth century account .

Madrid	LOCATION	are taken from
James Howell	PERSON	who wrote in
1622	DATE	.

		There is a chapter of about sixty pages on the
Prado Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, and another shorter one enti - tled `` Early Spanish Paintings . ''

		The art criticism here is vague and unsatisfying , with somewhat long historical digressions .

		As an excellent example of Mr.
Button	PERSON	's style and subject-matter , we quote his closing paragraph : '' For me , at least ,
Spain	LOCATION	remains as a sort of refuge , a land of sim and desert .

		If that be the obscure need of your spirit , go to her and she will heal you .

		For in the sun everything is true , all we have hoped and be - lieved and at last forgone , all the beautiful things of old time when Aphrodite at noon loved
Adon	PERSON	, and
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	sought for Persephone , and in the woods and on the mountains the women , stained with the juice of grapes , followed Dionysos ; when , in the dusty ways of tfie city , Christ gave sight to the blind , and in the heat of the day when the almond trees were shedding their blossoms He went by the stony ways to
Golgotha	LOCATION	.

		And we , too , shall be weary at evening , for he made the stars also . ''


George G. Brownell	PERSON	.

		Stukgis 's
History of Architecture	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The first volume of Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	's '' History of Architecture '' is at hand , and the two volumes remaining to complete the work are scheduled for the present year .

		The work is large in scope , as a brief summary of the contents will serve to show .

		Volume I. treats of those epochs and styles which are only half known to the modern stu - dent -- the Egyptian , Babylonian and Assyrian , and later Western Asiatic styles ; Greek art down to the final conquest by
Rome	LOCATION	; the earlier Italian art in its various forms ; the Roman Imperial architecture .

		Volume II .

		treats of the architecture of
India	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and other oriental nations , and includes also that
Mohammedan	DATE	architecture which arose out of the Byzantine styles .

		A treatment of the great Gothic school of Central and
Northern Europe	LOCATION	brings the history down to the fifteenth century .

		Volume III .

		deals with the fifteenth century remodelling of the art of
Europe	LOCATION	, the French florid Gothic , the English Tudor style , and as contemporary with these the beginnings of the classical revival in
Italy	LOCATION	, followed by the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean styles of the revived classic or neo-classic .

		Finally , in this volume will be studied the * A
History of Architecture	ORGANIZATION	.

		anomalous modern conditions , with an expla - nation of the failure of the nineteenth century in architecture while it was succeeding in paint - ing and in sculpture , and with constant effort to disentangle the serious attempts at original design from the mass of buUding which is un - disguisedly copied from earlier styles , and which is wholly commercial in its inspiration . ''

		The record is brought down to the time of '' those innovations in building which now foreshadow complete changes in all architectural style , '' -- which last , probably , instead of '' changes '' means the development or evolution of a new architectural style .

		The publishers of the work explain that '' in all this long inquiry the domestic architecture of each period is kept in view as offering a necessary corrective of conclusions which the grandiose architecture of the temple and the church , taken by itself , would suggest .

		This is especially the case in more recent times , when it is often found that the design of the dwelling - house is more nearly akin to refined and noble art than is that of the larger and more notice - able buildings . ''

		This last is a saving clause , for it is only in very modern times that domestic architecture and monumental architecture have failed to develop harmoniously in all essential characteristics , and this harmonious develop - ment very probably runs back to the earliest times ; though the author regrets his inability , through insufficient data , to write critically of the domestic architecture of such comparatively well-known civilizations as those of
Egypt	LOCATION	and of
Greece	LOCATION	, fearing to trench upon the domain of historical romance .

		Architecture is itself a history -- a record of human desire and activity , of race movement and achievement ; and a history of architecture may be one or the other of two things , or a blending of them .

		It may be an interpretation of the art and a determination of its relation to the life and philosophy of the race , showing the effect of modes of life and thought upon the ideals of the race as expressed in building in the abstract ; or it may be a record of technical achievement , made forceful by a comparison of concrete examples .

		If it be a judicious blend - ins : of the two , it will hold more of human interest and be more effective as an educational factor in the general evolution of a sympathetic knowledge of art .

		Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	, author , critic , and one - time architect , comes well equipped for his task of formulating critical and comparative judg - ments on such material as would naturally form 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, the basis of a great descriptive history of archi - tecture .

		His great knowledge and infinite patience , his keen observation and care for de - tails even to the counting and recording of the number and disposition of brick or stone courses in a monumental structure , his capacity for bal - ancing part against part and whole against whole , render his judgment as a connoisseur highly to be respected .

		As a record of archi - tectural events , this history , as evidenced by the volume in hand , leaves nothing to be desired .

		The work so far is an admirable example of the second form which a history of architecture may take , as above stated .

		Whether the com - pleted work will express that most desirable blending of human life with technical achieve - ment which constitutes art , remains to be seen .

		In the absence of the remaining volumes , the publishers ' statement on this point may be given . ''

		The
History of Architecture	ORGANIZATION	which we announce will discriminate closely between the natural artistic re - sults of construction and those methods of design which are quite apart from construction and are the result of abstract thinking and of the pure sense of form -- or , in a few cases , of color .

		An architectural design of any kind may have been conceived much as a piece of sculp - ture is conceived , that is , as a piece of pure form ; and it is in this way that much of Greek architecture took shape -- the simple requirements of the building of the time having but little influence upon it .

		On the other hand , with an energetic race of builders like the French of the twelfth century , a race not gifted with the sense of form to anything like the degree in which it was pos - sessed by the Greeks , the merit of a design would na - turally be found in the extraordinary logic and in the sincerity of the work , the placing of each stone helping at once the artistic results and the construction .

		Those are the extremes .

		Between them is the wide field of styles in which both influences are at work . ''

		The two extremes thus indicated may be denom - inated broadly the architecture of `` form '' and the architecture of '' feeling , '' the architec - ture of the intellect and the architecture of the emotions .

		The volume before us is dominated by the classic ideal , and the emotions have little play .

		The architecture of
Egypt	LOCATION	which reaches emotional depths is treated with too formal a touch , and it is only from the illustrations that one can fully understand why Greek art stopped at the threshold of
Egypt	LOCATION	, nor sought to com - pete with the intellect against the passions .

		A history of architecture which is based on race psychology will explain why the pjo-amids express the soul of
Egypt	LOCATION	and of no other country ; will explain not only that the columns were of magnificent proportions and the lin - telled roofs were massive , but also that the dom - inating thought in the mind of the race made other proportions and less enduring masses im - possible ; that the column was not a column , but an everlasting support , -- that a lintel was not a lintel , but an everlasting roof .

		A study of the mind of
Greece	LOCATION	will show in the changing di - mensions of column and lintel not only a develop - ment of architectural form but the birth of an idea which becomes clear and clean-cut and is evolved to its logical limit .

		A study of the Roman temperament will show how it was re - flected in an overpowering architecture in which the undeveloped idea of the arch and the fully developed idea of the lintel were hopelessly con - fused and endlessly entangled .

		Not all of this is set forth in the present volume as fully or as vividly as the student could desire .

		Such treat - ment does not necessarily take history into the domain of romance .

		A history of architecture which is based on the philosophy of life will ex - plain how , when
Greece	LOCATION	bowed to
Egypt	LOCATION	, the exploiters of Roman classic art could have car - ried their wares into the presence of the great temples of the north and not have been humbled into inactivity .

		This and kindred matters of race psychology should find treatment in the final volume .

		It is needless at this time to anticipate this treatment further than to suggest that perhaps painting and sculpture in general have not in the nineteenth century reached a comparatively much higher plane than has ar - chitecture .

		Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	's appreciation of sculp - ture , as evidenced in the first volume , is very sympathetic ; and its treatment is on the side of the relation of this art to architecture .

		The present day has made it a thing apart , which is not necessarily elevating it to a higher plane .

		Conditions which now surround architecture are very different from those of
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	of the tweKth century ; but that does not necessarily relegate to a lower plane that architecture which characteristically sums up these conditions .

		But in point of fact , we pro- duce no great architecture of form , for our in - tellects are devoted to the development of the sciences ; nor do we produce great architecture of feeling , because our emotions are swamped in the strenuous hustle of the commercial life .

		Our intellects do not any longer imagine forms , they simply remember ; our emotions no longer throb passionately , they merely flutter .

		And what applies to art applies with more or less equal force to the making of books and even the writing of history .

		The specimen pages sent out in advance do not fairly represent the work .

		With these in mind , one first opens the book with misgivings .

		However , it is pleasing to note that the style is
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 seK-contained and much in the author 's earlier manner .

		The task of collating and arranging the great mass of detail has been heavy , and the outcome is a work of great value and a mat - ter of congratulation to both author and pub - lisher .

		In general make-up , the work is very attractive .

		The letter-press is well-nigh perfect ; while the illustrations , which number more than four hundred in the first volume , are well chosen and extremely well reproduced .

		The full-page plates are carbongravures , while the illustrations in the text are half-tones from photographs and photo-etchings from line drawings and engrav - ings , but so harmonized in scale and so well placed that the effect of the whole is pleasing to an extent that is not always the case when varied means of reproduction are employed .

		The most serious mechanical slip seems to be in the inversion of the first half-tone plate in the chapter on the Corinthian style .

		Beyond this mishap , too much praise can hardly be given to the care which has entered into the artistic make-up of the initial volume , and which it is to be hoped sets a standard to be followed in the remaining ones .

Smith	PERSON	founded and for many years conducted the '' National Intelligencer , '' a journal of national circulation which acquired a great influence in American politics .

		Later , he was for a short time Secretary of the Treas - ury ; he was the first Commissioner of the Revenue of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, and was for many years president of important banks .

		It was but natural that his wife should take her place among the great ladies of the young capital ; and as she had some talent for writing , she be - came -LRB- anonymously , as befitted the taste of the day -RRB- a contributor to several journals .

		She also wrote a two - volume novel called '' A
Winter	DATE	in
Washington	LOCATION	, '' now exceedingly rare , which is valuable because of its faithful study of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	.

		Such meagre outlines can easily be filled in with light , color , and movement , if one recalls that in the
Washington	LOCATION	of those days there were peculiarly favorable opportimities for delight - ful social intercourse and intimate friendships between people of refinement and intelligence , such as are no longer possible in the beautiful city seething with politics and slowly but surely coming under the benumbing influence of the modern commercial spirit .

		Our story opens -LRB- to use a favorite phrase of the Lady 's Book age of American letters -RRB- with a description of the visits paid to the young wife , whose guests were '' treated to my wed - ding cake . ''

		In the next sentence we learn that '' Mrs. B -LRB- ell -RRB- brought us a large basket of sweet potatoes , and some fine cabbages , '' -- an astonishing compliment , surely , to a bride !

		In returning the visit paid by Thomas Law -LRB- brother to Lord EUin borough -RRB- and his wife -LRB- a descendant of
Lord Baltimore	LOCATION	, and a grand - daughter of Mrs.
Washington	LOCATION	-RRB- Mr. and Mrs. 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	,
Smith	PERSON	were persuaded to remain '' and dine off a fine turkey '' ; and they were conducted to the kitchen to see a '' contrivance '' called a '' Ranger '' on which the fowl had been roasted .

		A few days later , a modest gentleman called to arrange about the publication of a MS. `` as legible as printing , '' which turned out to be the work known as `` Jefferson 's Manual , '' the modest gentleman who brought it discovering himself to be its author .

		Thus are we brought face to face with the real hero of Mrs.
Smith	PERSON	's writings .

		Her intimate personal study of
Jef	LOCATION	- ferson covers many years , and was conducted in many places and through many scenes , but always with a loyalty and sincerity which are creditable alike to both .

		Following the inauguration of
1801	DATE	, the President 's house was presided over by his daughters , Mrs.
Randolph	PERSON	and Mrs.
Eppes	PERSON	, with the grace and dignity tliat have given them an enviable position among the great ladies of American society .

		The dinners which were fre - quently given by
Jefferson	PERSON	were laid on a round table at which twelve guests were seated ; and the letters are filled with the sayings and doings of the brilliant men who were making history with every sentence they uttered and every page they wrote , -- men upon whom we have come to look as the giants and ancients of our own younger and smaller day .

		Like a thread of bright embroidery worked about the historic tapestry the men were weaving , are the names of the women who created the society in which they shone , -- Mrs.
Madison	PERSON	, Mrs.
Cutts	PERSON	, Mrs.
Monroe	PERSON	, Mrs.
Adams	PERSON	, Mrs.
Wirt	PERSON	, Mrs. Clay , Mrs.
Calhoun	PERSON	.

		Like a panorama , we behold the charming home-life of the Jeffersons at
Monticello	LOCATION	and the Madisons at
Montpelier	LOCATION	; the burning of the Capitol and other public buildings by the British , and the flight of the terrified Washingtonians .

		We smile at Mrs.
Smith	PERSON	's alarm , which leads her to say : '' I do not suppose
Government	ORGANIZATION	will ever return to
Washington	LOCATION	.

		All those whose property was invested in the place will be reduced to poverty . ''

		Smiles are called forth also by her lively por - trayal of the scenes during Mr.
Clay	PERSON	's Con - gressional speech on the Seminole War , which is here partly reproduced . ''

		When I reached the Hall it was so crowded that it was impossible to join my party , and after much hesi - tation I consented to allow Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	to take me on the floor of the
House	ORGANIZATION	, where he told me some ladies already were .

		In the
House	ORGANIZATION	, or rather lobby of the
House	ORGANIZATION	, I found four ladies whom I had never before seen , all genteel and fashionable , and under the pro- tection of Mr.
Mercer	PERSON	, who shook hands with me .

		The
Senate	ORGANIZATION	had adjourned in order to hear Mr.
Clay	PERSON	; all the foreign ministers and suites , and many strangers , admitted on the floor in addition to the members , ren - der 'd the
House	ORGANIZATION	crowded .

		The gallery was full of ladies , gentlemen , and men to a degree that endanger 'd it .

		Even the outer entries were thronged , and yet such silence prevailed that tho ' at a considerable distance I did not lose a word .

		Mr.
Clay	PERSON	was not only eloquent but amusing , and more than once made the whole
House	ORGANIZATION	laugh ... Every person had expected him to be very severe on the President , and seemed rather disappointed by his moderation .

		\ \ Tien Mr.
Clay	PERSON	fin - ished he came into the lobby for air and refreshment .

		The members crowded around him , and I imagine by his countenance that what they whispered must have been very agreeable .

		When he saw me he came and sat a few minutes by me .

		I told him I had come pre - pared to sit till evening , and was disappointed at his speech being so short : he said he had intended to have spoken longer , but his voice had given out ; he had begun too loud and had exhausted himself ... The gentlemen are grown very gallant and attentive , and as it was impossible to reach the ladies through the gallery , a new mode was invented of supplying them with oranges , etc They tied them up in handkerchiefs to which was fixed a note indicating for whom it was design 'd , and then fastened to a long pole .

		This was taken to the floor of the house , and handed up to the ladies who sat in the front of the gallery .

		I imagine there were near 100 ladies there .

		So these presenta - tions were frequent and quite amusing even in the midst of Mr.
C.	PERSON	's speech .

		I saw the ladies near me were more accessible , and were more than supplied with oranges , cakes , etc. .

		We divided what was brought with each other , and were as social as if acquainted . ''

		No less quotable are passages describing the family life of
William Wirt	PERSON	; the excitement over the defeat of the now-forgotten
Crawford	PERSON	; the social upheaval which has passed into his - tory as the
Peggy O'Neil	PERSON	incident ; and the entertainments given in honor of
Miss Marti	LOCATION	- neau .

		Upon the deeper character and influence of the many notable men about her , Mrs.
Smith	PERSON	's comments are of no great value .

		A woman 's views of men and affairs are at best but a woman 's views .

		But a clever woman is often able to see and portray the peculiar characteristics of an individual or an event in a way that is illuminating and valuable .

		It is this quality in the letters of
Margaret Bayarh Smith	PERSON	that makes their publication well wortd while .

		The dramatic awakening at
Oberlin	LOCATION	, which has marked its current college year , gives fresh evidence of itself in an announcement , from the classical depart - ment , of a projected performance of Aristophanes 's '' Clouds '' toward the end of the

		This will be the first presentation of a Greek play in English translation that
Oberlin	LOCATION	has seen .

		THE DIAL 141 The FLiIGHT of
Marie Axtoinette	PERSON	.

		* An English translation of
M. Lenotre	PERSON	's Le Drame de Varennes appears with the title '' The Flight of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	. ''

		From the bookselling point of view , there is a certain utility in the change of title ; but the words '' Drama of Varennes '' suggest more adequately the spirit in which
M. Lenotre	PERSON	has treated one of the most startling and tragic situations of the French Revolution .

		Moreover , in his narrative the queen is not the principal figure , although she is inevitably the heroine .

		The interest is fitted , from beginning to end , upon the way in which every successive obstacle is passed by or broken through , until , upon the very threshold of security , the royal family is entangled in the meshes of new difficulties , which are in part simply the debris of previous obstacles swept along in the flight .

		In one sense , the English title is more exactly descriptive than the French ; for no account is given of the making of the plot , the theme is the denouement and the final catastrophe , including the humiliating return to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Those who are acquainted with
M. Lenotre	PERSON	's other work need not be reminded that he has used the historical method as severely in deter - mining each detail of the story as if he were engaged on a far didler task .

		He refers to his '' sources '' specifically , and is not afraid to insert an occasional long foot-note .

		But this method shoxdd not alarm the general reader .

		The fidness and exactness of the author 's in - formation has not impaired his sense for the requirements of the story .

		The foot-notes are merely pertinent asides , to which the reader may refuse to listen .

		The escape from the Tuileries is perhaps the most interesting group of incidents in the story , though not the most unfamiliar , because a single false step might have defeated the design at the outset ; and yet the different members of the party , in spite of minor mischances , suc - cessfully carried out the roles assigned to them .

		The situation was rendered more hazardous by the necessity that the royal children be taken to Count
Fersen	PERSON	's carriage before the coucher .

		The queen personally attended them , with
Madame de Tourzel	ORGANIZATION	, passing through unused rooms down toward the brilliantly lighted court - yard , where she might be recognized . ''

		They paused at the end of an empty room ; through the huge glazed door they saw the glimmering lights • The Plight of

Carrousel	ORGANIZATION	and the groups of people moving in the court .

		The Queen looked out for a moment , and then hid herself once more in the gloom .

		Under the cold insensibility afPected by the legal documents , one can guess at the anguish that must have wrung the heart of
Marie Thdr	PERSON	^ se 's daughter at this fatal hour . ''

		But she went out , saw the children safely in the carriage , and was again in her apartments by a quarter to eleven .

		The king 's coucher began at eleven .

		Lafayette arrived fifteen minutes later .

		The king talked with him , but seemed preoccupied and went several times to the window to observe the weather .

		The mo - ment given the king for his escape was while his valet was imdressing in an adjoining room , after he had assisted the king into bed and had drawn the curtains of the bedstead .

		When the attendant returned , he fastened to his arm a cord the other end of which was suspended on the curtain near the king 's hand as he supposed .

		He then lay down on his own cot , '' with his customary care lest he should awake his master . ''

		The further adventures of the family before they were installed in the berline are better known .

		If one were inquiring about the dangers of historical rhetoric , it would be instructive , after finishing
M. Lenotre	PERSON	's story , to read
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's account .

		Carlyle 's positive errors have already been pointed out by Mr.
Oscar Browning	PERSON	, or by the recent editors of the '' French Revolu - tion , '' Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	and Mr.
Rose	PERSON	; but the trouble is not in these errors so much as in the total impression from the narrative , which is that we have here ahnost a comedy or farce , rather than a drama which is deeply pathetic .

		Among the results of
M. Lenotre	PERSON	's special investigations is his conclusion about the recog - nition of the king .

		He discredits
Drouet	ORGANIZATION	's tale , showing from the official report of the muni - cipality of Ste.
Menehould	PERSON	that Drouet only suspected the possible presence of the king and did not think of communicating his suspicions to the municipality until the carriage was gone an hour and a half .

		The king had already been recognized much earlier at Chain trix , where the carriage arrived at half-past two in the after - noon .

		The royal family took no pains to deny their identity , and received the homage of the postmaster and his daughters .

		They were re - cognized again at
Chalons	LOCATION	, and
M. Lenotre	PERSON	be - lieves that from '' this time forward the news of the fugitives ' approach preceded them . ''

		At Ste.
Menehovdd	PERSON	, a barmaid spread the rumor that the king was going to pass ; '' everywhere the inhabitants gave signs of being already in an anxious and over-excited state , everywhere 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, they crowded along the route of the berline . ''

		It was this situation , every moment growing more ominous , which aggi-avated the difficulty of keeping the dragoons at the place where
Bouille	PERSON	had ordered them to await the coming of the royal carriage .

		In one of his supplementary chapters , '' The Case of
Monsieur Leonard	PERSON	, ''
M. Lenotre	PERSON	seems hardly consistent with himself .

		He intimates that the alarmist reports spread by Leonard ac - count for the failure of the post horses to be at their station in
Varennes	LOCATION	.

		In the general nar - rative , however , he says that the young officers in charge of the horses were waiting at the hotel
Grand Monarque	LOCATION	, watching at the open windows for the approach of the couriers who should tell them that the carriage was nearing the town .

		This statement gives the impression that there was a misunderstanding ; for
Valory	ORGANIZATION	, acting as courier , did not enter the town , although he reached it a quarter of an hour before the ber - line arrived .

		In the supplementary chapters may be found examples of the sort of work in
M. Lenotre	PERSON	's previous books , including four volumes on Revolutionary
Paris	LOCATION	.

		For the lovers of a good story , as well as for those who wish to study side-lights on the Revolution , and who may not be able to read French , it woidd be fortunate were a selection made from these volumes for translation .

		altogether delightful blend of invention and humor and bookishness and tender pathos and subtly iron - ical philosophy .

		The Vagabond is a masterpiece of characterization .

		Once known to respectability as
Gaston	LOCATION	de N ^ rac , he has long since sloughed off the integuments of convention , and become a joyous Bohemian , an oracle of the cafe , a peripatetic phi - losopher who can adapt himself to any environment that does not mean the submission to artificial restraints .

		The manner of his emancipation was this : in his early days of respectability he was be - trothed to an English girl , having won her from his rival , a French nobleman whose wealth was equalled by his depravity .

		Her father being threatened with disgrace ,
Gaston	PERSON	had made a quixotic bargain with his rival , whereby the father was to be saved , and the self-sacrificing lover was to disappear , apparently deserting his betrothed .

		All this took place many years ago .

		When the story opens , we find the hero in a
London	LOCATION	garret , and in the act of adopting a small boy of the slums , in whose breast he has de - tected a spark of genius .

		This boy joins his fortunes with those of his benefactor , receives a surprising education from this companionship , and becomes the chronicler of all that follows .

		The dull streets of
London	LOCATION	are soon exchanged for the friendly boule - vards of
Paris	LOCATION	and the sunny highways of
France	LOCATION	.

		There follow many adveirtures of a more or less picaresque nature , interspersed with expositions of the vagabond philosophy .

		Toward the close , there is an interlude , occasioned by the death of the French nobleman , and his widow 's discovery of the truth about her old-time lover .

		She seeks him out , their love is declared anew , and he makes a des - perate effort to become respectable once more .

		The experiment might have worked had it been con - ducted in
Paris	LOCATION	, but a brief sojourn in an English provincial town proves fatal to its success .

		The vagabond tries vainly to submit to the regimen of clothes and cleanliness , of abstinence and decorum , and makes a pathetic attempt to fit his conversation to the vacuous thought of his new associates .

		After a few weeks of silent martyrdom , he can endure it no longer , and bolts for his beloved
Paris	LOCATION	, where he relieves his pent-up feelings in a glorious spree and the congenial companionship of some amazingly abandoned rascals .

		Having thus restored his equi - librium , he weds a buxom peasant damsel , and prepares to end his days on a small farm which he is just able to purchase with what remains of his capital .

		Ilfaut cultiver notre jardin becomes his watchword ,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	replacing Rabelais .

		What we have written may do well enough for an outline of the story , but it can convey no notion whatever of the character of the hero , who is one of the most genial and human figures ever encountered within the pages of a book .

		It would take a very stern moralist indeed to find him , despite his obvious faults , anjrthing but sympathetic and lovable in all the phases -- even the most sordid -- of his pictur - esque and eccentric career .

		Kravonia is a principality to be sought on the

		THE DIAL 143 map somewhere in the vicinity of
Zenda	LOCATION	, and is , like most of the states of the mythical group to which it belongs , the sjjort of diplomatic intrigue .

		Its prince is sorely beset by enemies , but when he acquires a princess , in the shape of a beautiful En - glish maiden -- transformed from a lowly maid - servant into a captivating adventuress -- his for - tunes change , and he gives his foes a run for their money .

		Unhappily , he is killed just when triumph is at hand , and his princess goes into exile cherish - ing the memory of the glorious weeks of the con - flict .

		Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's hand has lost little of its cunning since the days when he invented Zenda , and his '' Sophy of Kravonia '' is a capital story , albeit the type is now somewhat worn .

		Mr.
John CoUis Snaith	PERSON	is a writer comparatively new to fame , but his ''
Henry Northcote	PERSON	'' is a book to be reckoned with .

		It is a tragedy of ambition , sombre in its coloring and questionable in its mor - ality , but possessed of a compelling force that is far out of the common .

		The hero is a penniless bar - rister who must be described as a megalomaniac .

		He is fairly bursting with the consciousness of his power to become a leader of men , if only oppor - tunity may be granted him , but is meanwhile starv - ing in a garret .

		In the lowest deep of misery , the coveted opportunity comes to him in the form of a brief , which charges him with the defence of a de - praved woman , a murderess whose crime is beyond the shadow of a doubt .

		He conducts the defence , and secures her acquittal by an appeal of daemonic eloquence to the jury .

		The tragedy of the situa - tion is psychological , for he knows in his heart that his plea is sophistical and that his motive is sheer personal ambition .

		This consciousness turns the victory to dust and ashes in his mouth , and he is almost at the point of renouncing the brilliant posi - tion which his forensic triumph has won for him .

		But with a mighty resolve , he casts all scruples to the winds , murders the woman whose life he has just saved , destroys the evidence of his crime by burning the building in which her body lies , and faces the future without feeling , as far as we are permitted to perceive , a tinge of remorse .

		This does not make a pleasant story , but its gi'ip is undeniable .

		It is also remarkable for the way in which it pre - serves the classical unities , for the entire action covers only a period of three days .

		We may add that no one who begins to read it will be likely to delay as long as that in reaching the closing page .

		The '' Call of the Blood '' is a wortliy successor to '' The Garden of Allah , '' hitherto the masterpiece of Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	.

		It offers the same combination of glowing color , picturesque setting , and psycholo - gical interest .

		The scene is
Sicily	LOCATION	, which is suffi - ciently tropical a country to justify the warmth of treatment which characterized the African romance first named .

		Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	works up his material with great thoroughness , and in this case , as in the other , has submitted himself to the influences of the environment until he has become saturated with its spirit .

		His hero and heroine are both English , but the former has a strain of Italian blood in his veins , and it runs riot when he takes his bride to
Sicily	LOCATION	for the honeymoon .

		Instincts awake in him that might never have declared themselves under the gray English skies , and he enters into the joy - ous existence of the island peasants and fisher-folk with results that prove disastrous .

		The cause of his undoing , and of the wreck of the bride 's happi - ness , is a girl of the people , whose unsophisticated charm stirs his dormant passions , and finally lures him to death .

		For this inevitable outcome every chapter and episode of the book help to prepare the way , and the author , with a fine artistic mar - shalling of his materials , brings the long-impending tragedy to its appropriate climax .

		In respect of scene-painting , dramatic construction , and emotional force alike , the book deserves unusual praise .


Owen Davenant	PERSON	, the hero of Mr.
H. F. Prevost Battersby	PERSON	's `` The Avenging Hour , '' is on his way from
London	LOCATION	to
South Wales	LOCATION	, where Lord
St. Osyth	LOCATION	, the aged kinsman from whom he expects to inherit , lives in a remote castle with the young wife who has recently accepted the offer of his hand and what remained of his heart .

		The only other occupant of the railway carriage in which
Davenant	PERSON	travels is a woman of such alluring charm that he cultivates her acquaintance as speedily as the circumstances will allow , and is aided therein by certain fortuitous hap - penings , chief among which is an accident to the line which considerably lengthens the journey .

		To put the matter bluntly , he has accomplished her se - duction before the journey 's end , and then learns , to his consternation , that they have the same destina - tion , and that she is no other than the wife of the kinsman whom he is about to visit .

		This is a start - ling situation indeed , yet a situation managed with so much delicacy and literary art as to seem far less shocking than it ought to seem , and of course really is .

		The next move in the game is to intro - duce the aged husband , and to represent him as a very vulgar and disagreeable person , thereby creat - ing a distinct prepossession in favor of his erring wife .

		This is deftly done , but even then
Davenant	PERSON	's decent instincts -LRB- for he has them -RRB- make his stay under that roof intolerable , and he departs on a military expedition to
Africa	LOCATION	, where he takes long chances , leads forlorn hopes , and escapes unscathed in accordance with the accepted conventions of this sort of melodrama .

		While thus far away news comes to him that
St. Osyth	LOCATION	is dead , but that illict love has borne its fruit , and that , by the strictest poetic justice , his sin has become the instrument of his undoing , for the posthumous child is the legal inheritor of the estate .

		Still later , the child dies , which somehow seems to make it possible for the lovers to come together , and the whole miserable business is patched up after the fashion which was to be expected -- at least by the confirmed reader of modern sex-fiction .

		The teller of this story dis - guises its essential repulsiveness by a skilful use of the casuistry of sentiment and the grace of literary composition -- those insidious devices by which the 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, modern novelist contrives to blur every principle he pleases , and make almost any atrocious act seem ethically plausible . ''

		Chippinge Borough , '' Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's new novel , is not unprovided with those elements of per - sonal and sentimental interest that go to the making of popular fiction , but it is essentially a novel of political history , and the Reform Bill is its real subject .

		The hazardous fortunes of that measure , and its iiltimate triumph , are matters of such tre - mendous importance so vividly set forth that by comparison the fortunes of the rather colorless hero and heroine seem unexciting .

		It is not that these figures , and the others subsidiary to them , are badly done , for Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	is too skilled a story-teller to give us puppets for human beings ; but they somehow tend to become accessories to an action which has issues far more fateful than those which concern any of the individuals involved .

		Chippinge is one of the rotten boroughs menaced by the Bill , and barely escapes being wiped off the political map .

		Its two seats have hitherto been the undisputed property of one
Robert Vermuyden	PERSON	, who is a most uncompromising Tory .

		His kinsman and putative heir is a young man who becomes infected with radical notions , and is daring enough to oppose the Vermuyden interest by joining with the reformers .

		He is also sentimental enough to fall in love with a demure schoolmistress , which complicates matters a good deal , since the young woman turns out to be old
Vermuyden	ORGANIZATION	's daughter , long mourned for dead .

		The tangle is straightened out , as a matter of course , the Bill passes the
Lords	LOCATION	, and one of
Chippinge	ORGANIZATION	's seats is saved from the wreck .

		Among historical figures .

		Brougham figures strikingly in the story ; and among historical happenings , there is a fine picture of the
Bristol	LOCATION	riots .

		On the whole , we must congratulate the author upon what is very nearly if not quite the best of all his novels .

		Corsica in the middle of the eighteenth century , struggling under Paoli to escape from Genoese rule , offers a fine field for historical romance , and Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	has made the most of it in his '' Sir
John Constantine	PERSON	. ''

		But
Paoli	PERSON	is not the hero of this tale , for invention has come to the aid of history , and supplied more legitimate claimants for the Corsican throne in the offspring of one King Theo - dore , an adventurer of somewhat shady character , but , according to the novelist 's scheme , of unques - tionably royal authenticity .

		Brought to the degra - dation of a debtor 's prison in
London	LOCATION	, this exalted scapegrace obtains succor from an Englishman , Sir
John Constantine	PERSON	, an old-time lover of the woman who , by marriage with
Theodore	PERSON	, had become for a brief period Queen Emilia of
Corsica	LOCATION	.

		He is a quixotic old gentleman with an only son , for whom he has conceived great ambitions .

		Between the exiled king and the Englishman a bargain is struck .

		Theodore declares that he has no children living -LRB- although he knows that he has -RRB- and , in considera - tion of certain moneys , makes over to Prosper , Sir
John	PERSON	's son , the royal title .

		There now remain only the invasion of
Corsica	LOCATION	, the expulsion of the Genoese , and the establishment of Prosper upon the throne -- an easy matter , in the estimation of our modern
Don Quixote	PERSON	.

		The army of invasion -LRB- numbering seven in all -RRB- is collected , and sails merrily for the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		A skirmish with
Barbary	ORGANIZATION	pirates threatens to imperil the expedition , which , however , in somewhat battered condition finally lands upon the Corsican shores .

		Hardly has this haven been reached , when Prosper falls into the hands of brigands , who turn out to be under the leadership of a young man and woman , brother and sister , who are the legitimate children of Theodore and
Emilia	ORGANIZATION	, and consequently the real heirs to whatever titles and dignities those royal personages have the power to transmit .

		But even these young people are with - out honor in their native country , for suspicion attaches to their past , and meanwhile the Paolis are rallying the patriotic forces of the island to their own standard .

		So we have the situation of the legitimate heirs to the kingdom fugitives in the macchia , and the innocent English pretender a captive in their hands .

		The plot works out by disclos - ing the despicable and treacherous character of the Prince , and the passionate and high-hearted temper of the Princess .

		The obvious solution -LRB- since his - torical fact does not permit either Prince or Princess or Pretender to achieve a throne -RRB- is for Prosper and the Princess to fall in love with one another -LRB- which they do in course of time -RRB- and in the end to sail away together from the distracted island .

		As for Sir
John	PERSON	, he dies fighting the Genoese , and his end is no less heroic than the rest of his career .

		The other figures in the romance awaken our interest ; he alone commands our love .

		The names of Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	and Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	appear conjointly upon the title - page of '' Doubloons . ''

		Reading the story , we find it to be the tale of a mysterious crime in
London	LOCATION	followed by a mysterious expedition to the Carib - bean in search of buried Spanish gold .

		This com - bination of ''
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	'' and '' Treasure Island '' is pleasing in its simple fashion , but what is Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	doing in that galley ?

		We refuse to associate him with so preposterous a yarn , and in - sist that his literary partner must be held chiefly responsible .

		The
London	LOCATION	part of the story is bet - ter than its sequel , and provides a thrill for every chapter .

		After a while , the complication becomes so great that there is nothing for it but to cut loose and take refuge in foreign parts .

Bartholomew	PERSON	and the murder of Coligny .

		Given these materials , a historical romance of the conven - tional type makes itself , and the considerable interest of the present example must be attributed in part only to the ingenuity of its fabricator .

		Still , Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	has put his historical facts -LRB- duly supple - mented by sentimental inventions -RRB- to skilful use , and made the old story quite readable again . ''

		The Illustrious O'Hagan '' is the title of Mr.
Justin Huntly McCarthy	PERSON	's new novel , and the Illustrious
O'Hagan	PERSON	is its hero .

		The first thing to be explained about this hero is that there are two of him -- twins so closely alike that their friends can hardly tell them apart .

		He -LRB- or they -RRB- became '' illustrious '' by fighting under the French king at
Fontenoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Afterwards , one of him goes to the
Morea	PERSON	and gets killed .

		The other , resting on his laurels in
Paris	LOCATION	, is summoned to a little German principality to rescue a sweetheart of his youth from her brute of a husband .

		He starts blithely on the adventure , and is soon followed by his brother , who is conve - niently resuscitated at this juncture , being needed in the novelist 's business .

		The scene is henceforth in
Schlafingen	LOCATION	, where the maiden is in sore distress , and where we learn that her princely husband is even more of a brute than we had ventured to anticipate .

		Since the
O'Hagan	PERSON	is now doubled -- a fact unknown to anyone but himself -- he is ena - bled to work for her rescue in two places at once , which gives him a decided advantage in the game .

		Of course the rescue is effected , and then the super - fluous
O'Hagan	PERSON	and the brutal prince kill each other in a welter of gore , which is just as well for both parties , since one of them is not fit to live , and the other is badly wanted -LRB- for a hanging matter -RRB- in

Uivil	LOCATION	IVar .

		■ '' - '' • • < • - n * - r ^ '' Reminiscences of a Mosby Guer - rilla '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Heretofore the public has known little of the real life of that famous war band commanded by
John S. Mosby	PERSON	, who in
1864	DATE
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	tried to capture and hang , who in
1872	DATE	was a political lieutenant of President
Grant	PERSON	, and in
1907	DATE	is said to be one of the advisers of
President Roosevelt on Southern	ORGANIZATION	affairs .

		This book throws much light upon the character of the com - mand -- its leader , the members , and its methods of warfare .

		There is not a word about constitutional theories , nothing about State Rights , no latter-day historical philosophizing , no description of conditions in the
South	LOCATION	during and after the war , nothing , in short , except a lively account of the fighting life of the Forty-third
Virginia Battalion of Partisan Rangers	ORGANIZATION	, commonly known in both
North and South	LOCATION	as ''
Mosby	PERSON	's Guerrillas . ''

		The regular troops of the Confederacy thought that too many privileges were given to
Mosby	PERSON	and his men ; the Federal commanders thought that the
Rangers	ORGANIZATION	ought to be hanged , and they did hang some of them , -- but
Mosby	PERSON	retaliated , and since he could hang about a hundred to one , he thus stopped that plan of deal - ing with his men .

		Mr.
Munson	PERSON	, the author of this book , joined the
Rangers	ORGANIZATION	when seventeen years of age and served until the final surrender .

		Judging from the tone of his book , he was much in love with the life of the
Rangers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Most of his narrative is about what he himself saw and took part in .

		He informs us that the chief object of
Mosby	LOCATION	, who operated within the Federal lines , was to secure information for Lee and
Stuart	PERSON	, to protect Southern sympathizers outside of the Confederate lines , to capture supplies , and to `` annoy the enemy . ''

		In the latter purpose
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	complained that it took 17,000 of his men to look after
Mosby	PERSON	's four hundred .

		The region in which the
Rangers	ORGANIZATION	operated embraced Fauquier and Loudoun counties , about a hundred and fifty miles from
Richmond	LOCATION	, near the
Blue Ridge Mountains	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was called ''
Mosby	PERSON	's Confederacy , '' and of
Mosby	PERSON	's rule here the author says : '' During the war all local govern - ment in that country was suspended ... The people looked to
Mosby	ORGANIZATION	to make the necessary laws and to execute them ; and no country before , during , or since the war , was ever better governed .

		Mosby would not permit a man to commit a crime ... in his domain .

		One of his men , in a spirit of deviltry , once turned over an old
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	farmer 's milk cans , and when
Mosby	PERSON	heard of it he ordered me to take the man over ... to
General Early	ORGANIZATION	with the mes - sage that such a man was not fit to be a Guerilla . ''

		It was a rare body of reckless young fighters whose exploits are chronicled in this volume .

		With the help of this description of the possibilities of guerrilla warfare , we may gain a conception of the .

		service rendered to both
South and North by General Lee	LOCATION	when he refused to countenance such a method of prolonging the contest .

		The recent statements of Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	on this point have an added force when one thinks of the conditions that would have followed had there been hundreds of such organizations in the remote districts of the South .

		A taster and ^ ^ ^ ^ non-professional critic is likely reiisher of the to be fresher and more inspiring in best literature , relating his adventures among books than is the practised writer on the same themes , with all his critical apparatus of gauges and stand - ards and measurements and tests , his stereotyped phrases , and the approved cant and jargon of his calling .

		Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	, like his fellow na - turalist , Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, can chat to us as pleasantly about books as about birds .

		His '' Friends on the Shelf '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is chiefly a reprint of ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' essays on literary subjects , taking its title from
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's words in one of 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, his letters , '' I must get back to my friends on the shelf . ''

		He treats of
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	,
Thoreau	PERSON	-LRB- most admirably , of course -RRB- ,
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
M. Anatole France	PERSON	, sundry matters of style , travellers ' notebooks , and our alleged lack of a national litera - ture .

		An enamored reader , he writes with a charm - ing disclaimer of being anything but a taster and relisher .

		But '' self-dispraise goes little ways , '' as the essayist himself admits , and '' the good critic is he who narrates the adventures of his own mind in its intercourse with masterpieces , '' says
M. Anatole France	PERSON	, as quoted by Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	.

		Some little mat - ters to quarrel over might easily be singled out .

		For instance , when the writer declares that
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	`` meant to be obscure , '' is he indisputably in the right ?

		We all know that our English Omar cared not for '' rank and office and title , and all the solemn plausibilities of the world '' ; but in recalling his repeated self-depreciation and his frequent hu - morous references to the great world 's disregard of his literary and critical endowments , one should also remember that -LRB- to quote Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	in another connection -RRB- `` the more considerable a man 's gifts , the more likely he is to speak disparagingly of them . ''

		A keen sense of the mocking irony of fate in snatching from our reach the very prize we most covet and seem to ourselves -LRB- in secret -RRB- most to deserve , is not exactly the same as a deliberate re - solve never to win that prize .

		In his blunt bidding of his friends to do no more than acknowledge the receipt of his little books , unless they found some - thing to censure , may be detected
FitzGerald	PERSON	's rec - ognition of the perilous sweetness of praise .

		The naturalist peeps forth , welcomely , in many a passage of Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	's , as for example -- a good quotation to end with -- `` If a man is not greater than the greatest thing he does , the less said about him and them the better .

		His work should drop from him like fruit from a tree .

		Henceforth let the world look after it , if it is worth looking after .

		The tree should have other business . ''

		What constitutes the vagabond poet oowic studies of literary or essayist or story-writer ?

		In his vagabonds . -RSB-

		book , '' The Vagabond in Literature '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , Mr.
Arthur Rickett	PERSON	declares the charac - teristic qualities to be restlessness , a passion for the earth , and constitutional reserve ; and the writers whom he finds especially marked by these attributes are
Hazlitt	PERSON	, DeQuincey , Borrow ,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	, a ; nd Whitman .

		He distinguishes between bohemianism and vagabondage , and though some of his distinctions and definitions seem strained , and many of his opinions are expressed with the finality and certainty of scientific truths , the essays on his chosen seven authors are good as literary apprecia - tions from a particular point of view , and are likely to send more than one reader back again to the imperishable pages of the writers discussed .

		Mr.
Rickett	PERSON	now and then splits hairs , as in calling De Quincey '' a simple nature and a complex tempera - ment . ''

		He speaks of '' the frank confidence of his Confessions '' -- as if ingenuous simplicity covdd anywhere be found in the rhetorical De Quincey , -- but later admits that '' the difference between the editions of De Quincey 's ' Opium Eater ' is sufficient to show how the dreams have expanded under popular approbation . ''

		Of the writing of essays on Thoreau there is no end in sight .

		A little search discovers half a hundred by authors of more or less repute in English and American books and maga - zines , besides the increasing number of formal bio - graphies .

		In this field Mr.
Rickett	PERSON	says nothing strikingly new , but he says enough to betray his own unfamiliarity with
Thoreau	PERSON	's haunts , if not even with his books .

		We read that ''
Thoreau	PERSON	turned his back on civilization , and found a new joy of living in the woods at
Maine	LOCATION	. ''

		The three brief excursions into
Maine	LOCATION	, as related in '' The
Maine Woods	LOCATION	, '' are apparently confused with the sojourn at
Walden	LOCATION	.

		The expression , '' the woods at
Maine	LOCATION	, '' occurs again later .

		Perhaps
Maine	LOCATION	is thought to be the town in which
Walden Pond	ORGANIZATION	lies .

		Even gram - matical slips occur in this unfortunate essay , as '' The riotous growth of eccentricities and idiosyn - crasies are picturesque enough '' ; and , with a reck - less piling up of perfect tenses , '' But one would have liked to have heard much more about them . ''

		Borrow is '' six foot three '' in height .

		These agree - able essays are not epoch-making -- how few books are !

		-- but they offer many a page of good reading , none the worse for being on well-worn themes .

		Studies in The publishers of Professor W. I. the evolution
Thomas	PERSON	's volume of studies in the 0 / Woman .

		social psychology of sex , '' Sex and Society '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , have thought it desirable to issue with it a statement that the press notices commenting upon its concluding chapter -LRB- which appeared earlier in periodical form -RRB- have caused it to be misinterpreted in the direction of an un gallant appraisal of the mentality of the gentler and more sensitive sex .

		It is most unfortu - nate that the insatiable reporter should have seized upon this material for plying his sensational trade ; but since he has done so it is pertinent to state that Professor
Thomas	PERSON	's volume is a sober and for the most part objective study of the influences shaping the life of woman , particularly among primitive peoples in the longer reaches of uncivilized man - kind .

		So far as deductions go , the conclusion is at least equally direct that with the removal of these '' anthropological '' disabilities the mental powers of the feminine mind will be released to a freer and fuller expression of its capabilities .

		Apart from this concluding chapter , which is indeed open to criticism as maintained upon a less consistent plan of exposition than pervades the others , the volume consists of a group of carefully elaborated and well sustained essays upon the organic differences of the sexes , the role of sex in primitive social control , social feeling , industry , morality , family life , and the evolution of modesty ; while the trend of the argument is best brought to a focus in the very in -

		THE DIAL 147 terestlng chapter upon the adventitious character of woman .

		In these delicate fields , among mooted data and conspicuous temptations to hasty inference and convenient though misleading formulae , Professor
Thomas	PERSON	moves with an expert discernment , discloses many a shortcoming in prevalent doctrine , and builds up a consistent objective picture of woman 's socio - logical status .

		Sociology is a new science , and by its invasion of a field in which all who run may read , and all who read may write or argue , is beset with peculiar liability to misinterpretation which may take the shape of ridicule .

		Professor
Thomas	PERSON	should not be held responsible for the vagaries com - mitted under the name of his science , nor for the popular distortion to which his views and his subject - matter lend themselves .

		Pioneers of our national expansion .

		The Westward movement , which in spite of its preeminent importance has only recently begun to receive the attention that it should have from students of the history of our country , is narrated in a pleasant popular manner by Mr.
Archer Butler Hulbert	PERSON	in his '' Pilots of the Republic : The Romance of the Pioneer Promoter in the
Middle West	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		As the title indicates , this movement of our popu - lation and institutions across the Alleghanies and into the farther West is characterized and described through accounts , which may originally have been popular lectures , of some of the leading `` promoters '' of these various expeditions or enterprises , -- those heroes and patriots who personally led these pioneer undertakings and endured their toils and dangers , or those who , hardly less heroes and no less patriots , inspired others to undertake the forward movement of our national expansion and to sufi ^ er in many cases the fate of pioneers .

		These men are well worth reading about , and any book that can make them live again for us of a quieter $ nd less adventur - ous time is a useful one .

		The '' promoters '' whom Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	includes are :
Washington	LOCATION	, the story of whose life-long interest in the
West	LOCATION	and untiring efforts to open it to settlement and commerce make the most interesting chapter in the book ;
Richard Henderson	PERSON	, the founder of
Transylvania	LOCATION	, that first invasion of the red men 's country west of the
Alleghany	ORGANIZATION	mountains ;
Rufus Putnam	PERSON	, the father of
Ohio	LOCATION	;
David Zeisberger	PERSON	, the devoted missionary ;
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	;
Henry Clay	PERSON	, the promoter of the
Cumberland Road	LOCATION	;
Morris	PERSON	and
Clinton	PERSON	, fathers of the
Erie Canal	ORGANIZATION	;
Thomas	PERSON	and
Mercer	PERSON	, rival pro- moters of railway and canal farther south ;
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark ; Astor	PERSON	, the promoter of

		^ Professor
Graziano Paolo Clerici	PERSON	's ' ■ ' ■ II piu Lungo Scandalo del Secolo XIX . ''

		which appeared about three years ago in
Italy	LOCATION	, has been translated and supple - mented by Mr.
Frederic Clmpman	PERSON	, and handsomely published , with many portraits , by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	under the title , '' A Queen of Indiscretions . ''

		Lives of Queen
Caroline	PERSON	, ill-starred consort of
George IV.	PERSON	, there were already in abundance ; but it appears that
Signor Clerici	PERSON	has had access to hitherto unused '' Italian records , both in public departments and in private ownership . ''

		Consequently his pages pre - sent fresh incidents that may modify opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the indiscreet lady who so narrowly escaped conviction of something worse than indiscretion .

		The Italian author 's severity of judgment is balanced by the English editor 's lenity ; and between the two
Caroline	PERSON	comes off rather as frivolous and frail than as deliberately profligate and licentious .

		The poor foolishly-reared girl was by no means a Messalina of wickedness .

		The mys - tery of her early separation from her royal spouse remains a mystery still , though the author attempts an explanation by comparing
George IV	PERSON	.

		in certain emotional and physiological respects to
Rousseau	PERSON	, and by finding in both -LRB- as he thinks -RRB- a congenital defect incapacitating them for marriage .

		Even the
Princess Charlotte	LOCATION	's alleged resemblance to her sup - posed father is not allowed to invalidate this fanciful theory .

		The English reader well versed in his naval history will note the vague reference to
Admiral Sii	ORGANIZATION	''
William Sidney Smith	PERSON	as '' a certain
Sydney Smith	PERSON	. ''

		The index calls him '' Captain Sir
Sydney Smith	PERSON	'' ; but under his portrait the name is correctly given .

		The index , by the way , is evidently not the work of an expert , its entries being unwisely chosen and grouped , and the page references inexact .

		Under ''
Pergami	PERSON	,
Bartolomeo	PERSON	, '' for instance , at least four page numbers lead one astray .

		There is a lack , too , throughout the narrative , of definite acknowledg - ment of sources ; the reader follows his author blindly .

		Fifty-seven portraits and portrait-groups are interspersed .

		Art of the Again Mr.
H. B. Walters	PERSON	comes be - ancient fore the reading world with a book Greeks .

		^ ^ ^ ought to be highly valuable , and again that world has good reason to be disappointed .

		In '' The Art of the Greeks , '' no less than in his '' History of Ancient Pottery , '' the author falls far short of his opportunity .

		The best of the books in the same field is now a decade old , and a decade makes great changes in the facts and theories of archaeology in such an excavating age as ours .

		The new work is far more imposing than the older one , more handsome and ambitious ; but it takes no account of the
Kaufmann	PERSON	head in discussing the Cnidian Aphrodite of Praxiteles .

		It dismisses
Furtwangler	PERSON	's monumental work at
Aegina	LOCATION	with the remark , '' A few additions have been made from the recent excavations , but nothing of special importance . ''

		It says of the Farnese Bull , that '' It was removed to
Rome	LOCATION	and there preserved to this day , '' when even the most casual visitor to the
Naples	LOCATION	Museum any time these eighty years must have seen that conspicuous group , whatever else may have escaped him .

		Such faults are hard to excuse ; but the numerous and handsome illustra - 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, tions do what they can hy way of compensation .

		They are of unusual value , both because of their excellence and their variety , and because they repro - duce many subjects not otherwise easily accessible to the general public .

		Among such old-time favor - ites as the Aphi'odite from Melos , the LaocoOn , and the victory from Samothrace , are pictures less often seen .

		Reproductions of vases and of such bronzes as the charioteer from
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, the youth dredged up near the island of
Cythera	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	's Eros , are so rare except in books designed for specialists that it is gratifying to find so many and such good ones in this work of more popular character .

		The type is in its way as pleasing to the eye as the pictures are in theirs .

		The publishers -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have produced such a charming book in all external respects that it seems a pity it should not be equally satisfying to the mind of the classical scholar .

T. G. Tucker	PERSON	, Professor of Classical of Athenian life .

		Philology in the

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	'' Handbooks of Archaeology and Antiquities . ''

		The volume is a treatise on Athenian life at its most attract - ive period -- that is , roughly speaking , the cen - tury beginning with 440 b. c and is presented in an easy , readable '' footnoteless '' form for the general reader , although the author endeavors to incorporate the results of even the most recent in - vestigations .

		The first sixteen chapters treat of such subjects as Public Buildings , Citizens , Out - landers , Slaves , Women , Social Day of a Typical Citizen ,
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, Festivals , and the Thea - tre .

		The seventeenth chapter deals with the Modern - ness of th ^ Athenians .

		The eighty-five illustrations are generally well chosen and modern , although not a few of them are pretty familiar -- the restoration of the
Acropolis	LOCATION	, for instance , being our old friend from
Schreiber	PERSON	's Atlas .

		The general style may be characterized in the author 's words as '' the oppo - site of pedantic , utilizing any vivacities of method which are consistent with truth of fact '' ; and it must be adnjitted that these vivacities are sometimes of questionable felicity .

		On the whole , the volume achieves its modest aim , which at once disarms criticism ; but it rather suffers from the inevitable comparison with some of the other members of the same series , as Professor
Ernest Gardner	PERSON	's admir - able '' Handbook of Greek Sculpture , '' or Professor
A. H. J. Greenidge	PERSON	's concise presentation of '' Roman Public Life . ''

		T - '' c - r '' 5 1 < • of Reiiuious plied to Prof essor Pratt s study of Belief . ''

		religious belief , to say that it pre - sents a very sane attitude toward the complex data involved .

		Its sanity consists of a wholesome and equally a discerning determination to view the facts as they are , and as finding an illumination in the teachings of modern psychology as embodied in the modern man .

		The sustaining position of the thesis is that religious belief , conformably to the status of belief as a psychological product , presents itself in three forms which are concisely formulated as the religion of primitive credulity , the religion of thought , and the religion of feeling .

		The psycho - logical foundation of the former is reached in the inevitable unanalysed attitude of the psychic novice , the child or the savage , -- that of acceptance , of reaction in a positive and simple manner to the situations of life .

		Among these are beliefs as well as customs ; and thus tradition and the religion of primitive credulity are formed and preserved .

		With experience comes reason , analysis , and doubt ; and in the positive religious field , dogma and theology .

		Yet underlying all is the true motive that makes mystics of some , brings conversion to others , and engenders prayer , devotion , and the sensitiveness to the eternal mysteries .

		These phases are exemplified in the great historical religions , as well as in the unfoldment of every thoughtful life .

		They are rein - forced in a somewhat novel manner in the present volume by an analysis of the responses to a religious '' questionaire . ''

		The author believes strongly in the

		The present edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- follows closely the plan of the first one published in
1897	DATE	.

		As before , the work is essentially a compilation .

		There has been very little attempt to harmonize conflicting views , and almost none at independent interpretation .

		The pages devoted to rocks and to soils reflect current views rather than suggest new ones .

		The chapters devoted to rock-weathering are the best in the book , and constitute in the aggregate our most authoritative treatise on this subject .

		In them Dr.
Merrill	PERSON	gives the results of personal investigations , and is at his best .

		His con - clusions are interesting and suggestive , but subject to all the doubt incident to the necessity of making in each case a first assumption as to the stability of some one element in the rock .

		The fact that the element chosen differs with each rock indicates that there is no great certainty as to this assump - tion .

		The book is especially useful to readers who desire a knowledge of the general facts and princi - ples involved in the study of rocks and their change into soils .

B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	, will en - able the reader to comprehend the motive of an artist inspired by the national renascence of the Jews as expressed in the modern Zionistic movement .

		Four - teen reproductions from the black and white designs of this artist , whose manner reflects that of the
Munich	LOCATION	'' Secessionists , '' bear witness to a symbolism at once lucid and forcible , and to the optimistic confidence for the future of the Jews as an agricultural race in
Pales	LOCATION	- tine .

		The work will appeal alike to those who have an interest in the rejuvenation of an ancient race , and to those who will be attracted by a technique suggestive of the skill of Japanese decorators and of the European masters of line-work .

		Longfellow 's inaugural address at
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	, delivered by him ,

		Printed from the autograph manuscript , it makes a volume of 130 pages , four inches by seven .

		It is a book that should appeal to collectors as well as to

N. C. Wyeth	ORGANIZATION	.

		Large 12mo .


$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		By
KATE	PERSON	and
VIRGIL D. BOYLES	PERSON	This is a capital story about
South Dakota	LOCATION	in the days when the '' rustlers '' held sway in the cattle country -- when they owned the deputy sheriffs and the juries -- owned almost everybody except
Paul Langford	PERSON	and
Gordon	PERSON	, the county attor - ney .

		Langford of the Three Bars ranch was the man who had thrown not only the whole weight of his personal influence , which was much , but his whole - hearted and aggressive service as well , into the long and bitter fight .

		And
Richard Gordon	PERSON	was another such , although every one seemed against him and against his law .

		Then there is
Jim Munson	PERSON	, a splendid characterization of the real cowboy , whose whole life is bound up in the Three Bars '' outfit , '' and against him the sinister figure of
Jesse Black	PERSON	, who makes all the trouble -- and the story as well .

		Seldom has a book contained so many characters that stand for plains life as it actually was in those days , or so many that have the faculty of appeal - ing to the reader .

		In Mr.
N. C. Wyeth	PERSON	the publishers feel that they have an illustrator who now stands unequalled in this class of work .

		His pictures have a truth , a strength , and an artistic stand - ard that simply compel attention .

		THE IRON WAY By
SARAH PRATT CARR	PERSON	The `` Iron Way '' is the
Central Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	.

		The completion of this great enterprise in
1869	DATE	provides the material for a story full of action and the power of big events .

		The author has made skilful use of some of the giant promoters of that day --
Leland Stanford	PERSON	,
Collis P. Huntington	PERSON	,
Mark Hopkins	PERSON	, and
Charles Crocker	PERSON	, upon whose initiative the railroad was planned and built .

		Of course it is not all railroad , for there is a most attractive love story involving the fortunes of
Alfred Vincent	PERSON	and
Stella Anthony	PERSON	, and there is plenty of the lively action characteristic of
California	LOCATION	in her early days .

		The railroad is but the vehicle for the tale .

		THE STORY OF BAWN By
KATHARINE TYNAN Miss Tynan	PERSON	has her own field , and her many admirers are perfectly content to have her continue in it to the extent of its possibilities .

		In the portrayal of cer - tain aspects of Irish life she has no equal , and her readers have learned to rely upon her .

		Her latest heroine , belonging to an old and honored family in reduced circumstances , is not unlike `` Julia '' and `` A Daughter of the Fields , '' and the story of her life is worked out with
Miss Tynan	PERSON	's customary delightful sentiment and cheerful humor .

		And again we find the careful avoidance of sensation and theatrical clap-trap which is one of this author 's greatest charms .

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 199 TRU
TEXAS	LOCATION	WAY .

		Comment is frequently made upon our na - tional character as an easy-going people .

		We are so tolerant of abuses , until they become unbearably acute , that we submit to all sorts of discomforts and petty impositions rather than exert the energy needed for their remedy .

		When matters come to a really serious pass , we are apt to assert ourselves emphatically enough ; but until such a crisis is reached , we are accus - tomed to bear the ills we have -LRB- and might easily be spared -RRB- as if they were inherent in the natu - ral order .

		This national trait of ours is respon - sible for a great deal of petty annoyance , of which we can not reasonably complain , since we make no serious effort to get rid of it .

		We submit to the theatre hat , and the tipping sys - tem , and the vulgar newspaper , not indeed without a murmur , but without any overt act of protest indicative of the courage of conviction .

		Being in this supine and craven state , it may be worth our while to heed the lesson of a recent happening in a
Texas	LOCATION	town .

		Upon the occasion in question , an opera company gave a performance of '' II Barbiere di Siviglia . ''

		Confiding in the proverbial simplicity of back - woodsmen , the director of the company short - ened the performance by omitting one act of the work .

		But he reckoned without his host .

		Cidture is abroad in these days , and it hums even in darkest
Texas	LOCATION	.

		This artistic affront caused the worm to turn , and the
Texas	LOCATION	audi - ence expressed its resentment with characteristic frontier strenuosity .

		Riot was incipient ; and without mincing words , these
Texas	LOCATION	champions of the artistic ideal expressed themselves with point and emphasis , concluding with a demand for the return of the money that had been be - guiled from their pockets by a delusive prospect .

		The
Texas	LOCATION	way of dealing with such offences may be rough , but it is sharply effective , and other communities shoidd profit by the example .

		The same opera company was guilty of the same offence in
Chicago	LOCATION	a fortnight earlier , and also of a similar offence in the presentation of still another opera .

		We are not particularly con - cerned to exalt '' Les Huguenots '' as a musical masterpiece , but when its performance is an - nounced , and when the playbills describe it truthfully , as '' an opera in five acts , '' there is , to 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, put the matter mildly , a good deal of bad faith , if not actual dishonesty , in omitting the fifth act altogether .

		This is the trick that was played upon the
Chicago	LOCATION	audience ; and there is no de - fence in saying that others have played the same trick before .

		Even a Meyerbeer opera deserves more respectful treatment than that ; whatever artistic quality '' Les Huguenots '' may have is utterly destroyed by abruptly ending the per - formance before it reaches its dramatic climax in the tragedy of the street scene .

		It is high time for the long-suffering opera-loving public to express its resentment at the false pretenses -LRB- of which the above is one out of many instances -RRB- that have gone practically unrebuked for as many years as we can remember .

		Changing slightly the venue of this discus - sion , we may recall the fact mentioned in our last issue , when , speaking of the causes which led to the failure of the
New Theatre	LOCATION	, we spoke of the director 's unconscionable mutilation of certain of the plays he undertook to produce .

		This was a particularly wanton proceeding , for it was done , not because he thought the plays improved by abridgment , but for the inartistic purpose of making room on the programme for curtain-raisers , -- which simply means taking a step away from legitimate theatrical enterprise in the direction of vaudeville .

		The chapter of theatrical offences of this sort is a long one , and every frequenter of the playhouse has suffered from them many times .

		The crimes that have been committed against
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	alone would require a volume to recount .

		From
Nahum Tate	ORGANIZATION	and
CoUey Cibber	ORGANIZATION	to Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	and Mr.
Sothem	PERSON	, almost every actor or manager who has undertaken Shakespearian productions has felt perfectly free to make any rearrange - ments he might wish , to distort and mutilate at his will in accordance with his own crude no - tions , of theatrical effect .

		We may admit , in this case , that the conditions of our stage are so different from those of the Elizabethan stage that some changes are necessary for a modern production ; but to say this is by no means to condone such perversions as
Tate	ORGANIZATION	's '' Lear '' and Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	's '' Henry the Fifth . ''


Altera	ORGANIZATION	- tions made in a reverent spirit , with a sense of the sanctity of the masterpiece dealt with , may be allowed ; alterations made as concessions to sentiment or sensationalism , for spectacular pvir - poses or the gratification of an actor 's personal vanity , should be censiired in the strongest terms .

		And in the case of a modern play , which has no need of being fitted to modem stage conditions , any kind of tinkering is rep - rehensible .

		It is an act of sheer dishonesty to advertise a play that already belongs to lit - erature , and present something quite different .

		If the play has been changed in any material way , the public is entitled to be told beforehand just what the changes are , and not left to discover them during the course of the performance .

		If dramatic literature suffers severely from the sort of treatment here described , those other species of literature that make their appeal to us solely from the printed page suffer in a far greater proportion simply because their volume is so much the greater .

		To catalogue the sins of editors and publishers in this respect would be an undertaking calculated to stagger the most industrious .

		But we trust that all such sinners are finally brought together in Male - bolge .

		They include , among others , the anthol - ogists who reprint mutilated forms of famous poems , without indicating where omissions have been made ; the editors of school and coUege texts , who slash their originals right and left , with no word of warning for unwary students ; the publishers who offer '' complete works , '' knowing them to be incomplete , and who reprint early editions which they know to have been superseded , but without vouchsafing a hint of this important fact .

		The expurgators constitute a peculiarly vicious class of these criminals , since their sins are so cunningly con - cealed as to be almost impossible of detection .

		Does it never occur to these gentlemen that their zeal for the suppression of the merely verbal forms of literary offence results in a form of dishonesty that is far more subtly mischievous than the evil -LRB- often illusory -RRB- which they are seeking to minimize ?

		The more we think of the
Texas	LOCATION	way of deal - ing with artistic misrepresentations and false pretences , the more we are inclined to applaud it .

		There may be other and better ways , but any way is better than none .

		We should like to see every perverter and falsifier of a work of art or literature made thoroughly uncomfort - able , until the lesson had been so repeatedly enforced as to be no longer needed .

		This is far from saying that such works should never be altered for any purpose whatever , but it is say - ing that they shoidd not be tampered with by incompetent bunglers , and it is also saying that in the cases which reaUy caU for some judicious reshaping or abridgment , the public is entitled , as a matter of common honesty , to be exactly informed of the nature of whatever changes have been made , or whatever liberties taken , with the original of the work .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 173
WENDELL PHILLIPS GARRISON	PERSON	.

		The causes of sane literary progress and intelli - gent citizenship have seldom had a more faithful devotee than Mr.
Wendell Phillips Garrison	PERSON	, whose death occurred on the
27th of last month	DATE	.

		Casting in his lot with the late
Edwin Lawrence Godkin	PERSON	, at twenty-five years of age , he gave his strength and talents to '' The Nation '' with a zeal that knew no break until failing health forced upon him the un - welcome necessity of laying the burden down with the close of the eighty-second volimie , a little more than
eight months ago	DATE	.

		As the known author of the keenest and most effective political criticism ever developed in the history of American journalism , Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's personality could never be merged in that of his paper .

		To many , therefore , '' The Nation '' meant Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	, and they never knew that there sat at his side a colleague whose labors from the very start were as vital to the character and success of the paper as those of the brilliant political critic himself .

		Of course Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	realized the worth of his coadjutor , and the recogni - tion which Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	's impenetrable modesty would not permit to be granted in any public way was always most amply bestowed in their private intercourse and correspondence .

		Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	's preeminent service to '' The Nation , '' and through it to the causes for which it has stood , lay in the remarkable insight displayed in making up his large body of reviewers and contributors , and the success with which he held them together .

		As an illustra - tion of this we need only mention that Mr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, Dr.
Daniel C. Gilman	PERSON	, and Prof.
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	have been contributors from the very first year , a nucleus for forty years of literary criticism which would have done honor to any criti - cal jom-nal ever published in the English tongue .

		During the
summer of 1905	DATE	, when some two hun - dred of his collaborators united in presenting him with a beautiful silver vase , as a token of their per - sonal esteem no less than their admiration for his editorial ability , the general public learned just how far and how carefully Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	had been ac - customed to search for the right man for any par - ticular line of review work or correspondence which he desired .

		And the marvel lies not merely in the fact that the list contained so many names of known eminence in the world of letters and science , but even more in the substantial unity of tone which steadily marked the body of criticism coming from this numerous , widely separated , differently edu - cated and differently circumstanced body of men .

		Of course this unity was no forcible creation of the coiTective editorial pencil , although no editor ever knew better how to wield that pencil , within legiti - mate limits .

		Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	would have scorned to make a contributor say what he did not think , nor would he have wanted any contributor willing to continue as such on that basis .

		It was his wide knowledge of men , coupled with extremely careful experiment where previous knowledge was not pos - sible , enabling him thus to pick men who shared his own high ideals and sincerely believed in the funda - mental principles on which those ideals were based , that gave the literary criticisms of '' The Nation '' a unity and steadiness of tone rarely if ever sur - passed in the history of critical journalism .

		A foe to all sham , insincerity , and corruption , in letters or in life , he stood as unflinchingly for his ideals as his father before him had stood for the correction of the great wrong of human slavery , and at bottom both w ` fere fighting against the same enemies -- ignor - ance , preconceived error , and selfish personal in - terests .

		Whatever other token friends may wish to establish in his memory , those eighty-two vol - umes of '' The Nation '' into which his virtues and energies were so unstintingly poured , with their steady appeal to that enlightened intelligence and morality upon which the progress of civilization must always depend , constitute a monument the fitness of which can never be excelled .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A poets ' trade-union has been formed in
England	LOCATION	, or so we are told by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	in a pleasant little article contributed to the
London	LOCATION	'' Chronicle '' ; and when
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	shall have passed the biU draughted by the xmion 's secretary , Mr.
Baunder	PERSON	, '' a gentleman of prosperous aspect , with a strong German accent , '' En - gland will speedily become a veritable '' nest of singing birds . ''

		By the provisions of this bill every citizen will be forced to buy annually a new volume of poetry -- or , rather , a volume of new poetry -- for every twenty poiuids of income that he has over three himdred pounds a year .

		Thus a prosperous merchant , or soap - boiler , or tallow chandler , with an income of two thou - sand pounds , let us say , will piu-chase eight hundred and fifty poetry books of the latest make every twelve mouths , at a uniform statute price of six shillings net .

		This protection to poets is considered necessary because poetry is at present so much less popidar than , for instance , history , archseology , and ethics ; whereby it has come about that , as
Herr Baunder	PERSON	affirms , '' the poets are remorselessly sweated ; thousands of them can not earn any wage at all , not to speak of ` living wage . '

		A guinea for a sonnet ; what do you think of that ? ''

		Shameful , in good sooth , and we hope for the early passage of the Baunder Bill -- but with an impor - tant additional clause .

		It should provide for pass exam - inations to be undergone by all purchasers of poetry , to ensiu-e that such poetry is read as well as bought .

		Not only must the hoi ` se be led to water , but he must be made to drink , and drink deeply , at the Pierian
spring	DATE	, under penalty of a heavy fine , or lingering incarceration , or both .

		How else infuse in the people a true and lasting love of divine poetry ?

		• • • Guardians for superannuated authors may be thought desirable if certain tendencies now discernible among some of our veterans of the pen should become strongly developed .

		Mr.
Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	, in com - uig to the defense of Shakespeare and in accusing Count Tolstoi of taking imfair advantage of European 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, dense ignorance of the poet , puts the query why the venerable Russian has not been prevented by those around him from making an unedifying display of him - self , and suggests that some friend or relative should take steps to spare him the humilation that must attend a further exhibition of the decay now undermining his mental powers .

		Another great writer , Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, who has just passed his eightieth milestone , is thought by many to have his impulses of unwisdom .

		His prose output , ceasing to take the form of fiction -- his last novel came out twelve years ago -- has of late appeared in the shape of rather excited political utter - ances , and of a sensational and much-discussed sm - gestion as to the expediency of probationary wedlock .

		That an author who toiled so strenuously in early man - hood -- spending his last guinea on one occasion for a sack of oatmeal , on which he subsisted while writing a book -- and who has done so much good work and raised himself to rank as one of the very foremost of living English prose writers , and as no mean poet , should now be suffered to do anything that may , even temporarily , dim the lustre of his renown , is to be de - plored .

		Few are the writers that can wield the pen , as did Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	and Mrs.
Somerville	LOCATION	and
Alexander	PERSON	von Humboldt , with even more power at eighty and over than at forty or fifty .

		• • * The U8E8 OF fiction , recently referred to in these columns under the heading '' Fiction as a Rest Cure , '' should have included '' Fiction as an Advertising Me - dium . ''

		The fiction-writer of the future , in order to be pecimiarily successful , may have to specialize as rigor - ously as does the historian or the scientist of to-day .

		At any rate , this is the opinion which such advertisements as the following might incline one to form .

		The first is from a
London	LOCATION	literary review of the highest standing . ' '

		The Editor of the
Talking Machine News	ORGANIZATION	requires stobies -LRB- 1,500 to 2,500 -RRB- with a
Talking Machine	ORGANIZATION	motif .

		Technical ac - curacy essential .

		Suitable articles would also be entertained .

		Specimen copy on application . ''

		The second is from a great city daily of equally high rank .

		``
$ 75	MONEY	Prize Stories .

		We want a short story of about 3000 words covering , in a catchy , readable way , the facts outlined in our booklet , ' Some Shoe Beforms . '

		Address , '' etc. .

		Many an artist , trained in the schools of
Paris	LOCATION	or
Munich	LOCATION	, has come at last to turn his back on '' art for art 's sake , '' and now earns a comfortable , sometimes a more than comfortable , livelihood as a designer of posters , anonymous works of art that are never rejected by an examining committee , and if they are elevated to the skies are all the more conspicuous .

		Who knows how many zealous and gifted followers of
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	may be glad some day to answer just such advertisements as the foregoing ?

		Fortunately or unfortunately , the crowding of the pro- fessions is making such things increasingly possible .

		• • • The new uteraky movement among the Spanish - American PEOPLES has for one of its first fruits a little volume of tales and prose poems ,
Noche Tragica	ORGANIZATION	, by the Cuban poet ,
Senor Arturo R. de Carricarte	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is noteworthy how much of the strong , tragic work of the day is coming from
Southern	ORGANIZATION	sources .

		Out of the sunshine , out of the flowers , out of the gay life of the semi-tropic lands , come books as terrible and soul - shaking as their earthquakes and eruptions .

		The French and Italian tragedians deal less with the outward conditions of life -- sociological problems , questions of reform or change -- than do their Northern compeers .

		They are avid of the elemental human passions .

		As a result , their work has a certain beauty and splendor , where that of Ibsen and
Tolstoi	PERSON	and
Turgenieff	PERSON	and the German dramatists is homely if not ugly .

		On the other hand , the best work of
the North	ORGANIZATION	has a mystic glamour which the South knows nothing of .

		Noche Tragica is a good example of the school we have been describing .

		It is a tale which M ^ rim ^ e would have liked .

		Fate , in it , is masked in flowers , but marches onward with implacable tread .

		All of Sefior de
Carri	PERSON	- carte 's pieces have a sombre soul beneath a bright ex - terior .

		In some of the prose-poems he shows an acute sensibility to natural phenomena -- like a
Maurice de Gudrin	PERSON	translated to the tropics .

		According to a cus - tom more observed on the Continent of
Europe	LOCATION	than in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	, there is prefaced to this little book a long essay by
Senor Ricardo del Monte	ORGANIZATION	, the most brilliant of Cuban critics .

		This discourse is a keen examination of modern thought and literary creation .

		It is always instructive to get at a different view-point from our own .


Senor Del Monte	ORGANIZATION	is at the centre of a horizon quite other than ours .

		The stars of modern literature arrange themselves to his eyes in a different way than they show in our sky .

		The constellations of
France	LOCATION	since
1830	DATE	blaze overhead .

		Single Italian or Spanish or German stars mount or descend .

		But only a few English suns peer above the horizon , and the Russian and Scandinavian and American hosts of light are invisible .

		The last photograph of
Longfellow	LOCATION	, not in fin - ished form , but in the negative -- from which no posi - tive had ever been printed -- has been accidentally discovered by a yoimg lad in
South Boston	LOCATION	, a photo - grapher 's assistant .

		The story of this forgotten photo - graph is interesting .

		In late
February , 1882	DATE	, the poet was walking along Brattle street ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, when he was accosted by a friend , a Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, photographer , who asked him to sit for his likeness before a new lens that he ,
Allen	PERSON	, had just bought for his camera .

		Long - fellow refused to visit the studio , but at last consented to pose on his own veranda ; and there , only a month before his death , he sat for what proved to be his last portrait .

		The negative , filed away and lost sight of , passed with the rest of the photographer 's outfit into other hands , and in a subsequent removal of the busi - ness to its present location the precious piece of clouded glass was trundled along with a pile of other un - considered negatives .

		Pulled forth very recently by chance , and held up to the light by an apprentice in a moment of idle curiosity , it was fortunately recognized by him ; and now its owner would not part with it for love or money .

		Coming to view twenty-five years after it was taken , and a hundred years after the poet was born , it is a remarkable bit of treasure trove .

		• • • A national
Dickens	PERSON	library is getting itself estab - lished in
London	LOCATION	, in the heat of the
Dickens	PERSON	enthusiasm aroused by the ninety-fifth anniversary , last month , of the great novelist 's birthday .

		A room in the
Guildhall Library	ORGANIZATION	will be set apart for this collection , the nucleus of which has been already formed out of the first editions of all the novels , with noteworthy American and other reprints and translations , and miscellaneous Dickensiana of sundry sorts .

		The widow of the late
F. G. Kitton	PERSON	, offers to the library his valuable
Dickens	PERSON	collection for the moderate sum of # 300 , and sub -
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 175 scriptions for its purchase are solicited by the editor of `` T. P. 's Weekly '' -LRB- which itself gives # 25 -RRB- at 5 Tavistock Street , W. C .

		A flourishing periodical , '' The Dickensian , '' published once a week by the
Dickens Fellowship	ORGANIZATION	, attests the English determination not to forget their immortal ''
Boz	PERSON	. ''

		At the same time , let it be gently hinted , there be those to whose delicate senses the air of a
Thackeray Library	ORGANIZATION	would more sweetly recommend itself .

		But patience !

		--
1911	DATE	is only four years distant .

		, , .

		The popularization of the best literature is to be attempted , with a display of childlike confidence that is nothing short of touching , by a new magazine , whose prospectus does not hesitate to declare that '' the very highest class and most valuable branches of litera - ture can readily be made fully as interesting , attractive , and even fascinating to all classes , even to the morbid - minded and degenerate , as is now the prevailing low order of the great bulk of sensational , exciting , stirring so-called ' literature , ' so boimteously scat - tered broadcast in its corrupting and demoralizing blight upon mankind . ''

		One would like to know the magic formula for rendering , let us say ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	or
John Ruskin	PERSON	as irresistible to the multitude as the latest murder mystery or sensational romance or lui'id detective story .

		We wait to learn this , but not , alas !

		in a spirit of confidence that is altogether childlike .

		• • • The death of `` Th .

		Bentzon , '' or Mme. Th ^ r ^ se de
Solms Blanc	PERSON	, as her friends knew her , will be noted with regret by many outside her native
France	LOCATION	, and especially by her American readers .

		Always friendly toward this coimtry and its literary workers , she has published , chiefly in the pages of the Revue des
Deux Mondes	PERSON	, many commendatory reviews of American books , eulogistic studies of American authors , and pleasant reminiscences of American travel .

		That she wrote also between thirty and forty novels comes as a surprise to most of us , who have commonly thought of her in connection with her more serious work , on which her fame as a writer will probably rest .

		• • > A Hebraization of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	's Rubaiyat has been undertaken by Mr.
Joseph Massel	PERSON	of Man - chester ,
England	LOCATION	; his version being based on
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's first edition , by many considered the best of the four .

		These haunting quatrains seem to have , in some sort , an affinity with the `` Wisdom books of the Old Testament , and a good Hebrew translation ought to prove , not perhaps the best-selling book in the
Ghetto	LOCATION	, but a tolerable literary success .

		Yet supposing the Hebrew version of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's stanzas to be faithfully turned back into Persian , would old Omar know himself at the end of this lingual hocus-pocus ?

		COMMUNICA TION .

		ON READING THE MAGAZINES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial.J Few publishers of magazines seem to realize the frame of mind most people are in when they pick up a magazine .

		I say most people , because there are a few who read the magazines religiously , as they might read the
Bible	LOCATION	, regardless of comfort or convenience .

		But as a rule people take up a magazine at a time when they are enjoying a few moments of leisure which they wish to spend as pleasurably and comfortably as possible .

		A man may be leaning back in his seat on the train , smok - ing a cigar , and rejoicing that he is to have a short respite from the harassing cares of business ; or he maybe puffing his pipe beside a grate fire , mider a green-shaded lamp , relaxing cosily after a day 's hard work , and taking up a magazine for diversion .

		I do not know so much about feminine ways , but I should fancy a woman might be reclining for her siesta , and open a magazine for a little mental relaxation and composure before she closes her eyes .

		Now I maintain that most of our magazines are not adapted to such a frame of mind .

		This is not because their contents are too serious , but simply because the magazines are so constructed mechanically that it is a physical effort to read them .

		In plain English , it tires the thumbs .

		Why do publishers put their magazines together so that they will not lie open on the lap ?

		How is a man to smoke his pipe as he reads , when he must hold the magazine open by all the strength of both hands ?

		I know of only one or two magazines that are properly boimd with thread and glue , instead of those irritating wire clasps .

		No doubt the clasps are cheaper , or they would not be used .

		That is the explanation of most of the impositions on a long-suffering public .

		But I believe any magazine publisher could increase his circulation by abolishing the clasps .

		The other day I closed my subscription to a magazine I had taken for years , and ordered another in its place , chiefly for the reason that one would not lie open on the table and the other would .

		The wire clasps were a doubtful economy , surely , in that case .

		Another reason why many magazines are unsuitable for leisurely reading is that they are too heavy and bulky with advertisements .

		I am aware that there must be advertisements to make the magazine pay .

		I would even go further , and maintain that most of our magazines are conducted primarily in the interest of the advertising department , and that the literary matter is sandwiched in merely to get people to read the adver - tisements .

		But why in that case should this not unwor - thy commercial end be defeated by making the magazine so heavy and forbidding that not even the advertise - ments will be read ?

		Other things being at all equal , I always buy the magazines that contain the fewest advertisements .

		When I must read a magazine that is so thick with advertisements that I can not hold it open , I tear off the cover , extract the wire clasps , detach the advertising pages in front and back , and tlien restore the clasps to their places .

		I thus have a light and easily handled collection of reading matter , while the detached pages make excellent material for starting fires in my grate .

		A handy mechanical device for per - forming this separation quickly and easily would find speedy favor with the magazine reading public ; indeed , 1 should not be surprised to learn that one has already been invented .

		It would not be the first instance of greed over-reaching itself and defeating its own ends .

		With all their faults , the magazines of to-day contain a great deal of good literature .

		While there is much in them that is worthless or of merely temporary inter - est , there is also much of value , which intelligent people can ill afford to miss .

		Publishers certainly owe it to their readers , as well as to their own interests , to make the contents of their magazines as accessible and as conveniently read as possible .

		Home Impressions of an Expatriated American .

		* It was of course to be expected that Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, in recording his impressions of the land from which he long ago expatriated himself , and which he lately revisited after nearly twenty-five years , would give us not so much his direct impressions -LRB- supposing a mind so subtile to be capable of direct and simple impressions -RRB- as his impressions of his impressions , his con - ception of what , in the aesthetic and artistic fitness of things , his impressions ought to be , and occasionally a side-glance at those impres - sions as he conceives they may impress his reader , -- all intertwisted and interwoven and wrought out in a pattern of that labyrinthine intricacy that is at once the despair and the delight of him who would thread the Daedalian mazes of this author 's wonderful prose .

		Even as Mr.
James	PERSON	drives from the wharf in
New York	LOCATION	, on landing , the extreme difficulty of the task before him presents itself as somewhat terrifying . ''

		Yes ; I could remind myself , as I weut , that
Naples	LOCATION	, that
Tangiers	LOCATION	or
Constantinople	LOCATION	, has probably nothing braver to flaunt , and mingle with excited recognition the still finer throb of seeing in advance , seeing even to alarm , many of the responsibilities lying in wait for the habit of headlong critical or fanciful reaction , many of the inconsistencies in which it would probably have , at the best , more or less defiantly to drape itself ... Nothing was left , for the rest of the episode , but a kind of fluidity of appreciation -- a mild , warm wave that broke over the succession of aspects and objects accord - ing to some odd inward rhythm , and often , no doubt , with a violence that there was little in the phenomena them - selves flagrantly to justify .

		It floated me , my wave , all that day and the next ; so that I still think tenderly -- for the short backward view is already a distance with ' tone ' -- of the service it rendered me and the various perceptive penetrations , charming coves of still blue water , that carried me up into the subject , so to speak , and enabled me to step ashore . ''

		Already in the preface to '' The American Scene ' the reader has been made aware of the writer 's deep sense of the weighty responsibility resting on him as a recorder of impressions , and of his brave resolve to face the situation , formi - dable though it be , with a noble courage . ''

		There would be a thousand matters -- matters already the theme of prodigious reports and statistics -- as to which I should have no sense whatever , and as to information about which my record would accordingly stand naked and unashamed .

		It shoidd unfailingly be •

		proved against me that my opportunity had found me incapable of information , incapable alike of receiving and of imparting it ; for then , and then only , would it be clearly enough attested that I had cared and under - stood . ''

		Mr.
James	PERSON	has been , as he says , all his days '' artistically concerned with the human subject '' ; and hence it is his impressions of American men and women that form the most characteristic portion of his volume , and that furnish the best passages for quoting .

		Of our men and women in general he says : '' No impression so promptly assaults the arriving visitor of the
United States	LOCATION	as that of the overwhelming preponderance , wherever he turns and twists , of the ifnmitigated ' business-man ' face , ranging through its various possibilities , its extraordinary actualities , of intensity .

		And I speak here of facial cast and expres - sion alone , leaving out of account the questions of voice , tone , utterance and attitude , the chorus of which would vastly swell the testimony , and in which I seem to dis - cern , for these remarks at large , a treasure of illus - tration to come .

		Nothing , meanwhile , is more concom - itantly striking than the fact that the women , over the land -- allowing for every element of exception -- - ap - pear to be of a markedly finer texture than the men , and that one of the liveliest signs of this difference is precisely in their less narrowly specialized , their less commercialized , distinctly more generalized , physiog - nomic character .

		The superiority thus noted , and which is quite another matter from the universal fact of the mere usual female femininity , is far from con - stituting absolute distinction , but it constitutes relative , and it is a circumstance at which interested observation snatches , from the first , with an immense sense of its portee . ''

		This distinction he regards as the feature of the social scene , and uncommonly fruitful of possibilities .

		In aU this there is cheer and hope for those who are inclined to deplore , as too obtrusively prevalent among us , the business - woman type , the new woman , and the bachelor maid .

		Any attempt to epitomize Mr.
James	PERSON	, or to reproduce him in other than his own words , would be rashly presumptuous and inevitably imsuccessfid .

		This must be the excuse , if excuse were needed , for introducing another consider - able passage , one that was inspired by a visit to
New York	LOCATION	's Ghetto .

		The reader will bear in mind that no other city has so many of the children of
Israel	LOCATION	.

		He will not need to be told to admire the skill of the literary artist in the following word-picture : '' There is no swarming like that of
Israel	LOCATION	when once
Israel	LOCATION	has got a start , and the scene here bristled , at every step , with the signs and sounds , immitigable , un - mistakable , of a Jewry that had burst all bounds ... It was as if we had been thus , in the crowded , hustled roadway where multiplication , multiplication of every - thing , was the dominant note , at the bottom of some vast sallow aquarium in which innumerable fish of over -
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 177 developed proboscis , were to bump together , forever , amid heaped spoils of the sea .

		The children swarmed above all -- here was multiplication with a vengeance ; and the number of very old persons , of either sex , was almost equally remarkable ; the very old persons being in equal vague occupation of the doorstep , pavement , curbstone , gutter , roadway , and every one alike using the street for overflow ... There are small , strange animals , known to natural history , snakes or worms , I believe , who , when cut into pieces , wriggle away con - tentedly and live in the snippet as completely as in the whole .

		So the denizens of the
New York Ghetto	LOCATION	, heaped as thick as the splinters on the table of a glass-blower , had each , like the fine glass particle , his or her indi - vidual share of the whole hard glitter of
Israel	LOCATION	. ''

		Of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, with its bone-rackiiig cobble - stone pavements , its alternate dust and mud , and its unsightly and unfragrant surface drain - age -- an ensemble not attractive to most visitors , nor by any means inclining them to picture the city in retrospect as an '' almost unnaturally good child '' sitting '' on the green apron of its nurse , with no concomitant crease or crumple '' -- the author , after some playful disparagement of the fine
Washington	LOCATION	monument , is moved to exclaim : '' Wonderful little
Baltimore	LOCATION	, in which , whether when perched on a noble eminence or passing from one seat of the humanities , one seat of hospitality , to another -- a process mainly consisting indeed , as it seemed to me , of prompt drives through romantic parks and wood - lands that were all suburban yet all Arcadian -- I caught no glimpse of traffic , however mild , nor spied anything * tall ' at the end of any vista .

		This was in itself really a benediction , since I had nowhere , from the first , been infatuated with tallness ; I was infatuated only with the question of manners , in their largest sense -- to the finer essence of which tallness had already defined itself to me as positively abhorrent ... Admirable I found them , the
Maryland	LOCATION	boroughs , and so immediately dis - posed about the fortunate town , by parkside and lonely lane , by trackless hillside and tangled copse , that the depth of rural effect becomes at once bewildering .

		You wonder at the absent transitions , you look in vain for the shabby fringes -- or at least , under my spell , I did ; you have never seen , on the lap of nature , so large a burden so neatly accommodated . ''

		No traffic however mild , no shabby fringes !

		Surely , our traveller must have passed his time in grove-embowered villas in the city 's most favored suburbs , if it has any such .

		Yet we learn from his own narrative that he did not do this .

		The best of health and spirits , then , must have been his during the
Baltimore	LOCATION	sojourn .

		The author 's itinerary included , in an autumn and winter progress from
New England	LOCATION	to
Florida	LOCATION	, the intervening cities of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Richmond	LOCATION	, and
Charleston	LOCATION	, be - sides
New York	LOCATION	and
Baltimore	LOCATION	.


Boston	LOCATION	, it need hardly be added , was not overlooked , nor were
Concord	LOCATION	and Salem and
Newport	LOCATION	, and other interesting parts of
New England	LOCATION	.

		The book is one to read in at length , if not to read through , and can not be presented by the reviewer in a nutshell .

		Its pages are strewn with the happiest phrases and turns of expression .

		They teem with passages of exquisite artistry , which , with - out reference to the scenes and objects so deli - cately depicted , are a joy to the lover of the gracefidly elaborate , the subtilely expressive and still more subtilely suggestive , in English prose .

		Those readers whom the end of the vol - ume shall leave unsatisfied may take comfort in the concluding words of the preface , where the author says he has not found his subject-matter scant or simple , and intimates that there are still further chapters to be told ere his story is done -- chapters , as he elsewhere hints , that shall deal with the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , as these earlier ones have treated the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Burneys in
St. Martin	LOCATION	's Street .

		* It is impossible not to agree with Miss Con - stance HiU , when she speaks , in the preface to her new book , '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	in
St. Martin	LOCATION	's Street , '' of the perennial interest that attaches to the letters -- and she might have added , to the diaries -- of the eighteenth century .

		It is this fact that gives validity to Miss Hill 's rather slender excuse for writing another book about the
Burney	PERSON	family , whose lively correspondence and voluminous journals , themselves easily acces - sible , have already been copiously drawn upon by present-day chroniclers .

		In '' Juniper HaU '' Miss Hill has already given a detailed account of one period in
Fanny Bumey	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		The title of her new book limits its material to the events of the years between
1774	DATE	and
1783	DATE	, the period which the Burneys spent in the last of their several
London	LOCATION	residences .

		It was during this time that both '' Evelina '' and ''
Cecilia	PERSON	'' were written , and that their girlish author was discovered and initiated into the charmed circle at whose centre sat Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	and Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	.

		Frequent journeys from
London	LOCATION	took
Fanny Burney	ORGANIZATION	to Chessington to see her dearest friend '' Daddy Crisp , '' and to
Streatham	LOCATION	and Bath to stay with her fond but decidedly exacting patroness Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	.

		Miss Hill does not consider it beyond her province to detail anecdotes of these visits , as well as of the musical and literary gatherings * The

March 16	DATE	, in
St. Martin	LOCATION	's Street , the plottings over the secret publication of '' Evelina '' that went on there , and all the merry and not in the least momentous daily doings of the little circle whose private life was so famous for its harmony and serene happiness that somebody has called them the '' most amiable and affectionate of clever families . ''

		For novelty of material Miss Hill depends upon a very complete description of the
St. Martin	ORGANIZATION	's Street residence , and upon some un - published MSS. , chiefly a diary kept by Char - lotte
Burney	PERSON	through part of the year
1781	DATE	, some letters of
Susan	PERSON	to her favorite sister
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	, and a few family letters from Mr. Crisp , Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	, and other friends .

		Most notable of all is the MS. of
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's unpublished play called '' The Witlings , '' which is apparently newly available , since Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	had not seen it when he published his life of
Miss Burney	LOCATION	in
1903	DATE	.

		None of these items is in itself of any particular importance .

		Together , and pieced out from the familiar sources -- the '' Early Diaries , '' Madame d'Arblay 's '' Diary and Letters , '' and her '' Memoirs of Dr.
Bur	PERSON	- ney , '' -- they make the bS , sis for a decidedly entertaining narrative of over three hundred pages .

		The
St. Martin	ORGANIZATION	's Street house is still stand - ing , and not altered beyond recognition .

		It is easy .

		Miss Hill tells us , to identify the drawing - room , though its '' prodigiously painted and ornamented '' ceiling , in which the Burneys gloried , has long since disappeared ; the library , which was also their music-room ; and the cheer - ful `` dining parlour '' where the delightfully informal tea-drinkings took place .

		Only the quaint observatory , once Sir
Isaac Newton	PERSON	's study and later
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's favorite retreat , has vanished .

		Miss
Ellen G. Hill	PERSON	has made many interesting sketches of the characteristic features of this house , and of other houses and scenes connected with the narrative .

		These , with vari - ous reproductions of portraits , form a valuable pictorial adjunct to the text .

		It is perhaps natural that a feminine chron - icler , and particularly one who has already given us a detailed account of Miss
Burney	PERSON	's real romance , should make a good deal of the brief but persistent wooing of her earlier lover , Mr.
Barlow	PERSON	.

		Miss HiU quotes from
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's journal for
1775	DATE	, and from a letter sent her by the enamored gentleman ; and these leave no doubt in the reader 's mind that
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's family had an exaggerated horror of her dying an '' old maid , '' -- for otherwise they surely would not have thought of urging her to consider a match so manifestly unsuitable .

		It was , however , small wondfer if Miss
Burney	PERSON	found even the man of average talents without charm , when she com - pared him with Dr.
Burney	PERSON	and his brilliant friends .

		Every one of these seems to have shown his best side to her .

		Even the gruff and iras - cible Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	grows actually lamb-like when she appears , and treats her with an unfailing consideration that he showed to no one else .

		Fanny comments on this in a letter written in
1782	DATE	to her father , while she was staying in
Brighton	LOCATION	with Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	. ''

		Our dear Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	keeps his health amazingly , and with me his good humor ; but to own the truth , with scarce anybody else .

		I am quite sorry to see how immercifully he attacks and riots people .

		He has raised such a general alarm that he is now omitted in all cards of invitation sent to the rest of us . ''

		But of all the visitors to
St. Martin	ORGANIZATION	's street ,
Garrick	PERSON	was the favorite with the
Burney	PERSON	sis - ters .

		A call from him sent them into raptures , and his friendship they justly considered a great honor .

		As
Charlotte Burney	PERSON	, the youngest daughter , puts it , more forcibly than elegantly , in her journal , '' / Split me if I 'd not a hun - dred times rather be spoken to by
Garrick	PERSON	in public than by His Majesty , God bless him ! ''

		It was at the house of
Garrick	PERSON	's genial friend Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	that the subject of '' The Witlings '' was first broached .


Sheridan	PERSON	was one of the guests , and , beginning by praising ''
Evelina	PERSON	, '' he insisted that its author ought to try her hand at a play .

		Reynolds heartily ap - proved the plan .

		So did
Johnson	PERSON	, Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	, and the rest of
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's friends , when they heard of it , save only Mr.
Crisp	PERSON	, who was doubtful if his '' Fannikin '' had the tempera - ment of a playwright , and who feared for her the results of a possible failure or a partial suc - cess .

		Six months later the play was finished and sent down to Chessington by
Susan	PERSON	and Dr.
Burney	PERSON	, with a request for an absolutely candid opinion .

		A letter from
Susan	PERSON	tells how Dr.
Burney	PERSON	read it aloud , to the great delight of his small audience .

		Nevertheless , both he and Mr.
Crisp	PERSON	decided that in spite of its clever characterization and spirited dialogue the play would better be suppressed .

		Fanny , who always set the approval of her dearest friends far above the praise or blame of the public , did not ques - tion the judgment .

		She writes in gay good humor to Mr.
Crisp	PERSON	, in answer to what she calls his `` hissing , groaning , cat-calling epistle , '' a letter concluding thus : '' I wo n't be mortified and I wo n't be downed ; but I will be proud to find I have , out of my own family , as

		THE DIAL 179 well as in it , a friend who loves me well enough to speak the plain truth to me . ''

		Miss Hill prints the fourth act of the play , the one , according to
Susan	PERSON	, which '' seemed least to exhilarate , or interest , the audience . ''

		It is an amusing satire on the affectation of learning , so prevalent among the fine ladies of
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's day when learning itseK was in fashion .

		But it lacks plot interest and dramatic movement .

		We can doubtless estimate , far more easily than
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries , the width of the chasm between the majestic progress of the '' three volume romance '' and the sprightly compact - ness of the stage comedy .

		Nevertheless , ' - The Witlings '' has , at the least , a documentary in - terest that fully justifies the lengthy citation .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	once complained that '' the little Burney '' would not '' prattle , '' though he was sure that she could do it well .

		But she and all her family prattle without reserve on paper , and they justify the Doctor 's suspicion by doing it extremely well , making us acquainted with themselves and their friends in phrases as artless as they are deft and telling .

		Susan 's letters are as lively as possible , and
Charlotte	LOCATION	's frag - mentary journal reads as if it might have been written yesterday by some bright girl of twenty . ''

		He is a genteel-looking man , and full of rattle -- and I like rattles , '' she says of a certain very unpopular Captain
Williamson	PERSON	.

		She repeats many epigrams and lively bits of repartee , calls
Boswell	PERSON	'' a sweet creature , '' apparently because he made a bon mot about her , and complains of a certain Mr.
Humphrey	PERSON	on the very tenable ground that all he ever said to her was , '' Pray how do all your brothers and sisters do ? ''

		Little touches like these give reality to the chronicle of the life that went on so merrily in
St. Martin	LOCATION	's Street .

		Miss Hill does not attempt criticism or inter - pretation .

		She acts merely in the capacity of showman , marshalling her documents and letting them tell their own story .

		Granted the limi - tations of her method and of her present oppor - tunity , she deserves nothing but praise for her conscientious and capable investigation of the resources at her command , and for her judicious selection and arrangement of her well-chosen material .

Stirrixg Chapters of American History	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Two important additions have recently been made to American historical literature by writ - ers who are masters in their chosen fields .

		In his sixth volume Professor
McMaster	PERSON	brings his '' History of the People of the
United States	LOCATION	'' from the accession of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	in
1829	DATE	to the veto of the
Whig Bank	ORGANIZATION	bills by Tyler in
1841	DATE	.

		In volumes six and seven Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	completes his monumental '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' which covers the period from
1 85	DATE	to 1 8 7 7 .

		In these two works may be found perhaps the best accounts yet written of the developments of the American people from the close of the Revolutionary War to the restora - tion of home-rule in the
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		The object of Professor
McMaster	PERSON	through - out his work has been to write the history of our people , and not simply that of a set of poli - ticians or even statesmen .

		If the present vol - ume seems to make a departure from this plan , since very little space is given to matters not connected directly or indirectly with politics , it finds its justification in the fact that the people were at last playing at the political game .

		The advent of
Jackson	LOCATION	, though neither preceded nor followed by any immediate and remarkable extension of the suffrage , is commonly looked upon as the real beginning of the democratiza - tion of the nation .

		Jackson came fresh from the democratic West , where the fight against savage foes and wild beasts for a home and sus - tenance in the forest left little room for the class distinctions and privileges which were charac - teristic of older societies .

		As the representative , the very embodiment , of such a democracy , it was altogether natural that he shoidd be on the lookout for everything which smacked of privi - lege .

		In his eyes , the
National Bank	ORGANIZATION	was a star case of privilege battening on the people ; con - sequently he soimded a note of warning at this accession , though there was practically no com - plaint against the bank at that time .

		Nothing daunted at the general indifference ,
Jackson	PERSON	, ably seconded by
Senator Benton	PERSON	, kept up the fight , first to arouse the people to a sense of wrong and then to right the wrong .

		In the end he compassed the destruction of the bank .

		180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, wild schemes of
State	ORGANIZATION	banks , are matters of common historical knowledge .

		These facts are all set forth by Professor
McMaster	PERSON	in an enter - taining manner ; but in speaking of the work of destruction , he follows the not uncommon habit of using a slightly misleading term when he speaks of `` removing the deposits '' instead of `` ceasing to make deposits . ''

		Though not so replete with dramatic interest as the story of wild-cat banking in
Michigan	LOCATION	, the banking experience of
Florida	LOCATION	, at that time practically new territory and a sort of ward of the nation , certainly is deserving of notice , though it re - ceives none .

		In addition to numerous small banks , three were chartered with large capital stock .

		There being no money in the territory with which to pay for the stock , the device was hit upon of borrowing the capital by the sale of bonds .

		The Territory itself issued three
millions of dollars	MONEY	of bonds for the
Union Bank	ORGANIZATION	at
Tallahassee	LOCATION	, where the population within its reach probably did not exceed fifteen thousand whites and blacks , and guaranteed the bonds of two other banks to the extent of nine hundred thousand dollars .

		The laws tmder which these schemes were put through attracted little atten - tion at
Washington	LOCATION	until the banks were on the road to ruin and the bondholders were getting uneasy .

		A few of the bonds were redeemed by the banks , but many of them were left outstand - ing , and for these the
Territory	ORGANIZATION	refused to pro- vide payment .

		In dealing with the question of Nullification , it is doubtfid if Professor
McMaster	PERSON	has laid sufficient emphasis on the personal equation in the matter .

		Jackson hated
Calhoun	PERSON	, and there - fore Nrdlification in
South Carolina	LOCATION	was treason .

		On the abstract question of States ' Rights , it would be hard to say just where
Jackson	PERSON	stood .

		His attitude toward the bank was the natural one of the particidarist ; in the matter of the Indians he stood complacently by and saw a
State	ORGANIZATION	nullify a decree of the
Federal Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		In neither case , however , was he stand - ing for any abstract principle , but simply for what he believed to be right in each case .

		The bank charter he believed unconstitutional ; he had fought too many '' Indians to have much sympathy with them .

		The tariff was a different matter .

		While not at heart a high-tariff man , he believed the tariff act constitutional and that his arch-enemy
Calhoun	PERSON	was at the bottom of the effort to nidlify it .

		One of the most interesting things brought out by the author in this connection is the atti - tude of
Virginia	LOCATION	which foreshadowed her later division .

		Naturally ,
South Carolina	LOCATION	was de - sirous to know the attitude of her sister states .

		In
Virginia	LOCATION	, it seems , the most that could be counted on was the neutrality of the eastern section , while the western section was sure to stand by the nation .

		Even more striking is a letter written by
Jackson	PERSON	to
Buchanan	PERSON	, explain - ing how he had consigned '' nullification and the doctrine of secession '' to the tomb from which they would never rise again .

		It seems now like an anachronism to read of a movement in the
United States	LOCATION	, as late as the
fourth decade of the nineteenth century	DATE	, to abo - lish imprisonment for debt , or to wipe out feudalism as preserved in
New York	LOCATION	in certain remnants of the patroon system .

		Abolitionism , suppression of the right of petition , immigra - tion , and other social and economic questions , receive due attention .

		Strange to say , how - ever , certain anti-democratic tendencies in this age of democratization receive no notice what - ever .

		Some of the states began to lay restric - tions on the right of suffrage .

McMaster	PERSON	will cover more years than he has done in any previous volume , and that , too , in a period more stormy and significant than some of those ah ` eady covered .

		The politics of the period are ample enough for extended treat - ment , and the social conditions will demand much f idler treatment than is given to this sub - ject in the present volume .

		A really great opportunity lies before the author , though he will be covering in part a period already well handled by Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	, and it is to be hoped that he wil not cramp himself by too narrow limitations in space .

		If two volumes are ne - cessary , let us have them .

		Giving up a promising business career and devoting oneself to the writing of history is an occurrence not common in this so-called com - mercial age .

		Such , in brief , has been the life of Dr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	, who has devoted nineteen years of the best part of his life to a period of our history but little more extended in time .

		The loss to the business world has been one of immense gain to the world of his - torical literature .

		The word '' literature '' is used designedly here .

		Possibly Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's works may not stand a rigid application of all the tests invented by the schoolmen to deter - mine what is literature , but they certainly carry
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 181 the stamp of verisimilitude and have the force necessary to Im-e the reader on and invite him to return .

		Whether describing the scattering of fresh firebrands by the repeal of the Mis - souri Compromise , or depicting social condi - tions in the fifties , bringing into vivid play once more those tumultuous emotions which swept n ^ en hither and thither in the closing days of one administration and the beginning of another , or setting the stage for the fidl tragedy of the Civil War , there is in all and over all the deep breath of human interest . ''

		Sordid '' and '' mean '' are terms that have been applied in contempt to American history .

		The blunder-crime of secession was atoned for with a mighty effusion of human blood ; but it gave to the world examples of heroic daring , patriotic devotion , and pathetic seK-sacrifice , of statesmanship and military genius , that have seldom if ever been surpassed , and , last of all , freedom to a branch of the human race .

		There was nothing sordid or mean here .

		But the aftermath of war , that blunder-crime against civilization strangely misnamed Recon - struction , -- was that not sordid and mean ?

		The answer may be found in the last two volumes of Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's history .

		Not that he has at - tempted to reveal the base , -- rather that , in his fidelity to the truth , he has been unable to conceal it .

		Seldom in all history has a nation been confronted with such momentous problems and presented with such magnificent possibilities in their solution , and more seldom still do we find a more miserable failure .

		Statesmanship seems to have died , and selfish political parti - sanship at once arose from the corpse .

		The generals of the army had bound up the wounds of the prostrate foe ; the politicians opened them again and bound them up with vitriol .

		The measures for the re-making of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	appear to have been conceived in hate and born in a lust for pelf and power .

		The really great op - portunity which lay before
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was to fit the wards of the nation , the freedmen , for citi - zenship , and to help them in adjusting their relations with their former masters .

		Instead of doing this they thrust the ballot into the negro 's hand and turned him and the carpet-bagger loose for one of the most shameless orgies of political plunder the world has ever seen .

		Great as was the injustice to the intelligent and property-owning classes of the South , it was perhaps even greater to the negro .

		This is an age of democracy ; at first blush the enfran - chisement of the negro might seem to have been a part of this movement .

		The injustice to him came not simply in leaving him in the hands of designing men , but in actually forcing him to look to them for guidance .

		Wickedness and barbarism can not rule forever over virtue and intelligence .

		The ten years ' orgy had created a distrust of the negro , and when his rule was overthrown he was thrust under foot as unworthy of political rights .

		And now , forty years after his nominal enfranchisement , he must begin at the bottom and first prove himself worthy of these rights .

		Shameless misgovernment in the South re - acted upon the whole country and contaminated public life everywhere .

		If some of the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	politicians were above the carpet-baggers in order of ability , they were not a whit better in point of morality .

		Concerning
Benjamin F. Butler	PERSON	, Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	quotes with approval Weed 's estimate that he was the most influential man in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1873 -RRB- , and the worst .

		One of the strangest things in all our history is that the intelligent and virtuous state of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	should have honored this man so often and so highly .

		His love of pelf and power has been pointed out by Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	in previous volumes .

		Why speak of
Oakes Ames	ORGANIZATION	and the
Credit Mobilier	ORGANIZATION	, of
Babcock	PERSON	and the Whiskey Ring , and of
Belknap	PERSON	and the Indian-trade frauds , the last two of whom were protected by President Grant ?

		After reading the complete exposure of the character of
Blaine	LOCATION	, one shudders to think how narrowly he missed the
Presidency twenty years later	DATE	.

		Summing up the story of shame , Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	says : '' The high - water mark of corruption in national affairs was reached dur - ing Grant 's two administrations . ''

		Grant him - self is cleared of all personal guilt , in spite of
Butler	PERSON	's boast that he had a hold over him ; but his career as President has beclouded somewhat the glory won by the sword .

		The notorious Tweed Ring had no official connection with national corruption , but the story of its riot and ruin is given as a part of the corruption of the age .

		In connection with the Tweed exposure .

		Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	makes a most interesting digression on the suffrage .

		Tweed had maintained himself by the vote of ignorant men who had no ma - terial interest in the community .

		The way to prevent such corruption , says Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	, is to restrict the suffrage by educational and prop - erty tests .

		But no such restriction was put in the
New York	LOCATION	charter , because at that time '' the country was bowed down in adoration of the theory that voting was a right , not a priv - ilege . ''

		The author thinks that possibly all 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, men should be allowed to vote for President and members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but that state and city government is more distinctly a matter of business , and in these the rule of an intelligent minority is preferable to that of an unintelligent democracy .

		It is not surprising that one who has spent a long time in the study of this period should turn from it with his confidence in democracy shaken .

		Rightly understood , how - ever , it only emphasizes the truth that democ - racy must base its hope of ultimate success on intelligence and virtue .

		The character of Tilden suffers slightly at the hands of Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	.

		There was no taint of corruption , not even to secure the Presidency in
1877	DATE	; on the contrary , he was honest , be - cause honesty is the best policy , though he did dodge the income-tax , but he was lacking in the physical and moral courage necessary for lead - ership in turbulent times and so vacillating of purpose as to destroy his party 's enthusiasm .

		As for
Hayes	PERSON	, '' left to himself , he would have been capable of refusing the high office if not honestly obtained , and had he declined to ac - cept it before the
Louisana	LOCATION	Retuming-Board made their return , though he would never have been President , he would have been one of the world 's heroes .

		As it actually turned out , hpw - ever , he saw with
Sherman	PERSON	's eyes , which were those of a stubborn partisan . ''

		It is the author 's opinion that '' he ought to have stopped the action in his favor of the
Louisiana	LOCATION	Returning -
Board	ORGANIZATION	, but after swallowing this much he stood as the avowed representative of his party ; and ... he had no choice but to take the place . ''

		From this the reader will infer at once that Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	does not think that
Hayes	PERSON	was elected .

		He says expressly that
Tilden	PERSON	should have had the vote of
Louisiana	LOCATION	and possibly that of
Florida	LOCATION	.

		His account of this memorable contest is clear and remarkably well condensed , though it does not appear to add anything new .

		However , it is not likely that anything new will be added luitil someone investigates thoroughly the frauds at their sources , if it can be done at this late day .

		A few years ago , in an article published else - where , the present writer , quoting Professor
Burgess	PERSON	's statement that the '' final '' history of the Civil War would have to be written by a Northern man , because the North was in the right and because the victor is always more generous than the vanquished , undertook to say that for this very reason the '' final '' history of Reconstruction would have to be written by a Southern man because the South was the ultimate victor in that life-and-death struggle .

		The recent achievement of Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	seems to indicate that the writer may prove a false prophet .

		Several Southern men have produced excellent monographs on this subject , but the man who surpasses him will accomplish a note - worthy feat .

		However , in dealing with these two periods there is this difference , which gives the Southern man no advantage : Men may stiU debate about the war and its causes , but there is only one side to Reconstruction .

		Here the vanquished , the inventors and supporters of Congressional Reconstruction , are universally condemned and cast into outer darkness .

		* `` My estimate of what Lord L3i ; ton 's rank will be is that , as a lyric poet , the position given him will be next among his contemporaries after
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Swinburne	PERSON	, and
Rossetti	PERSON	. ''

		So wrote Mr.

1892	DATE	.

		To a generation that knows

		We are not concerned at the moment , however , to attack or to confirm it , but only to gain , if possible , an accurate impression of the man himseK from the two volumes of his '' Personal and Literary Letters '' now before us .

		They contain a record of unusual inter - est , -- the story of a defeated poet , an exquisite amateur of letters , whom circumstances and temperament kept on the lower slopes of
Parnassus	LOCATION	.

		They convince us , not that
Lord Lytton	PERSON	's public career prevented him from becoming a great poet , but that his success as diplomatist and administrator was possible be - cause his poetic inspiration , though genuine , was fitful and limited .

		He recognized this quite clearly himself . ''

		And in a more serious vein , he wrote to his daughter a few months before his death : '' I reflect that if I had acted more selfishly -- I do n't mean in the bad but the best sense of the word , with more of that self-assertion which springs from a man 's confidence in the best of his own nature , and is the dis - tinguishing mark of genius - = -- I should have resolutely * Personal and Literaby Letters of

		THE DIAL 183 eschewed a number of good things not suitable to my nature , and should have bent the circumstances of my life into conformity with the natural direction of the faculties best fitted to render life fruitful .

		In my inability to do this I recognize the absence of that mis - sion without which the imaginative faculty is a will - ` o - the-wisp '' -LRB- ii. , 426 -RRB- .

		This letter is in pathetic contrast with one written to his father in
1854	DATE	, when he was twenty-two years old , and had been for four years following the profession of diplomacy which his father had marked out for him . ''

		I certainly feel and own that I have hitherto not done justice to myself in the profession , and I see many men getting before me to the top of the ladder whom I really feel to be not more light of foot or steady of hand than myself , so that if I continue to follow the career , certainly my amour propre is con - cerned in advancement ; but I feel that all those great and brilliant prizes which allure others , would , even were I to obtain them , greatly diminish rather than increase my happiness : each step forward would be a step further from my own ideal , and would have to be trodden over some relinquished dream , or some strangled interest ...
Even Uncle Henry	ORGANIZATION	, despite his many noble achievements and his costly successes , and his great position and reputation , the praise of the public press , the confidence of ministers , the envy of all his colleagues , and the Grand Cross of the Bath , is an example that makes me shudder .

		I would rather , for my part , have been
Burns	PERSON	at the Scotch alehouse , than Uncle Harry in a ship of war , going out to his post Mdth the red ribbon on .

		As I once said to you when we walked along the streets of
London	LOCATION	by night , and you made me proud and happy by asking me the ques - tion , my ambition has ever been for fame rather than power .

		... I have no fear myself of becoming a mere literary dilettante '' -LRB- i. , 59 -RRB- .

		This youthful prophecy was fulfilled .

		The '' great and brilliant prizes '' which he obtained -- the viceroyalty of
India	LOCATION	, the
Paris	LOCATION	embassy -- did not , if we may trust these letters , bring him happiness .

		Political activity was so far from absorbing him that it never really com - manded his respect . ''

		The debates of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, '' on his return from
India	LOCATION	, '' appeared to him ` dreamlike and devoid of real life ' ; those of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, ' one vast in - sane display of wasted power and passion mis - applied ' '' -LRB- ii. , 232 -RRB- .

		He would certainly have accepted
John Morley	PERSON	's characterization of politics , widely as his political views differed from those of the distinguished Liberal : '' Poli - tics are a field where action is one long second - best , and where the choice constantly lies between two blunders . ''

		On the other hand ,
Lord Lytton	LOCATION	was , in the strict sense , '' a mere literary dilettante '' all his days .

		And this he himself early recognized .

		Writing to Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	when he was twenty - four , he said : '' ' Art requires the whole man . '

		Ah , how well I know that !

		how bitterly I feel it .

		But why do you say it to me who am doomed to be a Dilettante for life ?

		If there is a word of truth in what we are always saying , and admitting when said , about the dignity of poetry as an art , its high tax on the faculties of the poet , and its sublime benefits to mankind , why in
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's name should we say that the devotion of the poet to his art , seriously , earnestly , exclusively ... as a profession and a most honorable one , is a waste of time ... a sleep in a garden of roses ? ''

		-LRB- i. , 80 -RRB- .

		This last is an allusion to a warning received from his father two years before .

		And to his father he wrote in
1860	DATE	: '' There can be no doubt about real genius .

		It is sure of the world , and the world is sure of it .

		And this is what dismays me on my own account .

		I am too clever , at least have too great a sympathy with intellect , to be quite content to eat the fruit of the earth as an ordi - nary young man , and yet not clever enough to be ever a great man , so that I remain like
Mahomet	PERSON	's coffin suspended between heaven and earth , missing the hap - piness of both .

		... A little more or a little less of whatever ability I inherit from you would have made me a complete and more cheerful man '' -LRB- ii. , 82 -RRB- .

		There is the formula of dilettantism , of that gifted mediocrity which lacks the final efficiency without which the gTcatest gifts are sterile .

		His father had long before warned him of the danger that besets a young man of fortune , good looks , and popularity ; but by dilettantism the elder Lytton meant '' writing only what pleases yourself , '' instead of writing with an eye single to popular approval .

		In fact , the suc - cessful novelist 's admonitions to the young poet are an amusing compoimd of admirable good sense and crass Philistinism . ''

		One thing I would say , in spite of all you urge about being content with a small audience and your own ap - proval .

		That is not the right ambition of a poet who means to influence his age .

		It is not worth the sacrifice of all other thought and career for .

		He should aspire to reach a wide public .

		This is one reason why I de - plore the paramount effect that poets who only please a few have on your line and manner .

		Praised as they are by critics ,
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	are very little read by the public , and absolutely unknown out of
England	LOCATION	.

		... Now take
Charles Mackay	PERSON	's poems .

		They are little praised ' by critics , no idols of the refining few , but they sell immensely with the multitude -- it is worth studying why '' -LRB- i. , 55 -RRB- .

		Though this is contemptible enough , many of the elder
Lytton	ORGANIZATION	's criticisms of his son 's work are thoroughly sound .

		He pointed out the re - dundance and decoration , the absence of '' mas - culine severity of taste , '' the fondness for detail rather than proportion , that characterized the young poet 's work , at the same time admitting its genius .

		He thought , however , rather too well of '' Lucile . '' ''

		I can remember no work of such promise since
Werter	PERSON	.

		... At times the play 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, of the vocabulary reminds me of Goethe himself in his best days of poetry .

		You may rely on fame for the poem '' -LRB- i. , 99 -RRB- .

		The author 's own view of it , we may say in passing , was more just . ''

		A trashy poem that seems to have be - come very popular in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- i. , 93 -RRB- was his best word for it .

		One aspect of the father 's relation to the son , however , is less amusing than painful .

		From his boyhood , the younger
Lytton	PERSON	's craving for his father 's love and respect is almost pathetic .

		At the age of eighteen he wrote : '' I have just heard from my father .

		What an m - tense pleasure it gives me to receive a letter of kind - ness from him , I can not tell you .

		My position and my feelings are so strange , my heart is so full of love for him , full to overflowing , but it is darkened and choked vtith the most fearful and constant doubts , the most painful suspicions , the most bitter feelings '' -LRB- i. , 24 -RRB- .

		This is an allusion to the estrangement be - tween his father and mother , and the jealousy and distrust with which each viewed the son 's intercourse with the other .

		At a later period , the yoimg poet 's desire for his father 's literary approval was no less keen thail his craving for his father 's love .

		In reply to the elder
Lytton	ORGANIZATION	's praise of '' Clytenmestra , '' he wrote : '' The best thanks I can give you back , my beloved father , for the great heartful of gladness you have given me must be the assurance of that gladness , and how it surpasses all other kinds of happiness , so that I could wish that my life should stop here lest anything less should follow ... My heart seems to open under each kind word of yours ; all things seem easy to do , and pain even light to bear '' -LRB- i. , 54 -RRB- .

		Yet the father to whom these words were ad - dressed was capable of writing a letter that con - victs him of cruel suspicion , if not of unnatural jealousy . ''

		I do n't think , whatever your merit , the world would allow two of the same name to have both a permanent reputation in literature .

		You would soon come to grudge me my life , and feel a guilty thrill every time I was ill ... No .

		Stick close to your profession , take every occasion to rise in it , plenty of time is left to culti - vate the mind and write verse or prose at due intervals .

		As to your allowance , I should never increase it till you get a step .

		I help the man who helps himself '' -LRB- i. , 60 -RRB- .

		To this the son replied : '' What you have said is quite enough .

		I shall only recur in thought to those suggestions for the future with reg ^ - et that they were ever made .

		I renounce them ... I am quite willing to abide in the profession and work as well and as cheerfully as I can in it '' -LRB- i. , 61 -RRB- .

		But this was followed by a still more amazing renunciation .

		At his father 's request he prom - ised not to write ab all for two years .

		Possibly the son 's poetical career , his incurable dilet - tantism , justify the father 's severity .

		But for all that , it was a rash and heartless way to deal with a young poet .

		Suppose someone had silenced
Keats	PERSON	for two years !

		The supposition is , of course , absurd ; for
Keats	PERSON	could not have been silenced .

		This act of obedience is suffi - cient evidence of the slightness of the poet 's gift .

		For such a nature , it would probably have been the part of wisdom to put into his profession the spirit and energy that were in - sufficient for his art , and to cease to look with longing at heights which he could not climb .

		In middle life , he apparently came roimd to his father 's opinion that the poet is not injured but improved by being combined with the man of afPairs , though the following letter , in which he expresses this conviction , must be contrasted with the one already quoted in which he lament - ed that his poetical aim had not been single : '' For any man of robust moral fibre and unlimited intellectual receptivity , I am convinced that occasional close contact with -LRB- or immersion in -RRB- the central move - ment of that world , mean and shallow though it be , is essential , not perhaps to the development , but to the adjustment of his faculties .

		My belief is that all flrst-class genius has in it an element of vulgarity , if you will -- but certainly of amalgamation with the common sense , and common experience and sentiment , of commonplace human beings -- a fulcrum for its indi - viduality in what is generally appreciable .

		Shakespeare had it ;
Milton	LOCATION	, too , in spite of all the narrowness of his sublimity ;
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, in spite of all his egotism ; and
Byron	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and Voltaire -- and this constitutes their immeasurable superiority in the hierarchy of genius over such geniuses as
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Rousseau	PERSON	'' -LRB- i. , 330 -RRB- .

		We have given so much attention to a single interesting phase of
Lord Lytton	ORGANIZATION	's life that we have little space to devote to many other phases of perhaps greater intrinsic importance .

		The letters seem to us conclusive evidence of his diplomatic ability , and of the wisdom and tact of his Indian administration , complicated though it was by the perplexities of the Afghan War .

		The letters from
India	LOCATION	, indeed , are so full of color and incident , and throw so clear a light on the problems of colonial administration , that they surpass in interest and value those of any other period .

		On his return to
England	LOCATION	, it became necessary for him to take part in a debate of the Lords which was virtually a defense of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	in its conduct of Afghan affairs .

		Lord Lytton never spoke readily , and had therefore carefully prepared his speech , when , within a few hours of deliver - ing it ,
Lord Beaconsfield	PERSON	begged him to change his line of argument .

		He writes : `` There was a fidl
House	ORGANIZATION	, the galleries thronged , royalties and peeresses who had staid in town to hear me ; the bar and the places behind the throne were also filled with Liberal
M. P.	PERSON	's and Ministers , who came up

		THE DIAL 185 from the Commons to hear me out of curiosity .

		I felt very nervous when I got up , and the cheers from my own side seemed to me rather faint .

		But after ten minutes I felt that I had the
House	ORGANIZATION	well in hand , and when I sat down 1/elt that the speech had been a de - cided oratorical success .

		Lord Beaconsfield was un - stinted in his commendations of what he called its ' remarkable Parliamentary tact . '

		The result was , 1 think , a great relief to him , for his last words as he left the
House	ORGANIZATION	with me were : ' You made a great effect without one injudicious word .

		As for myself , I feel as if I had won the
Derby	LOCATION	.

		I backed you heavily , and you have won my stakes for me -- easily .

		As for you , you have established your own Parliamentary position in the front rank .

		From this time forward you may do or say anything you please in
Parliament	LOCATION	.

		Your posi - tion is assured , and you have won it by a single speech ' '' -LRB- ii. , 228 -RRB- .

		It is in the same letter that he remarks , '' The more I see of public life in
England	LOCATION	, the less I like it , and the less I respect the actors in it '' !

		We can merely refer to the bits of literary criticism of his contemporaries -- often sound and always suggestive -- that are scattered up and down these volumes , and to the fragments of literary theory , which are as stimulating as those that delight us in the letters of
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		We must also confine ourselves to mentioning the names of some of the distinguished persons to whom Lord Lytton wrote with the utmost freedom and intimacy , --
John Morley	PERSON	,
John Forster	PERSON	,
Lord Salisbury	PERSON	, the
Brownings	ORGANIZATION	, the Queen .

		So far as
Lord Lytton	ORGANIZATION	's personality is con - cerned , we gain from these letters an impression of an unworldly and poetic capacity for friend - ship , of almost irresistible social gifts , of an entire sincerity of nature , utterly loyal and free from subterfuge , and beneath all the charm of manner and the gayety of the man of the world , a profound and permanent melancholy .

		He was evidently the most delightful and sympathetic of fathers , and his daughter writes of him with a mixture of the reverence due to his talents and position and the tenderness called forth by his fundamental imhappiness .

		In editing the letters , she has done her work with admirable reticence and skill .

		It is a far more touchinsr and mterestmg record than the biography of many a greater man .

		The

		* When the late Mr.
William Zeigler	PERSON	's first expedition to the Polar region failed to attain any high degree of north latitude , he was not disheartened , but immeditely fitted out another expedition and sent it northward under the command of Mr.
Anthony Fiala	PERSON	of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Fiala	PERSON	had been the photographer of the first expedition ; he had shown exceptional skill as an explorer , and had the experience necessary to overcome difficulties encountered by the first ill-fated party .

		Yet the well-laid schemes of both promoter and explorer went agley .

		Their vessel , `` America , '' was crushed in the ice the first winter ; the unusual climatic conditions of the following
summer	DATE	prevented any serious advance toward the desired spot ; the relief ship failed to appear at the end of the
summer	DATE	; and , finally , many of the men became disaffected , -- a list of insurmountable difficulties which com - pelled the explorer to relinquish his efforts and to return without having achieved the object of his quest .

		In a minor way , however , the Fiala-Ziegler expedition was successful .

		Charts were made of previously unexplored portions of
Franz Josef Archipelago	PERSON	, and magnetic and meteoro - logical observations were recorded by Messrs.
W. J. Peters	PERSON	and
R. W. Porter	PERSON	, the scientists of the expedition .

		The most important result of the expedition , however , is the publication of the account of it by Mr.
Fiala	PERSON	.

		His book , '' Fighting the Polar Ice , '' is doubtless the most interesting story of Polar exploration yet written in this country .

		Although it is the record of a failure , it is likely to be remembered longer than many accounts of more fortunate explorers .

		Mr.
Fiala	PERSON	's expedition left Trondhjem , Nor - way ,
June 23 , 1903	DATE	, and on
July 13	DATE	struck the ice-field in
Barentz Sea	LOCATION	.

		This sea , lying between
Norway	LOCATION	and
Franz Josef Archipelago	PERSON	, has been crossed by many expeditions in less than a week 's time , but it took
Fiala	PERSON	's ship , the '' America , '' over a month to buck and hammer its way to
Cape Flora	LOCATION	, the most southern point of the archipelago .

		On
August 8	DATE	, by almost miraculous good fortune , the ship escaped from the ice pack , '' steaming between two enormous blocks of ice , and escaping just in time , as the fields crashed together with tremendous force behind us . ''

		Desiring to winter farther north , however , Commander

		After a sturdy contest , the expedition made anchor in

Peary	PERSON	's recent achievement broke the record .

		From this time

		The '' America , '' seemingly a '' fatal and perfidious bark , '' broke loose from her moorings in a storm , and went adrift in the awful darkness of an Arctic night .

December	DATE	.

		One little incident which lightens this dark story we may here transcribe . ''

		The night of disaster was tinged with some flashes of humor , stories of which reached me later .

		While the crew were passing the bags over the side of the ship , the cook , who was of an excitable nature , suddenly appeared at the rail with a large bag which he heaved over with all his strength .

		It struck the ice below with a sounding crash ; causing several of the sailors to exclaim , ' Hello ,
Cook	PERSON	, what was that ? ' '

		Oh , that 's all right ! '

		he answered ; ' it ' s lamp chimneys andjiat irons J '' After the loss of the ship , the party had to accommodate itself to the house which had been built on shore at
Camp Abruzzi	LOCATION	.

		Then followed the long night of preparation for the trial fur - ther northward .

		On
March 7 , 1904	DATE	, twenty - six men , with sixteen pony-sledges and thirteen dog-sledges , set out for the great North apex .

		In five days the party returned to camp , sorely tried in spirit , and with a chilled enthusiasm .

		Five men had become disabled , the cookers had proved inadequate , a snow-storm had proved too much for the party , and complaints were so general among the men that
Fiala	PERSON	decided to return to camp to refit , and to reduce the num - ber of men for another attempt .

		This first attempt northward revealed the most serious defect in
Fiala	LOCATION	's appointments .

		Some of his men were of the stuff heroes are made of , but many of them were of conunoner clay and not fitted to endure the hardships of such rigorous work as Polar exploration de - mands .

		The author , who by no means has a complaining nature , fittingly says : '' In Arctic research -- as in all undertakings -- Christian character is the chief desideratum .

		The Polar field is a great testing ground .

		Those who pass through winters of darkness and days of trial above the circle of ice know better than others the weakness of human nature and their own insufficiencies . ''

		Could
Fiala	PERSON	have had a company of privates like his side companion , the
Irishman Duffy	PERSON	, he might have accomplished more , even in the face of the difficulties offered by
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second northward attempt was of even shorter duration than the first .

		The party left camp on
March 25	DATE	, reached Cape Fligely the same evening , but on account of disastrous ac - cidents to the sledges they returned on the second day .

		Out of thirty-nine men in camp , twenty-five elected to go south to
Cape Flora	LOCATION	to meet the relief ship .

		Again disappointment was to be theirs .

		Barentz Sea was dead and white , with a sullen sheet of rugged ice , so that no ship could come to the cape .

		All hopes of relief that year were soon abandoned .

		Provi - dentially , however , the lives of the party were saved by the abundant stores cached at
Cape Flora	LOCATION	by the Duke of the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	, and by the discovery of a vein of coal found up the steep talus .

		On
September 27	DATE	, Commander
Fiala	PERSON	left
Cape Flora	LOCATION	to march north again to
Camp Abruzzi	LOCATION	.

		For fifty-four days
Fiala	PERSON	and his heroic comrades staggered from ice-pack to ice-pack , from island to island , across the archipelago .

		It was on this awful return that he and
Steward Spencer	PERSON	met with the most exciting adventure recorded in the book .

		While walking ahead of the sledges , the snow gave way beneath
Fiala	PERSON	's feet , and with
Spencer	PERSON	, who was trying to help him , he feU into a glacial crevasse , a distance of seventy feet , where the two were wedged into a narrow abyss .

		The story of the rescue is a thrilling one . ''

		At last I saw above me the end of a rope , which gradually neared as I shouted directions to those out of sight above who were lowering the line , our only hope of escape . ''

		My right arm was free , and at last the precious line was in my hand .

		I painfully made a bowline in the end of the rope , the fingers of my left hand being for - tunately free .

		Slipping the noose over my right foot , I called to those above to haul away .

		Soon I was swing - ing like a pendulum in free space .

		... I called to them to move the rope to the right and then lower me .

		I swimg aroimd in the black chasm and felt the icy walls , but could not discover the Steward . ''

		In desperation , as I felt myself growing weaker , I called to him , ' Look up and try to see me against the light above ! '

		He obeyed , saw my suspended form , and directed my movements .

		In answer to my shouts , the men above moved the rope along the edge of the crevasse and lowered me to where I could reach the
Steward	LOCATION	, though I could not rescue him on account of a projection of ice that interfered .

		But I could pass him a foot and a hand , and lift him from his prone position , and help him to stand on the cake of ice that had broken

		THE DIAL 187 off when he fell and had jammed , saving him from death .

		Unable to give the
Steward	PERSON	further help , I told him it woidd be best for the men to haul me up and send the rope down for him .

		He agreed , and I was drawn to the surface , -- just in time , as I fainted on reaching the top .

		The
Steward	PERSON	was hauled up next . ''

		Again in the fateful month of
March , 1905	DATE	,
Fiala	PERSON	made his third trial , but reached only eighty-two degrees north latitude -- his farthest point north .

		Although he thought it possible that he and
Duffy	PERSON	might exceed
Cagni	PERSON	's record , he felt that the party which had wintered at the
South Camp	LOCATION	might need his guidance in event that the relief ship failed to come the second year ; so , sinking personal ambitions , he returned .

		On
July 30 , 1905	DATE	, the relief ship was sighted .

		Although failure marked the attempt of Mr.
Fiala	PERSON	to reach the
North Pole	LOCATION	, that word can not be applied to his book .

		In many respects it is a most notable book of exploration .

		First of all , it is eminently readable : it does not cata - logue its author 's heroic efforts , but it describes them with an imaginative fervor somewhat rare in books of this kind .

		Such sustained descrip - tive passages as his account of the grinding of the '' America '' in the ice , the long march of two hundred miles in the Arctic night from
Camp Ziegler	LOCATION	to
Camp Abruzzi	LOCATION	, and the story of the descent into the crevasse at
Hooker Island	LOCATION	, can hardly be matched among books of Polar exploration .

		Another feature that gives zest to this book is the author 's photographs .

		No amount of reading can convey an idea of the terrible ice-packs , the tremendous ice-pressures , and the hummocks over which the sledges of Arctic explorers have to travel , so satisfactorily as do the panoramic pictures in this volume .

		Fiala 's pictures reveal to us for the first time just what those difficulties are .

		The publishers of the excellent '' Geographical Library '' in which series this book appears , are to be con - gratulated on producing so picturesque and meritorious a volume .

		It will compare favorably with any book describing travel and exploration in the Polar region .

		Life and manners of `` the third
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		The recent death of
Giosub Carducci	ORGANIZATION	serves to remind us how much of the present literary revival in
Italy	LOCATION	is due to him .

		That very apt phrase `` the third
Italy	LOCATION	'' was coined by
Carducci	PERSON	to convey the idea of a free
Italy	LOCATION	proceeding on her path toward happier desti - nies , in distinction from the first
Italy	LOCATION	which gave birth to the grandeur of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, and the second
Italy	LOCATION	, overrun and subdued by barbarians , partitioned among strangers , or involved in inter - necine warfare .

		Books about the past of
Italy	LOCATION	are legion ; there are no lack of guides to her towns , her lovely landscapes , her art treasures .

		But now arises a new need -- to watch the
Italy	LOCATION	that is now in the making , the
Italy	LOCATION	renewed and re-born in art , literature , statecraft , in every manifestation of men - tal life .

		Fortunately , almost the first attempt to supply this need is a very successful one .

		It comes in the shape of a handsome volume by Miss
Helen Zimmern	PERSON	, bearing the title ''
Italy	LOCATION	of the Italians '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The author 's residence of twenty years in this land of her adoption has provided her with the adequate point of view ; her equipment as a scholar and writer on many subjects , artistic , philosophic , and literary , has given her a power of condensed gen - eralization which enables her to treat such subjects as `` The Press , '' `` Literature , '' `` The Painters , '' '' Sculpture and Architecture , '' '' Science and Inven - tions , '' '' Playhouses , Players and Plays , '' each in a single chapter .

		Some of these show how little we know of modern Italian life , and how easy it is for the casual tourist to be mistaken in his hasty deduc - tions .

		For example , we who are accustomed to bulky newspapers are likely to look with contempt upon
Italy	LOCATION	's small news sheet of four pages ; but scorn turns to praise when we learn of the wholesome editorial restrictions that govern the publication .

		No news calculated to disturb the world 's peace is allowed to be manufactured in the office ; the polit - ical leaders are , as a rule , well-argued , well-studied , well-informed , and terse in expression ; the standard of literary and dramatic criticism is really elevated .

		The sanctity of the home is jealously respected .

		No marriages or births are announced in the Italian papers , only deaths .

		There are no interviews except such as concern politics , no man 's house is described , no society ladies figure ; there is no lifting of the veils of privacy .

		A respectable Italian would be pained and scandalized if the picture of his wife or mother or sister occupied a full page in a public journal .

		The stock phrase with which the tourist comes to
Italy	LOCATION	, `` There is no modern Italian art , '' is also effectually sUenced by a succinct survey showing the existence of an active and noteworthy Italian art , especially in landscape , where the old art was weakest .

		That so many '' Old Masters '' are continually being made proves the skill , if not the honesty , of the modern painter .

		Some of these are so splendidly executed , so exactly reproduce the spirit and character of the time and the artist whose title they assume , that experts are continually de - ceived .

		The thirty-one full-page illustrations in
Miss Zimmern	LOCATION	's volume are up-to-date and some of them are entirely new , increasing the attractions of this highly interesting book .

		A champion of ^ ^ ^ ^ Q ^ ^ ^ sX biographies of Dr.
Samuel	PERSON	liberty and
G. Howe	PERSON	, as well as the more in - phtianthropv .

Laura E. Rich	PERSON	- ards , in an octavo of four hundred pages entitled '' Letters and Journals of
Samuel Gridley Howe	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , to which Mr.
Frank B. San	PERSON	- born has contributed a short historical introduction on the Greek Revolution of 1821-30 , and to which also
Whittier	LOCATION	's noble poem '' The Hero '' is appro - priately prefixed .

		This volume , with its sub-title '' The Greek Revolution , '' its closing '' End of Vol - ume I. , '' and its lack of index , seems to promise most hopefully a continuation of the work beyond the
year 1832	DATE	at which it pauses .

		Better than any attempt of our own to characterize these interesting extracts from diaries and letters that breathe the energy and ardor of youthful hope and courage and self-devotion , is the final paragi'aph of Mr.
San	PERSON	- born 's introduction . ''

		Every reader , '' he says , '' must be impressed , as I have been , with the genius , re - source , good sense , and chivalry of this young Bos - tonian , in the varied and exacting services which he could render to the cause of liberty and philan - thropy in the eight years covered by these journals and letters .

		His diction is not always classical , his knowledge not always exact ; but his head is clear and his heart in the right place , -- his hands skilful always to do what is needful at the time .

		As
Thoreau	PERSON	said of
Osawatomie Brown	PERSON	, ' He would have left a Greek accent slanted the wrong way , and righted up a fallen man . '

		And the effect of the whole is that of a romance of knighthood . ''

		Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	's prefatory and interspersed notes add no little to the value and completeness of the book as a detailed account of her father 's eventful young manhood .

		A photogravure portrait of the youthful
Howe	PERSON	, from the painting by
Jane Stuart	PERSON	, daughter of
Gilbert Stuart	PERSON	, faces the title-page .

		He was a strikingly handsome subject for any artist .

		Again under the auspices of Dr. Essays on

		Professor
Carl Hilty	PERSON	appeals to his English-speaking audience in a second '' happiness '' volume , -- '' The Steps of Life : Fur - ther Essays on Happiness '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , trans - lated by the Rev.
Melvin Brandow	PERSON	.

		These chapters from the pen , not of a professed religious teacher , but of '' a spiritually-minded man of the world '' -- to use
Laurence Oliphant	PERSON	's phrase , as quoted by Mr.
Peabody	PERSON	-- are in the vein of his earlier essays , but are -LRB- a glad surprise -RRB- even better and wiser and stronger .

		Professor
Hilty	PERSON	teaches constitutional law in the
University of Bern	ORGANIZATION	, but has a firm belief in truths of a more spiritual quality than those on the pages of the statute-book .

		A defender of the Christian faith in its fundamental principles , he has already proved himself an ethical and religious teacher of real helpfulness .

		The wrestling with sin , the bearing of sorrow , the pursuit of culture , the cultivation of charity and courage and a simple Christian faith -- these are his steps leading up the arduous ladder of life .

		Many striking passages in his book evoke cordial assent , and some , equally striking , call forth the opposite .

		He affirms that '' the most trustworthy friendships are those which have sprung from a previous enmity , or have been once -LRB- but not twice -RRB- broken off ; '' also , that `` women are in general more easy to understand than men '' ; and that '' polyglot speech is , as a rule , a mark neither of genius nor of character . ''

		Like most writings on `` the simple life '' and allied themes , these pages are not free from reiteration ; but that is not always a blemish in hortatory discourse .

		The translation is smooth , but has a few unidiomatic or awkward expressions , and at least one slip in grammar . ''

		Financial '' is used for '' pecuniary , '' `` delusion '' where `` illusion '' would have been better , '' more easy '' for the shorter and preferable '' easier , '' and , in one instance , '' they '' -LRB- German man -RRB- where a passive construction would have been neater .

		A handful of ^ ^ ' ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ bright and eminently colored beads readable are most of the little essays loosely strung , j ^ i ^ igg
Katharine Burrill	PERSON	's '' Loose Beads '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Every-day matters , and some others , are treated with good sense , cheerful philos - ophy , and literary skill .

		The happy quotation and allusion are abundantly in evidence , and the fact that two of the chapters had already found favor with the readers of '' Chambers 's Journal '' is a sort of recommendation for the entire volume .

		In her amusing paper on '' Innocence and Ink , '' the writer takes occasion to say : '' I am quite sm-e there are many days when gi'appling with a swarm of bees seems a light and easy task compared to grappling with words and sentences that refuse to swarm as you wish them to -- that are ever incorrigibly wrong and will never never come right . ''

		But herwords and sentences , as a rule , marshal themselves in excellent order , although a fussy critic might object to her split infinitives , her '' as if there was , '' her '' moirS antique '' -LRB- with its superfluous accent -RRB- , her indis - criminate use of `` nice , '' her Scottish shyness -LRB- she declares herself a Scotchwoman , else we should have written `` her skittish shyness '' -RRB- of `` shall '' and '' should , '' and other peccadilloes that need trouble only the purist .

		The book is most attractively printed and bound .

		THE DIAL 189 glow '' pass into oblivion .

		But behind the mask there is always a human being , and the lives of few women exhibit such vicissitudes as do those of actresses .

		The present author has given us sketches of a dozen women who in the eighteenth cenlhry attained to eminence in the only profession open to their sex .

		He points out that we are likely to form an erroneous estimate of the characters of those whose romantic careers form the subject of his vol - ume if we fail to bear in mind the gi-eat difference between the social positions of actors and actresses in the present day and their status in the eighteenth century ; they had then by no means emerged from the shadow of traditional classical and ecclesiastical degi `` adation .

		Furthermore , these actresses had to encounter the tradition of immorality attaching to them in consequence of the notoriously scandalous lives of earlier English actresses in the profligate days of Charles II .

		The author has painted pictures of
Charlotte Clarke	LOCATION	,
Margaret Woffington	PERSON	,
Catherine Clive	PERSON	,
Lavinia Fenton	PERSON	,
Frances Abington	PERSON	,
Dora Jordan	PERSON	, and their contemporaries , as they were , and left the reader to do his own moralizing wherever necessary .

		There is wit and genial humor and phi - losophy , with occasional cynicism , in these jottings , which are miscellaneous in character , -- critical , biographical , anecdotal , descriptive , according to the mood or the circumstance .

		macy '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- brings his nar - rative down to the treaty of
Westphalia	LOCATION	in
1648	DATE	.

		The period covered by the present volume marks the transition from the Middle Ages , with their almost chaotic political systems , to the modern period during which the permanent traditions of
Europe	LOCATION	took shape , national states succeeded to petty principalities , and modern diplomacy had its rise .

		In reality , Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's work is not a history of diplo - macy as the title indicates , but a political history with special reference to European international relations during the period covered .

		Primarily , it is a review of the relations of
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, Ger - many , and
England	LOCATION	to
Italy	LOCATION	, and particularly the long struggle of
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	for prepon - derance in the affairs of the Italian peninsula and the resulting effect upon the Papacy and upon European political morality .

		The ascendency of the
House of Hapsburg	ORGANIZATION	, the international influence of the Reformation , and the development of the idea of a sovereign state system , are other topics treated by Mr.
Hill	PERSON	.

		It may be doubted , however , whether they properly have a place in a history of diplomacy .

		The truth is that Mr.
Hill	PERSON	has given us little on the subject of diplomacy during the period covered by his volume .

		We look in vain for any discussion of the methods and agencies of diplomatic intercourse during the Middle Ages , the rights and privileges of ambassadors , diplomatic usages , the conception and character of mediaeval diplomacy , and similar topics .

		As a history of
Europe	LOCATION	mainly from the point of view of international relations , Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's work possesses conspicuous merits ; but it has only a very limited value for the student of diplomacy .

Viator	PERSON	also , if not strictly on business bent , will derive pleasure from these short and unpretentious chapters , writ - ten as they are in a humane and enlightened spirit , with an occasional touch of humor in its specific sense , and a delightful prevalence of good-humor throughout .

		A strong plea is made for out-door diversions in general , and for fishing and fowling in particular , with one brief chapter on rabbit-shoot - ing ; and every page breathes a sturdy and manly -LRB- not to say gentlemanly -RRB- protest against unsports - manlike sport .

		The writer professes himself a warm friend to all members of the fish and game tribe , although so ardent in their pursuit .

		His book makes for the ennoblement of his favorite pastimes , and for their perpetuation .

		The illustrar tions , by Mr.
Henry S. Watson	PERSON	, are numerous , ap - propriate , and daintily executed .

		A frontispiece photographic print of Mr.
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and also draw - ings of him in less formal attire , with rod in hand , add interest to this very inviting little volume .

		thg recently published `` Addresses of John Hay '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume contains twenty-four addresses ; many of them are brief re - sponses to toasts , or remarks on other formal occa - sions , each containing an appropriate thought or sentiment finely worked out and gracefully phrased .

		But some of them are more elaborate productions .

		The one entitled ''
Franklin	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	'' is perhaps the finest , with its broad sweep over the historical conditions that produced the Revolution , and its presentation of the manner in which
Franklin	PERSON	took advantage of those conditions to accomplish his mis - sion .

		Another elaborate address is that on President
McKinley	PERSON	, delivered in the Capitol at the invitation of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is , as was to be expected , wholly laudatory , but the praise is not without discrimina - tion , and it is a noteworthy example of the formal eulogy .

		Others are '' Fifty Years of the Republican Party , '' `` America 's Love of Peace , '' `` The Press and Modern Progress , '' and '' American Diplomacy . ''

		Within a month after he took his seat in

		His in - fluence arose not so much from his oratory , though he spoke often and well , hut from his efficiency in doing things .

		There was hardly an important measure hefore

		This con - spicuous career has been set forth by Congressman
Theodore E. Burton	PERSON	in his volume on Sherman in the second series of `` American Statesmen '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is rather hard reading for the ordinary person who has no great liking for figures and financial history ; there was not much in Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's personality or career to give a biographer opportunity to enliven his book with anecdote or incident .

		But it gives a good account of a real statesman , and a history of several important phases of our national development during the last half centuiy .

		Taking for its starting-point the now fairly-settled assumption that the poem is not the work of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, the author of this monograph proceeds upon the theory that it was written by some imitator of the poet during
the first half of the fifteenth century	DATE	.

		The general conclusion is that the poem is an eclectic composition , to which both En - glish and French influences contributed .

		The day of

Percy Goetschius	PERSON	, includes those writings of the class in question which have shown the greatest vitality -- a group of the '' Songs without Words , '' the Sonata in E major , the Rondo Capriccioso , and a score or more of other compositions .

		The collection has a preface by Mr.
Daniel Gregory Mason	PERSON	, besides the usual portrait and bibliography .

		We are all loyally prejudiced in favor of any pro- noimcement from the venerable and amiable man of letters who has made American humor famous .

		It is with natural regret that one feels it necessary to record that
Mark Twain	PERSON	's curiously tempered appraisal of
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- adds nothing to the fame of the author .

		The colloquial and typically American admonition apropos of bibulous occasions that advises against the mixing of potations applies with due allow - ance to the mingling of caricature and sober attack .

		It makes it trying to determine under which mask the part is going forward .

		At all events , the story of the remarkable movement with which the book is con - cerned is receiving in these reportorial and historical days a sufficiently objective and circumstantial examina - tion to satisfy the most critically inquiring student of the future .

		Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	has now come to the dig - nity of '' collected works . ''

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	have brought together , m the twelve volumes of their '' Plan - tation '' edition -LRB- published by subscription -RRB- the various writings of this versatile and accomplished gentleman .

		We may be in substantial agreement with the publishers in saying that '' Mr.
Page	PERSON	has for twenty-five years rep - resented all that is best in the literature of the old South and the new . ''

		That period of a quarter-century is approximately what stretches between ''
Marse Chan	PERSON	'' and ''
Gordon Keith	PERSON	, '' and the twelve volumes before us make a creditable showing of literary activity .

		Cer - tainly no one has written better short stories of old
Virginia	LOCATION	, and there is no better novel of the reconstruc - tion period than '' Red Rock . ''

		That novel , and '' Gor -
don Keith	PERSON	, ' fill each two volumes of the new edition , another gives us Mr.
Page	PERSON	's essays on '' The Old South , '' and still another of his poems .

		The remaining six are made up of short stories .

		The volumes are beautifully printed , and each of them contains three illustrations prmted in colors We trust that Mr.

		The demise of '' Temple Bar '' brings regret , espe - cially to readers of the magazine in its earlier days , when
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Miss Braddon	PERSON	and other famous writers contributed to its entertaining pages .

		It was started in
1860	DATE	, and has thus enjoyed a term of life far beyond the average of periodical ventures ; but of late its air and complexion have been sadly altered .

		And thus has fallen another victim to the too-triumph - ant ten-cent -LRB- or sixpenny -RRB- illustrated monthly magazine that stares us so unbashfully in the face on every news-stand . ''

		Leading Americans '' is the title of a new series of biographies announced by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, to appear under the general editorship of Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	.

		The first volume , '' Leading American Soldiers , '' by Mr.
R. M * Johnston	PERSON	, is now ready ; and among the future volumes arranged for are '' Leading American Scientists '' by Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, '' Leading American Historians '' by Professor
William P. Trent	PERSON	, '' Leadmg American Lawyers '' by Mr.
Henry C. Merwin	PERSON	, '' Leading American Poets '' by Dr.
Curtis Hidden Page	PERSON	, and '' Leading American Novelists '' by Mr.
John Erskine	PERSON	.

		Details are now announced of '' The Student 's Series of Historical and Comparative Grammars , '' edited by
Joseph Wright	PERSON	,
Professor of Comparative Philology	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The object of this series is to furnish students interested in historical and com - parative grammar with handy voliunes on the subject .

		The
General Editor	ORGANIZATION	has already secured the cooperation of the leading philologists in
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, and it is confidently expected that during the present year authors will have been secured for the whole series , consisting of about twenty-five volumes .

		The series will be printed at the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, and published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		Announcements of
Spring Books	ORGANIZATION	.

		Herewith is presented The Dial 's annual list of books announced for

THOMAS BAILEY	PERSON	ALDRICH .

		When
Lowell	PERSON	and
Holmes	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	died in the early nineties , the most important chap - ter in the history of American literature was closed .

		They were the last of the elder poets -- of the
New England	LOCATION	singers who had long held the national conscience in their keeping , with the grateful reverence of the younger gen - eration for their reward .

		But there were still poets left us -- youngsters by comparison , although fast approaching the venerable term -- and we felt that the torch was worthily borne by
Stoddard	PERSON	and
Stedman	PERSON	and
Aldrich	PERSON	.

		Then
Stoddard	PERSON	died , worn out with years , and now
Aldrich	PERSON	has laid down his pen , and we have left us only one poet of large achievement to repre - sent the mid-century period which saw our nation in the throes of its deep agony and wit - nessed its great moral awakening .


Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	was born
November 11 , 1836	DATE	, and died
March 19 , 1907	DATE	.

		His sev - entieth birthday , in curiously exact coincidence with that of Henry
Mills Alden	PERSON	, was cele - brated a few months ago , and gave his friends , known and unknown , the opportunity of paying him their tribute of admiration and affection .

		As one born in the thirties , he belonged to the decade of
Edwin Booth	LOCATION	and
Bret Harte	PERSON	, of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, and Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	, with all of whom he was linked by personal intimacy .

		His boyhood began and ended in
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, with an intervening decade in
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		When he was sixteen , his father 's death cut short his plans for entering
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, and he started to earn his living as a banker 's clerk in
New York	LOCATION	.

		But the literary instinct was too strong to be repressed , and he soon turned to editorial work for his support , with poetry for his avocation .

		He associated himself successively with several journals in
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	, and in
1881	DATE	was called to the proudest editorial post in the country , becoming the successor of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	as editor of the `` Atlantic Monthly . ''

		For nine years he occupied the Park Street sanctum with its back window view of th & most peaceful spot in
Boston	LOCATION	-- the Old Granary cemetery , whose occupants , as he used whim - sically to say to visitors , were highly satisfactory neighbors , because they never brought manu - 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, scripts for his inspection .

		Then , in
1890	DATE	, he passed the blue pencil -LRB- symbolically speaking -RRB- on to
Horace Scudder	PERSON	, and , made free from all sordid cares by the legacy of a generous friend , applied himself for his remaining years to the fine art of living .

		Youthful to the last , in both spirit and appearance , he looked at the world with Horatian eyes until just the other day , when the veil of death was drawn over them .

		Few of our writers have been as loved as he still fewer have left , as he has left , the was memory of the artist so closely interwoven with the memory of the rich personality .

		Delicate artistry was , indeed , the most char - acteristic mark of his work .

		One of his earlier poems recounts the things he would do if the soul of
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	dwelt within him .

		They were the very things that he afterwards did , and not merely with the exquisite art of his exemplar , but also with an instinct for purity that puts to shame the amatory parson of
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even more than of
Herrick	PERSON	, however , does his work remind us of Landor , whose trick of epigram , burdened with a wistful pathos , he caught with extraordinary facility . ''


October	DATE	turned my maple 's leaves to gold ; The most are gone now ; here and there one lingers : Soon these will slip from out the twigs ' weak hold , Like coins between a dying miser 's fingers . ''

		What could be more Landorian than that ?

		Only the image of the maple leaf marks it as a distinctive product of the
New England	LOCATION	soil from which the poet sprang .

		Yet this ' ' enamoured architect of airy rhyme , '' so delicate of fancy , so graceful of utterance , had also weighty mat - ters to disclose , and a weighty manner for their expression .

		He found , as so many other poets have done , in the sonnet the form most fit for his serious mood .

		Such sonnets as '' Unguarded Gates , '' ''
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	, '' and '' By the Poto - mac '' are the work of no lyrical trifler ; they are examples of the deepest thought and the noblest deliverance that our poetical literature can offer .

		In paying tribute to
Aldrich	PERSON	the poet we must not forget
Aldrich	PERSON	the prosateur .

		The latter aspect of his genius will hardly be left out of the reckoning by those who are old enough to remember the delightful surprise of ''
Marjorie Daw	PERSON	, '' and the piquant charm of '' Prudence Palfrey '' and '' The Queen of Sheba , '' when thosQ inventions were first from the press .

		And where is the American boy , young or old , who ever read `` The Story of a Bad Boy , '' and failed straightway to give it an abiding place in his affections ?

		It is a juvenile classic , if there ever was such a thing , having its place beside `` Tom
Brown	PERSON	at Rugby , '' `` Treasure Island , '' and perhaps two or three others .

		And there are yet other volumes of choicely-fashioned prose , taking now the form of fiction , now the form of impressions de voyage .

		Nor must we forget the miniature prose tragedy of '' Mercedes , '' effective both to read and to witness in per - formance .

		That work , and the blank verse ''
Judith	PERSON	of Bethulia , '' represent the author 's contributions to the practicable drama , and gives evidence that he was both a playwright and a poet .

		It is to the poet that
Aldrich	PERSON	was , however , that our thoughts turn first and last .

		He set for himself the highest possible artistic stand - ards , and came sufficiently near to their reali - zation to win laurels that will remain green as long as any feeling for beauty remains to us .

		He wrote little during his later years , the kindly muse heeding his prayer to her , '' That I may not write verse when I am old . ''

		His own lines , representing a bearer 's soliloquy at the funeral of a minor poet , may fittingly be drawn upon to close this brief tribute to his fragrant memory .

		`` ... Room in your heart for him , O Mother Earth , Who loved each flower , and leaf that made you fair .

		And sang your praise in verses manifold And delicate , with here and there a line From end to end in blossom like a bough The
May	DATE	breathes on , so rich it was .

		Some thought The workmanship more costly than the thing Moulded or carved , as in those ornaments Found at
Mycenae	LOCATION	.

		And yet
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's self Works in this wise ; upon a blade of grass Or what small note she lends the woodland thrush , Lavishing endless patience .

		He was born Artist , not artisan , which some few saw And many dreamed not .

		As he wrote no odes When
Croesus	ORGANIZATION	wedded or Maecenas died .

		And gave no breath to civic feasts and shows .

		He missed the glare that gilds more facile men -- A twilight poet , groping quite alone , Belated , in a sphere where every nest Is emptied of its music and its wings . ''

		LITERATURE OF THE WESTERN FU R-TRA DE .

		Few things can be more gratifying to the patri - otic American or Canadian than the marked revival , within the last few years , of interest in the early records of the two countries .

		THE DIAL 213 for reprints of early narratives and the publication of manuscript material .

		Books that previously were to be found only in large public libraries , and were known only to a few historical students , are now in thousands of private libraries ; while many valuable manuscript journals have been edited and brought within the reach of everyone .

		In an age of artificial conditions , of stiff conven - tions , and of pride in material achievements , it is wholesome to turn back to these simple records of our pioneer forefathers , and correct our point of view in the light of their achievements .

		The broaden - ing influence upon public opinion of a wide reading of the narratives of men like
Alexander Mackenzie	PERSON	,
Jacques Cartier	PERSON	, Captain Cook ,
La Salle	LOCATION	,
David Thompson	PERSON	,
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, the two Henrys , and
Zebulon Pike	PERSON	, can hardly be over-estimated .

		These men were not spotless heroes , but there is nmch in what they accomplished that was essentially heroic , and , what is greatly to the point , there is not a word in any of their narratives to suggest that they were conscious of this heroic quality .

		They did what was to be done with a singleness of purpose that one sometimes misses in the complex life of the present day .

		They were men of action , in the best sense of the term .

		They were pathfinders of a continent , to whom we owe much more than we are inclined to remember .

		The incentive that drew them to the path of discovery , a path beset by hunger and thirst , dangers and disappointments , was one that fortu - nately can not be measured in coin .

		For many years the deep human interest of these records and narratives was unappreciated .

		It was not , in fact , until
Francis Parkman	PERSON	had touched the eyes of a preoccupied public with his magician 's wand that they began to see the power , the pathos , the dramatic appeal of these forgotten documents .

		The writer has had occasion within the last twelve - month to read some fifty or sixty original narratives of Western Fur-traders , a few in print , many more -LRB- and these by far the most interesting -RRB- in the state in which they were written , sometimes on foolscap , sometimes on wrapping paper , occasionally -LRB- when paper was not obtainable -RRB- on birch-bark ; and once , far ofP in the heart of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	where even birch-bark was not to be had , the fur-trader , not to be beaten by circumstances , wrote his journal on a thin piece of board .

		To one familiar with the life of the Western trader , pathfinder , pioneer , these old manuscripts tell many a tale between the lines .

		Here the paper is browned by the smoke of a camp - fire , or scorched in drying the ink too near the flames ; here is a grease-spot of a buffalo or moose steak ; there the spray of a rapid has blurred a word or two ; or perhaps whole pages are illegible , twisted out of shape , the ink smeared up and down the page , while one pictures the trader 's journal thrown from the upset canoe and fished up by some following paddle .

		Still more significant are the breaks in the narrative .

		The trader drops his pen or pencil to trade a fathom of tobacco , a handful of beads , a pound of powder or shot , for peltries or perhaps a supply of much-needed pemmican ; he is interrupted by a drunken Indian , and pauses long enough to turn him out of the fort ; a cry comes from without that buffalo are crossing the river , and he rushes out to take a hand in the slaughter ; the next day we perhaps get the story , graphic in its simplicity and directness .

		Then there comes a time when some real or fancied gi'ievance brings down upon the fort a war-party of fierce Sioux or Blackfeet ; the trader pauses in the midst of a word , hears the menacing yell of the savages , grabs his gun and runs to guard the gate .

		The interrupted word is never finished .

		The grimy manuscript , with its fast-fading record of a forgotten life , is all that remains to tell the story of one who took his part in the stirring drama of the Western Fur-trade .

		Then the narratives themselves make anything but dry reading .

		They belong to a period that is past , and to a race of men almost extinct .

		They are often absolutely startling in their revelation of primitive passions , primitive desires , primitive vir - tues , -- civilization brought in contact with savagery in an untamed environment , dropping the veneer of conventionality , gradually approximating to the frank simplicity of aboriginal life , though fortunately maintaining some grip on the essential virtues .

		The Indian that we meet with in the pages of
Alexander Henry	ORGANIZATION	or
Samuel Hearne	PERSON	is almost ludicrously unlike the idealized creation of
Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, and the traders and voyageurs of real life do not remotely resemble those of the drawing-room nov - elist ; yet they are none the less interesting on that account .

		The student of human nature in the rough will ` find abundant data in the unexpurgated pages of many an old manuscript journal ; the social reformer may discover illustrations to point any conceivable moral ; the novelist can have his pick of a thousand plots from real life , many of them infinitely stranger than fiction , and each furnished with its appropriate setting .

		Is there anything more dramatic in fiction than the picture of La V ^ rendrye at the foot of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, gazing at their glittering peaks in the firm belief that immediately beyond lay the long-sought Western Sea , and bitterly turning back when the prize seemed within his very grasp , be - cause of the childish fears of his Indian hosts ; or of
Simon Fraser	PERSON	threading with grim pertinacity the appalling cafion of the
Fraser	PERSON	, simply because he had been ordered so to do ; or of Alexander Mac - kenzie painting that brief but pregnant inscription on the shores of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, ''
Alexander Mackenzie	PERSON	, from
Canada	LOCATION	, by land the twenty-second of
July	DATE	, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three '' ?

		Of the scores of narratives left by Western ex - plorers and fur-traders , comparatively few have yet been published .

		In many cases the original documents have already been lost or destroyed ; but , fortunately , a large number have been gathered into the national archives of the two countries , or are preserved in the libraries of historical societies .

		There is here a rich mine awaiting the industry of 214 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 1 , another Dr.
Elliott Coues	PERSON	-- or , for that matter , of a dozen
Elliott Coues	PERSON	; a mine which will afford ample returns for all the patient industry that may be expended upon it .


Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's uteraky methods recall those of
Walter Pater	PERSON	, if the truth has been told about the two writers ' manner of composition .

		It is said of Mr.
James	PERSON	that he dictates his first draft slowly , and this is afterward typewritten by his secretary , with wide interlinear spaces .

		Then , much in the manner of
Pater	LOCATION	, the author goes over this preliminary sketch or skeleton , flUing in and elaborating , rounding and padding and polishing , until , satisfied with his creation , the artificer sends it forth , confident that each faintest shade of thought has received adequate expression .

		From Mr.
James	PERSON	's latest book , '' The American Scene , '' let us take a single sentence , presentmg first its bony structiu-e , and then clothing it in all the rounded fairness and grace -LRB- his detractors might say , the clumsiness and heaviness -RRB- of its abimdant adipose tissue .

		Concerning
Philadelphia	LOCATION	's spread-out appearance we read in the skeleton , '' The absence of the perpetual perpendicidar seemed to symbolize the principle of indefinite level extension . ''

		That is graphic and satisfying .

		What is gained , or lost , by verbal elaboration and somewhat eccentric punctuation , will appear from the following : '' The absence of the note of the perpetual perpendicular , the
New York	LOCATION	, the
Chicago	LOCATION	note -- and I allude here to the material , the constructional exhibition of it -- seemed to symbolize exactly the principle of indefinite level extension and to offer refreshingly , a challenge to horizontal , to lateral , to more or less tangental , to rotary , or , better still , to absolute centrifugal motion . ''

		Small ' wonder is it that when an acquaintance rashly asked Mr.
James	PERSON	the exact meaning of a certain sentence of his , the distinguished author gravely and coldly replied that if the passage as it stood , representing as it did his carefully matured thought , did not explain itself to the reader , it was ixseless to enter into oral discussion of its meaning .

		... Things new but not true so often make their appearance in the daily press under the guise of scien - tific facts that a correspondent is moved to write to '' Science '' urging congressional legislation '' to check the publication of all items that convey erroneous im - pressions relative to matters in which the whole com - munity is interested . ''

		Such censorship of the press is undesirable in principle , even if practicable in the matter of pseudo-scientific '' stories '' ; but a little experience of newspaper ways soon enables the intelligent to discount or wholly disbelieve all items of a startling or sensa - tional character .

		Discoveries and inventions that , according to the newspaper , promise speedily to revo - lutionize some branch of art or industry or domestic economy are published at short intervals , and the cred - ulous await developments in eager expectation .

		But developments , or even further references to the epoch - making invention or discovery , never come ; and least of all does the newspaper print a retraction or modifi - cation of its startling '' story . ''

		Not long ago a Roches - ter machinist was said by some enterprising reporter to have devised an application of steam that would very soon consign all existing steam engines to the junk heap .

		Almost any reader of newspapers can cite similar instances .

		They are numerous enough , often amusing , but in the end monotonous .

		German and American reading habits are placed in instructive comparison by recent reports from two public libraries , one in
Germany	LOCATION	and one in this country , serving commimities of about the same size .

		The
Krupp Library of Essen	ORGANIZATION	, in the
fiscal year 1905-6	DATE	, circulated 388,001 volumes ; the public library of Troy , N. Y. , in its latest annual report gives a circulation of 62,000 volumes , or less than one-sixth as many .

		The
Essen	LOCATION	library , established primarily , we infer , for the benefit of
Herr Krupp	ORGANIZATION	's thirty thousand workers in steel , has 51,750 volumes .

		The three-hundred-thousand-dollar white-marble library building at Troy shelters , we ven - ture to guess , a considerably larger collection ; and the city on the
Hudson	LOCATION	is , besides , something of an educa - tional centre , with its
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute	ORGANIZATION	, its
Emma Willard Seminary	PERSON	, and other schools , while the Prussian town is known to us chiefly for its output of big guns .

		But in fairness we shoidd add that if the people of Altendorf , which was incorporated with
Essen	LOCATION	seven years ago , also depend for their reading matter on the
Krupp Library	ORGANIZATION	, the force of this com - parison is weakened .

		, , , Presidential praise of books goes little ways in some cases , as in that of '' The Woman Who Toils , '' which received a free advertisement in the President 's '' race suicide '' letter but is said to have been commer - cially unsuccessful on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Con - trariwise , '' The Simple Life , '' by Pastor
Wagner	PERSON	, appears to have been helped by a good word from the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, although the book might well have won popularity , but perhaps less quickly , on its own merits .

		Now the query arises , will M. Victor B ^ rard 's scholarly work on the '' Odyssey '' profit appreciably by the com - mendation bestowed upon it from the same high quarter ?

		It is safe to reply that the book is of too solid worth , of too special a nature , to be clamored for by the great easy-going , pleasure-seeking public .

		Eighteen months ago , before the English translation had appeared , some appreciative references to and quotations from this work were made in our pages ; and we are now glad to note any indication , however faint , that even a fractional part of the reading public is beginning to recognize the merits of this ingenious and painstakmg French scholar .

		A list of the six '' best-sellers '' in
America	LOCATION	, drawn up at the same time , shows but one female novelist to five of the other sex .

		Are American and English women changing places in the scheme of things ?

		• • •
The Authors ' Club anb Publishing Association	ORGANIZATION	, a new organization of which report reaches us , has elaborated a most beautiful scheme for the enrichment of its members ; nor are the fair proportions and grace - ful outlines of this plan , as an ideal creation , marred by the prosaic fact of its utter impracticability .

		Con - vinced that publishers are pocketing the lion 's share of profit in the book business , the members of this asso - ciation propose to do their own publishing , each one for himself -LRB- or herself -RRB- with the moral support of the others . ''

		Each author , '' we read , '' is to copyright his own book in his own name , and have the say of the mechanical make-up thereof , and make what contracts he wishes with the printer , etc. ; each author is person - ally to pay all the expense of getting his work into book form and the expense of newspaper and magazine advertising . ''

		Excellent !

		-- except that authors , espe - cially new authors , are seldom capitalists , or even in a position lightly \ , o risk a thousand dollars or so on a literary venture .

		A society of impecunious authors , each eager for a generous share of the book-buying public 's patronage , and so each pitted against his fel - lows , has its amusing aspects .

		We are told it was '' rumination '' on the evils of the existing order that '' has led to the uprising of the authors . ''

		Perhaps a little experience of the publisher 's trials and troubles may in its turn lead to the down-sitting of these same authors in a chastened and instructed frame of mind .

		• • • A shock to the cultured ear of
Boston	LOCATION	is the present cry of the street-car conductor , '' Out the nearest door ! ''

		-- on cars of the two-door pattern .

		This is a sad lapse on the part of a railway company noted for the courtesy and intelligence and superior education of its officials , and for the correctness of its printed rules and signs ; a company whose suburban cars rmi thi-ough a favored region where the very owls at night , with their '' to whit , to whom ! ''

		teach the lesson of the objective case ; a company , finally , that shrinks not from the ex - pense of two additional letters in its numerous posted warnings to the motorman to '' run slowly , '' wliile less grammatically conscientious corporations save paint and labor by allowing their cars to '' rim slow , '' in defiance of
Lindley Murray	ORGANIZATION	.

		What shall we say of this raucous chant , '' Out the nearest door ! ''

		-- is it a case of super - lative ignorance , or merely of comparative carelessness ?

		• • • Pessimistic despondency over the literary outlook is Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's note ui a recent newspaper article on modern English writers and their work .

		Witchery of form , native humor , mother wit , creative genius , he avers , are sadly lacking , and their places are but ill supplied by careful English , indus - trious learning , and sterling common-sense .

		It is an age of machinery , and not of natural spontaneity .

		Fourteen years ago Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, moved by somewhat the same spirit that now prompts him to utter his plaint , pub - lished a magazine article on '' The Decadence of Romance '' ; but while noting the decline , he yet wound up with a cheering assurance that , though modern con - ditions were unfavorable for the production of the old - time novel of love and war and knightly adventure , nevertheless there would somehow and in due season be evolved a new form of romance to fit the new environ - ment .

		Is he tired of waiting , that he so soon abandons this not unreasonable hope ?

		He should bear in mind that evolution is a slow process .

		Possibly his despond - ency is partly due to the natural ebb of buoyant hope - fulness as old age draws on .

		• • • The librarian who reads is not lost , we like to believe . ''

		The illiterate librarian ' might almost serve to designate more than one custodian of books whose attention is so largely given to details of administration that he forgets the library 's primary purpose .

		At next
summer	DATE	's meeting of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	'' The Use of Books '' is to be the main subject for dis - cussion , a wise choice that moves the '' Library Journfvl '' to admit , editorially , that while ways and means rightly claim much attention , yet '' it is true that in
A. L. A.	PERSON	conferences and other library meetings so much em - phasis has been laid upon methods of administration as to obscure the fact that books are the main factor in a library , and it is well to insist from time to time upon the book in itself as the central fact . ''

		• • • The simplicity of Esperanto , an artificial lan - guage remarkably easy for us Indo-Europeans to learn , appears to be surpassed by the simplicity of the Chinese and Malay tongues , which are extremely difficult for us .

		Count the rules of grammar in each , aiid convince yourself .

		This interesting revelation comes out in the course of a little dispute carried on between Professor
Leo Wiener	PERSON	, of
Harvard	LOCATION	, who exposes the weaknesses of the new language , and a remonstrant Esperantist , who hastens to its defense .

		The truth of the matter would seem to be that Esperanto is not , and perhaps never claimed to be , a world language , but rather a means of inter-communication for that part of the world known in a general way as
Christendom	LOCATION	.

		• • • '' Greatest scandal waits on greatest state , '' is a truism ; but nothing serious need be feared by admirers of
Walter Pater	PERSON	from the controversy -LRB- of a mild sort -RRB- now developing between the
Wright	PERSON	and
Benson	PERSON	factions in regard to Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's new and detailed life of
Pater	LOCATION	, wherein the later biographer charges the earlier with twelve astonishing errors .

		This pother will in no wise affect the fair fame of the gentle follower of Aristippus , except perhaps to heighten its lustre .

		... The Fielding Bicentenary , to be celebrated on the 22d of this month , should bring into clear relief , not the coarser qualities of the writer whose freedom of scope excited
Thackeray	PERSON	's envy , but the sterling vii-tues of honesty and fidelity , of manliness and woihanliness , that his upright and downright heroes and heroines tend to illustrate .

		The Career of a Great Editor .

		* '' What a noble record of courage and energy in the highest causes to recall '' exclaimed
James Bryce	PERSON	, when the news of Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's death reached him , five years ago .

		And no more ac - curate characterization of Mr.
Ogden	PERSON	's volumes can be given than Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's own words , -- '' a noble record of courage and energy in the highest causes . '

		Like
Carl Schurz	PERSON	and
Henry ViUard	PERSON	, with both of whom he was to be so closely connected , Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	came to
America	LOCATION	as a young man because he loved the ideals for which the great American republic seemed to stand , and the opportimities which it seemed to offer for working out successfully the great problems of human society and government .

		The
Godkin	PERSON	family runs back through some eight centuries of residence in
Ireland	LOCATION	to a little colony of Englishmen who settled in the
Barony Forth	ORGANIZATION	, on the coast of ``
Wexford	LOCATION	, and became Protestants during the period of the Reformat tion .


James Godkin	PERSON	, the father , driven from his Presbyterian pidpit because of his vigorous '' Eepeal Essays '' in support of the Young Ire - land movement in
1848	DATE	, served later as editor of the
Londonderry	LOCATION	'' Standard '' and after - wards of the
Dublin	LOCATION	'' Daily Express , '' acting also as Irish correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' and was naturally an imtiring advo - cate of Home Rule for
Ireland	LOCATION	to the end .

		No theorist could have devised a better parentage for the production of just such a keenly intel - lectual and vigorous fighter for reform causes as
Edwin Godkin	PERSON	proved to be .

		The '' singodar powers of expression '' com - memorated by Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	in the felicitous in - scription composed for his tombstone , together with his keen perception of what was worth expressing , were sufficiently developed at the age of twenty-two to warrant the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily News '' in sending him to the
East	LOCATION	as its cor - respondent during the Crimean War .

		From this service Mr.
Ogden	PERSON	dates one of the most firmly rooted of his later mental and moral characteristics : '' Indelible impressions were gained -- chief of them , hatred of war .

		He had seen its horrors naked . ''

		We thank Mr.
Ogden	PERSON	for the expression .

		Some day the time will come when we shall allow a writer with the eye of a
Godkin	PERSON	to strip the rags of mock patriotism , mock modesty , and a good many other mock - • The Life op Edwin

		eries , not from war in the abstract , but from some real and present war , and give us a good square gaze at its stark naked body ; and then we shall realize that
Bellona	ORGANIZATION	is not fit company for enlightened and self-respecting people .

		Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	reached
America	LOCATION	soon after the close of his Crimean experience , and , as with
Schurz	PERSON	, his first impressions were of the rising opposition to the cruelty and anomaly of slavery .

		He determined at once to see Southern condi - tions with his own eyes , and his letters to the `` Daily News , '' during a horseback journey which lasted from
December , 1856	DATE	, to the fol - lowing
April	DATE	, furnish a vivid and instructive picture from which Mr.
Ogden	PERSON	has drawn some fifty pages of well-chosen extracts .

		We clip a bit concerning the Walker '' filibuster '' episode . ''

		While passing over the lake between
New Orleans	LOCATION	and Mobile I was present while one of
General Walker	ORGANIZATION	's agents preached filibusterisin to the passengers in the cabin .

		The facility with which these men are , or rather were , allowed to harangue , beat up for recruits , collect supplies and arms , and despatch them to the scene of hostilities , is a curious commentary upon Mr.
Marcy	PERSON	's terrible letters to
Lord Palmerston	LOCATION	.

		From the high moral tone assumed by the
United States	LOCATION	government in its correspondence upon the
Crampton	PERSON	afPair , one can hardly be got to believe that
Walker	ORGANIZATION	's agents have had recruiting offices open in all the seaports , with flags flying from the windows with offers inscribed upon them of a free passage to , and free farms in ,
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, for more than a year past . ''

		Doubtless then as later , when Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	had become a naturalized citizen of the country he had loved long before he had ever seen it , many readers saw in this only a foreigner virulently assailing '' American institutions . ''

		The major - ity of us have not yet reached the point where we can appreciate and adopt the higher patriot - ism which , like wise and benevolent surgery , will build for a more healthf id future by fear - lessly cutting and cauterizing where cancerous growth or poison has entered .

		A social or political abuse was to him simply a disease , to be fought as relentlessly as a physical disease in one of his own family , and the untiring energy of the fight was as surely the mark and measure of his love in the one case as in the other .

		The keen disappointment which Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	felt in the closing years of his life , when he saw the
United States	LOCATION	, and then
England	LOCATION	, each engaged in a war which seemed to him easily avoidable and fraught with the gravest danger to fundamental principles of English and Amer - ican liberty , was closely akin to the bitter sorrow of which Mr.
Ogden	PERSON	, with delicate sympathy , has given us a glimpse on the occasion of his loss of a little daughter and later of his wife .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 217 It was this passionate love for free institutions , quickened by keen perception of the abuses by which they were endangered in the one land where they seemed otherwise to have the best chance of full development , that led Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	into the movement for establishing `` The Nation '' in
1865	DATE	.

		Readers of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	do not need a detailed support of the statement that he made of this modest looking periodical , never of large circulation , a power for political regeneration before which more wrongdoers have trembled than before any other single factor in the whole history of American political journalism .

		The rescue of the government service from the corruption which the Civil War had found bad enough , and left still worse , naturally appealed to him as fundamental to all desirable lines of improvement .

		It was truly a cry in the wilder - ness when he began . ''

		It was , to most people , a strange European whimsey .

		I remember being invited to a breakfast in
Washington	LOCATION	, given by Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	, who was then one of us , to bring together a few friends of the reform and some Congressmen .

		To me fell the task of explaining to a United States Senator what we aimed at .

		He knew nothing of
Civil Service Reform	ORGANIZATION	except the name , and that it was ` something , Prussian . '

		He listened with politeness to ray exposition of its merits , but it was evident to me that he considered me an estimable huih - bug or visionary . ''

		It was not long that any beneficiary of entrenched political abuses was able to regard the writer of the editorials in '' The Nation '' as a visionary on the side of attack , at least , though many doubtless persuaded themselves that he was deficient on the constructive side .

		Even people who ought to know better are sometimes hood - winked into the belief that you have no right to burn the tents of political pirates , squatting on the government preserves , until you have some essentially similar structure ready to put in their place .

		The subsequent history of the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	movement is clear enough evidence , even if other were lacking , that when Mr.
God	PERSON	- kin felt it his part to take up the work of con - struction his ideas always had live roots in the solid ground of experience and common sense .

		We can not take space to follow him through the various conflicts into which loyalty to prin - ciple and unbounded energy led him , first in the columns of '' The Nation , '' and from
1881	DATE	in the '' Evening Post . ''

		Of course he met opposition at many points from thoroughly repu - table and disinterested sources .

		It is no ^ nec - essary to argue that this opposition was never well taken .

		If we are to recognize no truly great , high-minded , and loyal leader until he comes to us above the level of possible error of judgment , then we shall never have him in this world at all .

		This much may be said , however , that when it would have been worth millions to malign interests to break down his reputation before the American people , no enemy ever found it possible to lodge one base or unmanly act or motive at his door .

		It was this high idealism , inexpugnable integrity , and unsuUied purity of motive , that drew and held for his paper so many readers who always felt it nec - essary to add to their letters of praise for some particular service to any good cause the state - ment that they often felt obliged to disagree with him .

		Doubtless approval thus qualified always struck him as the best possible proof that he was succeeding in his fundamental pur - pose , that of stimulating really vigorous thought on social and political problems in the minds of intelligent men .

		For the class of critics who would echo the gibe of some exposed rascal that his only dissatisfaction with himself was '' the fact that his name had one too many syllables '' he could feel nothing but amused contempt .

		His weapons were reserved for foes of more significance .

		The cry of `` pessimism '' was often raised against him , a word which in recent times has run a neck-and-neck competition with '' patriot - ism '' as '' the last refuge of scoundrels . ''

		The clearness of vision which can distinguish evil from good , the firm belief in the human possi - bility of intellectual and moral progress , the vivid hope that such progress would follow intelligent effort , the readiness to put his life enthusiastically into such effort , -- these were the elements of the '' pessimism '' of Edwin Law - rence
Godkin	PERSON	; and when really intelligent peo - ple come to reject this for a style of '' optimism '' which coidd see existing evils with the clear eye of a
Godkin	PERSON	and still be '' at ease in Zion , '' then the time for a real pessimism will indeed have come .

		That the conditions growing out of the Spanish and Boer wars saddened his declining years is of course known to all ; but it was no sadness of final despair , as is well shown by an extract from a letter written from
England	LOCATION	to
Wendell P. Garrison	PERSON	, within less than six months of his death . ''

		Some day I believe civil service reform will have become as obvious in
America	LOCATION	as it is here ; anything else is unthink - able .

		The anti-slavery fight seemed even more hopeless , yet it was won , and now people won - der that there ever was any fight at all . ''

		And it was that other arch '' pessimist , '' Professor
Norton	PERSON	, who wrote to Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	only two 218 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 1 , years earlier , -- '' when the work of this cen - tury is summed up , what you have done for the good old cause of civilization , the cause which is always defeated , hut always after defeat taking more advanced position than before , -- what you have done for this cause will count for much . ''

		To Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's strenuous warfare against injustice and wrong-doing .

		Professor
A. V. Dicey	PERSON	added as his second pronounced char - acteristic '' his extraordinary kindness to his friends . ''

		Mr.
Ogden	PERSON	's records of this kindness make the most delightful reading .

		Among those friends were
Bryce	PERSON	and Dicey and
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	,
Lowell	PERSON	and
Curtis	PERSON	, Professor
Norton	PERSON	and his accomplished sisters ,
Gilman	PERSON	and Eliot and
Andrew D. White	PERSON	, and a host of others whose names are of the very cream of moral and intellectual worth on both sides of the ocean .

		Nothing could be finer than his respect and affection for his colleague , the late WendeU

		The Art op
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		* Art-criticism of the higher order that rests upon the firm basis of a sound , consistent , and comprehensive fundamental metaphysic has made great strides in the years since the Pre -
Raphaelite Brotherhood	ORGANIZATION	, preaching their doc - trine of '' sincerity , '' made impassioned protest against pseudo-classicism , and
John Ruskin	PERSON	woke up the critics and art lovers of his day by his trenchant sentences and by the captivating rhet - oric that still , for many , conceals the defects • The Works of

		in his philosophy .

		Out of a maze of conflicting ideas the true concept has gradually emerged .

		As to what is the right point of view , there is now little difference of opinion among the writers and critics who are conceded to belong to the first rank .

		Nevertheless , there is no royal road by which this point of view may be attained .

		Each one must traverse anew the many complex and puz - zling problems that beset the path leading to the heights from whence is unembarrassed vis - ion , and many thei'e are that get halted by the wayside .

		The man who starts with the firm belief that the vital thing in art is the spiritual content , as distinguished from the manner and quality of its presentation , seldom gets much further ; though the difference between his out - look and that of the artist and connoisseur may ever remain to him an inscrutable mystery .

		For those who hold this opinion ,
Miss Elisa	LOCATION	- beth
Luther Gary	PERSON	's exceedingly interesting study of the works of
James McNeill Whistler	ORGANIZATION	offers much food for thought .

		And they , as well as those who do not need its lesson , should be able to find in it much pleasant mental refreshment .

		As a piece of critical writing , it is eminently sound and true to right principles .

		In dealing with an art as refined in conception and execu - tion as that of Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	, -- so exclusive , one might say , -- it is needful to have clear understanding and fine discrimination .

		These qualities characterize Miss
Gary	PERSON	's book in a high degree .

		Within the brief space of eight short chapters the master 's achievements in the several media in which he worked are surveyed and analyzed with rare insight , and the whole aspect and trend of his art are set forth .

		The estimate that places Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	among the foremost of modem artists , and even counts him the greatest of these , is difficult for the general public to understand .

		He did not paint for '' the man in the street . ''

		Nor , indeed , did he paint for the connoisseurs and critics , but for the pure delight he foimd in creating beautiful things .

		No artist was ever less influenced in his work by what others thought or felt about it .

		For anecdotal art he had unbounded con - tempt .

		As an elaborate binding upon a book that is not read usurps the first place in the eyes of the observer , so does a story introduced into a picture .

		More than that , in telling the story the artist is apt to leave out his art .

		Whistler would have none of it .

		As a story - teller he had a marked gift , but he was too much of an artist to tell his stories with brush or pencil .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219 This statement does not imply that his art , as has been alleged , deals solely with externals and is lacking in expressive and '' human '' qualities .

		How full of these it really is ,
Miss Cary	LOCATION	easily demonstrates .

		She points out that what Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	was concerned with was not cheap realism , which he scorned , but quintes - sential truth -- the very soul and poetry of things seen .

		It is this that gives vitality to almost everything he did .

		One may contem - plate his brushwork with the greatest satisfac - tion ; linger with delight over the skilful use of line in his etchings ; gaze with rapture upon his marvellous touch with pastel , by which he suc - ceeded in realizing something of the ineffable `` dipped quality '' -- to use his own phrase -- that is so precious in the glaze of certain choice pieces of Japanese pottery .

		Yet it is not the masterly technique that makes the deepest im - pression .

		Technique with
Whistler	LOCATION	was always a means to an end , and never a thing to be exploited for its own sake .

		He took infinite pains to conceal all traces of laborious effort .

		What he did care greatly for was the planning of the spaces and accents , the arrangement of lights and darks , the harmonious combination and interplay of color , the subtle discrimination in the tone values , -- all the elements , that is , of composition .

		These things , it should per - haps be said , are not a part of technique .

		They belong to conception , not to execution .

		The sure feeling with which Miss
Gary	PERSON	has penetrated the message of
Whistler	LOCATION	's art is well shown in the following descriptions of two of his works owned in
New York	LOCATION	: `` One of Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	's drawings represents a woman of great nobility of form , whose classic drapery does not disguise her classic proportions , and who stands leaning with one arm resting on a shelf or ledge .

		The effect is rendered by the slightest means , bvit the dispo - sition of the weight , the swell of the arm supporting the body , the relaxation of the other arm , the capacity of the whole strong buoyant figure to move with energy and lightness , are perfectly felt .

		These are the facts essential to our enjoyment , and they are not obscured by any irrelevances .

		They keep alive the spirit in which ancient art realized the nude by the consistent rejec - tion of all but its life-enhancing and aesthetic attributes .

		They touch idealism on the side of this rejection , but they have all that is artistically important in the real . ''

		Of the famous '' Nocturne in Black and Gold : The Falling Rocket , '' now owned by Mrs.
Samuel Untermyer	PERSON	, she says : '' A concentrated blaze of light fills the scene with splendor and there is a double line of rising and falling fire .

		Here again is the reproduction of a beautiful visual image-by the abstract means familiar in Japanese art and only recently familiar in
Western	LOCATION	art .

		The dark masses of blackish gray foliage , the dusky blue sky , the smoke irradiated against it and cooling and graying in color as it rises , the yellowish gray fore - ground make a pattern of line and color lovely in itself , that would still be lovely if the orange and yellow of the fireworks were stains of blood and carnage , if the smoke rose from a battle-ground , if the dark hulks of the trees were heaps of slain .

		The beauty is absolutely independent of the subject , and the sentiment of the scene is strictly the pictorial sentiment .

		The exclusive propriety of this sentiment in works of art is what
Whistler	LOCATION	strove to impress upon his hearers in his ' Ten O'clock , ' and what
Ruskin	PERSON	was instinctively combatting when he called the ' Nocturne in Black and Gold ' a ' pot of paint flung in the public 's face . ' ''

		The haK-tone illustrations of the pictures described in these extracts serve chiefly to em - phasize the reasonableness of
Whistler	LOCATION	's objec - tion to all reproductions of his works .

		The most that can be said of the thirty illustrations in the book is that they add something to its use - fulness .

		More than half of the volume is taken up by lists of
Whistler	LOCATION	's paintings , drawings , lithographs , and etchings , which should prove serviceable for reference .

		These lists have been compilied principally from Exhibition catalogues .

		The retention of the phrase `` lent by '' as an indication of present ownership seems a little out of place .

		This , however , and a few slips in proof-reading , are blemishes so slight as hardly to be worth mentioning .

		In its outward ap - pearance the book shows unusual taste .

		The deep cream-colored paper is perhaps a little too thick and makes the volume needlessly heavy ; but the combination of color in paper and bind - ing is a delight to the eye .

		The aptness of Miss
Gary	PERSON	's phraseology is deserving of more than casual comment .

		Ex - ception must , however , be taken to one expres - sion , because it denotes an erroneous use of a word that is very common .

		In speaking of
Whistler	LOCATION	's etchings she says he felt '' the charm and value of spontaneity of effect and a deco - rative plan . ''

		It is evident that what is meant by '' a decorative plan '' is a carefuUy balanced space composition .

		The use of the word '' deco - rative '' to describe it is inaccurate .

		A thing can not be decorative unless its purpose or use is to decorate some other thing .

		In contrast to this verbal slip , the words with which the author ends her chapter '' On
Whistler	LOCATION	's Theory of Art '' may be quoted . ''

		One more impression of his quality may be added to this incomplete notation , not for its special but for its general importance .

		He has been described truth - fully as the apostle of good taste , with a minifying inflection suggested in the phrase .

		But good taste no longer is a negligible quantity in any practice of life .

		It involves particularly a sense of the appropriate which is not the grammar but the style of poetry .

		It implies 220 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, sacrifices and restraints worthy of a passionate dedica - tion , and so far as passion is felt in
Whistler	LOCATION	's art , it is felt as the passion of a decorum known to the modern as to the ancient in its highest function .

		Dulce et decorum est not only to die for one 's country , but to live for one 's ideal .

		This with singleness of mind he did . ''


Fkedebick W. Gookin	PERSON	.

		Shakespeare and the Modern Stage .

		* Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, a man whose utterances on Shakespeare always merit attention , has brought together an exceedingly interesting series of papers contributed by him to various periodi - cals , in a volume entitled ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	and the Modern Stage . '

		The papers differ , of course , in value , the last five being of less interest and importance than the others .

		It is indeed not a little remarkable that so interesting a subject as
Shakespeare 's Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	should have been treated in so sketchy and inadequate a fashion .

		The perfectly sound principle adopted by Mr.
Lee	PERSON	, that ideas recurring frequently , though not always appropriately , on the lips of Shake - speare 's characters may be safely accepted as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own , should be carried much fur - ther than he has chosen to carry it .

		It seems , for instance , to lead inevitably to a stronger conviction of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's fundamental fatal - ism than Mr.
Lee	PERSON	appears to hold .

		But the first six papers of the volume , though brief , are of considerable importance , and form a group by themselves ; for with one exception they deal more or less directly with the staging of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays .

		The first of them , which appropriately gives a title to the book , is a sane and practical plea for emphasis upon stage essentials -- adequate scenery , trained actors , and a varied repertory .

		The modem stage , on the contrary , seems to be largely com - mitted to tendencies that are the direct opposite of these , -- to an elaboration of accessories that forbids the exercise of the imagination ; to the sacrifice of the play to the leading actor , and the consequent disaster to the training of the rest of the company ; and to the system of long runs of single plays , which is necessitated by the elaborate staging , but is quite certain to produce monotonous and wooden acting .

		In this connection , Mr.
Lee	PERSON	pays a high and de - served tribute to the aims and achievements of Mr.
F. S. Benson	PERSON	.

		The chief value of this paper , however , does not reside in its ideal stand - ard for Shakespearean productions .

		No one • Shakespeare and the Modern Stage , and Other Essays .

Sidney Lee	PERSON	.

Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		who is competent to express an opinion would deny the correctness of these positions .

		The great objection made to this standard is that it is a counsel of perfection , and that an attempt to apply it will empty the house and the manager 's pocket alike .

		But Mr.
Lee	PERSON	makes it quite clear , from the testimony of
Phelps	LOCATION	, that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	presented in this manner can be made to '' pay , '' and he makes it equally clear , from the expe - rience of Charles
Kean	PERSON	and Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	, that the current method is sometimes ruinous from a business as well as an artistic point of view .

		It was a happy thought of Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's to write a paper on ''
Pepys	PERSON	and Shakespeare , '' and this , no doubt , many readers wiU find the most amus - ing thing in the volume , -- amusing not only because of
Pepys	PERSON	's moral scruples as to play - going , but also because of the vagaries of his dramatic taste .

		Over and over he determined to go to the theatre no more , or at any rate to limit the frequency of his visits ; but the tempta - tion was too strong .

		He resorted to sophis - tries to justify himself , -- as when he held him - self excused for going to Drury Lane '' because it was not built when his vow was framed , '' and when he congratulated himseK that his vow had been kept because , though he went to the
Duke of York 's House	ORGANIZATION	, he was unable to get places .

		But he probably imposed upon himself the strongest pressure of which his thrifty soul was capable when he vowed to give ten pounds to the poor if he went to the theatre oftener than once in a fortnight . ''

		This , I hope in God will bind me , '' he said . ''

		A Midsummer Nights Dream '' he found '' insipid and ridiculous , '' '' Twelfth Night '' `` silly '' and '' weak , '' `` Romeo and Juliet '' '' the worst that ever I heard , '' and '' OtheUo , '' when compared with
Tuke	PERSON	's `` Ad - ventures of Five Hours , '' '' a mean thing . ''

		His refusing his bookseller 's offer of a copy of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	and his choice of
Fidler	PERSON	's `` Worthies ' '' and
Butler	PERSON	's '' Hudibras '' instead , are explica - ble enough when we remember Pope 's failure , many years later , to appreciate the value of the Folio .

		Pepys lived at a critical time in the his - tory of the Shakespearean stage , and his diary is therefore of great interest to students of dramatic history .

		On the third of
January , 1661	DATE	, he first saw women 's parts acted by women .

		It was during his career as a play - goer that elaborate scenery and costumes be - came a regular feature of dramatic performances ; the mechanical and spectacular devices used in the production of `` The Tempest '' that he wit - nessed would do credit to Mr. Tree himself .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 221 The theatre of the Restoration retained , how - ever , the immense advantage of a stage extend - ing far out into the house , from which , as
Colley Gibber	PERSON	wrote , '' the most distant ear had scarce the least doubt or difficulty in hearing what fell from the weakest utterance , ... nor was the minutest motion of a feature , properly chang - ing with the passion or humor it suited , ever lost ... in the obscurity of too great a distance '' -LRB- p. 90 -RRB- .

		Pepys 's attitude , after all , is really that of the average British and American play - goer , who , `` if he were gifted with the diarist 's frankness , ... would echo the diarist 's condem - nation of Shakespeare in his poetic purity , of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	as the mere interpreter of human nature , of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	without flying machines , of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	without song and dance ; he woidd characterize undiluted Shakespearean drama as ' a mean thing , ' or the most tedious entertainment that ever he was at in his life '' -LRB- p. 110 -RRB- .

		The last paper in the volume bearing directly upon the modern production of Shakespeare is that on '' The Mimicipal Theatre , '' in which Mr.
Lee	PERSON	urges the success of the
Vienna Volks	ORGANIZATION	- Theater as an example to
London	LOCATION	, and pleads for this public recognition of the stage as an important instrument of popular education .

		In this connection ,
Phelps	ORGANIZATION	's words may well be borne in mind : '' I maintain from the experience of eighteen years , that the perpetual iteration of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's words , if nothing more , going on daily for so many months of the year , must and would produce a great effect upon the public mind '' -LRB- p. 120 -RRB- .

		These are but a few of the many points of interest and value in this collection of papers , which will prove a boon to every student of Shakespeare .

ACTON 'S Ideals of History	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is a remarkable fact that much of the his - torical writing emanating from
England	LOCATION	within the last five years professes to draw its inspira - tion from the teachings and precepts of the late Lord Acton .

		belief in the universality of his knowledge and a trust in the correctness of his ideals .

		The editors of that monumental work now appear - ing , the ''
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	, '' asserted in the preface to their first volume that they were striving to follow the plans outlined by
Lord Acton	PERSON	, who was to have been the editor - in-chief of the undertaking .

		Historical essayists , as well as the authors of more ambitious his - torical productions , have confessed themselves inspired by the teachings of one whom they re - garded almost as a master .

		And yet
Lord Acton	PERSON	himself was not a producer , and has nowhere stated definitely and at length his ideals of historical study and historical writing .

		It is partly with the purpose of emphasizing and ex - plaining these ideals , partly to expand beyond the circle of personal acquaintance a true knowl - edge of
Lord Acton	PERSON	's great qualities , that two volumes have recently appeared from the pens of close friends and admirers .

		The first of these , by
Abbot Gasquet	PERSON	, is whoUy taken up with the letters of
Lord Acton	PERSON	to his fellow editors of '' The Rambler , '' and later of the '' Home and Foreign Review . ''

		Acton became part proprietor and one of the editors of '' The Rambler '' m
1858	DATE	, and after the discontinuance of that magazine engaged himself , together with several of his colleagues , in the organization of the short-lived '' Home and Foreign Review . ''

		Both of these were
Catholic	ORGANIZATION	publications , and by far the greater part of the letters in
Abbot Gasquet	LOCATION	's volume have to do with questions of policy and attitude relating to parties and controversies within the Roman Catholic body .

		The editor himself re - marks that many of the points involved were , even at the time , understood by none but edu - cated Catholics , and that most of them have since almost dropped from memory .

		It follows that
Lord Acton	PERSON	's letters in this volmne are in general quite beyond the understanding or ap - preciation of the non-Catholic reader of to-day .

		Yet even such blind reading can not fail to impress one with the truth of the claim for
Lord Acton	PERSON	of a universality of knowledge .

		His interests were never insular -- though he always exhibited a thorough British patriotism -- but extended to all modern lands ; whenever during his frequent sojourns upon the continent he wrote of contemporary political conditions , his criticisms showed keenness of immediate per - ception as well as thoroughness of historical knowledge .

		But such letters are infrequent in the present volume , and were it not for a careful historical 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, preface one might easily miss the point of
Lord Acton	PERSON	's attitude as editor of a Catholic maga - zine .

		That attitude reveals at least one of
Lord Acton	ORGANIZATION	's ideals in historical study , -- namely , a devotion to absolute and accurate historical truth .

		He was a devout Catholic , but he was equally devout in his love of truth , and was never willing to let his loyalty to the
Church	ORGANIZATION	relax in the slightest degree the rigor of any historical presentation of previous Church con - ditions or persons .

		Abbot
Gasquet	PERSON	brings this out very clearly in his preface , and quotes an article in '' The Rambler , '' not written by
Lord Acton	PERSON	, but perfectly representing his principles . ''

		We -LSB- Catholics -RSB- have to encounter the belief that we are not only crafty and false , but actually afraid of the truth 's being known .

		This belief has to be van - quished , not by an angry denial of its justice , not by tairnts , not by bragadocio , but by proving our courage by our acts .

		It is useless to proclaim that history and science are in harmony with our religion , unless we show that we think so by being ourselves foremost in telling the whole truth about the Church and about her enemies . ''

		The policy maintained by '' The Rambler '' had the quiet support of Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	and of many of the most thoughtful Catholics in
England	LOCATION	; but it was attacked with vigor by a faction really , though not avowedly , directed by Cardinal
Wiseman	PERSON	, and the originality and dar - ing of '' The Rambler '' made it an object of nervous distrust to the general and more con - servative Catholic body . ''

		The Rambler '' and the ''
Dublin	LOCATION	Review '' were far apart in their treatment of Church history .

		Abbot Gasquet writes : '' In historical matters , the policy of ' The
Dublin	LOCATION	' appears to have been to avoid , as far as possible , facing unpleasant facts in the past , and to explain away , if it could not directly deny , the existence of ' blots ' in the ecclesiastical annals of the older centuries .

		* The Rambler , ' on the other hand , held the view that the Church had nothing to lose and much to gain by meet - ing facts as they were .

		And acting up to this , it did not hesitate to discuss the conduct of the Popes of the Renaissance and the characters of canonized saints , etc. , with entire freedom , on the ground that no supreme office nor assumed sanctity was an a priori proof of impeccability , and that it should not shield the one class or the other from legitimate criticism .

		It taunted all those who would attempt , for example , the rehabilitation of ' bad popes , ' and would desire that all should shut their eyes to the unpleasant facts of Church history , as being plain ' whitewashers . ' ''

		Many attempts were made to smooth over the difficulties arising from these two diverse points of view , but in the end the situation became an impossible one , and '' The Rambler '' suspended publication , as did its successor , '' The Home and Foreign Review , '' after a brief existence in which an unsuccessful effort was made to keep away from controversial topics .

		Neither of these publications was suspended , says
Abbot Gasquet	PERSON	in contradiction of ordinary historical accounts , because of direct intervention from
Rome	LOCATION	, but rather because
Lord Acton	PERSON	and his friends yielded to the conviction that such con - troversies tended to over-emphasize what were , after all , unessential differences within the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		They yielded their active assertion of opinions by publication , but retained the opinions .

		And
Abbot Gasquet	PERSON	asserts also that to-day the criticisms and opinions of the
Catho	PERSON	- lic circle , as he likes to call it , would meet with no opposition from the authorities of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the preface to the volume of Lord Acton 's '' Lectures on Modern History '' gives a different impression of the results of this controversy ; for here it is stated that
Lord Acton	PERSON	, wearied and unsuccessful in the contest , welcomed the quiet promised by his appointment to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and in the almost passionate devotion he exhib - ited for the concrete truths of history evidenced the bitterness remaining from the struggle through which he had passed .

		The lectures here printed include the Inaugural lecture of
1895	DATE	, and nineteen lectures covering the period from the Renaissance to the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, delivered in the academical years from
1899	DATE	to
1901	DATE	.

		According to the editors of this voliune , much of
Lord Acton	PERSON	's influence arose from the enthusiasm for his subject manifested by the lecturer , so that when placed in cold type the lectures may seem inadequate in comparison with
Lord Acton	PERSON	's reputation .

		It is certainly true that a first impression derived from a rapid reading is that the lectures contain little that could not be found in any ordinary brief history of the period .

		But as one reads more carefully he realizes that every statement of fact , every idea expressed , has been carefully selected , or thoroughly weighed ; that the simple language used is purposely chosen in order that no con - fusion may arise ; that the few facts cited and illustrations given , from the multitude that might have been employed , are the exact ones best suited to the lecturer 's purpose ; and above aU , that there runs through each lecture an ideal of the progressive development of modem history so delicately stated as to be whoUy unob - trusive , yet so clearly conveyed as to be per - fectly unmistakable .

		It is easy to assert the unity of the history of modern states , or to phi - losophize upon it and choose isolated illustra - tions by way of proof ; but the highest form of art in historical writing is that which narrates
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 223 events without specifying directly the ideals it is sought to convey , and yet does emphatically convey such ideals to the reader .

		Of this form ,
Lord Acton	PERSON	's lectures are all excellent illustra - tions ; while that on Luther may well stand as an almost perfect example .

		In his Inaugural lecture .

		Lord
Acton	PERSON	used a more direct form ; and here he stated quite clearly his ideals of the real purpose of histor - ical study .

		He told the contributors to the Modern History series which he had planned , that '' the recent past contains the key to the present time '' ; and in the Inaugural , delivered some years earlier , he emphasized the usefulness of history in freeing the mind from '' illusions or unsifted prejudices . '' ''

		Its study fulfils its purpose , even if it only makes us wiser , without producing books , and gives us the gift of his - torical thinking , which is better than historical learning . ''

		And again he said : '' For our purpose , the main thing to learn is not the art of accumulating material , but the sublimer art of investigating it , of discerning truth from falsehood and certainty from doubt .

		It is by solidity of criticism , more than by the plenitude of erudition , that the study of his - tory strengthens and straightens and extends the mind . ''

		These were his beliefs as to the purposes of his - torical study , asserting its practical character and emphasizing the love of truth for truth 's sake ; but in treating of historical writing he elucidates that which was the great character - istic of his own lectures -- the unity of modern history , and that a constant '' progress in the direction of organized and assured freedom is its characteristic fact and its tribute to the theory of
Providence	LOCATION	. ''

		In fact , the two ideals that dominated
Lord Acton	PERSON	's plan for the '' Cambridge Modern History '' were , the study of historical condi - tions that the present time might be rightly interpreted , and a conception of history based on the thought of universal progress .

		These ideals were to be made manifest by the pens of men who were masters of the particular epochs of which they wrote .

		In the preface to their first volume , the present editors of the series state that they '' have adhered scrupulously to the spirit of his -LSB-
Acton	LOCATION	's -RSB- design . ''

		But the editors of
Lord Acton	ORGANIZATION	's Lectures evidently do not agree that these ideals have been strictly followed , and , although not offering any criti - cism , have published as an Appendix
Lord Acton	PERSON	's original letter to the contributors out - lining his purpose .

		In this the most striking paragraphs are the following : `` The recent Past contains the key to the present time .

		All forms of thought that influence it come before us in their turn , and we have to describe the ruling currents , to interpret the sovereign forces , that still govern and divide the world . '' ''

		By
Universal History	ORGANIZATION	I understand that which is distinct from the combined history of all countries , which is not a rope of sand , but a continuous develop - ment , and is not a burden on the memory , but an illum - ination of the soul .

		It moves in a succession to which the nations are subsidiary .

		Their story will be told , not for their own sake , but in reference and in subor - dination to a higher series , according to the time and degree in which they contribute to the common fortunes of mankind . ''

		The second paragraph of the preceding quota tion is given , with some slight changes in word - ing , by the present editors of the Modern His ^ tory series in their Inaugural preface ; but it is exactly in the purpose here indicated that the later volumes have more and more departed from
Lord Acton	LOCATION	's ideals .

		It is true also that the original plan of having each chapter written by the best quahfied specialist has not been fol - lowed .

		In the present volume on the Thirty Years War , for example , twelve of the twenty - seven chapters are contributed by the editors themselves .

		It may well have been discovered , however , that it was impossible to secure the one recognized specialist supposedly available for each minute period and topic , and certainly no just criticism can be directed against either the matter or the method of Mr.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	's six chapters in the present volume .

		But when
Lord Acton	PERSON	's main purpose is considered , -- the purpose of leaving on the mind of the reader an indelible impression of the continuous de - velopment of modern history , -- it can not but be acknowledged that no single author in this volume has succeeded in conveying such ideas as
Lord Acton	PERSON	himself has conveyed them in his lectures .

		Compare , for example .

		Lord
Acton	PERSON	's lecture on Richelieu with Mr.
Stanley Leathe	PERSON	's chapter on the same character .

		Lord Acton first guards his hearers against an over - estimation of
Richelieu	ORGANIZATION	's abilities by stating his `` low - water mark '' ; he then analyzes what Richelieu really accomplished , and this analysis , accompanied by pertinent illustrations , renders the final dictum convincing .

		Mr.
Leathes	PERSON	gives pages of exact and careful detail in relation to
Richelieu	ORGANIZATION	's acts and policy , gradually building a feeling of the greatness of his supposed hero ; then , in a few pages of adverse criticism , he destroys the figure he has created .

		In fact , his criticism is not really criticism , but rather merely a bald denial of the merits usually credited to Richelieu , and reads much like a condensation of
Avenel	LOCATION	's dicta .

		Lord Acton presents Richelieu as but the tool of his time , 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	the personification in
France	LOCATION	of the ripening age of political absolutism ; his acts and policy , as in the toleration he showed to Protestants , indicative of a change in world policy , when
France	LOCATION	, in this period , was a leader .

		In short .

		Lord
Acton	PERSON	depicts
Richelieu	PERSON	as an evidence of progressive development in modern history .

		All this Mr.
Leathes	PERSON	does not see , or at least does not state even by implication ; with the result that his detailed accuracy fails utterly to give to Richelieu a distinct place or purpose in his - tory .

		Thus the genius and the art of
Lord Acton	LOCATION	in conveying ideas while strictly adher - ing to historical truth are wholly lacking in this , and in by far the greater number of spe - cialized chapters in the ''
Cambridge Modem History	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It may be that the ideal of
Lord Acton	PERSON	of a new history that should present '' a continiious development ... not a burden on the memory , but an illumination of the soul , '' has been found impossible of realization by the present editors ; or perhaps they are among those historians who would deny that such an ideal is compatible with a truthful and accurate narration of historical events .

		It is not here necessary to repeat what has previously been stated of earlier volumes of this series , that it still remains a wonderful com - pendium of historical knowledge , to be trusted in details , and containing many unusual aids for the student and the investigator .

		Yet its claim to a wholly original method is not well founded , for other works of a similar character have been equally devoted to accurate historical mono - graphs written by specialists , while
Lord Acton	PERSON	's conception , -- the conception of a modern history that should move '' in a succession to which the nations are subsidiary , '' and should be '' not a burden on the memory , but an illumination of the soul , '' -- has , either intentionally or by lack of ability to evolve it , been wholly set aside .

		Three Books on Musicians and Music * In a well-made volume called '' The Romantic Composers , '' Mr.
Daniel Gregory Mason	PERSON	has gathered a number of essays covering the period of musical history in which devotion to form was rapidly modified by the insistence on the personal message , and the lyrical emotion of the

		composer foimd or made its way toward utter - ance through the possibilities of the modem orchestra .

		The six composers chosen by Mr.
Mason	PERSON	to illustrate this movement are
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Schumann	LOCATION	,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	,
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	, and
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the study of these widely varying natures Mr.
Mason	PERSON	brings acute musical percep - tion , a sure grasp of his thesis , and an intelligent sympathy which never weakens into partisan - ship .

		He h ^ no love for the advanced realism of to-day , but frankly confesses that his attacks on it will probably find few assenting voices .

		His views are set forth in clear and vigorous English , and with a self-respecting reserve as far as possible from the gush which makes so many easily - written books on music such terribly hard reading .

		Of the various essays , the one on Schumann seems to have been written from most intimate knowledge and sympathy , and will probably be read with most satisfaction .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	admits the justice , from a technical point of view , of
Weingartner	PERSON	's criticism of the
Schumann	PERSON	symphonies as '' composed for the pianoforte and arranged for the orchestra '' ; but urges the intrinsic tonal beauty of the themes as a compensating merit .

		The two papers on
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	and
Berlioz	PERSON	are fine characteriza - tions of two careers whose mutual contrast is well-nigh antipodal .

		On the whole , Mr.
Mason	PERSON	has given us a delightful book , well worth the attention of both amateur and professional .

		The '' Mastersingers '' of Mr.
Filson Young	PERSON	is a republication , with some additions , of a series of essays on musical subjects which ap - peared several years ago and which has there - fore won something more than ephemeral recog - nition in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		As the work of so youthful a writer -LRB- Mr.
Young	PERSON	tells us that he was only nineteen when most of them were published -RRB- , these papers display a remarkable maturity of thought and even world wisdom ; and the fervid intensity of many passages is intelligible and excusable .

		Some of the essays are '' programme '' interpretations of great sym - phonies like
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's Pastoral and
Tschai	PERSON	- kowsky 's Pathetic ; '' Tristan and Isolde '' is a more objective description of
Wagner	PERSON	's great drama of love and death ; and '' The Spirit of the Piano '' is a very just appreciation of
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	's genius .

		Mr.
Young	PERSON	's essay on
Hector Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	may profitably be comj -RRB- ared with that of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	mentioned above ; and in '' The Music of the Cafes '' we have a brief but telling sketch of the most innocent feature in the strange half - world of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lawrence GUman	PERSON	has for some years
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 225 been saying good things about music to the readers of American periodicals .

		Some of his articles have been carefully revised and pub - lished in book form imder the title of '' The Music of To-morrow . ''

		It would seem that
Wagner	PERSON	is of yesterday ,
Strauss	PERSON	of to-day ; and for to-morrow we are to attain unto the under - standing of such composers as Vincent d'Indy ,
Claude de Bussey	PERSON	, and
Charles Martin Loeffler	PERSON	.

		This position is maintained by Mr.
Oilman	PERSON	with a persuasive rhetoric that will appeal most strongly to those who have studied the works of these latest exponents of the divine art .

		As for
Richard Strauss	PERSON	, it is interesting , in view of the recent clamor about '' Salome , '' to note that Mr.
Oilman	PERSON	regards him -LRB- quoting the epigram of Mr.
Ernest Newman	PERSON	-RRB- as `` an enormously clever man who was once a genius . '' ''

		Salome '' is strongly objected to by Mr.
Oilman	PERSON	, not be - cause it is wicked , but because it is weak .

		The repelling subject is not atoned for by splendid music : '' the score is rich in the familiar audacities of
Strauss	PERSON	's style , but they are with - out point , without grip , '' in short , the contor - tions of the Sibyl without her inspiration , -- a conclusion from which some musicians will be inclined to dissent , who think that the score of '' Salome '' shows growth instead of decline , and would place
Strauss	PERSON	's nadir at the '' Sinfonia Domestica . ''

		mediate perceptions , and is revealed only to the clarified vision that can pierce the grossness of the sensual mists that envelope our daily lives .

		This ideal is embodied for Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	-LRB- as is well known -RRB- in the Catholic church , and her book is essentially the narrative of a new pilgrim 's progress toward that shining distant goal .

		Her pilgrim is of mingled Irish and Spanish blood , whose life has been shaped by circumstance into the conventional English mould .

		For upwards of fifty years he has led a prosaic existence of mechanical routine as a clerk in a banking house .

		He has certain marks of distinction , however , -- such as the name of
Dominic Iglesias	PERSON	and a physiognomy of refined and ascetic type -- which have always stood as the signs of a character too finely individualized to lose its stamp .

		He has done his daily work with faithful efficiency until the time when we make his acquaint - ance , the critical time which superannuates him and throws him in bewilderment upon his inner re - sources .

		Then romance makes an unheralded en - trance into his life -- romance as embodied in a dazzling creature named
Poppy St. John	ORGANIZATION	.

		She is a being of air and fire , a creature of impulses that have been sadly in need of regulation , for lack whereof she has gone sadly astray .

		But she so captivates us -LRB- as she captivates
Dominic	PERSON	-RRB- that we half forget her frailty in the revelation of the better possibilities of her nature .

		What follows upon the knitting of a relationship between these two is no vulgar liaison , but the upspringing of long dormant higher instincts in both their souls .

		The rare sym - pathy which henceforth links their lives in spiritual union reveals to both the far horizon ; the woman divests her life of unworthiness , and the man makes his peace with the church of his forbears .

		This is the essential movement of a narrative that has many minor features of interest -- incisive characteriza - tion , descriptive charm , and grave beauty of diction .

		It reaches an end of chastened pathos with the death of
Dominic	PERSON	, from whom we feel that the friend who lives to mourn his memory has won strength and purification that will last out her remaining years .

		The Welsh country , with its picturesque scenery , its distinctive human type , and its religious emotion - alism , is the setting of Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	's new novel .

		A Welsh maiden is the heroine , a maiden so unso - phisticated that she is afraid of love when it makes entrance into her life , and rejects the right man to marry the wrong one lest by yielding to the former 's appeal she shoidd find herself loving him too much for her peace of mind .

		It makes a curiously unreal complication , and ends in a subdued sort of tragedy .

		The two men , one a poor bank clerk , the other a wealthy aristocrat , are thrown together by accident in the first chapter , and discover that they bear the same name , although in no way related .

		This chance bond of union leads to an intimate associa - tion , which even outlives their rivalry for Aura 's hand .

		The rich man has the nobler soiJ , and his poor namesake is poorer in character than in worldly possessions .

		But the irony of fate , coupled with the 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, girl 's idiosyncrasy , wins the prize for the unworthy aspirant , and nothing is left his rival but to die gracefully and poetically in the last chapter .

		The irony of the situation finds expression in the title , '' A Sovereign Remedy , '' for in this case his wealth proves anything but a sovereign remedy for the hero 's disease .

		Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	is so wise a woman and so admirable a writer that her work always gives pleasure of a refined sort , but the present story offers only a pale reflection of the power displayed in her novels of Indian life .

		Mrs.
Henry Dudeney	PERSON	's portrayal of rustic scenes and characters are suggestive of the best work of
George Eliot	PERSON	and Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, and are ftot unworthy to be compared with those prototypes .

		This praise , high as it is , seems to us fairly earned by two or three of her books , and by none more fully than by `` The Battle of the Weak . ''

		In this strong and beautiful narrative , moreover , we find the quality of charm , which was somehow lacking in the earlier novels , and which was much needed to relieve the sombreness of their cast .

		The scene is
Gossips Green	ORGANIZATION	, a village on the
Cornish	LOCATION	coast ; the time is that of the Napoleonic wars .

		On a wild night of
1790	DATE	, a Frenchwoman is cast ashore from a wrecked ship , and lives just long enough to give birth to the child who is the hero of the narrative .

		A year or more later , the union of a retired soldier with a schoolmistress results in the birth of a girl .

		These two , the boy whimsically named
Quaker Jay	ORGANIZATION	, the girl baptized as
Lucy Bertram	PERSON	, are destined for one another in the end , but not until much suffering has chastened both their lives .

		We now pass lightly over a score of years , and find
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	a mad , irresponsible youth , the puzzle and scandal of the village , spectacular and vivid in his every act , a strange compound of recklessness and poetical mysti - cism , resulting from the blending of unrevealed ancestral strains .

		Meanwhile ,
Lucy	PERSON	, conventionally nurtured , becomes the wife of the village physician , a victim of self-repression , and a creature whose life is measured by rule and precept .

		It is a case of tragical mismating , for her every instinct turns toward
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, whose eyes have pursued her with adoring gaze from the time when they first fell upon her .

		How she struggles with the surging pas - sion , and how it fails to subdue her even upon a critical occasion in which the sentimental novelist would find ample warrant for her yielding , is subtly and powerfully set before us .

		Mrs.
Dudeney	PERSON	shows us how this most delicate of themes may be handled with perfect sincerity , yet without a trace of impure suggestion .

		She has written a story of truly wonder - ful beauty , commingled with tragic pathos and quaint humor , a book over which the storm cloud of tragedy hangs , yet which ends with the serenity of sunset peace . ''

		The Lonely Lady of Grosvenor Square '' is Mrs.
Henry	PERSON	de la Pasture 's latest novel .

		It is a delicate piece of work , quietly and charmingly sentimental , but with little of the sparkle and animation of '' The Man from
America	LOCATION	. ''

		It tells of a modest country girl , transplanted to the
London	LOCATION	palace in which a wealthy aunt , long estranged from her kinspeople , is lying in her last illness .

		Death claims its own , and the girl is surprised to learn that her brother -LRB- a soldier in
Africa	LOCATION	-RRB- has been made the legatee of his aunt 's possessions .

		In her brother 's absence she naturally takes charge , and tries to fit herself into her new conditions .

		A neighboring Duke , distantly related , helps to smooth away her difficvdties , and romance soon appears upon the scene .

		Then comes news of the brother 's death in some far-off war , and with it the knowledge that he had been secretly married , leaving a widow and a chUd .

		This throws doubt upon her interest in the property , which does not make a bit of difference to her lover , but greatly agitates his worldly-minded mother .

		Presently the widow , a Frenchwoman , appears upon the scene , and proves to be a very satisfactory sort of relative .

		She insists upon a division of the property , and all ends happily .

		This is a book of manners and sen - timents ; it touches only the surface of life , but it is agreeably written and proves mildly enter - taining .

		Mr.
H. B. Marriott Watson	PERSON	has recently written two stories for our entertainment , both highly inter - esting , although in very different ways .

		One is '' A Midsummer Day 's Dream , '' being a fantastic comedy of an • English country house party ; the other is '' The Privateers , '' being an exciting tale of intrigue , adventui-e , and hairbreadth escape .

		The first of these books brings us into the company of a pleasant group of people who are preparing for an amateur performance of '' A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream . ''

		The hero , who makes a belated appearance while the rehearsals are in progress , catches a brief glimpse of a nymph fleeing through the park , and retains as a trophy a shoe that she has shed in her flight .

		The rest of the story tells of his efforts to pick out his Cinderella from the bevy of young women who are members of the house party .

		His tactics are of such a nature that the other men of the party , driven to exasperation , wait upon him one morning with a categorical demand .

		They want to know whether he has designs on all the girls in the house .

		After being misled by several false clews , he at last dis - covers the object of his quest , and the consequences are what we have a right to expect .

		The vein of light and fanciful comedy in which this story is written makes of it a charming piece of work . ''

		The Privateers , '' on the other hand , is dis - tinctly melodramatic .

		It is concerned with the rivalry of two American speculators for the posses - sion of a young Englishwoman who , unknown to herself , is the heiress to the controlling interest in a certain American railroad .

		She is abducted from her home on the Isle of
Wight	LOCATION	, and carried to
Brittany	PERSON	on a private yacht .

		The hero is a gallant and resourceful British naval officer , who allies him - self first with one rival and then with the other , and finally rescues the distressed damsel from both .

		It is a merry game of hide and seek , played all along the Breton and
Cornish	PERSON	coasts , and has enough des -

		THE DIAL 227 perate situations to stock two or three ordinary romances .

		We can not say very much for Mr.
Wat	PERSON	- son 's Americans .

		Their acts and their words are reflections of an Englishman 's fertile imagination rather than products of observation -- unless it be observation of American manners as depicted on the English melodramatic stage .

		In `` The Amulet '' Miss Murfree has again made use of her extensive knowledge of the history of
Tennessee	LOCATION	, the period being that of the close of the Seven Years ' War .

		The scene is the British out - post of Fort Prince
George	PERSON	, on the eastern edge of the Cherokee country , where a small garrison is beset by its Indian foes , who are cowed but not subdued , and whose treacherous character means the possi - bility of surprise and massacre .

		The commander , his querulous sister , his beautiful daughter , and two young officers who are aspirants for her hand , are the characters of this historical romance , which is a rather sketchy bit of work on the whole , although it evinces & close acquaintance with
Cherokee	ORGANIZATION	lore .

		Dramatically , the story leads up to an expedition to the sacred town of Chot ^ , for the purpose of seizing certain cannon which the Indians have kept in vio - lation of their treaty agreement ; sentimentally , it declares for the courageous leader of this expedition and the corresponding discomfiture of his fatuous rival .

		Touches of poetic description are frequent in adornment of the narrative , for in this respect Miss
Murfree	ORGANIZATION	's hand has not lost its cunning , but other - wise the book falls far below the high standard set in her earlier writings . ''

		Romance Island '' exists in the fourth dimen - sion , which is the reason why it is not found upon the map .

		Its inhabitants are descended from
Hiram	PERSON	,
Prince of Tyre	ORGANIZATION	, and their civilization is far superior to ours in most respects .

		An American has found his way to them and become their king , which does not at all suit the ambitions of the native Prince
Tabnit	PERSON	, who presently finds a convenient way in which to dispose of the alien usurper .

		Thereupon Tabnit embarks upon a submarine and goes to
New York	LOCATION	, where the story opens after the events above related have all occurred .

		We are now introduced to the heroine , the daughter of the dispossessed king .

		Tabnit falls in love with her , abducts her , and bears her to the island with the intention of making her his bride .

		Now the hero , who is a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper reporter , has also fallen in love with her , and when she disappears , fits out an expe - dition in pursuit of her .

		His yacht successfully negotiates the difficulties of the fourth dimension , and lands its party on the mysterious island .

		From this point on , all is extravaganza .

		The writer lets her imagination run riot , but contrives to be enter - taining -- save for a tendency to indulge in prolix description -- until the climax is reached in the restoration of the king , the effacement of his wicked rival , and the triumphant rescue of the maiden , followed by her restoration to the world of prose ; that is , to as prosaic a world as lovers are supposed to inhabit .

		Miss
Gale	PERSON	has a pretty fancy , a manner of marked originality , and the trick of making a deft use of bits of literary , scientific , and archaeo - logical information .

		Poe would have opened his eyes wide had he foreseen , among the progeny of '' The Gold Bug , '' such a yarn as '' The Treasure of
Peyre Gaillard	PERSON	. ''

		The analytical process which that pioneer in the tale of mystery applied to the location of the spot where his hoard lay buried was simplicity itself in comparison with the method whereby the hidden treasure is discovered in the present ingenious nar - rative .

		As a matter of fact Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	overdoes the thing by too much subtlety , and by an appara - tus of documents which makes unconscionable de - mands upon the attention of his readers .

		Long before the end is reached , the reader becomes wearied with so great a complication , gives up his attempt to follow the clue , and is content to abridge the argument that he may the more speedily come to its conclusion .

		The scene of the story is a
South Carolina	LOCATION	plantation , whose owner is so impoverished that he is on the verge of desperation ; under these circumstances the discovery of the treasure becomes a necessity of the situation , of which fact we are so well assured that we grow careless in tracing the logical development of the search for it .

		The style of the story offers a curious blend of romantic glamour with realistic description ; at one moment we are rhapsodizing over the beauties of nature , and at the next we are engrossed by a mass of prosaic detail .

		When the treasure is unearthed and disposed of , it brings close upon
two millions of dollars	MONEY	, which sum is carefully itemized lest some lingering trace of incredulity should mar our unqualified acceptance of so satisfactory a total .

		The romantic and tragic history of certain mem - bers of the
Imperial House of Austria	ORGANIZATION	has provided Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	with the basic material for his '' Port of Missing Men . ''

		It is only by way of suggestion , however , for an attempt to identify his characters with actual Archdukes would be unprofit - able .

		It seems that ' a possible heir to the throne has disappeared somewhere in
America	LOCATION	, and that the succession must remain unsettled until it is deter - mined whether he be alive or dead .

		Meanwhile , a gang of scoundrels are intriguing in behalf of another claimant , for whom they are smoothing the way by a series of ingenious assassinations .

		The key to the mystery is in the possession of an expatriated Austrian who has become an American , and is known as
John Armitage	PERSON	.

		He has the evidence of the lost Archduke 's demise , but does not care to play into the hands of the conspirators by revealing it .

		The scene of the tale is first set in
Geneva	LOCATION	, but is soon transferred to
Virginia	LOCATION	, where the plot , which has been steadily thickening , comes to an exciting finish .

		A high-spirited American girl is the heroine , and the hero , after routing the conspirators , wins her for his bride as a matter of course .

		The story is fashioned after the conventional romantic pattern , 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, and displays no little skill in both plot and charac - terization .

		Corrupt politics and love are the ingredients , the former predominating , of Mr.
Will Payne	PERSON	's latest novel , '' When Love Speaks . ''

		The love interest is of the homely everyday sort , to be paralleled in the annals of a million homes ; the political interest is similar to that which a close study of thousands of American communities would disclose .

		The scene is a city of
Western Michigan	LOCATION	, in which a zealous dis - trict attorney conducts a desperate campaign against corruption , and ends by discovering that the forces of evil are too powerful for him to cope with .

		This disheartening conclusion is somewhat relieved by the outcome of the story upon its sentimental side , when husband and wife , estranged by their diffei'ing points of view , learn the lesson that instinct is a better guide than reason in the affairs of the heart .

		The in - junction implicit in the novelist 's treatment of his theme seems to be that we should take the world as we find it , with its mingling of evil motives with good , and not hope to eliminate the evil all at once .

		It is a counsel of practical wisdom , no doubt , but it seems to us also to have a tinge of despair .

		Probably he makes a little too much of the soul of good in things evil , finding too ready an excuse for com - promise with wrong , and allowing indignation to cool when it were better to keep it white-hot .

		At all events , he has worked in a spirit of absolute realism , and made a searching analysis of the meth - ods of the political corruptionist .

		Truthfulness rather than idealism is the note of the book , although it has latent idealism a-plenty , and '' Pardon 's the word for all '' would be a more closely descriptive Shakespearean motto than the one which actually adorns the title-page .

		In '' The Charlatans '' Mr.
Bert Leston Taylor	PERSON	has given us a clever sketch of musical student life in a large city .

		The city may with no great difficulty be recognized as
Chicago	LOCATION	, and the Colossus -- other - wise known as the
Grindstone	LOCATION	-- may possibly suggest to some readers a particular institution in which music has been successfully commercialized for many years .

		To this hive of industry a young girl from the country finds her way , under the delu - sion that it is a focus of musical culture .

		Since she has the true artistic endowment , she soon discovers that the work of the
Grindstone	PERSON	bears no relation to music in any real sense , that its ways are those of charlatanism and its spirit that of the philistine .

		She slowly gropes her way toward the light , and a promising artistic future seems to lie before her , when the mischief-maker Love enters upon the scene , and makes music seem a matter of minor importance .

		What eventually becomes of her is not revealed , since the writer leaves her hand in hand with the fairy prince by the brookside .

		But we may still surmise that she became a respectable amateur .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's touch is everywhere light and pleasing ; he has the gift of gentle social satire and the trick of clever dialogue .

		d '' `` ti `` n to Mr.
Walter Taylor Field	PERSON	, several of whose papers on books for children have appeared in its pages .

		These chap - ters and some additional ones on the same subject are now published in book form under the title , '' Fingerposts to Children 's Reading '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Books are living and breathing companions to their eager juvenile readers , Mr.
Field	PERSON	well urges , and hence the care needed in their selection .

		Their influence is both moral and aesthetic , and the two are not so very widely separated .

		Nor is there any useful distinction between boys ' books and girls ' books : if both are real literature , they will interest both sexes .

		Fairy tales receive a warm word of praise .

		The excess of periodical literature , most of it of little worth , read by children is deplored , and the formation of good libraries in family , school , and
Sunday	DATE	school , is strongly recommended .

		Chapters on reading in school , on supplementary reading , on the public library , on the illustrating of children 's books , and on Mother Goose , acceptably fill out the volume .

		A fifty-page list of young people 's books , with indication of the school grade or gi'ades in which each work should be read , forms an appendix .

		To an older person the list seems lacking in many a fondly remembered favorite of childhood ; but , unless the catalogue were to be of undesirable length , this is inevitable .

		One criticism of a general nature : the child in the author 's mind 's eye would seem to be rather precocious or priggish , or both .

		Can the ordinary child enjoy Shakespeare in the original at nine or ten , even in the few plays named ?

		or the `` Essays of Elia '' and
Thoreau	PERSON	's `` Walden '' at fourteen or fifteen ?

		or Miss Edge - worth 's '' Parent 's Assistant '' at any age ?

		The reviewer 's experience strongly inclines him to say no , especially in the matter of
Miss Edgeworth	LOCATION	.

		And although
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's essays .

		Pastor
Wagner	PERSON	's `` Simple Life , ''
Carlyle	PERSON	's `` Sartor Resartus , '' and
Lowell	PERSON	's prose works look well on the school library 's shelves , and by the mere displays of their lettered backs exert an educational influence , is any scholar , even in the high school , qualified to get that benefit from them that he might from reading other books more surely within his mental grasp ? ''

		Sartor '' might well give him a dislike for its author which he would never overcome .

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	's book is attractive in form and carefully printed , -- although ''
Clark	PERSON	: Self - Culture '' is an inaccurate entry for
James Freeman Clarke	ORGANIZATION	's excellent work on that subject .

		Progress in this field has been rapid and so subversive to widely accepted concep -
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 tions of certain of the factors of evolution that there has been great need of a critical review of the data .

		Professor
Thomas Hunt Morgan	PERSON	, recently appointed to the chair of Experimental Zoology in
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, has rendered this service to American biologists in his `` Experimental Zoology '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		The author takes up the experimental study of evolution , discussing the influence of exter - nal conditions in causing changes in the structure of animals but denying in the main that such changes are normally inherited .

		He likewise decides against the probable inheritance of mutations , and of the effects of use and disuse , and dismisses the supposed phenomenon of telegony as a breeders ' myth .

		The inheritance of disease through the mother is indi - cated by some recent experimental evidence , but demands more critical evidence .

		The rediscovery in recent years of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	's law of hybridization has given great stimulus to the scientific study of animal and plant breeding and unlocked not a few secrets of heredity .

		The possibility of the experi - mental development of new races of jlomesticated animals , races moreover of fixed and stable types , is firmly established .

		The unsolved riddles in this new field are still many and perplexing , as the reader will soon discover who attempts to thread the maze of '' heterozygotes and extracted recessives . ''

		This phase of the experimental field is evidently still in too raw a state for a well-digested summary .

		The discoveries of De Vries of the origin of new species of evening primrose by saltatory variation or mutation , as he designates it , has raised anew the whole question of the potency and scope of natural selection in evolution , and compels a new examina - tion of variation in its relation to the origin of species and the progress of organic differentiation .

		According to the mutation theory of De Vries , na - tural selection destroys species , it does not originate them .

		The experimental study of the determina - tion of sex has as yet brought forward no satisfying evidence that external factors in any way control the sex of offspring .

		On the other hand , much of the recent work in cytology and experimental breed - ing points to the probability that sex is predeter - mined in the union of the sex cells .

		An excellent summary of the recent literature on the various phases of this problem is found in these pages .

		The novelty of the field covered in this work and the very fundamental bearings of the data and hypo - theses here gathered in a critical summary combine to make Professor
Morgan	PERSON	's work indispensable to anyone who wishes critical information of recent movements in the biological world .

		Studies m There appeared in the pages of fiowerg for the `` The Studio '' some seven or eight art student .

		years ago , two ob three studies of flowers in flat tones by
Miss J. Foord	PERSON	, which at - tracted attention at once by their unusual artistic quality and marked individuality of treatment .

		The skilful placing upon the page and the fine feeling for decorative arrangement put them in a class by them - selves .

		These were the forerunners of the series which was published in a folio by Mr.
B. T. Batsf	PERSON	ord of
London	LOCATION	, in
1904	DATE	.

		The success of the book was immediate and well-deserved .

		Moved by its favor - able reception the author has been led to prepare a second series of '' Decorative Plant and Flower Studies '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- that are in some respects even more successful than the former .

		Though intended primarily for artists and designers , the beauty of the plates makes the volume one to be enjoyed for its aesthetic quality alone .

		The studies , forty in number , are reproduced in color by a French stencil process that has yielded most charming results .

		These are supplemented by an equal number of full-page drawings in outline , giv - ing details of growth and structure , and also by a set of smaller ones that convey the spirit and effect of each plant as a whole .

		Miss
Foord	ORGANIZATION	's draughts - manship sets a notable standard in its combination of force with delicacy .

		Her vigorous renderings show most clearly tliat flowers have greater possi - bilities for the artist than are commonly recognized .

		Especially in the representation of fragile plants like the barley and the flowering rush does she furnish effective object lessons .

		These , as she clearly dem - onstrates , have in their own way no less strength than more majestic members of the floral tribe , such as the marrow or the hollyhock .

		It is entirely a matter of treatment -- in this as in everything else .

		Students using this book should not overlook Miss
Foord	ORGANIZATION	's comments upon the plants depicted ; her words are very much to the point and emphasize the lessons taught by the drawings .

		Mr.
H. Maynard Smith	PERSON	will , without fiianmallr .

		question , be pleased to have his little book of essays , '' In Playtime '' -LRB- Ox - ford :
B. H. Blackwell	PERSON	-RRB- commended as suggesting more than once the genially autobiographic manner and the frolic playfulness of the master essayist in this kind , whom we do not need to name .

		Yet , born of the Elian spirit though he manifestly is , the author appears to be in error in one small particular concerning Lamb 's habits .

		`` Charles Lamb , '' he tells us , '' earned the gratitude of
John Company	ORGANIZATION	and a pension by what he wrote in Mincing Lane ; but he earned the gratitude of a nation by what he wrote at his own fireside . ''

		On the contrary , the tradition -LRB- and in part the authentic history -RRB- is that
Lamb	PERSON	did not hold his nose to his ledger all through office hours , but dashed off many a letter or squib or essay as he sat perched on that lofty stool , osten - sibly engaged in furthering the interests of
John Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such truancy of his quill was admirably in keeping with his well-known answer to an official rebuke for coming late in the morning . ''

		Well , you see , I make up for it by going early , '' was the bland excuse .

		Like
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Smith	PERSON	is a bachelor ; but -LRB- or hence -RRB- he delivers himself freely of advice to parents ; and like Lamb , again , he can write well on the subject of letter-writing .

		But in saying , incidentally , that Mrs.
Kemble	PERSON	made it a rule to 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, have her letters equal her correspondent 's in length , he is slightly in error .

		That lady 's rule was even more peculiar : she insisted on sending back the same amount of stationery as she received , whether written on or not .

		These light and quickly-read chapters , which have already had periodical publi - cation , equal the muses in number , and the gi'aces in general variety of subject matter , -- two chapters dealing with English literature -LRB- Sliakespeare and
Scott	PERSON	-RRB- , four with some branch or aspect of the author 's art , and two with affairs of daily life .

		The worthy and interesting contri - Thepsvcholofw ^ ^ i f ^ J p-j ^ ^ t the dis - of races .

		.

		i i • i cussion of the psychological explana - tion of racial traits finds a lucid translation at the hands of
Florence Wade-Evans	ORGANIZATION	, the work appearing under the title '' Race Prejudice '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is amongst the contemporary French thinkers that this problem of the psychological equations of races has reached most definite expression .

		From their sev - eral points of view
M. Boutmy	PERSON	,
M. Fouillife	PERSON	, M. Le Bon , and others have set forth , at times clini - cally , at times more academically , their analyses of the constituent traits , temperament , reaction to milieu , nature , and nurture of the European races .

		Parallel with the American discovery that
Boston	LOCATION	is a state of mind , they have determined that
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	and the rest are likewise states of mind .

		They have then proceeded to indi - cate how little intercommunicable these states of mind really are .

		M. Finot comes into the camp with a conspicuous chip on his shoulder .

		He main - tains that the differences of races have been much over-rated , and that the doctrine of superior and average and inferior races has little to stand upon .

		He surveys the evidence from craniology and brain structure , from archaeology , and historical achieve - ment , and decides that vicissitudes and opportunity , education and an upward sweep on a rising wave have been the dominant causes of seeming suprem - acy .

		He argues for a scientific equality of mankind and a practical disappearance of race prejudice .

		It is important to have this side of the question well advanced and to realize that much of the evidence -- notably the anthropological -- has been prejudi - cially gathered ; yet the net impression of the vol - ume is that of an able but somewhat too zealous special pleading for a cause that certainly makes a philanthropic appeal .

		It is to be expected that
M. Finot	PERSON	's most difficult '' case '' is that of the negro in
America	LOCATION	; his treatment of this incident distinctly lacks the seal of proof .

		The latest recipe for success .

		Manuals teaching the art of success will find readers as long as there are so many persons doomed to failure in the struggle for supremacy , and even for bare existence ; and since this struggle is daily becoming sharper , such books ought to be more and more in demand .

		The latest of the series is Dr.
Emil Reich	PERSON	's '' Success in Life '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- , a sort of com - panion volume to the same author 's '' Success among Nations . ''

		A carefully excogitated list of the con - stants and variables of success gives the treatise somewhat the same illusive appearance of mathemati - cal infallibility as marks the philosophical writings of
Descartes	LOCATION	and
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet in spite of this ill - advised plan of constructing a mathematical frame - work on which to fashion a body of doctrine dealing with the most unmathematical of subjects , the book is so fresh , so unconventional , so ingenious , and so suggestive , that its weaknesses and imperfections do not need to plead very hard for forgiveness .

		As a foreigner -LRB- a Hungarian -RRB- in
England	LOCATION	, the author writes understandingly and admirably on the advan - tages of the quick-witted alien 's position , though unfortunately not all immigi-ants are so brilliantly versatile as Dr.
Reich	PERSON	.

		None the less forceful for that , however , is his exhortation to get out of the ruts , to distrust convention , to seek an opening that not all the world is striving to crowd into , if we would succeed .

		Toward the end of the volume , especially in the chajjf.ers on special vocations , there is an apparent assumption of omniscience that repels , as does also , thi-oughout , a tendency to exaggerate and to make sweeping assertions .

		For instance , in treat - ing of success as a physician , the writer -LRB- whose doctorate , we believe , is not in medicine -RRB- inciden - tally remarks : '' It is no exaggeration to say that there is scarcely an American who does not carry from one to six different sorts of patent pills con - stantly in his pockets . ''

		In general , it is of course a material and tangible and speedy success that our pushful author-lecturer holds up to admiration , rather than that unrecognized and unapplauded and late-won spiritual victory which alone really mat - ters .

		In point of style Dr.
Reich	PERSON	might advantage - ously practice some of the English mutisme which he holds in so slight esteem .

		He has the readiness , not to say looseness , of the fluent talker and lecturer , but little of the exactness , the terseness , the fine re - serve of the scholarly and painstaking writer .

		In the preface to his volume on ' ' European Enam els '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Mr.
Henry H. Cunynghame	PERSON	,
C. B.	PERSON	, adroitly essays to disarm criticism of his very im - perfect book by advancing as an excuse for its shortcomings that '' so few regular treatises have been written '' on the subject .

		But this seems no reason at all ; for the untilled field gave Mr.
Cun	PERSON	- ynghame the rare opportunity to sink his plough deep into the virgin soil and turn up rich furrows of new material that should produce an abundant yield of interest and of value .

		Of course if he desired merely to compile a book from ready-made sources , he may not have foimd the material easy at his hand , -- although we know of several works , treating wholly or in part of enamels , that he has evidently made no use of .

		The result is a book that will not stand the test of criticism ; and therefore , accepting the author 's cry of peccavi , we will say in a few words what he has done without comment The art of enamelling in
Europe	LOCATION	.


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 231 upon how he has done it .

		In the introduction he tells what enamels are , their different kinds and methods , the colors that are used and how they are used , and much technical information of which he has knowledge from some practice in an amateurish way .

		He then gives a slight survey of the art in ancient times , of Gaulish enamelling in
Europe	LOCATION	after the Christian era , of the remarkable Byzantium enamels , of the mediaeval work of the Carlovingian period and up to the fourteenth century , of basse - taille or bas-relief enamels , of painted enamels which , having their origin in the fourteenth century and brought to great perfection in the two following centuries , are the most beautiful , the most artistic , and the most interesting of all enamels , and worthy of a special volume devoted alone to their history and art .

		Then with some pages on snuff-boxes , Battersea enamels , and enamelled jewelry , we reach the closing chapter on modern enamels .

		The vol - ume is illustrated with four color plates and fifty - seven process reproductions , and presents the same attractive appearance of preceding volumes in '' The Connoisseur 's Library . ''

		Mr.
Thomas R. Slicer	PERSON	's little book f .

		aSrr entitled '' The Way to Happiness '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- teaches convincingly that happiness comes through our activities , not through our passivities , and through living to the spirit rather than to the flesh .

		After pointing out that the search for happiness is natural and univer - sal , and that '' it is a law of nature that its unimpeded , undiverted , unsophisticated functions are functions of delight , '' the author briefly reviews the erro - neous or defective schemes of happiness devised by Cynics , Stoics , and Epicureans , and then advances to a consideration of the happiness that comes through altruism , worship , spiritual freedom , obe - dience to the heavenly vision , and , finally , blessed - ness and peace .

		Worry and sin are named as the two disturbing elements to our peace , and as they can not be mended they must be abolished -- a counsel of perfection .

		Mr.
Slicer	PERSON	's well-known fondness for
Browning	PERSON	comes out repeatedly in quotation or reference , and very effectively .

		He ends with the seasonable , the almost ine-vitable , ex - hortation to `` live the wholesome , natural , simple life as far as , in these complicated times , we can '' ; and the natural life , as before remarked , is the joy - fid life , all whose functions are functions of delight .

		The xtory '' ^ thousand years ago arctic explora - of Arctic tion began on a small scale , piratical exploration .

		Norsemen in search of plunder being the distant forerunners of
Peary	PERSON	and
Louis Amadeus	PERSON	, Duke of the
Abruzzi	LOCATION	.

		But practically all our knowl - edge of arctic regions has been gained during the past three centuries , from the days of
Henry Hudson	ORGANIZATION	onward , and especially during the past one hundred years .

		In thirty-three short and readable chapters Mr.
G. Douglas Hoare	PERSON	gives a succinct account of the sufferings and achievements of the heroic men who have braved the terrors of cold , storm , and darkness , which fall to the lot of all who seek to discover the secrets of earth 's most desolate domain .

		The successive expeditions of Sir
John Franklin	PERSON	are detailed with the fulness which their dramatic in - terest justifies , and accounts of the searching parties are given .


Elisha Kent Kane	PERSON	appears to have been the first American to take any prominent part in polar inquiry ; though ostensibly sent out to search for
Franklin	PERSON	, he devoted his efforts to regions where '' there was no possibility of finding traces of the missing explorers . ''

		The voyages of Hall , whilom editor of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	'' Daily Penny Press , '' and his sudden and tragic death are briefly treated .

		Later explorers , such as
Nares	LOCATION	,
Greeley	LOCATION	,
Nordenski	PERSON	- Old , De Long ,
Nansen	LOCATION	,
Peary	PERSON	, and Andr ^ e all re - ceive due attention ; even
Wellman	PERSON	's scheme for an aerial trip is mentioned .

		On the whole the author has given a very satisfactory bird 's - eye view of his subject .

		The book is illustrated with some twenty full-page plates , and closes with a fine large folding map which shows at a glance the very respectable amount of geographical knowledge that has been won in the Arctic circle .

		There is , however , a tract of two million square miles about the pole which is stiU a mystery .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The first lecture on the
Leslie Stephen Foundation	PERSON	was given at
Cambridge	LOCATION	on
Washington	LOCATION	's birthday of this year .

		The lecturer was Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, who appropriately took for his subject
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	, also the subject of
Stephen	PERSON	's best biography .

		The lect - ure is now issued by
Henry Frowde	ORGANIZATION	in pamphlet form .

		The new '' Knutsford '' edition of the writings of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	is edited by Dr.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	, who has been assisted by the daughters of the novelist .

		There are eight volumes altogether , of which the following five are now sent us : '' North and South , '' '' My Lady Ludlow , '' ''
Sylvia	PERSON	's Lovers , '' '' Cousin
Phillis	PERSON	, '' and '' Wives and
Daiightei	ORGANIZATION	's . ''

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons are the publishers .

		Mr.
Robert W. Moore	PERSON	's '' German Literature '' has recently been issued in a sixth edition by the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Hamilton	LOCATION	, N. Y .

		The steady demand for this popular manual is shown by the appearance of one edi - tion after another in rapid succession .

		In the present revision the author has taken the opportunity to bring the work up to date by enlarging the final chapters dealmg with the latest work of Sudermann and
Haupt	PERSON	- mann .

		Several fme illustrations have been added .

		Volumes representing the work in draughtsmanship of
Gainsborough	LOCATION	and Leonardo da Vinci have been added to the series entitled `` Drawings of the Great Masters , '' imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		There are upwards of forty reproductions in each volume , printed in various tints , with a number mounted on dark-colored backgrounds .

		Lord
Sutherland Gower	PERSON	contributes a brief introduction to the Gainsborough volume , while Mr.
C. Lewis Hinds	PERSON	writes at more length regarding
Leonardo	ORGANIZATION	's drawings .

		-- Exactly similar in form is '' The Great Etchers '' series , in which has 232 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 1 , just appeared `` The Etchings of
William Strang	PERSON	,
A. R. A.	PERSON	, '' with an introduction by Mr.
Frank Newbolt	PERSON	.

		Though often repulsive in subject , Mr.
Strang	PERSON	's work is always distinguished , and on the whole well worthy of representation in a series devoted to the world 's master etchers .

		Mr.
Tudor Jenks	PERSON	is going on with his series of pop - ular books about the lives and times of the great En - glish writers . ''

		In the Days of Goldsmith '' is the latest addition to the list which already comprises also the names of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and
Scott	PERSON	.

		These books , which made capital reading for young people , are published by
Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' History and Travel '' section of the '' Classified Catalogue of the Carnegie Library of
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	'' should prove a helpful adjunct to the resources of the library , on account of the annotation which is its char - acteristic feature .

		By this same token , students of history everywhere will find it useful for guidance in he selection of their reading .

		Librarianship is perform - ing its highest function when engaged in the preparation of catalogues of this type .

		Theodore
Beza	PERSON	's ''
Abraham Sacriiiant	PERSON	, '' done into English as '' A Tragedie of Abraham 's Sacrifice '' by
Arthur Golding	PERSON	, and edited by Dr.
Malcom W. Wallace	PERSON	, is a handsome publication of
the University of Toronto Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The original -LRB- here reprinted in an appendix -RRB- dates from
1552	DATE	, and the translation from
1575	DATE	.

		The editorial introduction and notes are very elaborate , and the publication is highly creditable to the scholarship of the university whence it issues .

		To their excellent series known as ''
Newnes	PERSON	' Art Library ''
Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have recently added volumes dealing with
Delacroix	PERSON	,
Ligres	LOCATION	,
Michael Angelo	PERSON	,
Correggio	LOCATION	, and Burne-Jones .

		Besides a fron - tispiece in photogravure , each volume contains from fifty to sixty large sized half-tone reproductions , a bio - graphical and critical introduction by some writer of authority , and -LRB- in most of the volumes -RRB- a list of works .

		Another series of the same publishers , and published in uniform make-up , is the '' Representative Art of European Galleries , '' to which has just been added two volumes covering the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The two volumes of Mr.
J. H. Balfour Browne	PERSON	's '' Essays Critical and Political , '' published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have now a somewhat old - fashioned flavor , since the papers bear dates in the seventies and eighties .

		The single exception to this statement is '' The Coming Revolution , '' written only last year .

		Among the subjects discussed in the '' Criti - cal '' volume are
Michael Angelo	PERSON	and
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	and
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Macready	PERSON	, and
Henry Fawcett	PERSON	.

		The '' Political '' vol - ume is too far outdated to have any particular value in
this twentieth century	DATE	.

		Mr.
Arthur Gray Butler	PERSON	, an English minor poet of dis - tinction and considerable achievement , wrote '' Harold : A Drama m Four Acts '' over thirty years ago .

		It was based , like
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Harold '' of the same decade , upon
Bulwer	PERSON	's novel , but was withheld from publica - tion until
1892	DATE	.

		It now appears in a second edition , a , publication of Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		It has been largely remodelled , and this with special reference to a possible stage performance , which we trust it may secure , for its diction is fairly level with the height of its noble theme , and that theme is one of the most dramatic that English history offers to the stage .

		Notes .

		Hawthorne 's immortal '' Tanglewood Tales , '' edited by Mr.
Robert H. Beggs	PERSON	, are now published as a '' Pocket Classic '' by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Much Adoe about Nothing '' is the latest volume in the '' First Folio ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, edited by the Misses
Porter	PERSON	and
Clarke	PERSON	, and published by the Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	.

		Messrs.

A. C. Benson	PERSON	is at its height , with a new edition of the '' Memoirs of
Arthur Hamil	PERSON	- ton ,
B. A.	PERSON	, '' his first book , now twenty years old . ''

		An Introduction to the Study of

		To the '' Country Life Education Series '' of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	there has been added a volume on '' Types and Breeds of Farm Animals , '' by Professor

		The Interpretation of Scripture and Other Essays , '' by
Benjamin Jowett	PERSON	, is a volume of the ''

		The papers reprinted date back to the `` Essays and Reviews '' period .


Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's essay on

		A small volume of '' Essays on English Studies , '' by the late
Henry Norman Hudson	PERSON	, is edited by Dr.
A. J. George	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The essays are mostly upon Shakespearean subjects -LRB- as

		The ever-increasing interest in
St. Francis of Assisi	LOCATION	and his followers makes pertinent the announcement of
Messrs Tennant	PERSON	and Ward of
New York	LOCATION	that they will publish early this month `` A Short Introduction to Franciscan Literature , '' prepared by Fr .

		Paschal
Rob	PERSON	- inson , O. F. M .

		The aim of the work is to provide a brief outline of the early sources of Franciscan history , which so often perplex the general reader , and the principal works relatmg to the Poverello written since the
thirteenth century	DATE	, as well as the enormous literary output of the Franciscan movement of the last few years .

		We are glad to say a good word for the Con - cordance Society , which was organized last
December	DATE	at the meeting of the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its officers are Messrs.
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	,
Charles G. Osgood	PERSON	, Jr. ,
Curtis H. Page	PERSON	, and
Charles W. Hodell	PERSON	.

		Its purpose is `` to provide subventions toward the publication of such concordances and word-indexes to English writers as shall be considered sufficiently meritorious and necessary , to formulate plans for the compilation of such works , and to assist intending com - pilers of such works with suggestion and advice . ''

		This is a highly praiseworthy imdertaking , for we need a g ^ eat many more concordances than are now available , and their production is so wearisome and thankless a task as to need some special stimulation .

		It is a kind of work that ought to come within the scope of the
Carnegie Institute	ORGANIZATION	, but failing that assistance , the new society is doubtless the next best means of getting it done .

		One hmidred members at an annual subscription of five dollars each are needed for a start ; unless that number is obtained by the first of
May	DATE	, the project will be abandoned .

		Since the printed list already contains more than fifty names , we trust the enterprise will not die '' a-borning . ''

		Professor
C. H. Page	PERSON	,

		The persons treated will be remembered chiefly as soldiers , and as soldiers they are here presented .

		Their principal battles are treated in considerable detail , which makes the book , as a whole , a composite military history from the inter - esting : view-point of the dominant personalities .

		The presentation of tactics is remarkably lucid .

		Anecdotes that indicate personality as effectively as historical performances , are frequent .

		A style at once forceful and charming , a thorough grasp of subject matter , and an enthusiasm for military affairs com - bine to make the biographies clear and spirited .

		Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	celebrated the eighty-fifth anniversary of his birth the other day , and the occasion seems to deserve a word of recognition .

		He is regarded by many as the most distinguished of Americans now living ; and even those who might hesitate to accord him that unique station would hardly deny him a place in the esteem and affection of his fellow - countrymen that few others share .

		The example of his life is one of the things that make all Americans proud of their national birthright .

		The aristocracy to which he belongs is one whose sway we may admit without a murmur , for it is the divinely-appointed aristocracy of intellect and character .

		The poet 's line -- '' Old age hath yet his honor and his toil '' -- is exemplified in both of its aspects by Dr.
Hale	PERSON	, for the advancing years that have heaped new honors upon his head have also found his shoul - ders strong to bear new burdens of enterprise and responsibility .

		How the record of that rich and active career puts slothfulness to shame and illustrates the immense value that a single devoted life may have to the community that enjoys its beneficence !

		Other octogenarians we have also , and claim with pride as examples of worthy manhood and womanhood consecrated to high ideals .

		Beside the figure of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	there stands the figure of his fellow-Bostonian ,
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	, only a year his junior , his rival in all good works , still strenuous in the spirit as once in the flesh .

		The arm that lent its strength to the attempted rescue of
Anthony Bums	PERSON	, and that dealt stout blows in the cause of human liberty , now wields no heavier weapon than the pen , but finds that as effective an implement of warfare as ever .

		The old-time abolitionist , still heeding in the eve of his life the voice obeyed at prime , is now raised as valiantly in behaK of
Philippine	LOCATION	free - dom as it was raised in behalf of negro freedom in the mid-century years .

		Coeval with these two men , Mr.
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	is rounding out an honorable age in the retirement of his
Connecticut	LOCATION	country home .

		His '' Dream Life '' and '' Reveries of a Bache - lor '' were published so long ago that they no longer enjoy the protection that our copyright laws grudgingly bestow ; they are books belong - 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, ing to so remote a past that it seems difficult to realize that their author is yet among the living .

		But they are still widely read and cher - ished , and '' Ik Marvel '' may find in this fact some compensation for the loss of his control over their publication .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the city of his birth , is still the home of Mr.
Henry Charles Lea	PERSON	, whose solid achievement in historical schol - arship is evidenced by many volumes , the list of which is not yet complete , for he is still the indefatigable worker that he has always been .

		And oldest of all our octogenarians , the still lively father of a livelier son , Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	from his home on the Hudson looks abroad with keen vision upon the world of thought and action , and recalls his long career of useful ser - vice .

		At least two women must be added to this list , Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	is close to the nineties , but her philanthropic zeal is unchilled with the years , and the spirit that found expres - sion in '' The Battle Hymn of the Republic '' is still strong to champion the right .

		And Mrs.
Julia Dorr	PERSON	, transplanted in childhood from the South to the North , still lends the grace of her life to her home in the hiUs of
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		One other name we must put upon our list , for , although English by birth and Canadian by residence , Mr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	has come into such intimate relations with our national life during the past forty years that we may fairly claim a large interest in his distinguished career .

		The sage of the
Toronto	LOCATION	'' Grange '' is now in his eighty-fourth year .

		He is old enough to have been a fellow-fighter with Bright and
Cobden	PERSON	in the battle for free-trade , and to have been
one of the first of the Saturday	DATE	Reviewers .

		He even has boyish memories of the jubilation over the passage of the Reform BiU .

		His thought has concerned itself with nearly every subject that seriously concerns mankind , and the broad sanity of his ideas has upon many critical occasions helped our judgment to keep its balance true .

		He is one of the wisest of men , and one of the few Englishmen who have understood the deep idealism that lies at the foundation of our national existence .

		We have named eight octogenarians out of the four hundred or thereabouts whose bio - graphies might be discovered by a diligent ex - amination of '' Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		These eight have been chosen because their reputation rests primarily upon intellectual distinction as illustrated by their published works .

		It seems to us a remarkable showing , on the whole , and it is doubtfid if it could be paralleled in En - gland or elsewhere .

		Furthermore , when we | consider the number of our great writers of the past who lived to be octogenarians --
Bancroft	LOCATION	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	-- the American exhibit of longevity in the ranks of authorship becomes even more striking , and more difficult of matching in the annals of other countries .

		We are proud of these men , and are profuse in the bestowal of lip-service upon them ; but we ask whether our pride in their possession would find adequate expression in case of need .

		Those whom we have named are in comfortable circumstances , as far as we know , so placed by their own efforts ; but we can not help wondering whether , if any of them were in actual want , we should find practical ways of making them feel our gratitude as a people for their useful and distinguished lives .

		Genius starving in the garret , and honorable achieve - ment destitute in old age , have been exemplified by many grievous past instances ; is such neg - lect any less liable to be laid at our doors than at those of other people in other times ?

		This is a searching question , and we do not feel alto - gether comfortable about the answer it would get if our people were put to the test .

		It seems to be one of our national failings that we are inclined to push the old impatiently aside in most of the walks of life , and to bestow upon eager and impetuous youth many honors that should be reserved for men of maturer years .

		We do this in the name of efficiency ; but it is a practice that tends to dull the fine edge of justice and make dim the lustre of its shield .

		THE VICTORIAN LITERATURE .

		A rush of Maenads across the scene ; Furies darting here and there with fiery torches and hissing tresses ; Bacchanals dancing tipsily in , escorting a hero 's catafalque ; in front , orgies over a grave ; in the background the blaze of battle sunsets and the wreaths of snow-clad heights : -- by some such pic - ture as this one might image forth the Georgian times in
England	LOCATION	.

		Then
England	LOCATION	was at the storm centre of the world .

		In the French Revolution , the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, the Napoleonic wars , it was either protagonist or antagonist .

		And its literature was coincident and coequal with its deeds , which is more than could be said of
France	LOCATION	at that time .


Burns	PERSON	preached the revolt of the natural man and the poli - tical man .

		Burke grappled single-handed with the French Revolution .

		Byron laimched himself on a lonely crusade against the powers of reaction .

		Scott created a nation and revealed the past of Em ` ope .


Wordsworth	PERSON	, like a Druid seer , stood upon his rocky heights and laid his commands on Nature itself .

		Coleridge unlocked the door where the Supernatural was sealed away .

		Shelley sang the strains of an
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 impossible perfection , and
Keats	PERSON	bodied forth the last charm of sensuous life .

		All was daring , ori - ginal , vivid , and alive .

		This age in
England	LOCATION	seems to me on the whole the greatest literary epoch of the last two hundred and fifty years .

		No other recent period has lifted so blazing a torch or shook its sparks so far abroad to kindle conflagrations in distant lands .

		Goethe and his compeers did work quite as solid and enduring , but , as they realized themselves , something of natural power , of daemonic inspiration , was wanting to them .

		Man for man , the Frenchmen of
1830	DATE	were inferior to their En - glish predecessors .

		Turn now to the succeeding age in
England	LOCATION	.

		If we shut our eyes and try to conjure up a generalized picture of it , the scene would be something like this : A gentle valley bedded deep with the green of trees and grass .

		On one side , a village with houses of old-time charm from which look forth or emerge girls of graceful loveliness and tranquil mien .

		In the middle , a field where lithe young athletes con - tend in various games .

		Toward the rear , an inn the very air about which is redolent of good cheer .

		And in the background manor-houses and mansions , each one looking down upon the world from its own seclusion .

		All is peace and rest and content .

		It would be an error , of course , to say that during
Victoria	PERSON	's long reign '' No drum with beaten sound Was heard the whole world round , '' but in comparison with most ages in the history of the world , it was a time of calm , of prosperity , of ma - terial development .

		And its literature was like unto it .

		It was a literature of the idyllic and the lyric in poetry , of humor and light comedy in the novel .

		The predominant note of the Victorian literature is , I think , its virginal purity .

		Never before , except in the Greek poets and in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, was the young girl drawn with such tender respect and ad - miration .

		And , without exception , she was never before so permitted to stamp herself upon a litera - ture , and stamp out all that might offend her in - stincts or interest .

		By the side of
Homer	ORGANIZATION	's chival - rous portraits of women and girls there is Hesiod with his rather low judgment of the lovelier sex .

		By the side of Sophocles and Euripides , with their lofty heroines , is Aristophanes with his utter irre - verence and world-upsetting indecency .

		And in
Chaucer	LOCATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, women of the coarsest and basest type jostle their fair and fragrant sisters .

		But the Victorian poets and novelists are the slaves of the young girl and the virtuous matron .

		They draw their chariots .

		Tennyson 's poetry is a gallery of fair women ; they dominate his books almost to the exclusion of any male interest .

		Coven - try
Patmore	PERSON	instituted a new religion of the Vu-gin .

		In
Browning	PERSON	, man is merely the attendant planet which revolves around a female sun .

		It is the same with the novelists .

		They treat their heroines with adoring worship , as something more than human .

		When
Thackeray	PERSON	wished to draw the picture of a thoroughly bad woman , he hardly dared to hint that in some matters she was not quite all she ought to be .

		This chivalry , characteristic of the Celtic tempera - ment , is not characteristic of the
Saxon	PERSON	mind .

		There is a vast region of English literature , extending from
Dryden	PERSON	and
Wycherley	PERSON	down through Field - ing and
Smollett	PERSON	and
Sterne	PERSON	, where it is not in evi - dence at all .

		Perhaps the comparative peacefulness of the Victorian age is the reason why the feminine influence became so powerful .

		Not only laws , but women , are silent amid the clash of arms .

		A second feature of the Victorian literature is its domesticity -- its concern for the narrow things of the household .

		It is the literature of the home ; and the home may be either a shrine or a prison .

		It makes for goodness , but it does not make for free - dom .

		There is a spirit of adventure , a carelessness of consequence , in all older literatures , which is largely wanting in the books of this age .

		Generally in the plays and poems and novels of the past , the mere fact of getting a living , the mere furniture and surroundings of life , are taken for granted , relegated to the background , or treated as a joke .

		But money , property , position , -- these are the serious things to the Victorian writers .

		The reward of virtue with them is a coach-and-four , a country house with pleasant grounds , the being on calling terms with the best families .

		It was not for nothing that the '' Book of Snobs '' was written in this age .

		Nearly everyone , from
Tennyson	LOCATION	down , was tainted with the worship of caste .

		Perhaps it came out most strongly in
Bulwer	LOCATION	, aman of genius to whom bad taste clung like a Nessus shirt .

		Carlyle blew the trumpet of revolt against this worship , and one can measure the work he had to do by the effort he had to make .

		The understanding of the power of money and the comforts of home is the beginning of realism .

		Idealism is possible to a poet who , like
Horace	PERSON	, could go singing through a wood filled with robbers ; it is possible to a hermit like
Wordsworth	PERSON	or
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		But a writer who likes to have everything comfort - able about him must unconsciously picture man as he is , not man as he ought to be .

		He must fail of sympathy with the great ideas , the great ambitions , the heroic actions of life .

		Notwithstanding its snobbery , the Victorian age saw , if not the beginning , an immense development of sympathy for the poor and lowly .

		The short and simple annals of the poor were found capable of infinite illustration .

		Low-life has always been the haunt of humor ; but
Dickens	PERSON	discovered that the poor have not only more fun among them , but more freedom and happiness than their superiors .

		Joy is the thing that makes literature permanent -- not the vulgar joy which can only see happiness in pink - and-white colors , in a succession of sugar-plums , in the negation of pain , but the joy which springs from keen and lofty effort , whether foredoomed to failure or success .


Dick Swiveller	PERSON	barricading himself round by a circle of unpaid scores for '' the rosy , ''
Micawber	PERSON	strenuously waiting for something to turn up , doubt - less felt , when either of them did raise the wind by 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, some lucky expedient , the same exalted joy that filled the stadium runner of
Greece	LOCATION	when he touched the post ; and they communicate this joy to us .

		It is by reason of his discovery of the immense re - sources of happiness among the poor that
Dickens	PERSON	's work is the great literary creation of the age .

		Squalid and gloomy and horrible , you say his pic - tures are .

		Yes ; but out of this squalor and gloom and horror
spring	DATE	the most beautiful flowers of life -- self-sacrifice , heroism , patient kindness , and sparkling wit .

		The relations of tragedy to joy in literature are universally mistaken .

		We sympathize with the effort rather than with the end .

		Who would not accept AchiUes ' early death , if he could deck himself in the splendor of that hero ?

		Who would not go through Hamlet 's troubles , if he could do it with the kingly mien , the intellectual domi - nance of the Dane ?

		We do not love death or pain or poverty , but we love the great spirits which can react against these dark , hard things , and strike out light for the centuries .

		Mild religious doubt was a great preoccupation of the Victorian writers .

		The day of defiance was past .

		Byron and
Shelley	PERSON	had been Titans hurling mountains at Zeus ; but
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Brown	PERSON	- ing ,
Newman	PERSON	, were simply disillusioned clergymen , timidly picking flaws in the plan of the universe , or falling back upon faith and authority .

		England had to go to a not very distinguished Persian poet of the past to get its most thorough-going statement of the eternal problems .

		The Scientific spirit , and the rise of the Evolu - tionary theory , which last had its home in
England	LOCATION	, have been accused of or praised for great influence on modern literature and life .

		But it seems to me that their power has been vastly overrated .

		The general conceptions of the creed of Evolution , which are all the world takes note of , are at least as old as Greek philosophy , and there have been no great doings from them in the past .

		At the most , they can but alter the special forms of religious belief .

		They can not shake the basis of faith .

		Men will go on believing in God , and the immortality of the soul , and redemption for sin , in the future as they always have in the past .

		If the old theologies fail to satisfy , they will frame new ones .

		There remains to be said something about the technical qualities of the Victorian literatm-e .

		In style -- which , in its limited sense , I take to mean concentration , vividness and freshness of speech -- the age must stand or fall with its leader ,
Tenny	PERSON	- son .

		Now it seems to me that in most of the great excellences of style , he is inferior not only to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	but to Gray and
Collins	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	.

		His best work brought into juxtaposition with theirs already shows a little faded .

		It has not the final simplicity , the jewel-like sparkle , the lasting memorable weight , of theirs .

		In prose , it may be said at once that the age had no original technical gift .

		All the weapons of English prose were forged long before and used with more effect .

		In simple prose it did not beat Swift or
Defoe	LOCATION	; in eloquent prose it did not reach the heights of
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	, or
Burke	PERSON	; and in perfect prose it has nothing which can compare with that of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, Congi-eve , or
Goldsmith	PERSON	.

		One technical quality , however , the age did revive , resuscitate , and carry to great triumphs .

		This is the almost invaluable quality of tone , by which a piece of literature is projected forth all of one piece , with its own special atmosphere and light .

		The supreme examples of this excellence in art are the best plays of Shakespeare . ''

		Macbeth '' and ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' `` Cymbeline , '' `` Twelfth Night , '' `` A Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' `` As You Like It , '' `` The Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' were thrown out by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's creating mind , each flawless in its unity of color , like the red and blue and green and mauve and yellow stars which dance in the tangles of the
Pleiades	LOCATION	.

		After Shakespeare this virtue in literature fell into abeyance -- for
Milton	PERSON	's elevation and majesty are quite different things .

		The wits and novel-writers who succeeded thought that all that went to the making of a book was a vast amount of human inci - dent and a great bundle of brilliant sayings .

		In Gray 's '' Elegy '' the thing was born again ; and in the best pieces of
Collins	PERSON	-- the '' Ode to Evening '' and the '' Highland Ode '' -- it attained a high perfec - tion .

		Four or five poems by
Coleridge	PERSON	and as many by
Keats	PERSON	show the virtue to the full .

		And by a special miracle ,
Scott	PERSON	in one story , '' The Bride of Lammermoor , '' attains a truth of tone which makes that novel rank above all his others .

		Now the gift of tone was habitual with
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		Not only in his shorter and eai ` lier pieces -- like '' The Dying Swan , '' `` The Two Sisters , '' '' Mariana '' -- but in his more ambitious works -- ''
Maud	PERSON	, '' '' The Princess , '' '' The Idylls '' -- is this excellence innate and of im - perative appeal .

		Tone was , if not
Rossetti	PERSON	's sole stock in trade , at least his most valuable asset .

		It is implicit , though not overwhelmingly apparent , in
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		James
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's '' City of Dreadful Night '' is a remarkable example of it .

		The novel writers , too , possess the gift .

		Three such varying tales as ''
Barnaby Rudge	PERSON	, '' ''
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	, '' and '' Armadale '' are fulfilled with it almost in extreme measure .

		And in a different kind , '' Pick - wick , '' ''
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' and ''
Silas Marner	PERSON	'' are perfect in atmosphere .

		The cultivation of tone is , I should say , the most valuable technical achievement of modern English literature .

		On the whole , however , the Victorian literature is deficient in greatness , originality , daring , soul .

		For strife it substituted comfort , for splendor it substituted charm , for fierce satire or soul-shattering tragedy it substituted gentle irony and light humor .

		There are to-day , and there always will be , innu - merable readers to whom these secondary qualities appeal most .

		But every age can supply them for itself .

		I am inclined to think that future genera - tions wiU prefer to light their torches at the battle - beacons of the Georgian epoch rather than at the modest hearth-fires of the Victorian age .

Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL 245 CASUAL COMMENT .

		The aberrations of contemporary judgments are a continual source of amusement and amazement to posterity .

		In one of
Christopher North	ORGANIZATION	's longest essays -LRB- it is almost a treatise -RRB- , he passes in review all the chief writers of his time --
Scott	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and the others -- and decides that no one of them was a great poet , but that the two who came nearest to making good their claim to that title were
Robert Southey	PERSON	and
Joanna Baillie	PERSON	!

		Mat - thew
Arnold	LOCATION	has a passage in one of his letters which throws a curious light on this subject .

		He attended a great literary banquet in
London	LOCATION	, and foimd himself seated at one of the lower tables until
George Augustus Sala	PERSON	and
Edmund Yates	PERSON	saw him and escorted him to the higher board where they had places by right .

		In the recently published life of Charles Lever there is an instance of the unexpected modesty of genius in assess - ing its own value .

		A chapter is devoted to the cor - respondence of Lever with
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	, wherein the creator of
Mickey Free	ORGANIZATION	and
Corny Delaney	PERSON	and Major Monsoon is shown as almost grovelling in abase - ment at the feet of the admirable though rather mediocre author of '' Castle Rackrent . ''

		The worship which both
Scott	PERSON	and Lever paid to
Miss Edgeworth	LOCATION	is a strik - ing testimony to the power of even execution and aca - demic correctness .

		Lever not only repented at her shrine the great sins of his youth ,
Harry Lorrequer	PERSON	,
Jack Hinton	PERSON	, and
Charles O'Malley	PERSON	, but he turned to imitation of her in a long series of dull books .

		It is his sins of fiction that the world will remember .

		Surely , ''
Charles O'Malley	PERSON	'' is the best war-novel ever writ - ten ,
Tolstoi	PERSON	's '' War and Peace '' and the tales of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	to the contrary notwithstanding .

		In reading
Tolstoi	PERSON	's vast works , one wonders why men should ever go out to fight , for he makes warfare the dullest , dreariest business human beings can engage in .

		In Lever , on the other hand , there is all the fun and frolic and ad - venture which lures men to action , -- and there is , too , much of the high magnanimities and deep loyalties of the heroic life .

		Lever 's rollicking revelry has been objected to as being out .

		of keeping with the serious business of war .

		But everyone who has been for a long time under circumstances of great stress and danger will at once recognize as true the overwrought exulta - tion which faces death with a flow of nonsense , or gay defiance , or even blasphemy .

		This feeling has been crystallized into that memorable short poem , '' Revelry in
India	LOCATION	'' ; and Lever gives it most successfully .

		• • • Our much-decried `` American-English '' has a good word -LRB- of a certain sort -RRB- spoken for it by an emi - nent English scholar and writer .

		Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, in addressing a British society lately established `` to help to maintain the correct use of English , and to promote the due recognition of English as an essential element in national education , '' adduced the significant fact that
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	has twenty teachers of English , while
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	has but one ; and this disparity he regarded as fairly representing the different degrees of import - ance attached to English language and literature studies in the two countries .

		We mean well , it would seem , even if we are young and ignorant .

		Some such sooth - ing balm as this was needed after the '' dressing down '' we speakers of the
United States	LOCATION	dialect -LRB- especially the female portion of us -RRB- have received , whether deservedly or not , at the hands of another Englishman -LRB- by adop - tion -RRB- , who , after long exile -LRB- self-imposed -RRB- , returns to his mother country and indulges in comments , not always complimentary , on her habits and peculiarities .

		• • • A LIBRARIAN WHO IS ALSO A HUMAN BEING is what Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	, public librarian -LRB- among other things -RRB- at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, has been not inappropriately called .

		Bibliothecal duties imquestionably tend to mum - mify the body and pedantify the mind ; but here we have a guardian of printed wisdom who is alert and brimming over with new ideas , and most undeniably alive .

		Under his more than up-to-date administration the
Los Angeles	LOCATION	library , as the librarian 's second ammal report announces , has moved into a new building , and has opened a roof - garden to its patrons as an alfresco reading-room .

		-LRB- Happy the reading public in that balmy clime ! -RRB-

		Smokers are welcome .

		Onlyindecent books are blacklisted .

		Mr.
Lum	PERSON	- mis holds that what the tax-payer asks for , within reason - able limits , he should have ; and if he feels a craving that nothing but '' The Cameron Pride '' or ''
Dick Onslow	PERSON	among the Redskins , '' with cigarette accompaniment , will satisfy , he should not be turned away with a chill - ing offer of ''
Paley	PERSON	's Evidences '' instead .

		This invites discussion , which , however , is not in place here .

		• ■ • The AVOCATIONS of great men are even more in - teresting , because more intimately characteristic , than their vocations .

		Hence we note , with something more than a passing glance at the announcement , that Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, writer of ingenious and startling stories , has been appointed a justice of the peace for
Folkstone	LOCATION	; also that Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, veteran novelist of assured renown , is and is proud to be a justice of the peace for
Dorset	LOCATION	, In fact , Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	takes more satisfaction in this minor office than in being known on two continents as the author of ''
Tess	PERSON	. ''

		All of which might easily remind one of Czar
Peter	PERSON	's passion for shipbuilding , and of the boyish glee with which he carried home to his Czarina his first wages earned by manual labor ; of
King Louis	LOCATION	's bent for clockmaking ; of a certain living emperor 's pride in his own poetry and painting ; and so on , to any length .

		One likes best the work in which voluntary choice has freest play .

		Also , all men are gratified to find how well they can -LRB- or think they can -RRB- do some things with the left hand .

		• • • The literature of the steerage -- that is , the kind of reading matter in request among '' third cabin '' pas - sengers -- has been made the subject of inquiry ; and it appears that whereas first-class and second-class voy - agers on our monster liners demand almost exclusively the very latest novels , with which the ship 's library is forced to stock itself just before the boat 's departure , the humble occupants of quarters near the throbbing vitals of the vessel must be content with standard au - thors , --

		Some Hoped-for
Victories of Peace	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Between those on the one hand who , like
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, believe government to be at best a necessary evil and its legitimate fimctions very narrowly restricted , and those on the other who , with Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	, of
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, maintain that its duties are of the wid - est range , and its possibilities of usefulness not yet suspected by the world at large , there lies a gulf that is deep and wide .

		Without attempt ing here any balancing of arguments on each side , the reviewer is glad to conmiend most heartUy the high moral purpose and the firm grasp of detail that make Miss Addams 's '' Newer Ideals of Peace '' a very valuable addi - tion to Professor
Ely	PERSON	's '' Citizen 's Library , '' which has now reached its twenty-fifth volume .

		Pleas for universal peace have been addressed , as Miss Addams points out in her Introduction , first to the higher imaginative pity ; and most conspicuous among peace-advocates who thus work on our sympathies are
Count Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	in his earlier writings and
Verestchagin	PERSON	in his paintings .

		The second line of appeal is that made to economic prudence ; and here again a Russian protagonist steps to the front in the person of
Jean de Bloch	PERSON	, banker and economist , who convincingly presents the mcreasingly ruin - ous cost of militarism , and shows that its bur - dens threaten to bring about social revolution in every European country .

		Contrasted with these older appeals are those of the third or more aggressive school of peace-promoters , who , without decrying arguments of the first two kinds , hold that there are now developing cer - tain `` newer social forces which it is believed will at last prove a ' sovereign intervention ' by extinguishing the possibility of battle at its very source . ''

		A few sentences from
Miss Addams	LOCATION	's opening pages wiU help to make clear this posi - tion , which is the one she herself holds . ''

		It is difficult to formulate the newer dynamic peace , embodying the later humanism , as over against the old dogmatic peace .

		The word ' non-resistance ' is mis - leading , because it is much too feeble and inadequate .

		It suggests passivity , the goody-goody attitude of in - effectiveness .

		The words ` overcoming , ' ` substituting , ' ' re-creating , ' ' readjusting moral values , ' ' forming new centres of spiritual energy ' carry much more of the meaning implied .

		For it is not merely the desire for a conscience at rest , for a sense of justice no longer out - raged , that would pull us into new paths where there would be no more war nor preparations for war .

		There •
Newer Ideals op Peace	ORGANIZATION	.

Jane Addams	PERSON	.

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are still more strenuous forces at work reaching down to impulses and experiences as primitive and profovmd as are those of struggle itself ... The Advocates of Peace would find the appeal both to Pity and
Pru	ORGANIZATION	- dence totally unnecessary , could they utilize the cosmo - politan interest in human affairs with the resultant social sympathy that at the present moment is develop - ing among all the nations of the earth . ''

		It is in the large cities , with their mixed populations , that this '' cosmopolitan interest '' and broader sympathy are to be cidtivated .

		To this end , experiments in ministering to social needs are to be made and governmental reforms instituted .

		Cities are with good reason '' cen - tres of radicalism , '' as they have in the past been '' cradles of liberty . ''

		It may be , thinks the author , that we shall be saved from mili - tarism by the '' fighting rabble '' itseK , by the quarrelsome mob turned into kindly citizens of the world through the pressure of a cosmopoli - tan neighborhood . ''

		It is not that they are shouting for peace -- on the contrary , if they shout at all they will continue to shout for war -- r but that they are really attaining cosmo - politan relations through daily experience .

		They will probably believe for a long time that war is noble and necessary both to engender and cherish patriotism ; and yet all of the time , below their shouting , they are living in the kingdom of human kindness . ''

		The newer and more aggressive humanitarian - ism makes for social amelioration in the pro- tective legislation that takes account of the weakest citizen as a valuable asset .

		It protests against the social waste involved in child labor , and it also demands that woman 's recognized aptitudes shall be utilized in civic life .

		Even in our city governments Miss Addams finds too much of the spirit of militarism , -- an administration concerning itself grudgingly with the people 's social needs and limiting ite activities chiefly to the enacting and enforcing of restrictive measures .

		The police department , a most conspicuous survival of militarism , re - ceives disproportionate attention .

		That govern - ment support is generously given to education , the author freely admits ; but she criticizes the reluctance of the municipality to take in hand a multitude of other public interests of like importance .

		A chapter is devoted to our failure , through a certain cast-iron inflexibility of law and custom , to make intelligent use of immi - grants in civic affairs -- a difficult problem , surely ; another to our defective industrial leg - islation ; and stiU another to the '' group mor - ality '' exemplified by trades-unions and other organizations and classes , whose several activi - ties are not yet harmonized and xmited for the common good .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 Excellent chapters on '' Protection of Chil - dren for Indiistrial Efficiency , '' '' Women in Government , '' and '' Passing of the War Vir - tues , '' close the book .

		The sad waste of human energy and even human life due to child-labor is forcibly and pathetically illustrated by a case from
Miss Addams	LOCATION	's experience .

		The mother of five children had died ; the father , a drunkard , had disappeared ; a feeble old grandmother re - mained .

		The oldest boy , not yet twelve , was a fine , manly little fellow , who recognized it as his duty to care for the family . ''

		We found him a place as cash-boy in a department store for
two dollars	MONEY	a week .

		He held it for three years , although his enthusiasm failed somewhat as the months went by and he gradually discovered how little help his wages were to the family exchequer after his car-fare , decent clothes and unending pairs of shoes were paid for .

		Before the end of the third year he had become listless and indifferent to his work , in spite of the m - crease of
fifty cents	MONEY	a week .

		In the hope that a change would be good for him , a place as elevator-boy was secured .

		This he was unable to keep ; and then one situation after another slipped through his grasp , until a typhoid fever , which he developed at the age of fifteen , seemed to explain his apathy .

		After a long illness and a poor recovery , he worked less well .

		Finally , at the age of sixteen , when he should have been able really to help the little family and perhaps be its main support , he had become a professional tramp , and eventually dropped completely from our knowledge . ''

		It is needless to say that the author is at her best on the subject of Woman Suffrage ; but without quoting her in that connection , let us choose our final quotation from her closing chap - ter .

		Professor
WUliam James	PERSON	, who is cited in the Introduction , has well urged the need to '' discover something heroic that will speak to men as universally as war has done , and yet wiU be as compatible with their spiritual natures as war has proved to be incompatible , '' Miss
Addams	PERSON	says : '' In a political campaign men will go through every possible hardship iii response to certain political loyal - ties ; in a moment of national danger men will sacrifice every personal advantage .

		It is but necessary to make this fellowship wider , to extend its scope without lower - ing its intensity .

		Those emotions which stir the spirit to deeds of self-surrender and to high enthusiasm , are among the world 's most precious assets .

		That this emotion has so often become associated with war , by no means proves that it can not be used for other ends .

		There is something active and tangible in this new in - ternationalism , although it is difficult to make it clear , and in our striving for a new word with which to ex - press this new and important sentiment we are driven to the rather absurd phrase of ' cosmic patriotism . '

		Whatever it may be called , it may yet be strong enough to move masses of men out of their narrow national considerations and cautions into new reaches of human effort and affection .

		Religion has long ago taught that only as the individual can establish a sense of imion with a power for righteousness not himself , can he ex - perience peace ; and it may be possible that the nations will be called to a similar experience . ''

		The desired word for
Miss Addams	ORGANIZATION	's world - embracing patriotism might seem to be '' hu - manitarianism , '' except that this term , like a coin long-minted , has become rubbed and worn , and is lacking in sharpness and precision .

		A fresh word is desirable .

		As an immediate and effective solution of the main problem indicated by its title , this treatise may well prove less successful than as a manual of instruction in methods of mutual service and a plea for mutual sympathy and good - will ; but for moral earnestness such as comes only of a life spent in good works , for persuasiveness such as speaks but from actual experience of things seen and heard and participated in , for high - souled nobility of purpose such as can mark no book written with other than a perfectly unsel - fish end in view , it is sure to take a high place in the literature of its kind , and , whatever its proportions of truth and error -- which time alone can tell -- it should accomplish a deal of good in the great work of social amelioration now in progress .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		Two Bishops of the
Western Frontier	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		About the time of the close of the Civil War there was a sparsely settled and little-known region in the heart of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, which was felt to be destined to become the home of a large population at some future time and to be an important part of our American nation .

		It comprised the '' wild and woolly West '' of those days , and was the home of the miner , the cowboy , the adventurer , the fugitive from justice , and the Mormon .

		The
United States	LOCATION	government organized therein the ter - ritories of
Utah	LOCATION	,
Montana	LOCATION	, and
Idaho	LOCATION	, compris - ing respectively about 105,000 , 145,000 , and 90,000 square miles , and having a total popula - tion , not coimting Indians , of 155,000 , or not quite one inhabitant to every two square miles .

		Into this vast region the
Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in
1866	DATE	determined to send a missionary Bishop , and selected for that purpose the Rev.
Daniel Sylvester Tuttle	PERSON	, then rector of a country parish in the central part of
New York	LOCATION	.

		248 THE DIAL -LSB- AprQ 16 , of his election , was but twenty-nine years old , and had to wait until after he had passed another birthday before he was of sufficient age to be made a Bishop ; but his training in his country parish was of a character to fit him for the peculiarly difficult mission upon which he was sent .

		His official title was at first '' Bishop of
Montana	LOCATION	, having jurisdiction also in
Utah	LOCATION	and
Idaho	LOCATION	. ''

		He familiarized himself with every portion of his vast field where any settlements were to be found , and after working therein heroically for fourteen years he prevailed upon the church , in
1880	DATE	, to set
Montana	LOCATION	apart as a separate
Missionary District	ORGANIZATION	and to select a Bishop therefor .

		He thereupon became Bishop of
Utah	LOCATION	with jurisdiction in
Idaho	LOCATION	, and fixed his home in
Salt Lake City	LOCATION	.

		Six years later he responded to a call , which then came to him for the second time , to become the Bishop of the Diocese of
Missouri	LOCATION	, and entered upon the work of the Bishop of a Diocese , to become also , more recently , by virtue of his seniority of con - secration , the Presiding Bishop of the Epis - copal Church in
America	LOCATION	.

		That same year ,
Idaho	LOCATION	was separated from the jurisdiction which had been formerly his and was joined by
Wyo	LOCATION	- ming , and the
Missionary District of Wyoming	ORGANIZATION	and
Idaho	LOCATION	was created .

		Of this , the Rev.
Ethelbert Talbot	PERSON	of
Missouri	LOCATION	was elected Bishop and in due time consecrated .

		He fixed his epis - copal residence in
Laramie	LOCATION	, built a cathedral there , and labored until
1897	DATE	, when he too was called to an
Eastern Diocese	ORGANIZATION	and ceased to be a missionary bishop .

		The experiences of these two men in that re - gion and at that particular period of the history of the several states which have grown up therein could not fail to be of intense interest to the general reader .

		And , fortunately , both have been prevailed upon to write their reminiscences and observations of the time when they were building up the church in a crude civilization .

		The book of the elder bishop has the deeper ecclesiastical interest , though it throws not a few valuable side-lights upon economic conditions , and its chapter on the Mormons shows a states - manlike grasp of the subject .

		The author re - cords his experiences with no word of complaint for the hardships he was called upon to endure , and his book can not fail to be an inspiration to the younger members of the ministry of his church , to whom he gives useful advice upon a variety of topics .

		In one respect the work might have been improved from a literary stand - point .

		Although begun in
1889	DATE	, it was not completed until
1904	DATE	; and before going to press it should have been thoroughly revised and the various chronological view-p6ints adjusted and brought into harmony with the later date .

		Bishop
Talbot	PERSON	writes in a popular literary style , and for the entertainment of the general reader .

		His life as a Missionary Bishop brought him in contact with the class of people whom Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	so well describes .

		Indeed , it is generally conceded that Mr.
Wister	PERSON	refers to Bishop
Talbot	PERSON	in one of his stories .

		The ground had been broken for him and the way smoothed for his missionary labors by his pre - decessors in the same field , so that he was not sub - jected to the same hardships as the elder Bishop , and he foimd leisure for recreation in hunting the big game of .

		that region .

		He also con - tributes a chapter upon the Mormons ; and one upon the Red Man is a valuable contribution to the literature of the subject .

		Both books are valuable in giving pictures , from slightly dif - ferent view-points , of life and conditions which are now rapidly disappearing from our land .

		THE DIAL .

		249 He is very much in earnest in his resolve that the layman shall not be '' bluffed '' by the ex cathedra pronouncement '' Sclentia locuta est. '' The higher Homeric criticism is not a science at all , he protests , but a mere jungle of false logic , a ^ morass inhabited by will o ' the wisps of wanton hypothesis and conjecture .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is be - trayed into some slips and exaggerations by the vivacity of his polemic , and his own positive con - clusions are in their turn open to cavil .

		But his main negative contention is sound .

		The new books of Homeric criticism make a formidable showing of archasological , linguistic , and ethno - logical erudition .

		But as arguments they are mere sophistical exercitations .

		We have not gained one inch on the position defined by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	: '' These are questions which have been debated with learning , with ingenuity , nay , with genius , -- but there really exist no data for determining them . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's polemic , despite '' much repetition and some wearisome details , holds the attention by a wealth of pertinent illustration from
Norse	ORGANIZATION	and Old French literature , and by the force and cunning of his dialectical sword-play .

		The disintegrationists collect examples of apparent diversities or inconsistencies in different parts of Homer in regard to language , ideas religious or ethical , burial and marriage customs , land tenure , weapons and warfare , the structure of the house , the knowledge and use of metals .

		These are mechanically combined in theories of the secular evolution of the various '' strata '' of the Iliad and Odyssey .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is not con - tent with showing up in detail the trivial and Inconclusive character of many of the alleged tests of earlier and later work .

		He is not sat - isfied with the effective but easy retort that the critics contradict one another far more than do the various Homers whom they postulate .

		He forces us to realize at every step the full con - crete historical implications of the theory that the Iliad and Odyssey are a late patchwork of poems , composed , interpolated , and altered through three or four centuries of changing civilization and language .

		The Iliad possesses artistic and historical unity enough for the unanalytical reader .

		If it is a slow organic growth , or a compilation of the work of a school , why has no other epic ever been produced in the same way ?

		The Kalevala is not an epic , though
Lonnrot	PERSON	, dealing freely with his materials , tried to make it one .

		Neither is the
Edda	LOCATION	.

		The chansons de geste were not pieced together out of lays , but freely composed .

		Even the relative success of the Niehelungen Lied required an individual author .

		If the apparent unity of archaic color in the
Iliad	LOCATION	was maintained by the conscious conventions of a poetical guild , why have no other poems before the nineteenth century archaized in this fashion -- not
Beowulf	LOCATION	with its allusions to Christianity , not the authors of the mediaeval French epics who attribute to tenth century knights the armorial bearings of a later age , not even the learned
Virgil	PERSON	, or ApoUonius of
Rhodes	LOCATION	, or
Quintus	ORGANIZATION	of
Smyrna	LOCATION	.

		If the irresponsible Ionian rhapsodists who composed the songs that grew into the Iliad consciously avoided reference to writing , coined money , seal rings , and in general to ideas , institutions , and geographical names later than the original kernel of the poem , why did the more literary cyclic poets , their contem - poraries by the hypothesis , introduce so many un-Homeric touches ?

		If we reject as interpo - lations ail passages that do not fit our theories , and assmne that some of the interpolators care - f vdly archaized while others followed the customs of their own day , may we not deduce any con - clusions from any text ?

		By what study of con - stitutional history were late Ionian strolling bards enabled to preserve throughout the Iliad the consistent picture of feudal institutions ex - hibited * in the relations of the Overlord Aga - memnon to his liegemen ?

		Why should they freely interpolate the corslet , but rarely the Ionian round shield , its natural accompaniment ?

		Or why should not the Homeric man , like the Algonquin Indian , have used both the corslet and the big oblong shield which in the opinion of the German professor rendered it superfluous ?

		Why should Homer , though familiar with iron , rarely if ever speak of iron weapons , if not for the reason that iron was not yet sufficiently well tempered to be used in war ?

		How much do we really know about early Greek land-tenure , and what probability is there that the great chieftains of the Iliad cultivated no larger domain than the lot which fell to a Thersites ?

		How could the author of the '' late '' tenth book of the Iliad describe a type of Mycenaean cap revealed to us by recent excavations ?

		Had he studied it in an archaeological museum ?

		Why should we expect all Homeric houses to conform to one type , and why should the daughters of princes not sleep in an upper chamber in the
Iliad	LOCATION	as well as in the Odyssey ?

		Such are some of the questions propounded by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	.

		And as he can obtain no satis - factory answer , he concludes that the Homeric poems are a consistent picture of a single age of Greek civilization , the sub-Mycenaean , which 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, falls somewhere between the shaft graves of
Mycenae	LOCATION	-LRB- 1500-1100 -RRB- and the time represented by the Dipylon tombs at
Athens	LOCATION	-LRB- 900-750 -RRB- .

		The probability of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's conclusion is not seriously affected by the inadvertencies and omissions which closer scrutiny would bring out .

		He deals timidly with the linguistic argu - ment , admitting regretfully or ironically that he is no grammarian .

		But though it is a curious and interesting fact that `` later '' forms are of more frequent occurrence in certain books of the
Iliad	LOCATION	, cautious reasoners are coming more and more to admit that the evidence is too slight to support any definite conclusion .

		We are forced back on the formula of the ancients , '' Homer '' employed a mixed composite dialect .

		Again , that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	seems to have studied only
Reichel	PERSON	on Homeric weapons , and but for a few casual references , almost ignores the ela - borate hypotheses of
Robert	LOCATION	, might be groimd of cavil for a partisan of the latter .

		But no student of Homer is under any real obligation to disentangle the cobweb of ingenious sophistry that
Robert	PERSON	has spun about the subject .

		And similarly of the much - vexed racial problem .

		We do not know whether the Achaeans of Homer were Mycenaeans , Pelasgians -LRB- whatever that may mean -RRB- , or Celtic invaders from the north ; nor does the question affect the unity of the Iliad .

		The real strength of the disintegrationist position is the cumulative impression -LRB- I do not say the cumulative logical force -RRB- of arguments singly mitenable .

		Where there is so much smoke , we think there must be some fife . ''

		Tantus labor non sit cassus , ^ ^ we exclaim .

		But every age has its own forms of scholasticism .

		The argument from the apparent consensus of the learned is naught .

		It is temporary and will change with the next new fashion .

		Homeric scholars read one another 's books , and a few leaders set the fashion for any decade . ''

		Fore God , they are all in one tale , '' the puzzled lay - man cries .

		The modem state contains three times the area and over five times the population of its prototype in
1567	DATE	.

		Besides administering ably a vast colonial empire , it is one of the most thriving and prosperous of the smaller states of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		For two centuries it was the leader of civilization and the foremost exponent of progressive ideas in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Then it suf - fered a long decline before its rejuvenation in the nineteenth century .

		Mr.
Barker	PERSON	, the author of '' The Decline and Fall of the Netherlands , '' does not seem to know much about the modem renaissance of that country .

		In the articles he has written for European reviews during the past year or two , he presages the absorption of the land of dykes into mighty
Germany	LOCATION	, although his arguments seem more ingenious than convincing .

		In his book , he concludes his historical survey with the fall of the republic and of the
Frenchified Kingdom of HoUand	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although his work is sur - charged with ideas and notions that are meant to illustrate '' the economic interpretation of history , '' he ignores the fact that while even as late as the nineteenth century
England	LOCATION	had coal and iron in plenty to meet the necessities of civilization ,
Holland	LOCATION	, being utterly without these resources , has not been able to compete with her island neighbor ; and in earlier times , also ,
Great Britain	LOCATION	had vastly greater internal sup - plies .

		Mr.
Barker	PERSON	shows lack of acquaintance also with authorities that might have helped him to sounder conclusions , -- as , for example , the more recent critical historical writings of the
Leyden	PERSON	and Utrecht schools .

		The philosophy of decline and decay may be as valuable as that of adolescence and growth .

		In any event it is certain that the author has contributed a work of singular value to all those who would have the study of history made as fruitfid and practical as possible .

		He has , we think , hurt rather than helped his lively book by overloading it with quotations from the classic authors , such as
Aristotle	LOCATION	,
Thucydides	LOCATION	,
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, and others who have already served long enough for copy-book inscriptions .

		It is refreshing , however , to find him quoting also
John Pym	PERSON	and

Motley	ORGANIZATION	and
Grattan	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Barker	PERSON	re-reads Dutch history in the light of the native authors of the old school and of general modem -LRB- foreign -RRB- writers ; and he does so critically .

		261 equal to
Grote	PERSON	, who preached British policy in a history of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Being a stalwart British Imperialist , he shows how the politicians have always mismanaged military enterprises .

		He would evidently have every general and admiral cut the wires of communication as soon as the march or the expedition is begun .

		His main idea is that
Great Britain	LOCATION	, in order to keep pace with
Germany	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, must form an imperial confederacy and have a written constitution ; otherwise , the British nation will surely recede into obscurity and give up the world to
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	and
Teuton	LOCATION	.

		To the American , the book is especially worthy of reading and study , for the wonderfully illuminating power with which it explores Dutch history to show the danger of the divisive forces in a nation .

		In the world-old struggle between local and central government , one can read in Dutch history the warnings that befit alike Americans in a federal union and Englishmen under a constitutional monarchy .

		The plague of Dutch history ` and the greatest hindrance to development lay in local and divi - sive forces .

		These prevented the realization of a true national union .

		Until modem times there was no centralized government of suffi - cient strength to solve the problems besetting the commonwealth .

		In the Middle Ages free - dom had been won from feudal lords , not by the people in their collective capacity , but by the cities , which finely wrought out the idea of mimicipal rights based on charters .

		But this process threw the power into the hands of oli - garchies .

		The families of wealth and ability perpetually maintained their power .

		Nether - lands , being an aggregation of cities , never be - came a genuine political unity , in spite of the genius of
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author does not bring out clearly -- any more than did Motley , who was under the spell of Hoofdt and
Wagenaar	PERSON	-- the contention of the Calvinists and Orangeists , as against the Arminians and Regents , in the great struggle between State-rights and
Union	ORGANIZATION	, led on the one side by Bameveldt and on the other by the military son of William the Silent .

		The people , or the Orangeists , emphasized the idea of the nation .

		The brilliant and able Bameveldt laid stress on the power of the States , the cities , and the power-holding aristocrats .

		The national idea triumphed over possible secession ; but no master-mind like that of
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	, who was a Unionist in both religion and poli - tics , led the Dutch into true national unity .

		Two centuries of a weak federalism , and the absorp - tion of individuals and corporations in the pur - suit of wealth at the expense of national unity , with the final humiliation of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	in being first ignored by the Powers and then con - quered by
France	LOCATION	, were necessary to make the Dutch realize how much they needed a cen - tralized government and a true head of affairs .

		In a word , the monarchy more than fulfilled the hopes of the republic .

		In developing his story , or rather his argu - ment in behalf of British federation , Mr.
Barker	PERSON	first shows the natural condition and resources of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	in shaping the character and history of the Dutch , and the upbuilding of the new world on the ruins of feudalism .

		Devas - tated by
Spain	LOCATION	, the Dutch Republic was created with blood and iron , but
the Netherlands	LOCATION	obtained the rank of a great Power .

		In time , too much home-rule brought on administrative chaos .

		Then party strife , arising from the ab - sence of a written constitution , weakened the country .

		While wealth increased , the army was allowed to sink into decay .

		The author even holds that the Netherlands treasonably aban - doned their ally ,
France	LOCATION	, and allowed the party of disintegration to become all-powerful in the commonwealth .

		The English attacked and de - feated the Dutch , gained the control of the seas , and took the Dutch colonies .

		Nevertheless , incurably selfish politicians in the
Netherlands	LOCATION	utilized defeat to strengthen their own position .

		Affairs went from bad to worse .

		In the end , under the blows , economic , military , and naval , of
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	,
the Netherlands	LOCATION	sank into insignificance -- a monimient to the folly of her self-seeking politicians .

		Mr.
Barker	PERSON	's style is bright and vivid .

		His references to authorities are numerous , and there is an excellent analytical index of thirty - six pages .

		The book is well worth reading by Americans interested in the study of national federation and state-rights .

		* The poetic drama is proving every year more attoactive to our younger writers of verse , and the unfortunate deadlock between poetry and the En - glish stage seems on the point of being broken .

		As long as theatrical managers maintained their nonpossumus attitude , rejecting with contumely the overtures of poets , the situation was hopeless , for such poets as wished to write in the dramatic form were offered no incentive to take stagecraft into consideration .

		But the situation is now considerably changed .

		Poetry , modern poetry , on the stage has been shown by such men as Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	and Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	to be at least a practicable affair , and the encouraging word has gone forth that even the commercialized and syndicated theatre has become amenable to an artistic appeal .

		One of the most promising of the younger poets who have heard this word of cheer is Mr.
Ridgely Torrence	PERSON	, whose ''
Abelard	PERSON	and H ^ loise '' we may now read in a book , and ere long , we are given to understand , may also witness in performance .

		His subject is one of the best that history can offer to the dramatist who has in his composition some infusion of psy - chology .

		The difficulty of dealing with one criti - cal situation in this poignant love-romance of the twelfth century has preserved the subject from over-exploitation , and left Mr.
Torrence	PERSON	a fairly fresh field for his endeavor .

		He disposes of the difficulty in question with a single effective line , dramatically placed , and the rest of his course is plain sailing .

		tirade as a legitimate feature of even the acting drama .

		The French stage , through three centuries of glorious history , has demonstrated to all but the mechanicians of dramatic writing that the long speech has as much right to exist as the choppy dialogue .

		Twenty-tliree lines is the extreme limit of Mr.
Torrence	PERSON	's daring , and upon two occasions he permits a character to discourse at that length .

		Neither of these passages wUl serve us for quota - tion , however , and we must illustrate the quality of the verse by means of an excerpt from the scene of the lovers ' meeting in after years .

		HfiLOISE . ''

		Love , bring back your eyes , think on us two .

		Think how the morning and the evening are , How they are lovely when we look together .

		Think how the dawn has found us glad of Love , Think how the noon has looked upon us glad , How the night 's pulse has grown to be one bird , Dripping its music on our double souls , Melting them to one song .

		Why , the whole earth Is like a banquet spread before our love , And I shall wait upon you , you shall see .

		Your bread shall be my tender services ; I '11 win the golden apples of the west , Out of my mighty willingness for you .

		Each dawn shall be a silver cup for you ; Oh , let me hold it , I am strong enough .

		Abelabd . ''

		So , there 's no help .

		Empty and waste and void .

		You only offer me this piteous table .

		Do you not see what mocking feast is Life ?

		Wherein one finds the goblets like as selves , Bitter , black wine .

		And floating motes for food ; How one sits with the sneering life around him Only to pass unquenchftd with a groan ?

		How he who deeply supped for living -- dies ?

		And he who hoped for death in his cup -- lives ?

		-LSB- He moves away .

		^ And all are troubled with the last year 's flies ? ''

		This passage may be taken as representing Mr.
Torrence	PERSON	's diction at its best .

		It is not without infelicities , verbal and rhythmical , but its movement is , on the whole , stately and impressive . ''

		The Coast of
Bohemia	LOCATION	'' is a volume of verse by Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page .

		Mr. Page is neither a lyrist nor a prophet , but he is a highly accom - plished man of letters , and so trained a hand as his could hardly fail to produce creditable work , even in the unwonted medium of rhyme and rhythm .

		We make one selection from the titular poem . ''

		There is a land not charted on all charts ; Though many mariners have touched its coast , Who far adventuring in those distant parts , Meet shipwreck there and are forever lost ; Or if they e'er return , are soon once more Borne far away by hunger for that magic shore . ''

		One voyager charted it for every age , From azure rim to starry mountain core .

		A nameless player on the World 's great stage , He spread his sails , adventured to that shore , And reared a pharos with his art sublime .

		Like
Ilion	LOCATION	's song-wrought towers , to beacon every clime .

		THE DIAL 253 '' There rest the heroes of lost causes lorn , On their calm brows more fadeless chaplets far Than all their conquerors ' could e'er adorn , When shone effulgent Fame 's ascendant star ; There fallen patriots reap the glorious prize Of deathless memory of their precious sacrifice . ''

		The thought of this poem recalls vividly `` The Isles , '' one of the happiest achievements of Mr.
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	.

		`` There is for the minor poet also a music that the outer world does not catch -- an inner day which the outer world does not see .

		It is this music , this light which , for the most part , is for the lesser poet his only reward . ''

		Thus runs Mr.
Page	PERSON	's apology for his intrusion into the singer 's realm .

		Combined with the evidences of poetic sensibility which his volume affords , the ex - cuse is quite sufficient . ''

		Easter-Song '' is the latest of the small books of verse that Mr.
Clinton	PERSON	ScoUard puts forth in such numbers .

		It is a collection of some twoscore '' Lyrics and Ballads of the Joy of Spring-time , '' which may be fairly represented by '' The Green o ' the Year . '' ''

		O the green o ' the year , the green o ' the year .

		When the blossom bursts on the jonquil-spear , And the wild-phlox lifts the blue of its eye Up to the blue of the brooding sky ; When every wafture of morning brings A sense of the fragrant heart of things !

		O the world is sweet and life is dear In this , the green o ' the year ! ''

		O the green o ' the year , the green o ' the year .

		When the lyric of earth is the song we hear .

		When rapture breathes from the lowliest weed , And the creed of joy is the common creed ; When nature thrills to the soul of the sod With the kindling touch of the smile of God !

		O the world is sweet and life is dear In this , the g ^ een o ' the year . ''

		`` Sicut Patribus , and Other Verse , '' is a collec - tion of poems by Mr.
Oscar Fay Adams	PERSON	.

		The noble motto of the parent puritan commonwealth provides a title , not only for the volume as a whole , but also especially for the Phi Beta Kappa poem with which it opens .

		The poem , read on Bunker Hill Day , is good anti-imperialist doctrine , and as such we give it welcome . ''

		Not mine , not mine the hand to sweep the strings With note triumphal , on this hallowed day .

		I am no prophet to foretell smooth things .

		Or choose a nation 's glory for my lay .

		The time for paeans is not yet , or past ; Rather the shuddering call that strikes us dumb , When , unto consciences aroused at last .

		The mutterings of a grim to-morrow come .

		These be no times for lightsome song : The shadow of a mighty wrong Darkens the path before , Clings like a mist behind ; We crouch , who stood of yore ; We grope , who now are blind .

		Alas for us !

		the sons of patriot sires , Breathing the air of freedom from our birth .

		Who might have kindled in far lands the fires Of liberty , transfigurer of earth ; Who might have raised a grateful people up To drain deep draughts from freedom 's brimming cup ; Who might have shown them the sure way to peace -- Alas for us !

		who did no deeds like these . ''

		This poem is a worthy pendant to Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's '' Ode in
Time of Hesitation	ORGANIZATION	, '' and will be grateful to all who feel the shame of the intolerable wrong done by our nation to freedom since the dark day when we foreswore our principles and became even as other nations in our disregard for the rights of man .

		This titular poem is followed by a group of dignified compositions suggested by the English cathedrals .

		The tomb of
William of Wykeham	ORGANIZATION	inspires this question of the builder 's shade : '' Dost somewhere rest , as this thy marble rests .

		Or art thou , builder-bishop , evermore Striving in other fields , in nobler toil , , Serenely glad the while as one that sees From some high place , untouched by time , past good Grow ever vaster as the centuries fall ? ''

		We must also find space for the lines tributary to the memoi ' y of
Horatio Nelson Powers	ORGANIZATION	, whom our older readers will remember as a valued contributor to these pages . ''

		Death hath no power o'er such as he ; The fulness of the life to be Shone round him in the life he spent Within this mortal prison pent .

		Texts might we gather from his looks Such as men read in holy books .

		And in his speech could hear at will The Master 's gracions accents still . ''

		A second offering of `` Post-Laureate Idylls '' fills the closing pages of this book of sincere and thoughtful verse .

		We have already spoken of one important Amer - ican contribution to the poetical drama ; another such work of comparable importance now claims our attention . ''

		Lords and Lovers , and Other Dramas '' is the title , and the author is Mrs.
Olive Tilford Dargan	PERSON	.

		The titular drama is a reproduction , re - markable alike in spirit and in diction , of the Elizabethan manner ; of the two • ' other dramas , '' '' The Shepherd '' is a prose tragedy of contempo - rary
Russia	LOCATION	, `` The Siege '' -LRB- again in verse -RRB- is a Sicilian tragedy of the age of the younger Dionysius .

		A first glance thus shows the author to be a woman of high and varied ambition ; a closer inspection reveals powers of no mean order in her work .

		Turn - ing now to '' Lords and Lovers , '' it is discovered to be a work having for its scene thirteenth century
England	LOCATION	, and for its characters the youthful
Henry the Third	ORGANIZATION	and the g ^ eat lords temporal and spiritual whose ambitions menace his royal prerogatives .

		The plot is strongly dramatic in construction , and the scenes are shifted with a truly Elizabethan disregard of the practical conditions of the modern stage .

		So far , of course , any reasonably informed writer might do as well as Mrs.
Dargan	PERSON	has done , but the case is different when we come to consider her poetic diction .

		One has but to skim over the pages to discover passages that arrest the eye , such , for ex - ample , as : '' The heavenly amaranth alone can dew Her brow with life . ''

		Nor are longer passages of sustained beauty lacking .

		Our own long extract shall be , however , from the Syracusan drama , from the scene in which Aratea well-nigh yields to the passion of Aristocles , although she is wedded to his friend . ''

		Aristocles .

		Come now , O now , else are we cast apart Far as the dismal Night heaves her vast sigh , Far as the laboring Chaos breathing blows , -- Perchance to hurl eternally about The farthest stars that from opposed heavens

		O , come ere we are lost !

		Be thy fair arms The rainbow girdle to this longing storm And its rude breast will pillow thee as soft As

		O kiss that holds the mornings of all time .

		And dewy seasons of the ungathered rose .

		Plant once again thy sununer on my lips ! ''

		Such verse as this leaves no room for criticism .

		It bears the visible mark of the divine gift , and there is no poet of our time who might not be proud to claim it for his own .

		The story of the woman taken in adultery is the theme of * ' Night and Morning , '' a narrative poem in blank verse by Mrs.
Katrina Trask	PERSON	.

		The story is told with picturesque beauty and adorned with happy imagery .

		Avowedly a didactic composition , the poem is nevertheless deeply mo \ dng , and its spiritual message is high and clear .

		The following text , from the scene in which the woman is brought before Christ for judgment , embodies the essential teaching of the work . ''

		Her new-born spirit saw beyond the hour -- Immortal life , indeed , is not fulfilled In the fulfilling of a dear desire ; There are supremer issues than the flesh -- Life 's glory lieth in the victory Of living spirit over mortal flesh . ''

		The poem offers an effective protest against the moral anarchy of the modern world .

		A memory of
Italy	LOCATION	, as embodied in the pair of quatrains entitled ''
Girgenti	PERSON	, '' may be taken to illustrate the quality of '' The Days That Pass , '' by Miss
Helen Huntington	PERSON	. ''

		The vision lingers still within my brain ; I sometimes see , though shut in city room , That far , sweet comer of the world again : The temples rising from the almond bloom . ''

		The early morning lights on plain and town .

		The golden convent walls and still blue sea .

		The distant mountains with their snowy crown , And all my heart cries out for
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		Many hearts will echo to that cry .

		This little poem is one of about half a hundred , all thoughtfully fashioned and delicate in expression .

		A memory of
Italy	LOCATION	, hallowed by association with the best-beloved of English poets , will do as well as anything to represent the collection called by Mrs.
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	'' In Praise of Leaves . '' ''

		Villa Magni '' is the name of the piece . ''

		There have I stood , and chastened by his name , With silence knelt -- a shadow at a shrine ; There have I given thanks , while breezes brine Murmured monotonies of youth and fame .

		Like votive anthems droned with soul aflame !

		There have I wandered , while the memoried air Whispered of dreams evasive , sadly fair .

		Of crystal faith earth could not crush or tame .

		Surely within these walls there lurks some trace Of that white spirit lingering there awhile , Some promise of a song -- some cloudy grace Hid there to presage weary men a smile .

		Some touch of that divinity they knew .

		When
Shelley	PERSON	passed imparadised from view . ''

		Of this volume , as of the one mentioned just before , we may say that its contents -- numbering nearly a hundred lyrics and sonnets -- offer upon every page the evidences of a delicate artistic sensibility .

		Beginning with a Morality and ending with a Nativity , the latest volume of poems by Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	gives us several gi-oups of pieces inspired in about equal degree by nature and by art .

		They strike no notes not already familiar to his readers , and in them he reveals , as heretofore , an extraor - dinarily sensitive temperament and a fine artistic sense of the fitness of words .

		Something like a creed appears to be formulated in the `` Hymn to Energy . '' ''

		Let every man be artist of his days .

		And carve into his life his own caprice ; And , as the supreme Artist does not cease Labouring always in his starry ways , Work without pause , gladly , and ask no man If this be right or wrong ; man has to do One thing , the thing he can ; Work without fear , and to thyself be true . ''

		Thou art , as God is ; and as God outflows Weaving his essence into forms of life , And , out of soul perfection 's lovely strife , Marries the rose 's odour with the rose .

		So must thou of thy heavenly human state , And of thy formless strife and suffering .

		Thyself thyself create Into the image of a perfect thing . ''

		This , it seems , is the new categorical imperative .

		It sounds plausible , but somehow is not as clear-cut and convincing as some of the older formulae .

		There are exquisite things in this volume , lyrical and medi - tational , and there is a graver burden , as of satiety , than we have been wont to find in the work of the poet .

		THE DIAL 255 `` Note on Poetry . '' ''

		Holiday '' is the title of the book , and also the titular poem .

		It is a lyrical autobiography of the human spirit through several incarnations . ''

		Twenty centuriea of Pain Mightier than Love or Art , Woke the meaning in my brain And the purpose of my heart . ''

		Straightway then aloft I swam Through the mountain 's sulphurous sty : Not eternal death could damn Such a hardy soul as I. '' From the mountain 's burning crest Like a god I come again , And with an immortal zest Challenge Fate to throw the main . ''

		The '' Note on Poetry '' is an eloquent argument for English blank verse as '' the subtlest , most power - ful , and most various organ of utterance articulate faculty has produced . ''

		In the closing passage of this '' Note , '' Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	, after a tribute to
Poe	PERSON	, enlarges upon America in general , and makes it evi - dent that he has been '' seeing things . '' ''

		America is the decadence of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Chivalry reappears there in the tyranny of pretty women and the liberty of divorce .

		Religion becomes a coarse sentimental pietism , and revisits us with an impudent stare in the face in the form of
Moody	ORGANIZATION	and
Sankey	PERSON	; our splendid robbers ,
Clive	PERSON	,
Hastings	PERSON	,
Rhodes	LOCATION	, degen - erate there into the pickpockets of the Trusts ; there the Celt flourishes , and the negro is burned alive .

		I find all that in ' Ulalume , ' and ' The Haunted Palace . ' ''

		Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	is a poet now in his twenty - eighth year , an Oxonian and an athlete , who has been writing verse since his undergraduate days .

		Five volumes now stand to his credit , besides the `` Poems '' which now introduce him -LRB- with Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	for a sponsor -RRB- to the American public .

		New pieces and selections from the earlier volumes make up the contents of this collection , which acquaints us with a singer whose note is both fresh and vital .

		We will turn straightway to quotation , and begin with a stanza from the ode to `` The Passing of
Summer	DATE	. '' ''

		What though the throstle pours his heart away , A happy spendthrift of uncounted gold , Swinging upon the blossomed briar With soft throat lifted in a wild desire To make the world his
May	DATE	, Ever the pageant through the Gates is rolled Further away ; in vain the rich notes throng Flooding the mellow noon with rapturous waves of song . ''

		This is the note of
Arnold	LOCATION	's `` Thyrsis , '' almost the note of
Keats	PERSON	.

		Our next quotation shall be a son - net , ''
Venus Disrobing	PERSON	for the Bath . '' ''

		Over the firm young bosom 's polished peaks The thin white robe slips dimly as a dream Slowly dissolving in the sun 's first beam : Far off the sad sea sighs and vainly seeks The abandoned shell that bore her to the Greeks When first she slumbered on the sea-blue stream , And in the dawn 's first faint wild golden gleam The white doves woke her with their soft red beaks .

		From breast to sunny thigh the light silk slips On every rose-white curve and rounded slope Pausing ; and now it lies around her feet In tiny clouds : now timidly she dips One foot ; the warm wave , shivering at her sweet , Kisses it with a murmur of wild hope . ''

		The purity of this exquisite picture is as noteworthy as its beauty .

		How differently a sensualist would have colored it !

		By way of contrast , our tax shall now be levied upon the merry ballad of the '' Forty Singing Seamen , '' for Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has a vein of fantastic humor no less marked than his feeling for every mode of the beautiful .

		These adventurers found their way to the land of Prester
John	PERSON	, and beheld many wonders , including the
Phoenix	LOCATION	.

		This is the veracious chronicle of what happened to them on their search for the fountain of youth . ''

		So we thought we 'd up and seek it , but that forest fair defied us -- First a crimson leopard laught at us most horrible to see , Then a sea-green lion came and snifPed and licked bis chops and eyed us , While a red and yellow unicorn was dancing round a tree I We was trying to look thinner , Which was hard , because our dinner Must ha ' made us very tempting to a cat o ' high degfree !

		Cho .

		-- Must ha ' made us very tempting to the whole menarjeree ! ''

		After these and sundry other experiences no less wonderful , the mariners returned to London-town .

		The note of skepticism struck in the closing stanza , '' Could the grog we dreamt we swallowed Make us dream of all that followed ? ''

		does not seriously interfere with enjoyment of the story .

		There is so great a variety offered by these poems that we have only begun to give them a fair representation .

		With the verses called `` Art , '' we may become deeply serious again , and reluctantly close the volume . ''

		Beyond ; beyond ; and yet again beyond !

		What went ye out to seek , oh foolish-fond ?

		Is not the heart of all things here and now ?

		Is not the circle infinite , and the centre Everywhere , if ye would but hear and enter ?

		Come , the porch bends and the great pillars bow . ''

		Come ; come and see the secret of the sun ; The sorrow that holds the warring worlds in one ; The pain that holds Eternity in an hour ; One God in every seed self-sacrificed , One star-eyed , star-crowned universal Christ , Re-crucified in every wayside flower . ''

		There is an excellent device in '' A Poet 's Prayer , '' which heralds '' The Worker , and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
Coningsby WUliam Dawson	PERSON	. ''

		Give me to sing the songs that must be sung ; Not vagrant echoes of the thing last said .

		Nor lamentable words caught up among Hollows where leaden skies are splashed with red , And startled eyes strain at departing day O'er barren lands where
Autumn	DATE	hath begun . ''

		One would expect cheerful strains after such an invo - cation as this , and it is something of a surprise to find the autumnal note predominant in what follows .

		For , 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, instead of the word of hopefulness and cheer , Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	brings us the message of life 's grinding misery , of the evanescence of joy , and of the chasten - ing ministry of suffering .

		We quote from what he says , '' As for the Dead , '' noting that it seems to be a reply to Baudelaire 's plea , '' Nous devrious pourtant leur porter quelques fleure , Lea morts , les pauvres morts , ont de grandes douleure , '' made familiar as the text of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's noble elegy . ''

		Why should we pluck fresh flowers for our dead , And add new death to that which went before ?

		We shall not ease them with our posies , nor Shall we repose them with the tears we shed , -- For they are dead . ''

		The poor dead can not smell the blooms we bring , For they are still , and straight , and very cold .

		And have no knowledge of the way we fold
Earth	LOCATION	's tender mantle round them slumbering .

		Nor love we bring . ''

		Whether their graves lie far apart and bare , Or scattered through the ocean 's restless sand .

		Or intimate with lilac and garland Of God 's wild rose , they may not choose to care What pains we bear . ''

		The name of
Garneau	PERSON	is an honored one in French - Canadian literature .

		Francois -
Xavier Garneau	PERSON	's '' Histoire du
Canada	LOCATION	'' is a standard work that has long been prized for its substantial excellence .


Alfred Garneau	PERSON	, the son of the historian , was a poet of considerable accomplishment , and his verse , now posthumously collected , has been published by his son , Mr.
Hector Garneau	PERSON	, who is also engaged in edit - ing a definitive annotated edition of his grandfather 's '' History . ''

		The volume of '' Poesies , '' by
Alfred Garneau	PERSON	-LRB- who died in
1904	DATE	-RRB- , represents the literary diversions of a man of affairs .

		The composition of these poems covered a period of half a century , and the number of pieces is nearly equal to that tale of years .

		We quote the lines written '' Devant la Grille du Cimetlere . '' ''

		La tristesse des lieux sourit , I ` heure est exquise ' Le couchant s ` est charg ^ des derni ^ res couleurs .

		Et devant les tombeaux , que I ` ombre idealise , Un grand souffle mourant soulfeve encor les fleurs . ''

		Salut , vallon sacr4 , notre terre promise !

		Les chemins sous les ifs , que peuplent les paleurs Des marbres , sont muets ; dans le fond ,

		La lumi ^ re au-dessus plane longtemps vermeille -- Sa b § che sur I ' ^ paule , contre les arbres noirs , Le fossoyeur repasse , it voit la croix qui veille . ''

		Et de loin , comme it fait sans doute tous les soirs , Get homme la salue avec un geste immense -- Un chant tr6s doux d'oiseau vole dans le silence . ''

		The grave note of contemplative melancholy heard in these lines is characteristic of the majority of the pieces .

		But the poet had - also lighter notes at his command , and occasionally more virile ones , as in the song of the '' Porte-Drapeau , '' inspired by the Fenian invasion of his country .

		Here is the closing stanza of this martial composition : ''
Victoire !	ORGANIZATION

		... des hommes perfides Voulaient envahir nos foyers ; Le ciel punit les fratricides , Nous avons fait cent prisonniers !

		New edition of The third volume of Grove 's ''

Grove	ORGANIZATION	's Diction - ti ^ nary of Music and Musicians , '' aryofmuttc J - r a t ^ n ■ ```` - • i i and musicians , edited by Mr.
J. A. r uUer Maitland	PERSON	, fully sustains the reputation of its two predecessors for accuracy of historical statement , comprehensive - ness of scope , and conservatism of criticism .

		In all these qualities it is a conspicuous testimonial to the expert editing and musical scholarship of Mr.
Mait	PERSON	- land .

		It must be conceded , indeed , with all respect to the ability of the late Sir
George Grove	PERSON	as a mu - sical connoisseur , that the new edition , even apart from additions , is a distinct improvement over the old one .

		There were several errors arid numerous omissions in the latter which necessitated the publi - cation of another volume as appendix to the original four .

		Of course it was not a heinous offense .

		Even with all the care bestowed upon the revised edition , this third volume gives two pages of addenda and corrigenda for volume two , showing the almost in - numerable difficulties which beset the compiler of a musical dictionary .

		This standard work has already been so fully reviewed in our columns , both as to the matter and the manner of treatment , that it is only necessary now to call attention to the contents of Volume III. , which begins with the name of
Joseph Maas	PERSON	and closes with that of
Louisa Pyne	PERSON	-- two names which call up old memories of opera in
Chi	LOCATION	- cago , for Maas the tenor came here with the
Kellogg	ORGANIZATION	troupe in
1874	DATE	, while
Louisa Pyne	PERSON	with her English opera troupe was here as early as
1855	DATE	. ''

		But where are the shows of yester-year ? ''

		There are thirteen articles in this volume which have almost text - book comprehensiveness , viz , ''
Madrigal	PERSON	, '' `` Mass , '' `` Mendelssohn , '' `` Modes and
Modula	PERSON	- tions , '' `` Mozart , '' `` Notation , '' `` Opera , '' `` Oratorio , '' `` Organ , '' `` Musical Periodicals , '' `` Piano , '' `` Plain Song , '' and '' Psalter . ''

		The biographies of
Mozart	PERSON	and
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	, having a few additions , are repro - ductions of these in the old edition , but it will appear singular to most students that 110 pages are allotted to
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	and only 31 to
Mozart	LOCATION	.

		This is to be explained , probably , by Sir
George Grove	PERSON	's pre - dilections for the former .

		The article '' Opera '' has been enriched by an excellent sketch of opera in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Thistleton-Dver	PERSON	is an experi - of Folk-lore enced producer ot lolk-lore books about women .

		which are interesting , show diligence , and bring together material of considerable value .

		He has facility in stringing liis beads together , is discreet in committing himself to no positive view , and carefully avoids the sifting of matter , statement of original ideas , or promulgation of theory .

		His usual qualities are admirably displayed in his latest work '' Folklore of Women '' -LRB-
McCIurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Its matter is drawn , he tells us , from '' legendary and traditional tales , folk-rhymes , pi'overbial sayings , superstitions , etc. '' In reality , far the larger part is from the proverbs ; and the proverbial philosophy of every time and every clime has found a vast field for expression in dealing with women .

		He presents Arabic ,
Hindustani	ORGANIZATION	, Assamese , Armenian ,
Kashmiri	LOCATION	,
Singhalese	ORGANIZATION	,
Tamil	LOCATION	, Chinese , Japanese and other pro- verbs , besides those of European peoples .

		Unless , however , he studies the peculiar features of life and thought of these stranger peoples , which must be known in order that their proverbs may be under - stood , little is gained by the mere repetition of the proverbs themselves .

		In fact , repetition without such explanation is often more misleading than help - ful .

		The graceful stringing together of all sorts of proverbs relative to women , the connecting phrases being meaningless and contributing neither thought nor explanation , produces a literary patchwork which makes pleasant reading but does not have the value of a carefully arranged and classified collection , wherein the proverbs were grouped or sub-grouped by races and with no connecting text .

		Our author divides his material into twenty-seven chapters , under such titles as '' Woman 's Beauty , '' '' Woman 's Eyes , '' `` Woman 's Tongue , '' `` Red-haired Girls , '' '' Woman 's Will , '' '' Woman 's Curiosity , '' etc. .

		Much suggestive material is presented that deserves dis - cussion .

		The final chapter , on '' My Lady 's Walk , '' is interesting .

		The term , as one of general applica - tion , seems to be of our author 's own suggestion , and he introduces the chapter with these words : '' Associated with many of our historic houses and romantic spots , ' My Lady 's Walk ' perpetuates the memory , not infrequently , of tradition of a tragic and legendary kind , some of which belongs to incident bound up with the seamy side of family romance . ''

		In this chapter also we have mere bead - stringing .

		If we seem to have given our author scant praise , it is not because he fails to present interesting matter , but because he fails to deal with it as he might . ''

Napoleon	PERSON	possessed it in full sov - ereignty , and felt the necessity of maintaining for his protection , against the Barbary pirates if against no one else , a miniature army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		This do - main , twelve miles by seventeen , he had exchanged for an empire reaching from the Baltic to the fron - tier of
Naples	LOCATION	and strengthened by a borderland of dependent states .

		Perhaps the contrast was tragic enough to divest sovereignty on so small a scale of any comic element ; perhaps
Napoleon	PERSON	was too ter - ribly serious a tyrannical possibility to be amusing even when forced to play the royal role on the scene of
Elba	LOCATION	.

		M. Gruyer thinks this episode has been too much ignored by the ordinary historians , whose interest remains centred upon the affairs of
France	LOCATION	.

		He has studied the island and has carefully identi - fied the places mentioned in the accounts of Na - poleon 's stay .

		He describes these as they are to-day and as they were in
1814	DATE	, supporting his descrip - tions with excellent photographs .

		The body of his narrative is made up of an account of the events of
Napoleon	PERSON	's life from his arrival , in
May , 1814	DATE	, to his departure , in
February	DATE	of the next year .

		It is pleasantly written , and the information is drawn from good sources ; but it does not impress one as equal to the opportunity either in grasp or firmness of treatment .

		-- An interesting book to read in re - gard to the same phases of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's career is
J. Holland Rose	PERSON	's edition of `` Napoleon 's Last Voyages '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , comprising the voyage to
Elba	PERSON	in the '' Undaunted , '' as recounted by Admiral
Ussher	PERSON	, and the voyage to
St. Helena	LOCATION	on the ''
Northumberland	LOCATION	, '' by
John Glover	PERSON	, secretary to Rear Admiral Cock - burn .

		These accounts have been published before , the last time in
1895	DATE	; but their value is now in - creased by Dr.
Rose	PERSON	's notes , and they are embel - lished with twenty illustrations taken from contem - porary sketches and caricatures .

		geems to have touched the high-water mark in bookmaking that is at once irreproachable and inexpensive .

		Here are half-a-dozen volumes , published in the regular course at a price little more than that asked for the ordinary novel , which , if issued with the imprint of some so-called '' private press , '' w ^ ould be widely discussed and eagerly taken up at whatever cost by collectors of choice books .

		258 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, The general characteristics and atmosphere of seven - teenth-century bookmaking have been reproduced with remarkable fidelity ; it is not merely that old - time type-faces are used and a contemporary form of binding copied , but the actual quality of the work itself -- the typography , the presswork , the sewing of the sheets -- speaks eloquently of a day when the book was a creation of the artist 's hand rather than the output of a machine .

		The first group of six volumes is made up of
Pepys	PERSON	's `` Memoires of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	, '' wherein the immortal diarist appears to advantage in his official capacity as naval adminis - trator ;
John Evelyn	PERSON	's '' Sculptura , '' an interesting by-product of another famous diarist , with a second part never before published ;
Peacham	LOCATION	's '' Compleat Gentleman , '' the contribution of a Cavalier school - master to the literature of courtesy ;
Thomas Howell	PERSON	's '' Devises , '' a volume of verse which served to make less barren the gap in English poetry between Sur - rey and Spenser ; Sir
Henry Knyvett	PERSON	's '' Defence of the Realme , '' the work of an obscure but valorous soldier in
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's service , now for the first time printed ; Sir
Fulke Greville	PERSON	's '' Life of Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	, '' well known and still holding a secure place among books about
Sidney	PERSON	.

		Each of these volumes contains an introduction by some capable writer , and in the '' Sculptura '' is a notably fine reproduction in photogravure of
Prince Rupert	LOCATION	's mezzotint .

		It is to be hoped on every account that the ''
Tudor	PERSON	and Stuart Library '' will multiply and prosper .

		Ideals of life in an adjective have been preached from many a pulpit , lay and professional .

		The simple life has been exalted , the happy life encouraged , the strenuous life advertised .

		We have been led to consider the value of the experimental life , the duty of the dedicated life .

		Mr.
Gulick	PERSON	's plain - spoken appeal for the value of `` The Efficient Life '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- is not of this ilk .

		It is a notably sen - sible , frankly practical , and popularly attractive statement of some well-established principles of healthy mindedness , that , as the Romans told us , necessarily requires health of body .

		Dr.
GiUick	PERSON	exhibits a welcome versatility in enforcing his cen - tral theme of efficiency : brawn is good when it is good for something ; means are not ends and are to be appraised by their subservience to ends .

		This is a tolerant doctrine .

		One man 's way to the end is not another 's ; and even when the one 's meat is far from being another 's poison , it is not the best meat for the second .

		Know thyself , and act accord - ingly .

		Best of all , the doctrine emphasizes quality .

		Efficiency is not only big and little ; it is high grade and low grade .

		The race-horse and the plough - horse have unlike physiologies and markedly unlike psychologies .

		There are thousands of persons who do not ask for and are not likely to be benefited by profound treatises on the hows and whys of our bodily and mental economy .

		They need plain talks for plain people ; yet he who does the talking must be inspired by a sound perspective of how such The meaning and virtues of ejfflciencv .

		knowledge is gained and where application is war - ranted .

		To such , Dr.
Gulick	PERSON	's pages are admirably suited .

		Common-sense , unfortunately , does not seem as soothing or as uplifting as mystic cant to sickly minds .

		But in the end health comes to the healthy-minded ; and these will find a fellow-feeling in this plain tale of the meaning of efficiency and the influences that make for and against it .

Hicks MagiU	PERSON	, is presented under the title `` Sixty - five Years in the Life of a Teacher , 1841-1906 '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work is very un - pretentious in style and naive in its simple-hearted revelations of the writer 's feelings , filial , paternal , and professional .

		Much of the book is of interest chiefly to the friends of the man or of the college ; yet it is interesting as a whole as the self - revelation of a fine character and an interesting personality , of a man too deepy absorbed in the service of his generation through the training of its youth to care for self-advancement or outside interests .

		Among the things that give to the book a value for the gen - eral reader are the descriptions of life among the Friends of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	two generations ago , and of the schools and teaching of that day ; the inter - esting accounts of two great teachers under whom the writer studied .

		Professor
Hadley	PERSON	of
Yale and President Wayland of Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, and of the college teaching at that time , with the story of the beginnings of the elective system in our colleges under the remarkable leadership of President Way - land ; and the striking personality of
Francis Gardner	PERSON	, Master of the
Boston Latin School	ORGANIZATION	, in which Mr.
Magill	PERSON	taught for several years , Ac - counts of the founding of
Swarthmore College	ORGANIZATION	and of its history occupy a considerable portion of the book .

George M. Gould	PERSON	continues his plucky fight against what he appears to have some reason for regarding as prejudice and error in the generally accepted methods of treating -LRB- or neglect - ing -RRB- eye-diseases and ailments caused by defective vision .

		The public , especially the medical part of it , by this time knows something about Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's pronounced views on eye-strain , its great prevalence , its evil effects , and its cure ; and while the perse - vering author 's latest volumes on the subject have not the novelty of their predecessors , they serve to strengthen his position by reiteration and added in - stances .

		Many of the chapters are reprints from medical and other journals ; and there are but five studies -LRB- all in Volume IV . -RRB-

		of famous sufferers --
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Tchaikovsky	ORGANIZATION	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,

		It is only by this organized perse - cution , under conservative interests , that the fecund race of cranks is kept from overflowing the land .

		The innovators that finally triumph have proved their fitness to survive -- as may be believed will be the case with Dr.
Gould	PERSON	.

		The temper of the man com - mends itself , as reflected in the following brief quo - tation from his pages : '' There is more in medicine than treating the disease , more than treating the patient .

		The patient is a person , a friend and brother , with a past and a future .

		The classing and treating sick human beings exclusively as ' clinical material ' is an accursed thing and the curse of medicine . ''

The Merrymount Press of Boston	ORGANIZATION	is of Renaissance bringing out , in a limited edition , literature .

		^ series of works '' characteristic of some aspect of the cultm-e which flourished in
Western Europe	LOCATION	during the period of the Renais - sance . ''

		The set is called as a whole `` The Hu - manists ' Library , '' and the first number is made up of selections from
Leonardo	LOCATION	da
Vinci	PERSON	's fragmentary writings , many of them found mingled with his drawings and diagrams ; and to the volume , which is entitled '' Thoughts on Life and Art , '' Mr.
Lewis Einstein	PERSON	, the general editor of the series , has con - tributed a short but helpful introduction , while Mr.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	has done the work of translating .

		The old-time type , especially designed for the pub - lishers by Mr.
Herbert P. Home	PERSON	, is beautifully clear , and also innocent of freakish features .

		As a basis for the text .

		Dr.
Solmi	PERSON	's '' Leonardo da Vinci : Frammenti Letterari e Storici '' -LRB-
Florence	LOCATION	,
1900	DATE	-RRB- has been used , by permission ; but other texts have been compared , and a new order has been adopted in arranging the paragraphs .

		The next three numbers in this series will be
Erasmus	LOCATION	's trea - tise '' Against War , ''
M. Pierre de Nolhac	PERSON	's '' Pet - rarch and the Ancient World , '' and Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	's '' Defence of
Poesie	LOCATION	; A Letter to Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	; and The Defence of
Leicester	LOCATION	, '' -- all competently edited .

		A long list of works from which future selections will be made has a promis - ing appearance in both authorship and editorship .

		The first four volumes may be ordered singly or , at a slight reduction , collectively .

		In one sense , the most recent ency '
2cycio %	PERCENT	dias .

		clopaedia is always the best ; and ''
Nelson	PERSON	's Encyclopaedia '' is a very recent work indeed .

		We mean by this that the work has been prepared in much less time than usually goes to such an undertaking .

		We are in - formed that the actual manufacture of the twelve stout volumes has been accomplished in less than a year , which probably makes a new record for works of this class .

		It is an essentially modern book of reference , which means that the men and activities of the present day receive an unusually large share of attention .

		This , of course , is at the expense of historical information , but for that we can easily consult other encyclopaedias fashioned upon a more leisurely plan .

		There is a great profusion of illus - tration in these volumes , the first of them alone giving us over fifty full-page plates -LRB- a dozen of them colored -RRB- besides hundreds of smaller figures .

		There are three narrow columns of small but clear print to the page , which would not be agreeable for continuous reading , but has the advantage of pre - senting a great deal of matter in compact form .

		Each volume has a useful Appendix of Pronunciation .

		The editorial work has been done under the joint direction of Mr.
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	and Mr.
George Sandeman	PERSON	of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		On the whole , we think highly of this encyclopaedia , which fairly realizes the German ideal of a Konversations -
Lexicon	LOCATION	, and which is published at a price moderate enough to place it within the means of a large num - ber of readers .

George Derby	PERSON	, entitled '' A Conspectus of American Biogi-aphy . ''

		This substantial volume of nearly eight hundred pages contains , in indexed or tabular form , an enor - mous number of facts so arranged as to make it a helpful book of reference .

		For example , one can find in it lists of all the occupants of important positions , public or private , throughout the history of our country .

		Among these lists we may mention cabinet officers , members of both houses of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, governors of states , presidents of colleges , bishops of various denominations , army officei 'S , and editors .

		Then there is an interesting tabulation of poems , plays , and novels , in which American historical characters figure , a catalogue of public statues in the
United States	LOCATION	, a collection of '' notable sayings , '' an '' anniversary calendar , '' and a list of '' founders of American families and their descendants . ''

		A large section of the work is filled with indexes , both personal and topical , to the Cyclopaedia .

		A classified list of Americans , preeminent in various occupations , is another useful feature , but the chron - ological arrangement of the names under each cate - gory seems to be based upon the date of first appearance before the public instead of the date of birth .

		This is a curious method , and yet is not without certain advantages .

		But it is not explained , and we have been left to puzzle it out for ourselves .

		Speaking of this edition the other day , we ought to have called attention to the fact that the '' Brand '' volume is a reprint of Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	's wonderful translation , a fact which for some unexplained reason the publishers have suppressed .

		The natural inference would be to credit Mr.
Archer	PERSON	with the version , in spite of the astonishing contrast between his own wooden translations and this master - piece of poetical reproduction .

		It was high time to include a Mozart volume in the '' Musicians ' Library '' of the Messrs.
Ditson	PERSON	.

		The neglect of that great genius by our fashionable modern pianists is one of the most discouraging signs of the musical times , because it illustrates the extent to which the craze for technique has got the better of musical feeling .

		What famous executant of our day would dare , without an apology , to substitute a Mozart sonata for the dazzling composition of the latest of Russians that is usually the piece de resistance of the programme ?

		And yet , in nine cases out of ten , musical art would gain from the substitution and only pedantry or sensationalism would lose .


Herr Carl Reinecke	PERSON	, who knows his
Mozart	PERSON	, is the editor of the volume of '' Twenty Piano Compo - sitions '' now published .

April 16	DATE	, The Magazine Reader 's Friend TN each monthly issue of What 's in the Magazines the contents , for the same month , of nearly one hundred leading peri - odicals are classified , indexed , described , and commented upon , -- all in the simplest and most convenient way imaginable .

		It makes accessible to the busy every-day reader the entire mass of current periodical literature as it appears .

		Each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the magazines of the month , that will give one in five minutes the information hitherto to be obtained only by long and tedious examination of contents-pages on the news-stands .

		It is a periodical that brings the other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so must prove indispensable to everyone who would keep in touch with current affairs .

50 cents	MONEY	A labor and time saving device that promises to attain an almost universal popularity .

		The multiplication of worthy periodicals within the past few years has meant a serious embarassment to those who try to keep in touch with current literature , and despair was heretofore the portion of the m/in who disliked to miss articles of value wherever produced .

		As a handy guide to the things one needs or desires , What 's in the Magazines is a veritable path through the forest .

		--
Bkookxyn Daily Eagle	ORGANIZATION	.

		The valvs of such a convenient and reliable guide to the magazine literature of the country will be rapidly appreciated by the student. , the teacher , the specialist in any field of research , the general reader and the onan of affairs .

		It is a publication that will admirably supplement - `
Poole	PERSON	's Index '' and the ' • ' ■ Guide to Periodical Literature . ''

		--
Detroit Evening News	ORGANIZATION	.

		So great is the reliance placed upon What `` s in the Magazines that the busy man and woman wonders how in the past he did without this valuable little periodical that comes each month and places the contents of the high-class magazines in easy access to the reader .

		It is not .

		however , a msre list of contents , nor a complicated index , but ea ^ h issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the maga - zine contents of the month .

		Its valvs to busy men and women is incalculable .

		NOTES 292 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 293 SCIENCE A ND LI TERATURE .

		Every now and then the voice of some crit - ical
Cassandra	PERSON	is heard to prophesy dire things concerning the fate of literature .

		The great writers are all dying , and none appear to take their places .

		Civilization is becoming more and more material , and idealism is everywhere being crowded to the wall .

		Men look to the poets for diversion , but no longer find in them the bread of life .

		Now materialism , as Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	remarks in a recent '' Contem - porary '' article , '' is a good mouth-filling word , upon which anyone in search of an explanation may seize .

		What , it might be asked , can you expect of a generation which speaks of the British flag as an ' asset ' ?

		Who would now reject even a small portion of the world for fear of losing his own soid ? ''

		But literature has survived the menace of asphyxiation by mate - rialism a number of times already , and wiU probably continue to do so , however seemingly imminent the death-agony .

		It is not so much toward materialism as toward science that we shoxdd look for the corrosive influence that now imperils aU the arts , literature among them .

		This is the text of Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's essay , which has for its title the ominous question , '' Is Litera - ture Dying ? ''

		and which takes a less hopeful view of the situation than that which we are disposed to advance .

		A few sentences wiU serve to illustrate our writer 's statement of his case . ''

		The scientific spirit seems now to dominate everything .

		The world in future is to be governed from the lab - oratory .

		It used to be said by those of old time that science had a definite province , beyond which was the realm of literature , conduct , im - agination , faith .

		Modern science seeks to re - move the boundaries , to claim all knowledge for its province , and to say that what it does not know is not knowledge ... When , if ever , science is finally enthroned as the goddess of reason , the one source of real truth here below , the arbitress of human destiny , the dictatress of the world , literature must gradually subside into a tale of little meaning , a relic of the past .

		The legendary mathematician 's comment on ` Paradise Lost ' -LRB- a very fine poem , but I do n't quite see what it all goes to prove -RRB- , may have 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, shown him to be in advance of his age .

		For though ' Paradise Lost ' probably numbers more readers than the `
Principia	LOCATION	, ' it has not extended the boundaries of human knowledge . ''

		This seems a plausible argument , but it is based upon a fallacious distinction .

		Let us grant that science has aU knowledge for its province ; the admis - sion does not in the least impair the claim of literature , which has the coequal , if not the superior , right to rule over that province by virtue of its appeal to the emotional side of hu - man nature .

		Science and literature in their relations to one another and to man , simply illustrate anew the coordination of temporal and spiritual authority that history shows to have been workable for many centuries in many lands .

		It is only what theologians style '' science falsely so-called '' that seeks to usurp the place of literature ; science truly conceived does loyal service to literature by keeping it supplied with fresh materials for its shaping agency .

		Has Mr.
Paul	PERSON	forgotten his
Wordsworth	PERSON	?

		Nothing truer was ever penned than the famous saying : '' Poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge ; it is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all science . ''

		The discouraging conclusion of our essayist 's argument is formulated in the following series of propositions : '' There is enough poetry in the world already .

		It must be waste of tipae to make more .

		Science is to literature as life to death .

		To become really scientific is a resur - rection .

		If these views are widely held , more widely every day , the question at the head of this article must be answered in the affirmative .

		It may be a euthanasia , a gradual and easy decay .

		But it is as certain as it is gxadual . ''

		We have already stated what seems to be a sufficient reason for holding this reckless use of the words '' must '' and '' certain '' as extremely ill-advised .

		The writer ignores the fundamental elements of the problem , and his finding has only the narrow support of certain temporary condi - tions , of a mere phase in the progress of our culture .

		That phase , we will freely allow him , shows us to be suffering just now from the arro - gance of positivism and the corresponding defect of imagination , from an excess of materialism over humanism , of realism over idealism , and of the claims of the flesh over those of the spirit .

		As a statement of the existing situation and out - look , Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's complaint is probably not over - drawn , the colors of his picture are perhaps no darker than are justifiable .

		We heartily agree with him in his scoring of the present-day evils of irreverence and philistinism , and '' the crass - ness of unidealized prosperity . ''

		His list of the influences now hostile to literature might be con - siderably extended , or at least particularized , to even more dismal effect .

		The degrading uses which are made of literature in our educational machinery would supply a fruitful theme for exploitation .

		Another would be supplied by the unconscionable activities of the commercially - minded persons who provide us with a large share of the books , and a still larger share of the periodicals , that we read .

		We may , in short , find ourselves in substantfel agreement with Mr.
Paul	PERSON	, or with any other reporter who looks upon the present age as one of literary retrogression , but we must part company with all such observ - ers when they endeavor to persuade us that the doom of literature is at last sealed .

		For we have only to look back a hundred years or so to discover literature springing radi - antly into renewed life from a social and intel - lectural soil seemingly as sterile as that of these discouraging days in which we live .

		As Mr.
Watts-Dimton	PERSON	has pointed out , mankind alter - nates between two great impulses , the impulse of acceptance , and the impulse of wonder .

		Although science is doing its best to destroy in us the impulse to look with wondering eyes upon the world , we are by no means in the desperate case of our eighteenth-century forbears .

		Per - haps we are yet destined to as low a descent before the awakening comes .

		But if the past has any lesson at all for us , it is the lesson that the spirit of man , although subdued for a season , always contrives to reassert itself , refusing to be forever fed upon the husks of mere knowledge , demanding also for its full sustenance those elements of awe and rapture and reverent faith which science alone can not offer , and which it is the holy mission of literature to furnish for the famishing soul .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A NATIONAL MONUMENT TO SHAKESPEARE is the Sub - ject of an illuminating essay in Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's recent book , ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	and the Modern Stage . ''

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	gives the history of the various attempts made by En - gland to commemorate her great poet , and marshalls all the arguments to show the fitness and necessity for such celebration .

		Particularly does he dispose of those projects which would make of a Shakespearean memo - rial the tag to some utilitarian purpose -- a lectureship foundation , a school for actors , or an endowed theatre .

		It is to be feared that
England	LOCATION	is not yet ready for a spontaneous and general tribute to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is no such love for the things of the mind , no such pas - sionate adoration for the kings of art , in that country , as exist in many other nations or lands .

		Standing in

		THE DIAL 277
Burns	PERSON	's cottage in
Ayrshire	LOCATION	one can see a continual stream of Scotch people flowing in and out , -- small merchants , farmers , drovers , women and children , -- and from their wet eyes and trembling lips one can gather the force of the feeling which has dotted the west of
Scotland	LOCATION	with magnificent monuments to
Burns	PERSON	.

		But nobody goes to
Stratford	LOCATION	except Americans .

		En - gland is the
Martha	PERSON	of nations , careful in material matters , careless about ideal ones .

		For her warriors and statesmen she has glorious rewards and gorgeous graves .

		But the '' Poets ' Corner '' of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	has a sneering sound .

		Yet with all her worship of success and power she has produced no man of action of the first rank , none the world would place level with
Alexander	PERSON	,
Csesar	PERSON	,
Charlemagne	LOCATION	, or
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		Per contra she has produced the supreme creative artist of mankind .

		, , .

		The reference-library idea has been usefully applied in establishing the
Department of Legislative Reference	ORGANIZATION	of the city of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, with Dr.
Horace E. Flack	PERSON	, a
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	graduate , at its head .

		This new municipal department , which began its beneficent existence with the opening of the year , is probably unique , in this country at least , although
Boston	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	have well-managed and very useful bureaus of statistics , and the state libraries of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	and

		The innate depravity of words , their perverse tendency to lose the innocence etymologically belonging to them , and to acquire sinister meanings , must have struck many a reader of early English literature .

		Does your reviewer of Finot 's '' Race Prejudice '' mean seriously to assert that the Negro American is the most difficult '' case '' in the way of miiversal brother - hood ?

		We have usually been patronizingly informed that our advance in
America	LOCATION	had little to do with the case , since we were exceptional , and that the real crux of the matter was the origin and destiny of the Afri - can Negro .

		When now there comes an advocate who successfully ridicules the pretended inferiority of Afri - cans , your acrobatic wiiter gracefully informs us that we of
America	LOCATION	lack '' the seal of proof . ''

		Is this because he knows anything about the Negro American , or be - cause he misses in Finot the staring headlines of '' Rape '' and `` Lynching . ''

		-LSB- The closing sentence of our review seems unfor - tunately to have suggested a conclusion as remote from the intention of the reviewer as of the author of the book reviewed .

		The sentence was intended to suggest that the experience of the negro situation in
America	LOCATION	furnishes to the author the most complex data and considerations afforded by the juxtaposi - tion and assimilation of modes of life of two racially most distinct varieties of man .

		The scope and man - ner of
M. Finot	ORGANIZATION	's treatment indicates that he regards the matter as difficult , as worthy of detailed and exact analysis .

		In the reviewer 's opinion ,
M. Finot	ORGANIZATION	's chapter covering this ground does not carry con - viction to the unprejudiced reader .

		THE DIAL 279 GERMAN AND AMERICAN READING HABITS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		A possible injustice would seem to be done by the statement , in your issue of
April 1	DATE	-LRB- page 214 -RRB- , that '' German and American reading habits are placed in instructive comparison by recent reports from two libra - ries , one in
Germany	LOCATION	and one in this country , serving communities of about the same size . ''

		You then proceed to show that the
Krupp	ORGANIZATION	Library of
Essen	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, recently circulated 388,001 volumes , and that the public library of Troy , N. Y. , in its latest report gives a cir - culation of 62,000 , or less than one-sixth as many .

		In fairness it should be pointed out that the American library you have chosen for this illustration has a very small circulation in proportion to the population of the city -- less than one volume per capita , whereas a cir - culation of from three to seven volumes per capita is found in many American towns and cities .

		At the last
United States	LOCATION	census , Troy had a population of 60,651 , while
Somerville	LOCATION	and
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, the next larger cities , had populations of 61,643 and 62,059 respectively .

		And the latest reports of the public libraries in these cities showed circulations of 391,783 and 381,818 vol - umes respectively .

		It may also be pertinent to inquire whether the figures given for the circulation of the German library include books used in the library as well as those borrowed for home use , the latter only being included usually in American statistics .

		READING SHAKESPEARE TO CHILDREN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		A review of '' Fingerposts to Children 's Reading , '' in a recent issue of The Dial , takes issue with the author in regard to the reading of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's simpler plays to children nine years old .

		There is , among adults , a wide difference of opinion as to how much children can understand .

		This difference of opinion is due chiefly to the difference in children .

		We are prone to regard children as a species and to base our judgment of the species upon the particular children who may have come under our observation .

		It is cer - tainly as futile to expect every child to be interested in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	at nine years of age as it is to expect every man and woman to be interested in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		Some minds never open to the influence of great poetry , -- and it is often because they have never been accustomed to reading and hearing it .

		But I wish to make a plea for the reading of Shakespeare as soon as the child will listen with real interest .

		I made my own acquaintance with the great dramatist when I was seven ; and I can vividly remember the delight that I had , lying flat on the floor with the great old-fashioned family edition of the '' Complete Works '' open before me .

		My oldest boy listened eagerly to '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' '' Mid -
summer	DATE
Night	TIME	's Dream , '' and '' The Tempest '' at eight , and was able to repeat intelligently the story of each .

		I find in my book of clippings an article taken
several years ago	DATE	from a well-known periodical , in which a mother writes as follows : '' One of my pleasures during the past two winters has been the reading of Shake - speare 's plays to a little gathering of four people -- three of them being my little girl , age nine , and my two boys , ages eleven and seven ... Interesting comments were made as to the way the different characters im - pressed them .

		The older boy listened to all the dramas , not being willing to miss anything .

		The girl missed two or three , and the younger boy listened to parts of all and to every word of the tragedies . ''

		Dr.
Robert CoUyer	PERSON	mentions
Bunyan	PERSON	,
Defoe	PERSON	, Gold - smith ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Bible	LOCATION	, as being his meat and drink in boyhood ; and the influence of these mas - ters is evident in his strong , terse style .

		A great danger to the present generation of children is in the multiplicity of books written for them .

		Many people have come to feel that children need a literature quite distinct from that of grown-ups , and reduced to their supposed level .

		The effects of this '' juvenile '' literature is seen in a weakened mental capacity , and a lack of appreciation of what is high and noble .

		If a boy is hungry for a book we give him Henty instead of Motley , and Lamb 's '' Tales from Shakespeare '' instead of the real thing .

		The '' Tales '' are good in their way , but they were written as hack-work , and it is doubtful whether Charles Lamb , at least , ever took much interest in them or any large part in their composition .

		They are only the plots and contain little of the inspiration which comes even to children from contact with the original dramas .


Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	has said : '' A mere dip into something vast , remote , mysterious , may stir the child 's imagination and set his mind to work on larger lines . '

		Man 's reach is greater than his grasp , else what 's a heaven for ? '

		... We used to think that birds flew because they had wings ; we now surmise that they have wings because they tried to fly . ''

		I heard , not long ago , in the
Forestville	LOCATION	school of this city , a class of fourth-grade children , about ten years of age , reading ''
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream . ''

		They read it with expression and with evident appre - ciation .

		Their answers to questions showed that they understood it , -- not as an adult or as a scholar under - stands it , but as a child who is interested in the fairy story and touched by the melody of the noble verse .

		They read it from a complete edition of the play , not a simplified or emasculated version .

		I heard an eighth - grade class read '' Hamlet , '' recite some of its greatest passages , and discuss its characters with as much interest as a college literature class , and with more originality , if with less profundity .

		These children are not prigs .

		They play as hard and enjoy their play as much as any child , but they love great literature because they have seen and felt its beauties .

		Life not only means more to them now , but it will mean more to them in the days , to come because they have formed a taste which will lead them up and on .

		Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	, the distinguished dramatic critic , has recently expressed himself as opposed to in - troducing
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to children .

		He wishes them to wait until they reach maturity , and then approach the plays as they would approach a new play by
Pinero	PERSON	or
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	.

		This plan doubtless has some advantages .

		Our appreciation of any great work is measured by the mental and spiritual equipment with which we approach it .

		But this equipment does not come to us unsought .

		It is gained by reading and by the cultivation of the spirit .

		What shall the child read in order to enable him to understand Shakespeare at thirty ?

		Not the '' Elsie '' books and
Amanda Douglas	PERSON	, and
Oliver Optic	PERSON	, surely , -- or any of that peptonized milk diet upon which so many are bringing up their families .

		Here , as in every other department of human effort , the child learns to do by doing , -- and I am constrained to believe that the best preparation for understanding
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is Shakespeare .

		A Realistic Study of an Idealist .

		* In a biography from Mr.
Thomas Wright	PERSON	's busy pen the reader has learned to expect a praiseworthy fidness of detail and an agreeable manner of presenting it .

		His '' Life of
Walter Pater	PERSON	'' does not disappoint this expectation .

		Every available source of information apjjears to have been made contributory to his two handsome and lavishly illustrated voliunes ; and if his workmanlike methods are not exactly those of previous writers who have rhapsodized on the life and genius of Pater , the difference is not altogether one to be regretted .

		A characteristic preface -LRB- Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is never content to let the end crown the work -RRB- sets forth , among other things , '' twelve principal errors of commission and omission ` that the author has found in Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's study of Pater in the '' English Men of Letters '' series .

		The earlier biographer has asserted that
Pater	PERSON	's command of language was not the result of much youth - ful writing that never saw the light ; that he wrote no poetry in boyhood except a few humor - ous lines ; that Roman Catholicism in his family was of late date ;
Harbledown	LOCATION	,
Pater	PERSON	's home during his attendance at the
King 's School	ORGANIZATION	, Can - terbury , is not mentioned ; Mr.
Benson	PERSON	repre - sents Pater as popular in those school days ; he makes him '' apt to be reticent about his own interior feelings '' ; he leaves unmentioned five of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's most intimate friends ; he omits
Pater	PERSON	's connection with
St. Austin	LOCATION	's ''
Monk	PERSON	- ery '' ; he makes
Pater	PERSON	's chief interest in early life to have been philosophy , whereas Mr.
Wright	PERSON	says it was English literature ; he avers that
Pater	PERSON	's metaphysical studies did not de - stroy his strong religious instinct ; he does not spice his narrative with anecdotes , and records only two or three uninteresting conversations ; and , twelfthly , he declares that
Pater	PERSON	wrote very few letters .

		That Mr.
Benson	PERSON	was more or less in error in most of these particulars , some of which are really of little importance , is clearly enough proved by Mr.
Wright	PERSON	; but the disputed assertion that Pater was '' apt to be reticent '' still remains a safe one to make , however much he may have occasionally taken his few nearest friends into his confidence .

		Li regard to
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's chief interest in early life , the reader of Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's volumes might fairly * The Life of
Walter Pateb	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		New York :

		maintain that both biographers are in the wrong : the preponderating passion in child - hood and adolescence appears to have been neither philosophy nor English literature , but religion .

		The boy delighted in preaching , both his own and that of another , and repeated in - stances are given of his excessive church-going , up to the time of his only too natural skeptical and atheistical rebound , which had its serious begimiing at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The accusation of not indulging in anecdotes implies , some will say , more praise than blame .

		Another inaccuracy of Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	rectifies has to do with
Jowett	PERSON	's justifiable action in pre - venting Pater 's receiving the coveted proctor - ship that had looked so attractive to him , not because of its duties , which were wholly uncon - genial to the mild-mannered recluse , but because of the additional # 300 or # 350 it would have brought to his pocket .

		Previous writers on Pater liave yielded to the strong temptation to clothe their thoughts in Pateresque language .

		The graceful little trib - ute to him in the '' Contemporary Men of Letters '' series has , among other examples of fine writing , a comment on '' Diaphaneite ' de - claring that '' the whole composition moves with unwonted resiliency and speed , '' -- that is , with unwonted backward-leaping and forward-hasten - ing ; unwonted indeed !

		Mr.
J. R. McQueen	PERSON	, an old friend of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's whom Mr.
Wright	PERSON	is the first to draw on extensively , says upon hav - ing his attention drawn to this sentence : `` I am never surprised at anything I read in these little memoirs about Pater .

		The authors seem to think fine writing makes up for ignorance of facts . ''

		Hence a natural satisfaction in meet - ing with one memoir of Pater that is a plain , straightforward narrative with no attempt to make flowers of rhetoric hide a poverty of fa < it .

		Only once is the author caught in the commis - sion of something like a Paterism , and that is well on in his task .

		This single instance , from the thirty-second chapter , is worth quoting as a curiosity . ''

		He delighted in high altars banked with flowers -- the arum , the narcissus , the jonquil -- innumerable candles forming a pyramid of points of fire , priests in transplendent copes stiff with gold , incense rising in swelling clouds , bell-ringing , geniiflections . ''

		Admirers of Pater maj ' ^ regret that his bio - grapher has seen fit to dig and delve for so many small matters of fact that , as he presents them , do not always redound to
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's credit .

		Yet , much as the Greeks preferred to take their divinities with a plentiful admixture of undivine
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 281 attributes , so it soothes our inferiority to detect human imperfections in our idols .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	certainly shows us a very real and mortal and fallible man in his book , and even declares he might easily have made him more ungodlike stiU ; but considerations for others ' feelings caused the biographer to go through his manu - script again and again , striking out '' everything that seemed likely to give offence , '' and espe - cially omitting '' all Pater 's jibes at religion . ''

		Which are worse , we wonder , the scoffer 's actual jibes or the imaginary ones that his friends are thus left to torment themselves with ?

		But this reticence seems misplaced in denying us , and in making a virtue of denying us , all account of
Pater	PERSON	's home life with his sisters at the house in
Bradmore Road	LOCATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, which he occupied for seventeen years .

		The boy Pater , as pictured by Mr.
Wright	PERSON	, was a very abnormal and by no means prepos - sessing lad .

		He would join in no games , and rev - elled in uncompulsory church-going , shunning most of his mates at school and consorting only with a chosen two , the three being known as '' the triumvirate . ''

		Even from these two inti - mates he allowed himself to be estranged in his Oxford days of religious unbelief .

		The man and scholar is depicted as given to indolence , despite his literary enthusiasm for '' ascesis , '' and as but superficially versed in even his chosen specialties .

		The glamour of his style , we are told , blinds us to the shallowness of his knowl - edge .

		Even as to the outward and physical Pater we are repeatedly reminded of his simian , prematurely-whiskered appearance in youth , and of his heavy , hunch-backed , Dutch ungain - liness throughout life .

		From the chapter on '' Pater at Fifty '' let us quote a few illustrative passages . ''

		In early portraits of him , taken just after the culti - vation of the historical moustache -LSB- whereby hangs a tale -RSB- , he has a rather helpless look , nor was he even then at all a strong man .

		In the portrait taken late in his life by Messrs.
Elliott	PERSON	and
Fry	PERSON	, he appears , though little over fifty , as bald as a coot , while the moustache has grown heavy and truly Bismarckian .

		... In these por - traits he does not seem so very plain , but the evidence of all who knew him is the other way about ; moreover , he himself was well aware of his shortcomings in this re - spect , and regretted them .

		He loved pictures ; but there was one picture which always gave him pain -- the one which he could see any day in the looking-glass ... Owing to his feeble health Pater always looked at least ten years older than his age ; but it was difficult to per - suade him to call in a doctor , and he had little faith in medicines .

		No passage in his favourite Montaigne pleased him more than the
Seigneur	PERSON	's answer to those who urged him to take physic : '
Tarry	PERSON	till such time as I have recovered my health and strength again , that then I may the better be enabled to endure the violence and hazard of their potions . ' ''

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's opinions of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's various works are briefly given , nor does he enter into any long analyses or descriptions of these works .

		It is the more homely and human , not the lit erary and artistic side of Pater , that he chooses chiefly to portray .

		In rating the Renaissance studies well above any of the other writings , even above ''
Marius	PERSON	, '' and in rather disparag - ing the '' Plato and Platonism , '' which even
Jowett	PERSON	felt moved to commend , he seems to be denying to some of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's best work the praise that is its due .

		But other critics , notably and most recently Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, have written appre - ciatively and at length on these matters , although Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's work shows signs of haste , of `` too many irons in the fire . ''

		A revision of his book , now that greater industry has thrown new light on dark places , is to be desired , and indeed is urged by his friendly antagonist .

		But even Mr.
Wright	PERSON	, with aU his diligence and the repeated revision of his manuscript , has not freed his work from every mark of haste or carelessness .

		He persists -LRB- if one may notice so small a matter -RRB- in using '' previous '' as an adverb ; he makes Oscar Wilde '' a boy of seventeen '' in
1874	DATE	, having already -LRB- with Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	-RRB- placed his birth in
1854	DATE	; he misquotes Shakespeare so far as to write the un-Shake - spearean neuter possessive pronoun , and more than once speaks of '' Love 's Labour Lost '' ; he puts '' peroration '' in place of '' exordium '' ; and he , or the printer , is guilty of '' FeuiUet . ''

		With a reckless disregard of physical laws he describes the old town of Spires as lighted at night '' by lamps suspended over chains stretched across the streets , '' -- a rare illustration of
Stockton	PERSON	's '' negative gravity . ''

		Ninety-two -LRB- the title-page modestly says seventy-eight -RRB- plates , including several unfami - liar portraits of Pater and three of Mr.
Richard C. Jackson	PERSON	, the original of ''
Marius	PERSON	, '' are scattered through the volumes ; and there are ten bibliographical and other `` Appendices , '' besides an ample preface .

		The richness of illustrative and sometimes not too closely rele - vant matter more than once comes very near to being padding , -- as in the author 's closing sketches of his subordinate characters .

		The narrative , too , is chopped up into absurdly short chapters , forty-seven in number , for no other apparent purpose than to waste space ; the paper is thick ; and each inserted plate counts as two 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, pages in the pagination .

		The footnotes are superfluously and tiresomely numerous , includ - ing as they do explanations of the obvious , and not a few cross-references such as diligent edi - tors of ancient texts love to send scampering like so many little barking dogs across the bottom of their pages .

		Justice to the Railroads .

		* The attention of the people of this nation has been concentrated for a year or more upon our railroads and their relation to public interests .

		The thought and purpose of the American people moves from one extreme to another , and this is as true in the field of railroad criticism as in any other .

		Fifty years ago every com - munity went out and met an intending railroad with a brass band , the freedom of the city , choice locations , right of way without compensa - tion , and , in a general way , a chromo thrown in .

		Within the last few years we have swung to the other extreme , and it has been difficijlt to find in the public mind any good thing that could be said of railroads .

		Their whole manage - ment has been bad , and nothing that might be done to restrain them would be considered in - appropriate .

		Even the
Inter-State Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	has caught this public spirit at times , and has demanded powers that might not be wisely administered .

		The legislatures of the various states have been keen on the trail of the railroad , and within the last few months some fifteen legislatures have passed bills fixing a maximum rate of
two cents	MONEY	a mile for pas - senger transportation .

		In consequence of all this panic , and all this grim determination to down the railroad , railroad men have been ask - ing themselves how they might best take stock of the future .

		Sensitive credit has felt the in - fluence , and loans that were easy to negotiate • The Working of Railroads .

		for the purpose of railroad improvement a year or two ago are difficidt to make to-day .

		The looker-on in
Vienna	LOCATION	can not help asking whether this is quite as it should be ; whether a great industry that has done so much to develop the resources of this nation , and to make the nation great , not only industrially but poli - tically , can be as bad as has been represented , or deserve punishments as dire as have been urged .

		At such a time any literature that will fairly present the history of the railroad in con - nection with the growth of this nation , and also describe the railroad in its construction and operation , can not help but bring about a better condition of things , at least in public sentiment .

		Three years ago Professor
Emery R. Johnson	PERSON	produced an admirable little treatise entitled ''
American Railroad Transportation	ORGANIZATION	, '' which for the first time put within the covers of one book an adequate account of the railroad system of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Close on his heels came Mr.
Pratt	PERSON	, the railway correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' who in his book on ''
Ameri	PERSON	- can Railways '' gave the impartial view of an outsider .

		And now we have a work on `` The Working of Railroads , '' by Mr.
Logan G. McPherson	PERSON	, a very good supplement to the two previously mentioned , as in a most scientific and carefid manner it presents the various func - tions of railroading in their details and in their inter-relation as well as in their relations to the public and the state .

		In the first chapter of Mr.
Logan	PERSON	's book , on `` The Transportation Function , ' he shows most vividly how localization of industry has been made possible in this country by the expan - sion of our railroad system , a localization which has been essential to the success of our indus - trial growth .

		In the next chapter he takes up '' Construction and Operation . ''

		Under the latter term he discusses somewhat in detail the three great departments involved in maintenance of way , maintenance of equipment , and trans - portation .

		One can not read further than through this chapter , however ignorant one may have been before , without beginning to grasp the tremendous forces that are involved in the building and equipping of a railroad .

		The third chapter is devoted to that subject around which the battle with the railroad has been waged during the last three years -- that is , traffic .

		Under this subject the author discusses the car - riage of persons and the carriage of goods by express , by mail , or by the ordinary freight shipment .

		The complex subject of rates is presented somewhat at length , and the different

		THE DIAL 28S principles are brought out that are involved in the basing point as used in
America	LOCATION	, the taper - ing system as used in
Australia	LOCATION	, and the Zone System as used in
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		This chapter will be good i-eading for those who , following the magnetic lead of Mr.
Stickney	PERSON	, have come to the conclusion that rate-making is an easy thing and that not much technical and expert knowledge is necessary for its performance .

		The more formal and technical portion of the raUroad business is discussed in a chapter on '' Accounting and Statistics . ''

		Then in the fifth chapter the author rises into the larger field of strategy , in the discussion of '' Financial and Executive Administration . ''

		The relation - ship of the railroad to those whose capital is used in the form of stocks or bonds , and on the other hand toward the financing agencies of Wall Street , is presented in a very business - like way .

		More than that , the financing of a railroad , not merely when it is in a prosperous condition , but in disastrous times when it passes into the hands of a receiver , is also discussed .

		Two very important chapters are on ''
Correla	PERSON	- tion '' and '' Integration . ''

		The first has to do with what might be called the oiling of the system , by means of which everything works harmoniously and without friction .

		The second is concerned with what is familiarly known in the industrial world as standardization .

		This is developed in the most interesting way with reference to construction and equipment , signal - ing , ticketing , and the carrying out of every form of business on a national system rather than a local and diverse one .

		The final chap - ter , on the '' Relation to the Public and the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' is partly historical in its discussion of pooling and the
Inter-State Commerce	ORGANIZATION	Com - mission , and partly critical in the suggestions which are brought out in connection with the
Hepburn	PERSON	biU and other bills that resulted in the drastic legislation of
1906	DATE	.

		The whole is presented in an unprejudiced and impartial way , and the book is the most important con - tribution to its branch of the subject that has yet been made .

		It would pay the railroads to buy a million copies of this book and place it in the hands of the public for educational pur - poses .

		If the whole industrial life of the nation , which is so inextricably interlaced with the rail - road system of the country , is not to be violently disturbed , it is very desirable that such know - ledge as this book contains be given to the man on the street in regard to the merits and demerits of the railroad problem , y t tt ^

		The Story of L < a Sal , t.e 's Last Voyage .

		* The present writer has had occasion to review , within the last few years , several reprints of important books of travel bearing on the early history of
America	LOCATION	, and is glad to avail himself of this additional opportunity for commending the enterprise and patriotism of American pub - lishers in this regard .

		As a Canadian , he can do this without any suggestion of national glori - fication .

		The voyages and travels of
Marquette	LOCATION	,
Hennepin	LOCATION	,
La Salle	LOCATION	, Lahontan , to mention no others , are of as much interest and value to Canadians as to Americans , and
Canada	LOCATION	has been laid under a debt of gratitude to American publishers for reprinting these rare volumes .

		Among them we now have a new edition of
Joutel	ORGANIZATION	's famous Journal of La Salle 's last voy - age , with valuable historical notes , etc. , by Mr.
Heniy Reed Stiles	PERSON	.

		Joutel , it will be remembered , accompanied La Salle on that memorable voyage of
1684	DATE	, so promising in its opening and so disastrous in its end .

		He was a fellow-townsman of La Salle 's , and seems to have accompanied the expedition at
La Salle	ORGANIZATION	's personal request .

		His duties were to superintend all matters pertaining to the provisioning , sheltering , and general care and comfort of the settlers whom La Salle confidently expected to become the nucleus of a prosperous French colony in
Louisiana	LOCATION	. ''

		His services to the enterprise , '' says Dr.
Stiles	PERSON	in his Biograph - ical Note on Joutel , '' as they are simply and circumstantially narrated in this Journal , and corroborated by contemporary evidence , prove that La Salle 's choice of him as the ' man of affairs ' of the expedition was well-founded and fortunate .

		Practical , methodical , resourceful in every emergency , tactful in his dealings with all the members of the heterogeneous company with whom he was associated , and inflexibly loyal to his Chief ,
Joutel	PERSON	fuUy proved his worth . ''

		Charlevoix met Joutel in
1723	DATE	, many years after his return from
America	LOCATION	, and speaks of him as a very upright man , and evidently the only trustworthy member of La Salle 's party .

		Parkman , judging Joutel merely by the internal evidence of his Journal , reached an equally favorable conclusion as to his sense , intelligence , and candor .

		284 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, appallingly adverse circumstances , and his death at the hands of his own men , is of the utmost worth .

		It is safe to say that of the several narratives of this expedition
Joutel	PERSON	's is far and away the best , -- in fact , the only trustworthy account we have of the voyage in its entirety .

		Joutel has been criticised for his alleged acquiescence in the murder of La SaUe , and for his subsequent connivance in the concealment of the fact of
La Salle	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		On these points Dr.
Stiles	PERSON	's opinion is interesting .

		He says : '' No shadow of complicity in the murder of La Salle attaches to Joutel .

		That he did not more strongly assert himself in the critical emergencies which suc - ceeded that tragical event , was due , probably , to a combination of circumstances .

		The mutineers who had accomplished the deed were overwhelmingly dominant , and the lives of the whole party tremWed in the balance .

		Joutel was no coward ; but the situation in which they ' found themselves called for the exercise of that pru - dence which is of ttimes the better part of valor .

		Neither was he ambitious ; so that when the little band of seven who sought to separate themselves from the assassins finally started upon their long and perilous journey toward the North , we find , as if by common consent , that the
Abb	ORGANIZATION	^
Cavelier	PERSON	-LRB- La Salle 's brother -RRB- figures as the nominal leader .

		Undoubtedly this was due partly to the respect felt by
Joutel	PERSON	for the aged ecclesiastic by virtue of his sacred office , as well as by his own life - long association , at
Rouen	LOCATION	, with the family of
Cavelier	PERSON	; and also by motives of policy in thus securing for the party the prestige of being headed by a La Salle -- a ' name to conjure with ' amid the savage tribes through whom they must pass . ''

		Thus far , most of us will probably be inclined to agree with Dr.
Stiles	PERSON	in clearing
Joutel	PERSON	's character from any serious fault ; but it is not so easy to acquiesce in his somewhat lukewarm defence of
Joutel	ORGANIZATION	's connivance in the conceal - ment of the fact of
La Salle	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		No doubt Dr.
Stiles	PERSON	is quite right in saying that the de - ception originated with the Abbe
Cavelier	PERSON	, '' who desired thereby to get possession of property which might otherwise have been seized by creditors of his deceased brother ... La Salle '' ; but as this is no defense of
Cavalier	ORGANIZATION	's conduct , so is it no defense of
Joutel	ORGANIZATION	's conduct to say that his connivance was due to respect for Cave - lier 's cloth and family .

		The concealment was outrageous , and
Joutel	PERSON	must in this respect share
Cavelier	PERSON	's well-earned blame , whatever his motives may have been .

		Whatever punishment
Cavelier	PERSON	deserved , he does not seem to have got it in this world , for , according to
Parkman	LOCATION	, he lived to a good old age , and died rich , '' having inherited a large estate after his return from America '' -- La Salle 's evidently .

		This edition of
Joutel	ORGANIZATION	's Journal is so admir - able in most respects that it seems ungratefid to offer any criticism .

		At the same time it does appear somewhat regrettable that in select - ing the text for it the most complete one avail - able was not taken .

		The text adopted is that of the English translation -LRB- 1714 -RRB- of the
Paris	LOCATION	edition of
1713	DATE	.

		We need not go further than Mr.
Griffin	PERSON	's Bibliography -LRB- p. 230 -RRB- to learn that this edition , '' methodiz 'd '' by the
Sieur de Mitchell	PERSON	, is but an abridged and modified version of the narrative , and that
Joutel	PERSON	com - plained that changes had been made by the editor in retouching the work for publication .

		On the other hand ,
Margry	PERSON	in his ''
Decouver	PERSON	- tes et etablissements des Fran ^ ais , '' vol .

		iii. , pp. 89-534 , published the Journal in its entirety and integrity .

		A translation of the Margry copy would have had to be specially made , it is true , while the other was ready to hand ; but how much more satisfactory it would have been to have had a translation of
Joutel	ORGANIZATION	's Journal as he wrote it , rather than of a version that is , to say the least , open to suspicion !

		Taking the text as it stands , one can not too highly commend the present edition .

		Follow - ing the Historical Introduction , and the
Biogra	PERSON	- phical Note on Joutel by Dr.
Stiles	PERSON	, we have , first , the original title-page -LRB- of the
London	LOCATION	edi - tion , 1714 -RRB- in facsimile ; then the French Book - seller to the Reader , and the Preface written by
Sieur de Mitchell	PERSON	, as they appeared in the En - glish edition ; then the text of the Journal , with notes and annotations by Dr.
Stiles	PERSON	; fol - lowed by '' Remainder of Letter by he who revis 'd this Journal , being sequel to same , '' and Letters Patent granted by the
King of France to M. Crozat	ORGANIZATION	.

		Finally , we have Mr.
Griffin	PERSON	's very full Bibliography , and the Index .

		A heliotype reproduction of
Gudebrod	ORGANIZATION	's statue of La Salle , made for the
Louisiana	LOCATION	Purchase Exposition , is used as a frontispiece ; and at the end of the volume will be found a reproduction in facsimile of
Joutel	ORGANIZATION	's map originally published in the
Paris	LOCATION	edition of
1713	DATE	.

		Mr.
Griffin	PERSON	's Bibliography is by no means the least valuable portion of the book .

		It is , of course , much more than a bibliography of La Salle ; rather , in fact , a bibliography of the discovery and exploration of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		Prepared for another purpose , some little time ago , it only comes down to the year
1882	DATE	, and consequently omits a good deal of important material published since that time .

		For instance , one finds no mention of Winsor 's '' Narrative and Critical History of America '' or of his '' Cartier to Frontenac , '' both import - ant in their bearing on the discovery and ex - ploration of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	VaUey .

		Similarly ,

Fiske	PERSON	's '' Discovery of
America	LOCATION	, '' or Thwaitess monumental edition of '' The Jesuit Relations , '' or his editions of Hennepin and Lahontan .

		Neither do we find Bandeliers '' The Gilded Man , '' in which new light is thrown on La Salle 's last voyage , and on his death ; nor
Girouard	PERSON	's ''
Lake St. Louis	LOCATION	, '' which bears on an earlier period of
La Salle	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		No mention is made of the quite considerable liter - ature that has grown up about the voyages of
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	and Chouart , especially the third voy - age .

		On this voyage , according to one group of historians , they reached the
Mississippi	LOCATION	-- first of white men ; according to another group , they did nothing of the kind .

		Whether they did or not , the controversy is too important to be omitted from a Bibliography of the Discovery and Exploration of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		It included papers in the Transactions of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	of

Benjamin Suite	ORGANIZATION	, Judge Prud ` homme , and Dr.

Ontario	LOCATION	in

S. J. Dawson	PERSON	's Memorandum on early maps , pp. 325-330 of the same book .

		These omissions are noted , not in any spirit of criticism of Mr.

		International , IjAw in the
Russo	PERSON	- Japanese War .

		* The late war between
Russia	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	brought out a crop of books , some in French others in English , dealing with the various questions of international law raised during this conflict .

		Some of the controversies thus raised , such for example as those relating to the use of wireless telegraphy and the employment of floating mines , were both new and unique .

		New applications were also given of old and well established principles of international law , * The International Law and Diplomacy op the
Russo	PERSON	- Japanese War .

		By
Amos S. Hershey	PERSON	.

		New York : The Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		and new precedents established which will doubtless afPect the future conduct of war .

		The most scholarly , exhaustive , and illuminating study of the
Kusso	PERSON	- Japanese conflict from the standpoint of international law and diplomacy has been made by
Professor Hershey of the University of Indiana	ORGANIZATION	.

		It makes a fitting sup - plement to Dr.
Asakawa	PERSON	's excellent work en - titled '' The Russo-Japanese Conflict , '' which appeared a year or two ago , and which , like the present work , is indispensable to the student of Russo-Japanese relations prior to the treaty of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.

		A portion of the ground covered by Professor
Hershey	PERSON	had already been occupied by Professor
T. J. Lawrence	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	in his '' War and Neutrality in the East , '' pub - lished in the
summer of 1904	DATE	, a few months after the outbreak of hostilities .

		Professor
Lawrence	PERSON	's book , owing to its early publication , necessarily left luitouched some of the import - ant questions which were raised during the latter months of the war and , besides , the con - troversies with which it deals are treated with less thoroughness by Professor
Lawrence	PERSON	than by Dr.
Hershey	PERSON	.

		A bulky volume by two English barristers .

		Smith and
Sibley	PERSON	, published a year ago , undertook to cover the entire field , but it is full of gross inaccuracies , and is over - laden with extraneous matter .

		After a sixty-page review of the causes of the ^ -LRB- var , based largely but by no means entirely upon Dr.
Asakawa	PERSON	's work .

		Professor
Hershey	PERSON	reviews the steps leading up to the outbreak of hostilities and examines the Russsian charge of Japanese treachery in beginning hostilities in advance of a formal declaration of war .

		Pro- fessor
Hershey	ORGANIZATION	's conclusion on this point is that to which every impartial student must come -- namely , that
Japan	LOCATION	's action was neither unpre - cedented nor contrary to strict international ethics -LRB- p. 67 -RRB- .

		With regard to Japanese vio - lation of Korean neutrality , however , he finds
Japan	LOCATION	guilty of a violation of one of the most fundamental rules of international law , -- the right of every independent state to remain neu - tral during war among other nations and to have its neutrality respected by all belligerents -LRB- p. 71 -RRB- .

		With regard to the treatment of enemy sub - jects in each others territory at the outbreak of hostilities , he thinks the conduct of both bellig - erents , although not strictly illegal , was far from being liberal , particularly when compared with the liberal policy of the
United States	LOCATION	govern - ment during the Spanish - American War as that policy was embodied in the proclamations of President
McKinley	PERSON	and in the decisions of the 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	,
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- pp. 295-7 -RRB- .

		The Japanese were repeatedly accused of disregarding the obligations of the
Hague	LOCATION	and
Geneva Conven	ORGANIZATION	- tions by firing upon Red Cross trains and hospital ships , while the Russians in turn were accused of withholding from the Japanese in - formation concerning Japanese prisoners , and of using '' dumdum '' bullets in several engage - ments .

		Each accused the other of bombarding undefended coast towns -LRB- p. 311 -RRB- , and of neglect - ing sick and wounded soldiers held as captives , but the evidence available is not sufficient to convict either of flagrant abuses under any of these counts .

		Mr.
Hershey	PERSON	's conclusion is that while there were a number of alleged violations of the rules of civilized warfare , especially on the part of
Russia	LOCATION	, these rules were on the whole fairly well observed by both belligerents .

		The violations proved were few and unimportant , considering the magnitude of the military opera - tions .

		In this respect Dr.
Hershey	PERSON	says the Russo-Japanese War ranks as high perhaps as any in history , with the possible exception of the Spanish-American conflict -LRB- p. 323 -RRB- .

		Aside from
Japan	LOCATION	's violation of Korean neutrality and the cutting out of the '' Ryeshetelni '' from the harbor of Chefoo , she showed remarkable con - sideration for the rights of neutrals .


Russia	LOCATION	, on the other hand , was guilty of repeated and flagrant violations of neutral rights .

		The seizures by the volunteer cruisers , the ''
Peter	PERSON	- burg ' and the ''
Smolensk	LOCATION	, '' the detention of the German mail steamer ``
Prinz Heinrich	PERSON	, '' the arrest of the P. and O. liner ''
Malacca	LOCATION	, '' the sinking of the '' Thea '' and the '' Knight Commander , '' and the unwarranted extension of the doctrine of contraband were some of the more important instances of infringements upon neutral rights .

		The inclusion of coal , naphtha , cotton , and food stuffs in the list of vmcondi - tional contraband , and the adoption of the rule that the destination instead of the use to which such articles were to be put determined their liability to capture , were not only contrary to the most enlightened rules of modern warfare but , so far as coal was concerned , were contrary to Russian practice .

		The Russian rule made no distinction , for example , between a cargo of anthracite destined for
Nagasaki	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- the seat of the
Japanese Navy Yard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and a cargo of soft coal destined for the cotton factories of
Osaka	LOCATION	.

		If destined for a belligerent port they were liable to capture irrespective of whether the intended use were innocent or hostile .

		This rule was utterly at variance with that embodied in the American order of
Jime 20 , 1898	DATE	, which treated coal as contraband only when destined to a naval station , a port of call , or a ship of the enemy , and also with the provisions of the
U. S.	ORGANIZATION	naval code which treated the other articles mentioned as contraband only when intended for the use of the military or naval forces of the enemy .

		The Russian decrees with regard to contraband called out vigorous protests from the Amer - ican and English governments , and
Russia	LOCATION	was finally forced to modify the objectionable rule until it conformed more nearly to the American doctrine .

		One of the new and unprecedented questions of international law raised during the
Russo	PERSON	- Japanese War related to the rights of war cor - respondents and the use of wireless telegraphy in neutral waters and on the high seas .

		The controversy was raised by a Russian decree an - nouncing the intention of the Russian govern - ment of treating as spies newspaper correspond - ents who were found making use of wireless telegraph apparatus within the zone of military operations , and as lawful prize any vessel pro- vided with such apparatus .

		It was well known that the order was directed against the corre - spondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' who was then cruising in the Yellow Sea on a dispatch boat equipped with a De Forest wireless telegraph outfit .

		The present rules of warfare contain no provision covering such cases , and the mat - ter should and probably will receive the atten - tion of the forthcoming
Hague Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		A somewhat similar question was raised by the action of the Russians in installing a wireless telegraph instrument in the neutral port of Chefoo for the transmission of messages from
Port Arthur	LOCATION	during the investment of that place by the Japanese .

		Upon representation the Chinese authorities , realizing their neutral obligations , demolished the wireless station in
August , 1904	DATE	.

		Another new question was raised by the alleged conduct of the Russians in sowing the strait of
Pechili	LOCATION	with submarine mines which floated into the open seas , con * stituting grave danger to neutral shipping .

		There seems to have been some doubt whether such a proceeding was the result of deliberate action on the part of the Russians or merely the result of carelessness , but in either case the Rus - sian authorities were guilty of a gross violation of the rules of civilized warfare .

		The
Institute of International Law	ORGANIZATION	, at its last session -LRB- Sep - tember ,
1906	DATE	-RRB- , adopted a series of resolutions relative to wireless telegraphy and submarine mines in war , and the coming
Hague Conference	ORGANIZATION	will doubtless take some action on the subject .

Hershey	PERSON	are `` The North Sea Incident '' which was terminated happily through the employment of an
International Commission of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	in accordance with the provisions of one of the Hague Conventions ; '' The Hay Note and Chinese Neutrality '' ; `` Belligerent Warships in Neutral Ports '' ' ; the rules of war - fare adopted by both belligerents ; and '' The Relations of

		* Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	has published his opin - ions on the labor question in a sensible '' letter to a labour friend , '' in which he urges a policy at once conservative and progressive .

		His argument for positions taken is rather an appeal to familiar facts than an induction from fresh investigations .

		The interest of the letter lies in its formulation of the judgment of a historical student who is familiar with many aspects of life and is reasonably free from bias .

		The preface to '' In the Fire of the Heart '' fore - warns the critic of the dire consequences of an unfavorable review .

		This creates an unnecessary prejudice against a well-meaning effort to outline a social policy which is a kind of tamed socialism .

		Having ticketed the volume we know what we may in general expect : municipal management of public utilities , initiative , referendum , and recall , opportu - nities , of culture for the people .

		Articles in mag - azines and newspapers have made these ideas common property and they have been treated with greater care and accuracy in numerous treatises .

		The simple reassertion of opinions is not proof of their soundness , and the reader can easily discover that the arguments on one side are here urged with - out much consideration of those on the other side .

		With the ethical ideals of the author it would be difficult to take issue .

		With good sense , wide learning , and ripe experience the eminent statistician opens to young theologians that world of conflict in which ethical and religious principles are put to severest strain .

		Most of the lectures are historical in char - acter , and it is by this road that men are induced to come into the best temper for considering problems where '' self the wavering balance shakes . ''

		It is a little provoking , however , to break off conversation after a few paragraphs on so profound a theme , when we know the reserves of knowledge are so vast , and where it is impossible to present all sides in the compass of a popular lecture .

		Nevertheless the earnest students must have gained a clearer view and a saner judgment from listening to our veteran master in the economic field .

		Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	has made familiar and sympathetic acquaintance with thieves in his `` Autobiography of a Thief '' and has introduced us to a rude labor leader in
Anton	LOCATION	, the hero of `` The Spirit of Labor . ''

		The first impression is disagreeable and even repul - sive , when we are carried bodily into the society of organized labor as depicted in these strong chapters .

		Centuries of neglect on the part of the privileged , decades of recent antagonisms , crowded dwellings and shops training multitudes to communistic ideals , bear fruit in revenge , revolt , and clash with the con - ventionalities of the world of business managers , including their churches .

		A few generations of common schools , with compidsory education and child labor laws , and the leaders of workingmen will not resemble
Anton	PERSON	in vulgar and ungrammat - ical language , though they may not be so pictur - esque as he .

		That the trade union movement can use such a man is obvious enough , but he is hardly a typical character .

		Only the life of a tramp and of early hardship , with bigoted teachers , could pro- duce just such a spu-it , and the wonder is that it retains so much that is sound and fair .

		It is not quite safe for comfortable people to be ignorant of the way in which some hundreds of thousands of discontented neighbors look at life .

		This book is an attempt , '' says the preface to '' The Labour Movement in
Australasia	LOCATION	, '' '' to de - scribe the history of the political labour party of
Australasia	LOCATION	.

		I have tried to write from the stand - point of an agnostic in social creeds . ''

		Certainly the facts are set down with candor and impartiality .

		Some very excellent and inspiring writers have gone to the British colonies of the
South Pacific	LOCATION	for proofs of their radical theories , and the reader is always a little uncertain whether the very moral earnestness of the advocates of progress does not obscure their vision of reality .

		Even in counting stars or blood corpuscles the scientific observer must beware of having theoretic expectations , and the personal equation must always be checked by the sober look of those who have no hypothesis to prove .

		In the book before us the observations seem to be set down with singular fidelity to plain truth and to deserve confidence .


Australasia	LOCATION	is an interesting world and a large world .

		Its people and institu - tions have attracted the attention of social students because certain novel experiments have been tried with socialistic ideas .

		The minimum wage doctrine has there found embodiment in law ; industrial arbi - tration has passed from discussion into action ; the government has gone into business like any ordinary corporation .

		All these radical measures have grown naturally out of the situation , but it is too early to sing the praises of a fighter whUe he is still in the throes of struggle with a powerful adversary , and equally premature now to foretell the triumph of government ownership in far-away
Australasia	LOCATION	.

		That the country has been prosperous no one can deny , but that may be from the natural advantages of the land and people and not from government interference in industry and commerce .

		That the labor party has made serious mistakes seems quite obvious ; but our business corporations have not always been successful , and many of the great man - agers have proved costly servants of the confiding stockholders and general public .

		It is refreshing to find an author who is willing to let the facts speak for themselves without playing tricks on credulous partisans and furnishing food to prejudice ; and in this interesting volume the author seems to be hon - estly trying to place the reader in position to form his own judgment in presence of the actual situation without too much prompting as to the conclusions he ought to derive from the survey .

		The time is not yet ripe to speak the last word on the minimum wage , and very able representative economists think it will be impossible to fix a stand - ard below which wages shall not go .

		But the hour has come for an earnest and careful consideration of the central ethical problem of economic life : viz. , is a standard of community obligation discoverable , or must the wages of the unskilled workmen con - tinue to be determined by the battle of competing forces ?

		It is obvious that if we question the morality of the rate fixed by competition we must find another method of measuring social duty .

		In Mr.
Ryan	PERSON	's '' A Living Wage '' these questions are clearly and cogently discussed .

		The ecclesiastical bias is frankly revealed , but it does not seem to affect the value of the reasoning process , and nothing rests merely on church authority .

		The starting point is the assertion that every man has a right to live a decent human life by the product of his labor , and that those who control the materials and the instruments of pro- duction are the persons primarily responsible for paying a living wage .

		Since the entire community ultimately shares this responsibility , the employer should be compelled by law to pay a living wage , and pensions should secure a suitable income for old age when earning power ceases .

		If the fundamental principle is accepted and proves to be practically enforceable then society has a measure of the mini - mum duty of the employer and of the state ; and this measure defines the beginning of poor relief as well as of wages , insurance , and pensions .

		This doctrine is so at war with our individualistic modes of thought and the traditions of legislation and judi - cial decisions that its advocates must not hope for its speedy and easy reception .

		The writer of this book has brought together in clear and readable form most of the essential arguments which have been offered for his contention ; and he has supplied to trade unions and advocates of advanced social legislation very telling arguments for their position .

		It is difficult to see how any honest man who has hitherto been comfortable in conscience in the pay - ment of starvation wages , on the ground that a com - petitive or customary rate is also a just rate , can retain his self-satisfaction and complacency after reading this argument .

		Perhaps the best way to peace of mind is not to read such books at all , and that is the path frequently followed .

		The historian Green was perhaps the first to consider the social side of English history important enough to write about , and his history is still the best all-around account .

		However , to meet popular demand , short histories of social conditions alone have from time to time appeared .

		One of the latest and best of these is
M. B. Synge	PERSON	's '' A Short ` History of Social Life in
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes	PERSON	`` & Co -RRB- .

		In twenty-eight short chapters , covering about four hundred pages , the author gives us a narrative of much interest and considerable value .

		It is , as the author states , '' a book of detail , '' about the life of English men , women , and children , -- their homes , their dress , manners , and etiquette , their religious and superstitious customs , their food , their health , their occupations , crimes and punishment , and many other such matters .

		The arrangement is somewhat peculiar ; no topic is treated fully in one place , but the chapters correspond to the generally accepted divisions of political history , and for each of these periods the author gives an account of the more important social forces .

		This method , while not allowing unity of treatment , makes the book useful to read in connection with a purely political account .

		There are no references to authorities , no bibliog - raphies , and no footnotes ; for all of these omis - sions the average reader will be thankful and the student regretful .

		The author treats the entire subject as one of development , advance , and better - ment , and does it very successfully .

		The work is evidently based on wide reading and research .

		A feature is the frequent quotation from original sources of apt anecdotes , appropriate incidents , etc. .

		One quotation , from an old book on etiquette , advises that '' if you eat with another , turn over the nicest pieces to him , '' and never touch more than three fingers to the meat ; another , from a physician 's handbook , advises young doctors to '' tell the patient you will by God 's help cure him , but inform his friends that the case is a serious one ... suppose you know nothing , say there is an obstruction of the liver ... especially use the word ` obstruction ' for patients do not understand it , which is important '' ; from a similar book is quoted a prescription for that complaint now known as ''
spring	DATE	fever '' : '' Shave the patient 's head and anoint it with honey ; the flies will so worry him that he will continually strike out at them , which will cure his lethargy . ''

		Each chapter has much of such matter well incorporated into the text .

		For the 407 pages there is an index containing 74 entries ; it is little less than insulting to the reader to put such an index in a book of this sort .

		For readers ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ author succeeds in

		This feat has been accomplished by
Abb	ORGANIZATION	^
Felix Klein	PERSON	, Professor at the
Catholic Institute of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, already favorably known to American readers through his book on '' The Land of the Strenuous Life , '' published last year .

		Professor
Klein	PERSON	has had the ingenious idea of writing a book in the character of a young Amer - ican student who is making his first visit to
France	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- La D ^ courverte du
Vieux Monde	PERSON	, par un Etudiant de
Chicago	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		From this vantage-point he is able to describe attractive regions of that country , and to discuss entertainingly some of the great problems now confronting the French nation without shocking the patriotic pride and sensitiveness of his com - patriots .

		As Professor
Klein	PERSON	has proved himself a sympathetic and careful observer , both at home and in this country , he has been able , while doing full justice to the many admirable sides of modern French civilization , to point out numerous incon - sistencies and absurdities in contemporary social and political organization .

		But whether he takes us to
Paris	LOCATION	or to
Rouen	LOCATION	, to
Auvergne	LOCATION	or to Le Quercy , his method is the same .

		By vivid and often charming descriptions , he acquaints us with the physical nature of the region ; while by making his various charac - ters express their opinions , or by his own reflections , he eloquently discusses the problems of the day .

		The lack of initiative and ambition found among young Frenchmen of good birth , education , and 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ability , deplored as a serious menace by contem - porary writers , is illustrated by
Bernard de Pujol	PERSON	, while
Abb	ORGANIZATION	^
Lagrange	LOCATION	represents the broad-minded and thoughtful members of the French clergy .

		Of course the book has a special interest for readers who have lived in
France	LOCATION	, who have been impressed by certain sides of French life , and who are familiar with the various leaders of French thought , some of whom express their views in the book under an assumed name .

		Even where we can not agree with the author 's conclusions -- for example , in regard to the Protestant Church -- we must admire and endorse his usually sane and fair attitude toward the problems he treats .

		The career of
Auguste Rodin	PERSON	is an ex - iTnu ^ oT emplification of Victor
Hugo	PERSON	's words : ''
Ami	PERSON	, cache ta vie et rdpands tes OBUvres . ''

		If few biographers have had as simple materials at their command as were within reach of Mr.
Frederick Lawton	PERSON	while he was preparing his `` Life and Work of Auguste Rodin '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , stUl fewer have understood as well as he the art of extracting from such materials as they possessed every item of information that would serve more fully to illustrate the genius and the career of the person they commemorated , or to display more clearly the blended or conflicting lights arid shades of his character .

		Unlike most noted persons , the sculptor 's record is not '' buried under a mountain of heterogeneous record '' ; his life has been modest , simple , and retired .

		Rodin occupies a unique posi - tion among the sculptors of his time .

		His present biographer , without attempting to establish any exact and definite precedence for his achievement over that of all others , asserts that his name will rank in the f utiire among the foremost of the great masters of the statuary art .


England	LOCATION	, quick to rec - ognize eminence in foreigners , has honored
Rodin	PERSON	with the Presidency of the
International Society of Sculptors	ORGANIZATION	, Painters , and Gravers , succeeding Whist - ler .

		Rodin was born in
Paris	LOCATION	on the
12th of November , 1840	DATE	, and showed early ability as an artist .

		From this early talent sprang a style aimed at most of his brethren , and the hostility of sculptors of the orthodox school has been through - out , and is still , only too patent .

		If
Rodin	PERSON	's posi - tion during the past few years , as Vice-President of the ''
Societe Nationale	ORGANIZATION	des Beaux Arts , '' has en - abled him to give more weighty utterance to his own convictions , these are none the less considered by the majority of French sculptors as rank heterodoxy . ''

		They will not understand my realism , '' says
Rodin	PERSON	. ''

		For them sculpture should not endeavor to rep - resent flesh and blood and bone , since marble and bronze do not possess the colours which in painting create the illusion of life .

		I , on the contrary , claim that the sculptor can reach the same result if he will reproduce with fidelity and intensity the model he has before him .

		It is with his eyes fixed on life that he must work ; and his art will be able to rep - resent it entire , when he has observed sufficiently and has sufficiently trained his fingers . ''

		Mr.
Law	PERSON	- ton 's well-illustrated volume is a work of close and cogent reasoning , eminently fair and candid , and must promote a better understanding of the relative positions of representatives of the plastic art on questions which seem to involve serious but not necessarily irreconcilable antagonism .

		In President
Hadley	PERSON	's ''
Baccalau	PERSON	- Xlrfutni '' ^ `` ^ ^ `` Addresses , and Other Talks ou Kindred Themes '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- there is a tone of fellowship and sympathy , a recognition of the common collegiate and human tie uniting him with his hearers , that must have made these short and unstudied discourses appeal with force to the audience addressed .

		That they did so appeal is partly proved by the request that they should be gathered together in book form for permanent pre - servation .

		They dwell , very properly and naturally , on the grand fundamentals of character and citizen - ship , of individual and social virtue , and , in the large wholesome sense , of piety and religion .

		That the latter can be taught as a thing apart is of course emphatically denied . ''

		I believe , '' says the author , '' that both in school life and in after life the moral training and the secular training must be so inter - woven that each becomes a part of the other . ''

		A return to something like the old system of a reg ^ ar college curriculum is favored . ''

		Our college grad - uates of recent years , '' we read , '' find that indis - criminate election of studies has meant intellectual dissipation .

		In short , we have learned that the sugar-plums of education do not furnish a strength - ening intellectual diet . ''

		The greater importance of being than doing , of character than visible perform - ance , is emphasized ; and there is good augury in the writer 's assurance that '' our country still aspires to be led by men who shall prove their claim for leadership , not by concrete material achievements , but by their character and their ideals . ''

		The simple , straightforward style of these addresses is engaging , even to the reader in his closet ; to the hearers of the spoken word it must have been much more so .

		A slight error -LRB- of the types , probably -RRB- gives us '' Ex - cept the Lord keep the house , '' etc. ; and another inaccuracy , less chargeable to the long-snff ering com - positor , is the assigning of Mr.

		Professor
Fleming	PERSON	devotes about 130 out of 455 pages .

		The chapter on Educational Problems leaves the impression that the carpet-baggers deserve less credit for the public schools than some have been disposed to give them .

		Even these were used for peculation , as the report of the superintendent of education in
Louisiana	LOCATION	in -RSB- 871 will show .

		How they were used to influence political action is revealed in the catechism which followed the arithmetic lesson in some of the
Florida	LOCATION	schools , the whole object of which was to inculcate loyalty to the Republican party and inspire hatred of Democrats .

		The church , which plays so important a part in the social life of the South , receives due attention in this volume .

		The chapter on Social and Industrial Conditions throws much light on the relation of the races , the real condition of the negro , and the difficulties of industrial reorganization .

		Each chapter is preceded by explanatory notes by the editor .

		To anyone who wishes to make a thorough study of Reconstruction , these volumes wUl be invaluable .

		They siipply most of the essentials of
McPherson	ORGANIZATION	's work , and also a great deal of matter not found there at all .

		With three volumes to his credit .

		Professor
Fleming	PERSON	now takes rank as one of the leading historians of Re - construction .

		The South is to be congratulated that one of her sons is able and willing to devote his time and talents to so important a work .

		The modern doctrine of the intimacy of connection between mental func - tion and bodily condition carries with it a vast system of practical consequences .

		Hygienic measures and warnings have taken place side by side with moral exhortations , or have re - placed them .

		A convenient and sensible handbook , setting forth the doctrines of sound health of mind , is furnished by Dr.
T. S. Clouston	PERSON	in his volume entitled '' The Hygiene of Mind '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The nature of brain action , its dependence upon the muscular , nutritive , and supporting systems , the changes of state in the several ages of man , the momentous doctrines of heredity , the special liabili - ties of the periods of life , the questions of diet and exercise , the reflex influences of good cheer and healthy-mindedness -- all these -LSB- are plainly handled , with no very g ^ reat brilliancy of illustration or novelty of insight , yet effectively and intelligibly .

		The book is a readable and practical contribution to its topic .

		It reflects a clinical interest in the workings of mind , but lacks the insight into the underlying psychological relations that might well sharpen the contours and add interest to the details of the ensemble .

		It is in a fine spirit of reverence for t/the ` soum ^ the traditions of her home-land that Mrs.
St. Julien Ravenel	PERSON	has written the volume entitled ``
Charleston	LOCATION	: The Place and the People '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		While she modestly dis - claims all pretense to have written a history of the place she loves so dearly , Mrs.
Ravenel	PERSON	has omitted few of the incidents , -- tragic , romantic , prosaic , selfish , -- which have taken place at
Charleston	LOCATION	during the two hundred and fifty years that the city has sat on her low shores and listened to her rivers flowing into the ocean .

		The scene has varied less than the actors , who are many -- Indians , English - men , Huguenots ,
Covenanters	ORGANIZATION	, pirates , priests , pre - lates .

		Nonconformists , soldiers ,
Tories	ORGANIZATION	, Federalists , NuUificationists , Unionists , Secessionists .

		Of all these Mrs.
Ravenel	PERSON	tells , -- but above all of a society whose like the world will not see again , since all that produced it has gone forever .

		The charm of a past so eventful broods over the city in a re - markable degree , and the wistfulness of a love that looks back to a day that is dead touches the pages with a grace very much at one with the theme .

		In spite of Mrs.
Ravenel	PERSON	's disclaimer , she has written a real history , and our only regret is that the very noble restraint with which she speaks of the sorrow - ful days of the war between the states has prevented her from telling many things which we are sure she knows and which we should greatly like to know also .

		Train , Assistant District Attorney in

		The object of his book , he tells us , is to correct a general erroneous impression as to certain phases of criminal justice , and to give a concrete idea of its actual workings in large cities .

		He takes up these phases in successive chapters devoted to the subjects of crime and criminal procedure .

		The work , in no sense technical , gives a clear notion of the func - tion of lawyer , judge , juror , and witness , and lays bare the evils of the .

		law 's delays , its `` red-tape '' and its '' tricks . ''

		The present method of procedure , Mr. Train considers in many respects archaic ; but he does not discuss the subject of criminal-law re - form .

		He states , however , that the present con - ditions are due to `` our exaggerated regard for persoiial liberty coupled with a wholesale adoption of the technicalities of English law '' which we have now outgrown .

		The author deplores the lack of respect for the law characteristic of the American people as a whole .

		Although thoroughly serious in purpose , he lightens his chapters with amusing anec - dote , and thus gives us an entertaining as well as a strikingly suggestive book .

Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have begun the pub - lication of a '' Large Print Library '' with a handsome edition of '' Wuthering Heights . ''

		The special features of these books are a type unusually readable and a digni - fied buckram binding with stamped label .

		They are pub - lished at a moderate price , and the public is invited to vote for the books that it would like to have reprinted in this form .

		The new ''
Oxford Edition	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, of '' The Complete Poetical Works of
John Keats	PERSON	'' is edited , of ancient right , by Mr.
H. Buxton Forman	PERSON	.

		It gives us a portrait , a lengthy introduction , a sixteen-line fragment never before published , and numerous variorum readings in the form of foot-notes .

		We should judge it to be , on the whole , the most satis - factory of single-volume editions of the poet .

		The
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	will publish at once a book by Mr.
Joseph S. Tunison	PERSON	entitled '' The Dramatic Traditions of the Dark Ages . ''

		It is usual to regard the '' Dark Ages '' as a gulf which cuts the history of the drama sharply in two .

		The author maintains , on the contrary , that the drama had a continuous life .

		To sup - port this position he has recourse to various little-known authorities , Byzantine and other , and builds up a history of the drama in the Dark Ages .

		The thoroughness of research and the mechanical dignity which characterize the series of select biblio - graphies of American authors published by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are maintained in the latest addition to the series , '' A Bibliography of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, '' compiled by Mr.
George B. Ives	PERSON	.

		Besides the writings of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, classified in cate - gories , the volume gives us lists of biographies , signed essays and reviews , anonymous reviews and articles , poems of tribute , and a record of auction sales .

		The second annual issue of '' The Studio Year-Book of Decorative Art '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has just made its appearance .

		In general form the volume is similar to the special numbers of '' The Studio '' issued from time to time , -- which is to say that it is a paper-bound quarto , well-printed on good paper , and lavishly illus - trated in color and half-tone .

		Text and pictures com - bine to form a comprehensive guide to the artistic construction , decoration , and furnishing of the home which every householder will find suggestive and inter - esting , -- albeit some of the matter , as for instance the section on fireplaces , has little practical value to any but the English home-builder .

		The two concluding volumes of '' Literature of Li - braries , Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries '' are shortly to be issued by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the editorship of Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, librarian of the
Newark	LOCATION	public library , and of Mr.
Henry W. Kent	PERSON	, assistant secretary of the Metropolitan Museum of Art .

		These final issues comprise '' De Bibliothecis Syntagma , '' by
Justus Lipsius	PERSON	, and '' News from
France	LOCATION	; or , A Description of the
Library of Cardinal Mazarina	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Gabriel Naud	PERSON	^ .

		Printed and bound by the
Merrymount Press	ORGANIZATION	, as they are , these books comply with the strictest requirements of fine book-making , and are all of moment to the librarian , since they deal with actual collections of books and their use and administration .

		Postage

		GENERAL ALEXANDER 'S critical narrative of the Civil War has long been looked for with a peculiar interest by both military and civil students of its subject .

		He was a graduate of West Point , a brigadier-general in the Confederate army , chief of artillery of Longstreet 's corps , enjoying the personal confidence of Lee and the principal leaders in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of
Northern Virginia	LOCATION	, and is probably the most important of surviving Confederate officers .

		His book is the first philosophical review of the history of the war ever attempted , and the only one likely to be written by a participant ; and as such possesses a positively unique value .

		His impartial judgments , deep knowledge , and vivid illuminating anecdotes make this one of the most important books ever published on the Civil War , and a most valuable addition to American history .

US	LOCATION	.

		Tacitus said of the Greeks that they only praised their own achievements .

		The New Engianders learned this trick early and prac - tised it late .

		They stood shoulder to shoulder and cried each other up .

		Like
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's learned ladies , they decided that no one should have any wit but themselves and their friends .

		Scattered over our country , they took with them , wherever they went , the totems of their tribe , and set them up to be worshipped by the outer barbarians .

		They had some excuse for this , because they , of all Americans , did acknowl - edge some sort of intellectual weights and measures .

		But it was inevitable , in the end , that the rule of their gods should be challenged , their sanctity questioned .

		Bidlied out of obe - dience , some of us are ready to say that the
New England	LOCATION	writers were respectable people who did good in their day , but that in the consider - ation of universal literature they are not much , and that even in the consideration of American literature they are second-rate .

		The thing that separates the literature of
New England	LOCATION	from that of the rest of the country is its ingrained didactic tendency .

		It is the out - come of centuries of sermonizing .

		The Puritan believed he had a monopoly of goodness , which he was willing to dispense to the rest of the world for a consideration .

		Now all great art is in its effect moral .

		Great beauty harmonizes and inspires the mind .

		Great humor exposes the hypocrisies and corruptions of mankind , and draws us toward sanity and health .

		Profound metaphysical thought , winging along the fron - tiers of the unknown , lifts us above the petty concerns of life , its injustices and disappoint - ments .

		Literature which runs counter to the conventional ideas of morality is often the most moral of all .

		Byron 's '' Vision of Judgment , '' with its irreverence , almost blasphemy , is moral because like a blaze of lightning it burned up the foul airs of its time .

		Burns 's '' Jolly Beg - gars `` is as moral as the Mene ,
Mene	PERSON	,
Tekel	ORGANIZATION	,
Upharsin	PERSON	of the Persian king .

		Fielding 's ''
Joseph Andrews	PERSON	'' is moral , for it is a pro- test against sickly sentimentalism and prurient thought .

		There is Paganism in plenty in the 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
May	DATE	.

		16 ,
Iliad	LOCATION	, but has the modern world produced any - thing more essentially noble than the life and doom of Achilles ?

		Nay , the '' Bacchanals '' of Eurijjides is moral , though it is a hymn to intoxication .

		Moral ideas come nearest to us when embodied in the forms of creative art .

		No precept can equal an example .

		Instinctively all the races of men have projected their hopes and aspira - tions , their beliefs , their best and truest being , in the large forms of literature or religion .

		Rama and the Pandu brothers ,
Rustum	PERSON	and Isfendiar , Achilles and Odysseus ,
Charlemagne	PERSON	and his Paladins ,
Siegfried	PERSON	and
King Arthur	PERSON	, are instances of man 's half unconscious shadow - ing forth of an ideal which may become a model .

		Of course , accompanying this creative effort there has always been much sermonizing and maxim mongering ; but I do not know of any ; literature where this is not secondary , where it has not been of less educational value than the imitation which the great figures of art have forced upon men .

		: The failure of the
New England	LOCATION	writers in ; creation is due partly to their lack of sympathy ; with power in all its manifestations , partly tOj the genuine sincerity with which they held their ' moral code .

		It is the shibboleth of recent crit - icism , that sincerity is a poet 's greatest virtue .

		| Rather I should say a splendid insincerity is ; the germinating kernel of the imagination that creates .

		It is not to be supposed that Shake - , speare held with
Falstaff	ORGANIZATION	's code of morals and mode of life , or that he approved of Richard or ' lago as men and citizens .

		But the joy of : imagination was on him , and he thought him - !

		self into their skins and delighted in the exhi - bition of their powers .

		The
New England	LOCATION	writers could not do this .

		They were compelled by the nature of their minds to import a moral meaning into , or alle - gorize a moral lesson out of , everything they touched .

		Once , indeed ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	in `` The Scarlet Letter '' came near giving us a genuine tragedy .

		His theme is only a variation of the usual French theme of three -- husband , lover and wife ; but the situations are developed ' with remarkable skill , and the style , if a little prettyfied , is noble .

		The test of a tragic piece of work , however , is this : Does it leave us dull , depressed , dispirited , convinced that human life is a hideous mistake , or does it ring in our ears like the sound of a trumpet , does it tone our nerves like mountain air , does it make us feel that we are giants and able to contend against Fate itself ?

		All the really great tragedies of the world affect us in the last-named ways ; even an almost inhuman work like '' Wuthering Heights '' does so ; but unless I greatly err , '' The Scarlet Letter , '' like the tragic pieces of the Russian novelists , leaves us in dull despair .

		In everything but supreme creative force and supreme technical gift , the literature of
New England	LOCATION	is most satisfactory .

		It is thoroughly set up and equipped in all its branches .

		It has a genuinely great metaphysician in
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	, and a long roU of poets , essayists , and historians .

		And who can doubt that these were men of genius ?

		If they could only have let themselves go -- if they had only given their imaginations a loose rein into all the fields of life -- they might have been great creators .

		If they had only wooed Beauty more imreservedly they might have been great technicists .

		As it is , two of the most solemn of them ,
Emerson	PERSON	and
Bryant	PERSON	, have flashes of revealing light .

		But such flashes are intermittent with them , and more like phosphorescence than fire .

		Alto - gether , I should hesitate to place any of the
New Englanders	LOCATION	among the purple-wearers of mankind .

		Has America produced any such inheritors of the purple line ?

		I think it has .

		I think the world has instinctively selected two or three of our men for its real regard , while it has only yielded a cold admiration to the
New England	LOCATION	contingent .

		There is
Cooper	PERSON	, whose work is known and valued all over the civilized world .

		His '' Spy '' is a great novel .

		The character of
Washington	LOCATION	-- perhaps the most difficidt to handle of all historic figures -- is given with wonderful dra - matic effect , far surpassing , I think ,
Thackeray	PERSON	's treatment in '' The Virginians . ''


Cooper	PERSON	was the first to extend the domain of the novelist over the ocean , and his set of sea tales , in their com bined rendering of elemental and human action , are hardly yet equalled .

		But of course his great work is his series of pioneer stories .

		The forest life of
America	LOCATION	, its most wonderful phase , starts from his broad canvases .

		Nobody admires
Parkman	PERSON	more than I do .

		He tells the tale of the great American adventurers with fire and enthusiasm .

		But imagination is better than fact .

		The whole forest life , -- nature and man , the shadowy woods , the rolling streams , the broad lakes , the hunt , the trail , the camp-fire , the Indian habitat , the warfare of white and bro ^ vn , of French and English , -- is in the novelist rather than the historian .

		Cooper 's Indians have been objected to as idealized .

		They
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301 are probably no more idealized than the heroes of Homer or the
Highlanders of Scott	ORGANIZATION	.

		And Leatherstocking is one of the great figures of prose fiction .

		Cooper has terrible faults .

		His plots are often mechanical to a degree ; his minor characters are often irritating in their inanity or absurdity ; his conversations are almost always stilted and unnatural .

		But his broad pictures of forest and lake and prairie stamp themselves on our minds .

		It is the epic of the making of an empire , the disappearance of a race , which we follow in his books .

		At the right and left hand of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	, I should place
Brockden Brown	PERSON	and
Herman Melville	PERSON	.


Brown	PERSON	, a miracle of nature , a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	novelist , fascinated
Shelley	PERSON	and was evidently deeply studied by
Poe	PERSON	.

		In force of imagina - tion , vividness of weird incident , intensity of picture , unshrinking realism , he is at least the equal of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		But human nature is still further withdrawn from the normal in him than in the
New England	LOCATION	romance writer .

		If
Hawthorne	PERSON	's world is a moonlight one , his is only lit by jagged flashes of lightning .


Herman Melville	PERSON	has given us at least two immortal books . ''

		Moby Dick '' is in some sense the greatest sea narrative ever written ; but it is so Byronic , so strained and singular in its passion and theme , that only a recurrence of morbid conditions of human nature could brinsr it into fashion . ''

		Typee , '' however , is sunny and grace - ful and beautiful and irresponsible , and must always charm .

		Irving is the second name on our list which the world has accepted at something like its real value .

		What ease of polished prose is his !

		What kindly , tolerant outlook on human life ; what vivifying speU in his lightest touch !

		His English sketches had a great effect on
Dickens	PERSON	, but they are themselves derivative from
Addison	PERSON	and
Steele	PERSON	.

		But most of his group of
Hudson River	LOCATION	stories are as original as they are great .

		Imagination , humor , creative force , -- all the ingredients of lasting work are in them , and the world has pretty well learned them by heart .

		The case of Whitman vs. the Traditional Muse IS yet unadjudged .

		If it were merely a matter of rhyme or metre , I see no reason why any poet should not be allowed to please himself .

		There are many national verse forms which are as queer to our eyes and ears as any in Whit - man .

		There is plenty of rhythm in
Whitman	LOCATION	's VBrse , as there is in some of the
Bible	LOCATION	books or in
Blake	PERSON	's chants .

		But the matter of Whitman 's poetry is undefined and unformed .

		He seems to me one who has tried to get the whole uni - verse into his brain , and in a manner has suc - ceeded , only it has turned back into chaos .

		Everything is fluid in him -- with here and there disjecta membra of human limbs , trunks of trees , sunsets , moral virtues , and so forth , calmly floating about .

		But occasionally some form of beauty or power heaves into sight , and once or twice the whole business coalesces and hardens into something new and strange and fine .

		In discussing
Poe	PERSON	, I wish to put aside for the nonce the question of his intellectual power .

		I think I have probably read as much metaphysic and science as most of the critics who decry
Poe	PERSON	as a cheat and charlatan .

		To me he seems a great thinker , an intellect lucid and far dart - ing .

		He resembles , indeed , those early Greek or Hindoo philosophers whose guesses and intui - tions have never been excelled for profundity .

		But let that pass .

		I wish to concentrate my attention on him as a technicist .

		Poe is the great tone master of modern literature .

		Tone in literature is a certain blending of the intel - lectual and the sensuous for a predetermined effect .

		It requires , perhaps , a touch of morbid - ity of temperament to produce it , for everything contrary or extraneous to the desired effect must be shut out .

		Most of the epics and great works of prose fiction have no trace of tone .

		They are too wide-reaching , their contents are too various , to be keyed to one single note or har - monized to one tune .

		The drama , the lyric , and the prose story are the regions of tone .

		Even in these , greatness is possible without it . ''

		Hamlet '' begins with a tone picture hardly equalled even in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, -- the platform at
Elsinore	LOCATION	, the biting coldness of the night , the sentinels in their cloaks , the distant noise of the king 's revel , and then -- the Ghost .

		But as the play goes on , its intellectual and emotional con - tent bursts the sensuous framework , and tone disappears .

		Visible Memorials to
Burns	PERSON	in
Scotland	LOCATION	, a poor country , are surprising in number and character .

		There is , first , the cottage near Ayr , a national possession kept in admirable preservation .

		There is the Bums monument , a Grecian temple with statuary , on the banks of the ''

		At
Kilmarnock	ORGANIZATION	there is a memorial structure , rivalling the Scott monument at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	in size and surpassing it in beauty .

		There is the magnificent mausoleum at
Dumfries	LOCATION	.

		And there are statues at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	,
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and doubtless other places .

		In contrast with this atmosphere of worship there is an incident connected with
Stratford	LOCATION	which is worth relating as illustrating British character and bad taste .

		On a hill , some distance from the town but dom - inating it and the valley of the
Avon	LOCATION	, there is erected a granite shaft probably one himdred feet high .

		It appears that a ^ ative of those parts went up to
London	LOCATION	as a poor boy and by industry in the brewing trade ac - quired a fortune .

		Returning to his birthplace , he built this monument to commemorate his virtues and assert his superiority to Shakespeare !

		However , it does not behoove us in
America	LOCATION	to throw stonies .

		• • • Misplaced zeal on the part of librarians was lately touched upon in these columns in reference to the bibliothecal practice of a rigid and absurd economy in the use of capitals .

		It is gratifying now to find this mild censure echoed and emphasized by no less an authority than Mr.
E. H. Anderson	PERSON	, Director of the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	, an institution that , imder its former energetic head , made itself famous for its advocacy of various innovations , -- in spelling , in capi - talization , in labor-saving but brain-puzzling abbrevia - tions , in unimagined applications of the decimal system , and in divers other matters purely technical and wholly external to the realm of literature and the delights of reading .

		Before the
New York Library Club	ORGANIZATION	Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	discoursed wisely on the injury librarians have done to their cause , both with the thinking and with the unthinking public , by an injudicious activity in alien fields .

		Whatever merit there might be in these de - partures from accepted usage that are so persistently advocated by theorists , the speaker declared all such reform movements to be outside the librarian 's true sphere of usefulness .

		In one cause alone should he take the lead , and that is in making more accessible to the public whatever of good may be found in books .

		Yet no thimdering of cannon was heard last month when Mr ,
John Burroughs	PERSON	bade farewell to the sixties and began a new decade of life .

		Perhaps he was too busy wel - coming the return of robin and bluebird to take thought of this cardinal event in his personal history .

		As his readers have had ample opportunity to learn of late , Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	is a rugged foe to sentimentalism ; and this may account for his having thus stolen a march on his admirers -- an involuntarily surreptitious march .

		Nevertheless he will not escape the tribute of many a congratulation , uttered or unexpressed , and many a sincere wish that he may long continue to make life brighter for his fellow-men by giving them an occasional peep at the world of nature through the wonder-revealing lenses of his spectaicles .

		This '' most interesting house in

# 50,000	MONEY	, was not built , it is safe to say , with the proceeds from the '' Pleasures of Memory , '' but rather with the handsome earnings of the paternal bank somewhere in the
City	LOCATION	.

		The debt which nineteenth - century memoirs owe to
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	's breakfasts can never be estimated : the stories that have found their way into print from that table of wit , and that are now being served up again to readers , are innumer - able ; while the stories that failed of this immortality must be vastly more numerous , and , likely enough , in many instances , of even better quality .

		It is meet that a tablet should be inscribed to the honor of this host who so long and with such distinction presided over '' the feast of reason and the flow of soul . ''

		There was a time when the sending of complimentary copies , with obse - quious notes , to leading critics was a common practice with authors , though one of which they were never honestly proud .

		But this brazen -LRB- or golden -RRB- bid for favorable notice passes the bounds of all that has ever been recorded or even imagined in this line .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		SHAKESPEARE FOR CHILDREN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial.J I have read with much interest the commmiication on the subject of '' Reading Shakespeare to Children , '' in your last issue .

		In our work of prescribing the right reading for children we naturally have to generalize broadly as to the right reading at the right age -- for the guidance of those who have not studied the subject ; and we endeavor to base our generalizations upon as wide a study of children 's tastes and of children 's inter - ests as possible .

		But no hard and fast rules will always apply , and personal experience is often more useful as a `` finger-post '' than any sets of rules .

		When I was a boy I lived in a place , and at a time .

		of book-famine .

		At home in a coimtry town not a hundred miles from the great metropolis of
London	LOCATION	, there was nothing but the Bible , '' The Pilgrim 's Pro- gress , '' and a few volumes of dreary semi-Calvinistic theology .

		No newspapers were allowed in the house , and such was our isolation that the
United States	LOCATION	was only a geographical abstraction -- simply a name to me , -- imtil one day in school we were given a copy of '' The Times '' newspaper in which a leading article on the outbreak of the Civil War was made our reading lesson for the day .

		The only things that I knew of Shakespeare were the scraps in our reading-books at school : and how I loved them !

		-- alike for the music of the language and the vastness of the subjects , although I know now that I had not nearly fathomed their full meaning .

		Indeed , I find new thought and new meaning every time I re-read my Shakespeare .

		I did not make acquaintance with a single play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's until I was grown up ; and for a long time it was with difficulty that I could read them ; to follow the story was hard and troublesome .

		If the plays had been read to me when I was nine years old I am certain that I should not have had this difficulty to overcome at twenty .

		Here is another bit of personal experience : Somehow or other , when I was between seven and eight a four - page Prospectus of an illustrated edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	came into my hands .

		Beneath an illustration were the lines : '' Pull fathom five thy father lies ; '' and Ferdinand 's '' The ditty does remember my drown 'd father . ''

		How that word '' remember '' puzzled my young brain !

		The joy in later years of finding out its real meaning was , I really believe , the foundation of a love of the study of words which has never left me , and was a factor in starting me on a course which resulted in making me proficient in three languages besides my own .

		Another personal experience and I have done .

		There is a most interesting movement in
Boston	LOCATION	, imder the auspices of the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	, to give special performances of standard English plays for the benefit of our school children .

		``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, '' `` Twelfth Night , '' '' As You Like It , '' and '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' have been presented .

		The great
Castle Square Theatre	ORGANIZATION	has been packed from floor to ceiling with children of all ages from nine to sixteen , and it was an inspiring sight to watch these young people following the presentation of these masterpieces .

		The intelligent appreciation that they showed was remarkable , and the teachers are unanimous in testify - ing to the happy and useful results m their school work from the opportunities thus afforded .

		The younger ones , so far as I could see , followed the play with as keen a zest as their elders ; and it was easy to see that few of the points escaped them .

		For my own part , all my observation leads me to the conclusion that the right time to read Shakespeare to children is just as soon as they can be interested in it .

		They will not understand the play fully ; and , indeed , none of us ever appreciates fully and finally any great work of art .

		One sees fresh beauties and new meanings every time one comes to it .

		If those who object to the reading of Shakespeare to children at nine because they can not fully understand it , were to wait imtil they could fully understand
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, they woiUd never read Shake - speareatall !

Within Three Degrees of Ninety North	ORGANIZATION	.

		* '' You all want to know what there is at the
North Pole	LOCATION	, '' said Commander
Peary	PERSON	in a recent lecture ; and he admitted that '' there is prob - ably nothing there , and no Pole which anyone can bump into in the dark ; neither is there a great hole in the ground or a great rounded mountain to mark the exact spot .

		There may be land ; the Pole may be only a spot in the great Arctic sea . ''

		Nevertheless , even with '' nothing there '' but ninety degrees of latitude and a conflux of all the meridians of longitude , the race for that mathematical point in space is an exciting , a stupendous game , certainly to the Arctic ex - plorer the most stupendous conceivable game ; and with each added degree or fraction of a degree of farthest northing the contest becomes sharper , sterner , more exciting than before .

		In this matter it is the last step instead of the first that costs so tremendously in pluck and per - sistence and coolest daring , to say nothing of the large demands made upon physical strength and pecuniary resources .

		It is a contest that , even in the reading of it , quickens the pulse of the pale student in his closet .

		The feelings of the participant himself , as touched upon a few months ago by Commander
Peary	PERSON	in receiving from President
Roosevelt	PERSON	's hand the
Hubbard Medal	ORGANIZATION	of the
National Geographic Society	ORGANIZATION	, are not beyond the comprehension of the most unad venturous .

		From the speech of acceptance , which with that of presentation forms the Intro - duction to
Conmaander Peary	ORGANIZATION	's memorable re - cord now published under the title '' Nearest the Pole , '' a few sentences may here be given . ''

		The true explorer does his work not for any hopes of reward or honor , but because the thing he has set himself to do is a part of his being , and must be accom - plished for the sake of the accomplishment .

		And he counts lightly hardships , risks , obstacles , if only they do not bar him from his goal .

		To me the final and complete solution of the Polar mystery which has en - gaged the best thought and interest of some of the best men of the most vigorous and enlightened nations of the world for more than three centuries , and to-day quickens the pulse of every man or woman whose veins hold red blood , is the thing which should be done for the honor and credit of this country , the thing which it is intended that I should do , and the thing that I must do .

		A Narrative of the Polar Expedition of the
Peary • Arctic Club	ORGANIZATION	in the
S.S. Roosevelt	LOCATION	, 1905-1906 .

Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		finding a story told in the first person , is not unlike the feeling that may come to many on following
Conunander Peary	PERSON	's perilous poleward course , so often do we suspect that he has denied us the thrills of suspense and fear and admira - tion that another chronicler of the modest hero 's deeds would have delighted to impart .

		Yet there remains a very clear perception of the explorer 's unrivalled fitness for his self-imposed task , of his courage , promptness , resourceful - ness , ability to handle men and to breathe into them something of his own spirit , and , last but not least , of his extraordinary powers of endur - ance and his Anglo-Saxon tenacity of purpose .

		With a boldness that often makes his com - panions tremble for his and their own safety , he combines a caution that tells him just when he has reached the limit beyond which lies foolhardiness , an instinct that whispers '' turn back '' when to go on would mean certain death .

		Of the formation of the
Peary Arctic Club	ORGANIZATION	, the planning and building of the '' Roosevelt , ' its launching in the
spring	DATE	of 1 905 , the departure of the expedition a few months later , and , finally , what that expedition accomplished , the daily press has already given full accounts .

		But the story as told by the leader of the brave little band has a charm entirely distinct from its news value .

		That latitude 87 ° 6 ' was reached , which now stands as the '' farthest north , '' is generally known ; but of certain incidents of glorious daring and still more glorious victory we are glad to have fuller details .

		The splendid pluck with which the '' Roosevelt '' was navi - gated through the ice to her Arctic anchorage on the northeast coast of
Grant Land	ORGANIZATION	, whence in
February	DATE	the sledging party started for the
Pole	LOCATION	, is something admirable .

		The stout build of the ship and her sharply-raking stem enabled her to achieve the hitherto impossible .

		In glow - ing terms which sometimes refuse to shape them - selves into sentences -- but that is no matter -- the author writes : '' The Roosevelt fought like a gladiator , turning , twisting , straining with all her force , smashing her full weight against the heavy floes whenever we could get room for a rush , and rearing upon them like a steeple - chaser taking a fence .

		Ah , the thrill and tension of it , the lust of battle , which crowded days of ordinary life into one .

		The forward rush , the gathering speed and momentum , the crash , the upward heave , the grating snarl of the ice as the steel-shod stem split as a mason 's hammer splits granite , or trod it under , or sent it right and left in whirling fragments , followed by the violent roll , the backward reboimd , and then the gathering for another rush , were glorious .

		At other times , the blue face of a big floe as high as the plank sheer grinding against either side , and the ship inching her way through , her frames creaking with the pressure , the

		THE DIAL 305 big engines down aft running like sewing-machines , and the twelve-inch steel shaft whirling the wide-bladed propeller , till its impulse was no more to be denied than the force of gravity . ''

		On the
21st of April	DATE	, after a desperate dash for the Pole through dangers and difficulties beyond description , the sledging party , which had left the ship two months earlier and had more than once turned anxious looks of longing southward and homeward , received the leader 's reluctant command to retreat .

		It was high time .

		It had been an open
winter	DATE	, and in a day more the breaking up of the ice would have made retreat impossible .

		Even as it was , one yawning expanse of water nearly proved the ruin of the party .

		More than two miles of thin and bending ice had to be crossed on snow-shoes .

		The climax of peril is thus described : '' We crossed in silence , each man busy with his thoughts and intent upon his snowshoes .

		Frankly I do not care for more similar experiences .

		Once started , we could not stop , we could not lift our snowshoes .

		It was a matter of constantly and smoothly gliding one past the other with utmost care and evenness of pres - sure , and from every man as he slid a snowshoe for - ward , undulations went out in every direction through the thin film incrusting the black water .

		The sledge was preceded and followed by a broad swell .

		It was the first and only time in all my Arctic work that I felt doubtful as to the outcome , but when near the middle of the lead the toe of my rear kamik as I slid forward from it broke through twice in succession , I thought to myself ' this is the finish , ' and when a little later there was a cry from someone in the line , the words sprang from me of themselves : ' God help him , which one is it ? '

		but I dared not take my eyes from the steady , even gliding of my snowshoes , and the fas - cination of the glassy swell at the toes of them . ''

		But firm ice was reached at last , and then it was found that the cry of alarm had been caused by nothing worse than had befallen the narrator himself .

		Not yet , however , was all danger past .

		After the north coast of
Green	ORGANIZATION	- land had finally and with further grave diffi - culties been reached , starvation stared these famishing and exhausted men in the face , and was only averted by the lucky finding of a smaU herd of musk-oxen .

		How the herd was cautiously approached , two weak and starving - dogs being sent ahead to round it up , how one of the poor dogs was tossed and gored while the other , staggering and tottering , stuck to his duty , and how in sick suspense a pause for necessary breath was made before rifle could be lifted and aimed , is too long a story to teU here ; but we give a part of its close . ''

		I kicked off my snowshoes and sat down upon them for a moment to pull myself together .

		In that moment there passed before me all the weary days since we went on scant rations ; the grim daily grind ; the dismal wait - ing at the Styx for a chance to regain the world ; the heart-breaking work through the shattered ice ; the in - fernal groaning and crashing of the floes ; the ever - present nightmare of more open water ; the incessant gnawing under the belt ; the bruised and aching feet ; the burning eyes and face .

		... I dropped my mittens , threw a cartridge into the barrel of my carbine , and advanced toward the herd .

		Faithful Ahngmalokto cried out -- ' Do n't go so near ,
Peary	PERSON	, ' but this pimy herd of musk-oxen was a trifle compared with the lead whose black embrace we had all faced , and I stepped between the gray dog and the bull .

		Crack !

		a tiny tuft of hair flew out from just back of the bull 's foreshoulder and he had something beside the gray dog to think of , though he did not go down .

		My bullet had missed his heart and gone through his limgs .

		Crack !

		the other bull made a jump forward , stopped , staggered a step or two back - ward , then lurched over on his side .

		My aim was better .

		Crack !

		Crack !

		the two old cows followed suit .

		Crack !

		the yoimger cow went the same way . ''

		And , in short , the entire herd was disposed of by the marksman-explorer , and then appears to have been devoured by the men and dogs , after '' which the march over the ice and back to the ship was resumed and completed .

		What , after it was all over , the expedition proved to have accomplished , is briefly sum - marized by the writer .

		The highest north now gained leaves but 174 nautical miles to be con - quered this side of the
Pole	LOCATION	, and various items of information interesting to Arctic geographers have been gathered .

		The author thinks the problem of attaining the Pole has been simpli - fied fifty per cent by this latest .

		expedition , and he is evidently keener than ever for another attempt .

		Following his main narrative are chapters on the expedition of 1898-1902 , on the planning and building of the '' Roosevelt , '' and on '' My Eskimos . ''

		A full index and an excellent map conclude the volume .

		A worthy accompaniment to the beautifully-printed text is the collection of interspersed illustrations from photographs by the author -- some of them taken , apparently , under most trying conditions -- and the colored frontispiece by Mr.
Albert Operti	PERSON	.

		The large size of the page , seven by ten , is turned to good account in many of the fine pictures of Arctic scenery and Arctic life .

		As a very readable record of a heroic achieve - ment , and at the same time of a bitter dis - appointment , the volume is valuable .

		May its author live to accomplish in full the object of his noble striving !

		Beginning with
Patras	LOCATION	, Champlitte swept over the west of the peninsula in thorough but not unmerciful conquest , respecting as far as he could the rights and properties of the conquered .

		The campaign of acquisition we may not follow ; but here is one picture of the invading force : '' They looked across the waters to
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	and great Parnassus lifting their storied crests in vain .

		For no thrill of old association woke response in these rude soldiers of the west , to whom the Greeks were heretic ' griffons , ' and the Hellenes of old , who had crowned the heights with wall and tower , passed for the giant races of an earlier world .

		Little recking of the me - mories that harbour in these immortal hills , they marched on through vineyard , cornfield and olive grove .

		... At the head of the troop ride the two leaders accompanied by a small band of prelates , intent rather on the prospect of benefices than the winning of souls , and scarcely distinguishable by their habit from the lay soldier .

		Each knight is dressed from head to foot in a close-fitting suit of mail , the coif or hood of steel covering the head and leaving only the features exposed ... The sergeants follow the knights in mail that is less complete , and the humbler adventurers wear for defense the pour-point , a quilted garment of padded cotton . ''

		So they passed along , a typical band '' from the pages of romance , to an easy conquest .

		By the end of
1208	DATE	the central and southeastern por - tions of the Peloponnese , in large part , had been annexed to the kingdom established promptly in the west .

		About this tune
Guillaume de Champlitte	PERSON	was summoned to
France	LOCATION	, and
Geoffrey Villehardouin	PERSON	, probably as a result of questionable methods , became recognized as
Prince of Achaia	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1218	DATE	,
Geoffrey I.	PERSON	was succeeded by his son
Geoffrey II.	PERSON	, '' who gained almost as great an extension of territory by sagacious policy as his father had acquired by conquest . ''

		A younger brother ,
William	PERSON	, the next rider , had such a brilliant career that by
1259	DATE	he had become paramovmt not only in
Greece	LOCATION	but in aU
Romania	LOCATION	.

		At this point we may return for a moment to the Greek city that is always first in our thoughts , although it plays only a secondary role in the history of this period .

		In
1206	DATE	,
Bonifazio	PERSON	bestowed the lordship of
Athens	LOCATION	on
Otho de la Roche	PERSON	, whose territories , when he had won them , were to include a considerable part of central
Greece	LOCATION	.

		About
Attica	LOCATION	and its capital in the
early thirteenth century	DATE	we know but little .

		In the eleventh century the Em - peror Basil II .

		`` bore witness to the glories of nature and art of which the venerable city could still boast '' ; and in
1153	DATE	an enthusiastic Arab geographer speaks of
Athens	LOCATION	as rich in popula - tion , surrounded with gardens and arable land .

		In
1185	DATE	, however , the district pleaded its im - poverishment as an excuse for not sending the customary coronation offering to the Emperor
Alexius	PERSON	on his accession .

		About the same time an archbishop gives very gloomy accounts of the material condition , with the added com - plaint that '' the citizens , whom in his inaugural allocution he addressed as sons of the ancient Athenians , had even lost the use of their own glorious language , and his classic idiom feU upon miappreciative ears corrupted by a bar - barous dialect . ''

		However , there are fairly defi - nite traditions that
Athens	LOCATION	was recognized as something of an intellectual centre even during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries ; and the early years of the rule of the house of la
Roche	ORGANIZATION	seem to have witnessed a commercial revival , if we may draw any inference from the reestab - lishment of a Genoese commimity .

		In
1210	DATE	the Megaskyr , as the Greeks now called the lord of
Athens	LOCATION	, joined
Geoffrey Villehardouin	PERSON	in the conquest of Argos and
Nauplia	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the close of the campaign he received the investiture of these fiefs , becommg for them the liegeman of the
Prince of Achaia	ORGANIZATION	.

		About forty years later
William Villehardouin	PERSON	demanded from
Guy de la Roche	ORGANIZATION	a formal act of homage for
Athens	LOCATION	as well , and on being refused , success - fully enforced his claims in a fierce campaign .

		This brings us to the point mentioned at the close of the preceding paragraph .

		The same year that saw
William Villehar	PERSON	- douin so powerful in the east witnessed his humiliation : for at the end of
1259	DATE	he was de - feated and carried as a captive to the
Emperor Michael	ORGANIZATION	.

		His ransom in
1262	DATE	involved im - portant cessions of territory as well as formal 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, submission to the overlordship of the Greek Emperor .

		The remainder of his reign is a story of desperate struggles against the eastern poten - tate and his fatal involution in the strife of
Italy	LOCATION	, nntil the Prince of Achaia became '' instead of the protagonist in
Romania	LOCATION	, a mere pawn in the far-reaching schemes of Charles of
Anjou	LOCATION	. ''

		His death in
1278	DATE	closes the most attractive period of the romantic story of
Achaia	LOCATION	.

		At the history of the next one hundred and fifty years we may not even glimpse , although the fortunes of
Isabelle Villehardouin	PERSON	, the career of the Catalan company , the practical annihila - tion of the historical chivalry of
Romania	LOCATION	in one fatal day in the marshes of
Boeotia	LOCATION	, the political activities of the Acciajuoli , -- the steel - kings of the mediaeval world , -- offer tempting vistas .

		These were the days when three hun - dred
Franks	PERSON	might turn the tide against ten thousand soldiers of the east ; when a noble lady was required to go unhesitatingly into alien cap - tivity as hostage for her husband 's overlord ; when an arm of
John the Baptist	PERSON	was accepted as adequate security for a loan of five thousand golden hyperpers .

		Puny campaigns and petty feuds grow tiresome ; but always the story has life and movement .

		Now it carries the reader to
Athens	LOCATION	and sea-girt
Euboea	LOCATION	; now to Con - stantinople , the seat of the tottering and incon - gruous eastern empire ; now westward to
Italy	LOCATION	, with the threads of Venetian commercial intrigue and the varied webs of papal and imperial policy ; now further still to
France	LOCATION	, where the king was yet the fount and head of chivalry .

		In the latter part of the fourteenth century a lease of the principality of
Achaia	LOCATION	was conceded to the Knights of Rhodes by
Otho of Brunswick	ORGANIZATION	, and from this point we have '' an epoch of conflicting claims and provisional administration . ''

		There were '' Princes of Achaia '' until the downfall of
Centurione Zaccaria II.	PERSON	, who ruled over a scanty remainder of this once prosperous dominion , and died in
1432	DATE	.

		`` With him perished the last Frank whose name is known to history , and with the exception of the ports that were held by
Venice	LOCATION	, the peninsula was once more in the hands of the Greeks . ''

		Thus ends the Grecian chapter in the great book of romantic chivalry .

		For this chapter English readers have de - pended principally on the sections in
Finlay	DATE	's '' History of
Greece	LOCATION	, '' and on
Leake	PERSON	's books of travel .

		The French have had the works of Buchon and the later study of La Baronne Diane de Guldencrone called '' L'Achaie Feo - dale . ''

		The researches of the German scholar
Hopf	PERSON	resulted in a mass of material that one can only describe as colossal and chaotic ; but from the heap more pragmatic historians are sorting out valuable ore .

		Of late years in - terest m the period has been more active and fruitful .

		English students have recently been conducting carefid investigations on Greek soil ; and the second volume of
Ernst Gerland	ORGANIZATION	's am - bitious `` Geschichte der lateinischen
Kaiser	PERSON	- reichs von Konstantinopel '' will be devoted to the '' Frankenherrschaft in Griechenland . ''

		Many years ago Sir
Rennell Rodd	PERSON	, then an attache of the British embassy in
Athens	LOCATION	, find - ing himself in the mood of puzzled discontent of the traveller with whom we began our notice , determined to write a history of Mediaeval
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Through a busy life of letters and diplomatic service his aim was never lost from sight , although the scope of the proposed work was gradually narrowed until it assumed the form of the volumes on our table .

		The product bears every mark of loving toil .

		Our author has spared no effort to reach available sources , or to make his results perfectly clear .

		The style is simple and direct .

		In the nature of things , the average reader can not be promised continuous enjoyment from over six hundred octavo pages of rather detailed study ; nor will even the elect find their pleasure uninterrupted .

		However , all students of mediaeval history or problems of feudalism , all lovers of
Greece	LOCATION	, and many gen - eral readers who find pleasure in strolling be - yond the beaten path , will gladly acknowledge the fruitftd service of the titled enthusiast who has given us '' The Princes of Achaia and the Chronicles of Morea '' ; and perhaps in passing we might point out that any writer of historical novels would find material for at least half a dozen '' thrillers '' in this straightforward narra - tive .

		Where an author has given so much , it is perhaps ungracious to ask for more ; but one misses a connected treatment of the domestic life and industrial conditions .

		There are tan - talizing mentions of the textile industries of
Thebes	LOCATION	and the current products of the
Morea	PERSON	, which only serve to whet our appetites .

		The very fact that recorded information on such topics is scanty indeed would have made us more gratef id for a couple of chapters embody - ing our author 's conclusions based upon his intimate knowledge of the conditions of modern Greek life and his extended studies in the Prankish period .

		As it is , he deserves our thanks for a valuable piece of work that brings this unremembered age of
Greece	LOCATION	vividly and agi'eeably before our minds .

		The latter half of the accurately descriptive
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 title seems to demand a brief note on '' The Chronicle of
Morea	PERSON	. ''

		It will be recalled that there is a Greek record , in various manuscripts , of the conquest of
Morea	LOCATION	; and a French ver - sion , rather abbreviated , carrying the history some ten years further down than the Greek poem as we have it .

		Obviously here is a glori - ous opportunity for controversy , and the oppor - tunity has not been neglected .

		Avoiding any part therein , we may summarize the conclusion of our author , who attributes great importance to the studies and opinions of Professor
John Schmitt	PERSON	, the latest and best editor of the Chronicle .

		There existed in the castle of
St. Omer	LOCATION	at
Thebes	LOCATION	after the year 1227 a history of the conquest of
Romania	LOCATION	and
Morea	PERSON	, which we assume to have been a Greek metrical re - cord of events up to
1304	DATE	, written originally about that year and brought up to date from time to time .

		From this original the existing Greek and French versions are derived directly .

		The author , who was exclusively Frankish and Catholic in sentiment , may have been a clerk or notary in the retinue of the brilliant young
Nicholas III	PERSON	.

		de
St. Omer	ORGANIZATION	.

		At any rate , the `` genesis of the Chronicle may be assigned without question to the early years of the four - teenth century , to a period that is very near the events recorded , many of which were still a living memory , while its value as a picture of contemporary thought and manners , during this obscure epoch of history , can hardly be over - rated . ''

		About the book as a thing to be handled we would say just a word .

		There is a clear-cut introduction dealing with historical authorities .

		A readable account of the fourth crusade , in - cluding the sack of
Constantinople	LOCATION	and the partition of the empire , is given as a sort of prologue occupying about a hundred pages .

		The history from the time of
Otho of Brunswick	ORGANIZATION	to the Greek restoration is summarized as an epi - logue .

		There are three appendices , the third of which contains helpful genealogical tables ; also a map , which might have been better ; and an index , which is welcome , although it ought to be fuller in view of the value and nature of the contents of these two acceptable volumes .

		The
Smith Professorship	ORGANIZATION	at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, which has been vacant since the death of
Lowell	LOCATION	, has at last been filled by the appointment of Professor

		He has in hand a volume on the Novel for the '' Types of English Literature '' series .

		The Maxy-Sided IjEighton .

		* It is difficult to imagine a biography of
Frederic Leighton	PERSON	that should lack interest and inspiration , so full and varied was his career , so rich both in spiritual graces and material achievements .

		The complexity -- or shall we say the simple himianity -- of his temperament , and the consequent variety of his interests and activities , will indeed tend to baffle a biographer .

		His was not one of those intense artistic natures that lend themselves easily to picturesque re - miniscence and spicy anecdote .

		Exaggeration and affectation were utterly foreign to his genius .

		He would no more have fondled Ros - setti 's wombats or indulged in a Whistlerian tilt with the critics than he would have painted the Blessed Damozel or dashed off a Nocturne in Black and Gold .

		His Pre-Raphaelite con - temporaries considered him an arrant Philistine , but they always found him a friend , just , tol - erant , and kindly ; as indeed did everyone who came in contact with him , whether in private or official relations . ''

		I am a workman first and an official afterwards , ''
Leighton	PERSON	said once ; but it is probably as an official , an encourager and patron of English art , that his influence was strongest and most endiiring , and his ideals were best expressed .

		There was nothing radi - cal in those ideals ; like everything about
Leighton	PERSON	, they were thoroughly sane and self - controlled .

		Perfect sanity , remarkable social and executive gifts , a keen sense of duty , un - flagging industry , unfaUing enthusiasm for the best things -- here is a rare combination of quali - ties , and particularly rare in an artist .

		The life of such a man can not fail to yield a pleasant and profitable study .

		The present biography , '' The Life , Letters , and Work of
Frederic Leighton	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.
Russell Barrington	PERSON	, will undoubtedly remain the authoritative account of the matter .

		The ten years that have passed since
Leighton	PERSON	's death lend sufficient perspective to the view .

		Mrs.
Barrington	PERSON	was a personal friend of
Leigh	PERSON	- ton 's , and , being herself an artist , is familiar at first hand with the artistic situation in his time .

		His family and friends have furnished her with a voluminous mass of letters and with valuable notes on certain aspects of
Leighton	LOCATION	's career ; and drawings , studies , and finished pictures have been freely lent her for reproduction .

		In the matter of illustration , certainly , the • The Life , Letters , and Work op
Frederic Leighton	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated in photo - gravure , color , etc. .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		310 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, two large octavo volumes which embody the life and letters will not easily be surpassed .

		With the exception of the Watts portraits , a few draw - ings by
Steinle	PERSON	,
Leighton	PERSON	's favorite master , and a view of the famous Arab Hall in
Leighton House	ORGANIZATION	, practically all the illustrations reproduce
Leighton	PERSON	's own work .

		They include sketches , studies , drawings of flowers and leaves , water colors , such as
Leighton	PERSON	was fond of painting in
Italy	LOCATION	and the
East	LOCATION	, a set of illustrations for '' Romola , '' several statues , portraits -- gener - ally painted by
Leighton	PERSON	as pot-boilers , -- and a representative selection of the finished pictures on which his fame as an artist rests . ''

		The mind in creation is as a fading coal , ''
Shelley	PERSON	said once ; and
Leighton	PERSON	felt the same thing and tried in many ways to guard against it , although in the end his sacrifice of inspirar tion to elaborate finish was always deliberate .

		The powerful sweep and spontaneous suggestive - ness of some of the studies will therefore amaze readers who know only the cold classicism of most of the paintings ; while others attest a love of nature and an attention to her slightest de - tails that would do honor to Hunt 's model Pre -
Raphaelite	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of the less significant studies might easily be spared , but taken as a whole the illustrations , \ \ ^ hich are excellently repro - duced , offer a complete and striking exemplifi - cation of
Leighton	LOCATION	's methods and abilities .

		The binding of the volumes exhibits xinusual taste , and despite their bidk they are light and easily handled .

		Unfortunately , Mrs.
Barrington	PERSON	is not as skilful in arranging and adapting her material as she has been industrious in collecting it .

		The inherent difficulties of the subject are exagger - ated rather than avoided by her treatment .

		She does not understand the art of compression .

		Anxious to give just the right effect , she is unwilling to omit anything that can possibly be suggestive .

		The result is seven hundred pages -- including , characteristically , a preface , two introductions and an appendix , -- burdened with a mass of raw material , which , had it been judi - ciously sifted , would have produced a clear-cut , lucid impression , where now there are only blurred outlines , obscured by the mass of '' original documents . ''

		Unhappily , the reader of present-day biography is thoroughly accus - tomed to this state of things ; he is used to being his own editor , and he wiU assume the respon - sibility in this case the more readily in propor - tion as Mrs.
Barrington	PERSON	has more than the usual excuse for failing to detach the salient features in so vast a panorama as
Leighton	LOCATION	's life offers .

		The most vital part of the biography is con - tained in the first volume , which deals with
Leighton	PERSON	's student days , and shows him tri - umphing over bad health , weak eyes , and family opposition in his choice and pursuit of his art , revelling in
Steinle	PERSON	's instruction at
Frankfort	LOCATION	, loving
Rome	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, hating
Paris	LOCATION	, and finally achieving his first great triumph by the sale of his exhibition picture , ''
Cimabue	ORGANIZATION	's
Madonna /	ORGANIZATION	' to the Queen .

		Leighton 's letters , most of them to his mother , tell much of the story .

		They are long for a boy 's letters , introspective in parts , and in parts very lively .

		Characteristically enthusiastic is this bit about a journey to
Holland	LOCATION	, taken when he was twenty-two : '' There I am at the
Hague	LOCATION	.

		Pretty place , the
Hague	LOCATION	, clean , quaint , cheerful , and ai n't the Dutch just fond of smoking out of long clay pipes !

		And the pictures , Oh the pictures , A h the pictures !

		That magnificent Rem - brandt !

		glowing , flooded with light , clear as amber , and do you twig the grey canvas ?

		What Vandykes !

		what dignity , calm , gently breathing , and a searching thoughtfulness in the gaze , amounting almost to fas - cination .

		... I catch myself bearing something in mmd !

		` And yet , after all ' -LRB- with an argumentative hitch of the cravat -RRB- ' all that those fellows had in ad - vance of us was a palette and brushes , and that we 've got too ! ''

		Leighton 's gentleness of spirit is nowhere better shown than in the perfection of his family relations .

		His mother was fond and proud of him , but confirmed ill-health made her queru - lous .

		Leighton never resented her exactions , apologized as heartily for imaginary neglects as for real ones , and was constantly trying to gratify her and give her a share in the pleasures of his busy , happy life .

		His father was an austere man , matter-of-fact and quite out of sympathy with his son 's artistic ambitions , having sanctioned his studies only on the hard condition that he should manage to achieve eminence .

		Determination to satisfy his father imdoubtedly had much to do with
Leighton	PERSON	's dogged perseverance .

		For the road to eminence was not easy ; the brilliant suc - cess of his first picture was followed by the com - plete failure of his second .

		Leighton faced the fact squarely , hiding his chagrin to break the news to his mother as gently as possible .

		He looked upon his defeat , he declares bravely , as a fortunate occurrence , and so must she .

		`` Consider what an edge and zest I get for my future efforts , and what an incentive I have to exert myself to put down the venomous jargon of envious people ... The more they abuse the better I 'll paint -- industry against spite -- I will have a pull for it . ''

		One obstacle
Leighton	PERSON	never had to down .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 His family were not wealthy , and he generally found the money he got for his early pictures `` unkimmon handy '' ; but he could afford to live comfortably whUe he studied , and to spend his vacations in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, or the East , whose spell he came imder while he was still a young man and never outgrew .

		Travel was his chief recreation , for he hated general society as much as he enjoyed the companionship of a few chosen friends .

		There are many interesting accounts of his journeyings to be gleaned from his letters , and the story of one notable trip up the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, in a steamer lent him by the Viceroy at the insti - gation of the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	, is delightfully told in the journal which he kept during his two months of isolation from the world and the post .

		One of the fruits of his
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	journeys was ''
Arab Hall	PERSON	, '' the crowning feature of
Leighton House	ORGANIZATION	, which he designed , with the help of Mr.
George Aitchison	PERSON	, as a harmonious setting for his wonderful collection of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	enamels , and which , now that
Leighton House	ORGANIZATION	is open to the public , furnishes an additional proof of the breadth of his artistic tastes and interests .

		The year after his ascent of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	,
Leighton	PERSON	was elected to full membership in the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		During the nine years that inter - vened before his election as president he worked faithfidly to further the interests of the Acad - emy .

		One of his innovations was the winter exhibition of
Old Masters	ORGANIZATION	, undertaken in order that students who could not go abroad might receive a stimulus from seeing examples of the greatest art .

		His chief object in making colored studies when he travelled was to benefit these same students , whose interests he had constantly at heart .

		At the same time he was busy and productive as a painter .

		Even his election to the presi - dency of the Academy made no break in his habit of painting regularly from nine to twelve and from one to four every day .

		His care - fidly prepared public addresses , from which Mrs.
Barrington	PERSON	quotes at length , his work in the Academy council , involving careful research and tiresome correspondence , his efforts in be - half of provincial and colonial exhibitions , his active interest in the
British Museum	ORGANIZATION	, of which he was elected a trustee in
1881	DATE	, were all at - tended to '' out of hours . ''

		During the seven - teen years of his presidency he exhibited eighty canvases and two statues at the Academy , and forty-one slighter works elsewhere .

		Yet he was never too busy to hunt out and encourage a poor artist , or to give his time and influence to any project for the betterment of English art .

		When his strength began to fail and friends implored him to rest , he answered , '' But that would not be life to me !

		I must go on , think - ing as little about it as possible . ''

		He fought his losing fight as gaily and as gallantly as years before he had fought a win - ning one .

		His letters to his widowed sisters , written while he was travelling in a vain search for health , -- '' sowing patience and reaping nothing in particular , '' as he put it , -- are full of hope and good cheer .

		The
Sunday	DATE	before he died he was busUy planning for one of his famous concerts , and when , on the day before his death , he rallied unexpectedly , he exclaimed to his sisters , '' Would it not have been a pity if I had had to die just when I was going to paint better ! ''

		Mrs.
Barrington	PERSON	's exposition of
Leighton	PERSON	's theories of art and her criticism of his paint - ings are just and discriminating , and she offers interesting critical comment from
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Watts	LOCATION	,
Briton Riviere	PERSON	, Sir
William Richmond	PERSON	,
Walter Crane	PERSON	,
Hamo Thomycroft	PERSON	, and others , many of whom have furnished notes especially for her use .

		She fully appreciates
Leighton	PERSON	's artistic limitations , and if she has little but praise for the man she is evidently sincere and probably just .

		Two popular fallacies about
Leighton	PERSON	, which traced his avoidance of general society to snobbishness , and his success to an easy sacrifice of conviction to popular standards , she thor - oughly disproves .

		* Professor Amiinius .

		Vambery , of the Uni - versity of
Budapest	LOCATION	, is unquestionably the best - informed living authority on the history and civilization of
Moslem Asia	LOCATION	.

		Fifty years of study and observation among the peoples of the central Asiatic deserts , pursued often in the guise of friar or merchant , have given him a keen insight into Moslem life and character ; and this , combined with ripe historical and philo - logical scholarship , qualifies him in an excep - tional degree for the production of such a book as that which has recently come from his pen under the title of '' Western Cidture in Eastern Lands . ''

		In many publications , beginning with '' Sketches of
Central Asia	LOCATION	'' issued
thirty-six years ago	DATE	, Professor
Vambery	PERSON	has given the * Western Culture in

England	LOCATION	and

		312 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, world vivid descriptions of the governments , religions , customs , and general state of society prevailing in the broad stretches between the Caspian and
Chinese Turkestan	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his latest book he essays a new and more ambitious task -- more ambitious , at least , if performed in the conscientious fashion characteristic of the author 's past labors .

		This new undertaking is a comparative study of the aims , methods , and achievements of the Occident 's two great '' cidture-bearers '' in central
Asia	LOCATION	, i.e. ,
Russia	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		Those who are familiar with Professor
Vam	PERSON	- b ^ ry 's writings know him to be no admirer of
Russia	LOCATION	and Russian civilization .

		One need not be surprised , therefore , to learn from the pre - fatory page that the fundamental object of the present work is to prove the erroneousness of the common idea that the Russians , who in many respects are themselves still semi -
Asiatic	LOCATION	, are better fitted to undertake the civilization of
Asia	LOCATION	than the English , the accomplished repre - sentatives of Western culture , whose stiff bear - ing and unpliable character are supposed to be detrimental to its successful transmission .

		If this were Professor
Vambery	PERSON	's first book , the impression of the reader , at first glance at least , would doubtless be that it constitutes essentially an effort to maintain a more or less precon - ceived thesis ; for the subject is one which has lent itself too often to loose and superficial generalization .

		But inasmuch as the author 's views on the subject have long been known to be taking gradual shape with the development of his studies , the book appeals to one rather as a deliberate and systematic exposition of a judgment arrived at only after painstaking and disinterested investigation .

		The volume falls naturally into three parts , treating respectively of the civilizing influence of
Russia	LOCATION	, the civilizing influence of
England	LOCATION	, and the future of Islam .

		The nineteenth cen - tury is conceived of by Professor
Vambery	PERSON	as the second great epoch of
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	interfer - ence with the affairs of the nearer Orient , the period of the late Roman republic and early empire being the first ; though it would seem that the Alexandrian age and the era of the Crusades might well be added to the list .

		The question as to the rightfulness of this
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	interference in our own day is raised , but is promptly dismissed with the declaration that without western help
Asia	LOCATION	'' will never rise above its low level , '' and even though the politics of European powers in
Asia	LOCATION	are far from unselfish , culture and liberty can never come to Asiatics except thi'ough influences whoUy foreign .

		In a succession of semi-historical and semi-des - criptive chapters , the author then sketches the establishment of Russian authority over the various peoples of southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	and cen - tral
Asia	LOCATION	-- the Ural-Altaics in the fifteenth century , the Ugrians in the sixteenth , the Turco-Tartars in the sixteenth and seventeenth , and the peoples of Turkestan in the latter half of the nineteenth .

		Russian operations and in - fluences in the three khanates of the last - mentioned region are singled out for somewhat detailed analysis .

		The general conclusion is that the rule of the Muscovite , however tyran - nical and corrupt , is at least considerably better than that of the former native princes .

		But after this is conceded , the author goes on to point out serious defects in the Russian system , and to show why , after forty years of Russian administration , the khanates are '' very far from having reached that degree of intellectual and material development which might have been attained , considering the adaptability of the sub - jugated peoples and the means at the disposal of the Russian Crown . ''

		The many defects and abuses connected with the Russian system he conceives are the unreliability and vicious char - acter of
mo %	PERCENT	t of the officials , the arrogance and contempt for the natives which they generally display , and the indifference of the government to anything but political aggrandizement .

		Full recognition , however , is given the good which the Russians have accomplished . ''

		Everyone will gladly concede that in many quar - ters of the ancient world , where anarchy , robbery , and starvation formerly reigned , the Russian regime has created a certain amount of order ; it has made peace - ful intercourse possible , and given
Europe	LOCATION	access to many formerly inaccessible regions .

		But it would be difficult to see in these and many other advantages of civilization , which chiefly benefit the Russian Govern - ment , a ground for believing that the intellectual eleva - tion and enlightenment of the Asiatic can and will be brought about under the guardianship of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is only by the refining influence of culture , and the inde - fatigable and continued efforts in the matter of educa - tion , that any good results can be expected , and in this respect the
Russian Government	ORGANIZATION	has been most defi - cient .

		... A sober and unprejudiced judgment must lead us to the conclusion that the forty years of Russian government in
Central Asia	LOCATION	have so far only touched the surface of social life .

		True , they have left a slight impression on the external forms , but they have not penetrated into the inner parts .

		All that can be seen of reform or modernization in the life of the
Turkestani	PERSON	is of superficial and compulsory nature ; it emanates from fear of the conqueror , and its chief object is to please the foreign lords , and to make them more friendly disposed . ''

		The reason why
Russia	LOCATION	's attempts to civilize
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 313 her conquests have been so ineffectual , Professor Vambery considers to be that in
Russia	LOCATION	herself the staindards of culture and of political educa - tion are still so imperfect .


Russia	LOCATION	is yet far short of that stage of development which would enable her to stand as the representative of the true spirit of modern advancement . ''

		Russian culture is only half European , and still half
Asiatic	ORGANIZATION	, and although modern
Russia	LOCATION	has produced a few great personalities , yet taken as a whole its edu - cation is only half finished , and not matured enough to make it the successful civilizer of other entirely or semi - barbaric societies . ''

		The popular idea that this semi - Asiatic char - acter is a valuable asset in the government of Asiatic populations , that it facilitates mutual sympathy between riders and subjects and makes assimilation easier , is flatly rejected by the author .

		Quite to the contrary , he maintains that this is a serious disqualification , because while the process of '' Russification '' checks any natural development in the coimtries concerned , the western civilization , being only partial and poorly represented , makes little or no impres - sion on them .

		While criticizing sharply the work of the Russians , Professor Vambery is fair enough to point out the unusual difficulties with which they have had to contend , partic - ularly the unyielding antagonism of Islam and the inbred attachment of the Turcomans to their old tribal institutions .

		He closes his survey with this broad-minded observation : '' Judging dispassionately and without prejudice , we must frankly acknowledge that the Russians have done much good work in
Asia	LOCATION	; that with their advent order , peace , and security have taken the place of anarchy and lawlessness , and that notwithstanding the strongly Oriental coloring of their political , social , and ecclesias - tical institutions , as representatives of the western world , they have everywhere made a change for the better , and inaugurated an era more worthy of humanity . ''

		England as a '' culture-bearer '' in
Asia	LOCATION	is considered , quite naturally , in relation to her work in
India	LOCATION	, though the divergence between conditions prevailing there and in the Russian poi-tions of the continent is so stupendous as to render comparisons extremely liable to fallacy .

		Professor
Vambery	PERSON	's chapters tracing the rise , progress , and present state of the British do - minion in
India	LOCATION	cover familiar ground in a very interesting fashion , but the significant things he Eas to say are with respect to the causes of British success in transplanting European civili - zation to Asiatic soil .

		These causes he is able to reduce to a single phrase -- the humane and enlightened spirit of British administration .

		English administrators have been successful in introducing reforms in
India	LOCATION	which the natives would not have tolerated at the hands of their fellow-countrymen , purely because of the fair spirit in which these innovations were conceived and executed .

		Public improvements , education , morals , charities , have been greatly stimulated ; and the system of taxation inaugurated by the English Professor Vambery considers '' more advanced than any of the independent Moslem states , more advanced , even , than in many European lands . ''

		In a chapter of comparisons and contrasts , the author undertakes to show how , in aims and methods and equally in achievements , the empire-building of Englishman and Russian have been wholly unlike .

		For one thing ,
Russia	LOCATION	meets conquered peoples as the uncompromising champion of Christianity , and compels their immediate conversion -- thereby insuring their hatred at the start ; while
England	LOCATION	has never attacked , or in any manner sought to subvert , the faiths of her dependent peoples .


Russia	LOCATION	, in the course of her conquests , is declared never to have failed , as soon as her power was sufficiently established , to exercise a disquieting influence , not only upon the political , but also upon the ethical , social , and religious life of the people , in order to simplify the process of absorption ; while in all of
England	LOCATION	's proceedings a policy which is essentially the reverse stands out clearly . ''

		The Russian conqueror is content when he finds his sub - jects tractable , quiet , punctilious tax-payers and willing tools .

		In his endeavours in the field of general national culture and enlightenment , his chief care is to teach the Asiatic the elements of school learning in the Russian language ; and amongst the Tartars ,
Kirghises	PERSON	, and Sarts , only those whose intention it was to become entirely Russified have devoted themselves to higher education .


Russia	LOCATION	has never concerned itself much about the sym - pathies of its foreign subjects ; its iron grasp is never slackened by any softer considerations , and in the whole length and breadth of its conquered dominions we seldom come across any Asiatics who express themselves pleased with the Russian regime , and voluntarily conform to the new regulations under the Tsar 's administration ; enthu - siasm is certainly never entertained .

		With the English it is quite different .

		They have always consulted the wel - fare of the people under their charge ; they are anxious that the reforms and innovations introduced should be just and fair ; wherever possible they have exercised charity and forbearance ... The English are not nearly so much hated and feared in
India	LOCATION	as the Russians are in
Central Asia	LOCATION	, for the most thorough-going , anti-foreign Hindu can not shut his eyes to the justice , the imparti - ality , and the good intentions of the sahibs .

		Perfect imdivided affection can hardly be looked for , for the foreigner ruler is never an object of devotion ; but the respectwhich theHindu can not withhold from his foreign master may in time turn to sympathy , and the relation between master and subject may before very long be - 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, come quite tolerable ... The view that
Russia	LOCATION	will be better qualified than
England	LOCATION	to civilize
Asia	LOCATION	is altogether false .

		A politically free nation , occupying a higher cultural level , has more active measures at its disposal , has more strength and perseverance , and has nobler ends in view , than a nation which has scarcely emerged from infancy , which is as yet in the first period of cultural transition , and which , moreover , held fast in the bonds of a despotic absolute monarchy , has been unable to acquire the knowledge necessary for cultural activity .

		It is scarcely to be expected of a nation which itself has still so much to learn , that it will be able to teach others to work with better results than
Russia	LOCATION	has done so far . ''

		However frequently one may be disposed to take issue with Professor Vambery in his as - sumptions and conclusions , the scholarly merits of his work must be recognized at every turn .

		He occasionally falls into a panegyrical strain which is ill-advised , as , for example , when he exclaims exultingly -LRB- p. 259 -RRB- that ''
England	LOCATION	's victories are the victories of freedom and hu - manity ; they can never be dangerous to any - one . ''

		But these lapses are not frequent , and they probably flow from the author 's vivacity of style rather than from any inherent faults in his thought .

		* We have often thought , and now and then said , that when the Great American Novel came to be written it would have for its leading motive the con - trast between successful parents and their degenerate children , a contrast so frequently , and at times so dramatically , illustrated in our national life as to assume typical significance .

		This is the motive of '' The Second Generation , '' by Mr.
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	, as the title clearly implies .

		Unfortunately , Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has no style , and thus his management of a strongly-conceived situation becomes bald and unconvincing .

		He tells us the story of a successful manufacturer , sprung from the plain people , who dis - covers that his children -- a son and a daughter -- have grown up without any sense of social responsi - bility , and with no idea that life is to mean for them anything more than an unbroken round of selfish pleasures .

		him to encourage these low ideals , the old man makes a will which leaves the bulk of his fortune to a uni - versity , reducing his children from the idle luxury they have anticipated to the level of homely comfort .

		It is a hard blow to them , and resented with anger and bitterness , but they have good ancestral stuff in their composition , and in the end their loss proves their salvation .

		The greater part of the book is devoted to the slow working out of the regeneration of these two young lives .

		The moral of the story is so fine and true , despite a slight tincture of un - wholesome socialism , that we could wish the author 's literary gift were in proportion to his ethical insight .

		In the present competition among our amateur sociologists to produce the most distressful fiction possible , we should say that the honors are at present with Mr.
Brand Whitlock	PERSON	.

		`` The Turn of the Balance '' is about as gloomy a picture of contem - porary life as has thus far been produced , even in these days in which we learn that we are living in jungles ravaged by octopods .

		Aside from the love - story , there is not a ray of light in the book from beginning to end , and the love-story is so clearly a perfunctory concession to a useless convention that it does n't seriously count .

		This '' vivid picture of the savage cruelty at the heart of our boasted civ - ilization , '' as the publishers magniloquently call it , is a piece of imitation Zolaism which depends for its effects upon sensational exaggeration and the accumulation of a careful selection of horrible details ; justice is everywhere thwarted , and evil triumphs at all points .

		The reforms in the administration of justice which Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	has at heart , and which are doubtless needed , are not likely to be furthered by such a book as this , which is chiefly remarkable as an exhibit of the criminal under-world , its view - point , its customs , and its speech .

		The author seems to be an expert in the use of argot , and displays his knowledge of the criminal vocabulary to an extent that makes him unintelligible for pages at a time .

		`` The Upstart , '' by Mr.
Henry M. Hyde	PERSON	, is a homely story of old-fashioned construction , telling how a boy of humble birth rises in the world by his own efforts , gets an education under difficulties , goes into politics and defeats his rivals , and triumphantly carries off , in the face of violent paternal opposition , the girl whom he has loved all his life .

		The scene is a country town in
Michigan	LOCATION	, and the various types of character among its inhabitants , native and foreign , are sketched with the fidelity that comes only from close observation .

		It is a realistic nar - rative , simple and straightforward , with touches of humor , and impretentiously successful in its execu - tion .

		One would fancy that at this late day a nov - elist would be rather ashamed to produce another Zenda romance -- the trick is so easy , the scenario so distinctly planned , and the stage-setting so worn by use .

		But Mr.
William Tillinghast Eldridge	PERSON	lias ventured to mount the piece once more .

		His book is called ``
Hilma	PERSON	, '' which is the name of the princess , his scene is the kingdom of
Scarvania	LOCATION	, and he trots
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL S16 out all the old mummers -- the rival claimant with his sinister partisans , the devoted followers of the heroine , and the American hero of superhuman courage .

		In reading a romance of this type , about the only thing we care to find out is whether the American gets the princess ; in the present instance , while he renounces her for the time being he still has hopes , and we are not called upon to shed many tears .

		The story is told in nervous and sometimes ungrammatical English , and its nomenclature rivals that of '' Graustark '' for weirdness .

		We have had many novels concerned with actors and actresses , and usually the artificiality of the life portrayed has been reflected in the treatment .

		The first thing to say about Miss
Laughlin	PERSON	's '' Felicity '' is that it is free from the fault in question ; there is no garishness in the light which it casts upon its characters , who are exhibited as essentially normal creatures , superficially afPected , of course , by the accidents of their profession , but evidently human beings in the natural and familiar sense .

		Neither does the book invest the life of the stage with any - thing of the false glamour which it is apt to have in the eyes of unthinking people , especially young people ; nor , on the other hand , does it suffer from anything remotely suggestive of pharisaical pre - judice .

		Its actress-heroine lives the life theatrical from her earliest childhood , but her character is not drawn from footlight observation .

		Miss
Laughlin	PERSON	's acquaintance with the conditions of stage-life is evidently considerable , but she knows other aspects of life as well , and knows that the actor is at bottom the same sort of person as may be found in almost any occupation that is not merely mechanical .

		Of course , the nature of the actor 's calling cuts him off from that continued association with the same peo - ple and scenes which is the richest possession of normally-constituted human beings , and deprives him of the strength that can come only from a rooted existence .

		That this loss should be recognized to the full is a vital requirement of the book of theatrical fiction , and the fact that the present writer does so recognize it -- that she makes it the leading motive of her story -- is the best tribute we can pay to her artistic sincerity .

		Her Felicity is a bright and winsome creature , a histrionic genius and the idol of the public , but these facts are never allowed to obscure certain other facts more humanly signi - ficant -- her longings for friendship , for the intimate ties of family affection , for the holy bond of mar - ried love .

		From these her profession in large measure precludes her , and she is not compensated for missing them by any amount of public adula - tion or any degree of worldly prosperity .

		An ele - ment of almost tragic pathos comes into the story when she marries an easy-going and superficially polished fellow-actor , and desperately tries to idealize his commonplace nature .

		There is more real tragedy in this situation than in the episode of his melo - dramatic murder which ends the brief term of their wedded life .

		We are given to understand that she afterwards marries the right man , but this we must take largely on trust , for , although he has been a friend from childhood , and makes intermittent appearances all through the book , he remains a shadowy personality .

		The failure to make this man convincing is the most noticeable fault of the book , which is , after all , a first novel , which means that faults are inevitable .

		But it is , on the whole , a novel of such interest and charm that we are con - tent to accept it , with whatever defects may accom - pany its qualities , as one pi the most pleasing con - tributions to the season 's output of fiction .

		Miss
Margaret Potter	PERSON	has written the second of her series of Russian novels , and called it '' The Princess . ''

		It is an intense and tragic story of the Princess
Catharine	PERSON	, descended from
Alexander I.	PERSON	, and of her son Constantine .

		The Princess is de - lineated as a woman of great nobility of character , wedded to a dissolute Grand Duke , and bearing with dignity the perpetual affront of his libertine life .

		Her son is the chief object of her affections , and , as she watches over his development , she observes with horror that he is fast following in his father 's foot - steps .

		The climax is reached when both father and son fall into the toils of the same Italian adventuress .

		For a time neither suspects the other , although the scandal is known to everybody else in
Petersburg	LOCATION	, but discovery is inevitable , and when it comes the horror-stricken son takes his own life .

		The scene of this story is placed about ten years ago , and actual persons are freely introduced into the author 's pages .

		Sometimes , as in the case of the Tsar
Nicholas	PERSON	, they appear under their real names , at others in trans - parent disguises , such as de Windt for de
Witte	ORGANIZATION	, and Doshoudoneff for Pobiedonostseff .

		An important figure in the narrative is the ghost of the composer Tschaikowsky -LRB- here called
Ivan Gregoriev	PERSON	-RRB- , who acts as a sort of tutelary genius to the characters chiefly concerned , and materializes at critical mo - ments just long enough to express his sympathy and deliver himself of some excellent ghostly advice .

		It is a pity that Miss
Potter	PERSON	should have resorted to this trick of supernaturalism , which seriously weakens her book .

		Miss Mm `` free seems to alternate pretty regularly between romantic inventions of the historical past -LRB- with Indians -RRB- and pictures of modern life .

		Her scene is always the same -- that region of the
Great Smoky Mountains	LOCATION	which she has made so com - pletely her own for literary purposes .

		Her histor - ical romance of '' The Amulet , '' which we recently reviewed , is now followed by `` The Windfall , '' which is a novel of present-day conditions .

		We welcome the familiar description , colored and atmos - pheric , with which the book opens ; it has become reduced to a fairly definite formula now , but it never quite loses its freshness .

		Miss
Murf	PERSON	ree 's latest hero is an itinerant showman , who has set up his booths and tents in the town of Colbury for the entertainment of the countryside population .

		His troupe is in des - perate straits , and achieves only a dubious success in this last desperate venture to retrieve its foi `` tunes .

		But our interest is soon diverted from the show , 316 THE DIAL -LSB-

summer	DATE	visitors .

		There is an interesting young woman in each group , and either would make an acceptable heroine ; as a mat - ter of fact , the primitive beauty of the one proves no match for the cultivated charm of the other , with whom the showman falls rather precipitately in love .

		Fate smoothes the way for him by revealing his gentle birth and making him the heir to large estates .

		This is the '' windfall '' which gives the book its name .

		The writer shows herself still capa - ble of using the old material to excellent effect , although it would be foolish to deny that she has worked the vein until it shows signs of exhaustion . ''

		The Iron Way '' is a tale of the buUding of the
Central Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author , Mrs.
Sarah Pratt Carr	PERSON	, is the daughter of a man who held a responsible position in connection with the work of construction , and her childhood was literally spent on the road , moving with her family from one con - struction camp to another , as the track slowly made its way eastward .

		She is thus able to draw upon her personal recollections for most of the material out of which she has built this vivid narrative of pioneer experience .

		To satisfy the imperious de - mands of the novel-reader , she has invented a love - story of the conventional sort , but the chief interest of her tale centres about the railroad itself , and the amazing energy displayed by its promoters -- the '' big four '' of
California	LOCATION	history -- in overcoming the obstacles set by nature and human perversity in the way of the enterprise .

Lady Swettenham	PERSON	, to whom the editor has dedicated the volume .

		But a great part of the journal is devoted to things personal and domestic ; hence the propriety of its private circulation when , five years after the writer 's death , it first saw the light in a modest way .

		One regrets that Lady

		The author deplores the prevalence of a culture that is but skin-deep and a learning that is only a smat - tering .

		But even smattering he seems not utterly to despise , for surely no book could appeal more peculiarly to smatterers than does this ingenious collection of fact and fancy , history and anecdote , politics and society chit-chat .

		He was very familiar with the history of the star , and felt as if a personal ac - quaintance were looking down at him .

		An atti - tude of mind similar to this is manifested by
Martha Evans Martin	PERSON	in her volume entitled '' ' The Friendly Stars '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- ; she wishes to interest her readers so that they too may take delight in the celestial bodies which beam so cheerfully upon us from their far-away fastnesses .

		The opening chapter on the rising and setting of the stars is followed by one in which the brightest stars are described in a general way ; after this a number of chapters are given to descriptive matter about each of certain notable stars , such as
Arcturus	LOCATION	,
Vega	PERSON	, and the brilliants which be - stud
Orion	ORGANIZATION	's giant form .

		We are informed of their sizes , their distances , their colors , the seasons of the year at which they rise and set near sunset , and of other facts which lend to them a human interest .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.

Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Rivers	PERSON	's especial investigations lay in the direction of the social organization and the system of kinship in vogue among these people .

		The Todas are a purely pastoral people , limiting their activities almost entirely to the care of their buffaloes and to the complicated ritual which has grown up in association with these animals .

		Their religion is based fundamentally upon their dairy work , and their lives are indissolubly bound up with attention to these sacred beasts . ''

		The sacred ani - mals are attended by men especially set apart who form the Toda priesthood , and the milk of the sacred animals is churned in dairies which may be regarded as the Toda temples and are so regarded by the people themselves . ''

		No feature -LRB- and there are hundreds of complicated features -RRB- of their peculiar worship is overlooked by Mr.
Rivers	PERSON	; in fact , he has loaded his study with such minute detail that it sometimes obscures the general course of his dis - cussion .

		After describing the elaborate ceremonial which centres around the dairy , the author describes other sacred ceremonies and institutions , discusses the general features of their religion , considers their social life , their ceremonies of birth , growth , and death , their sacred days and superstitions , and closes his volume of eight hundred pages with an account of the relations of the Todas to the other tribes of the Nilgiris , and their origin and affinities .

		Readers of `` The Pedagogues '' wiU remember that early story of Mr.

		His later novel , '' The Ancient Grudge , '' also pictures the victim of seductive self-deception in the brilliant but super - ficial architect ,
Stewart Lee	PERSON	, and in the pompously philanthropic millionaire Halket .

		From Mr.

		Because it might draw upon him comparison to his disadvantage , he does not utter freely his carping criticism of the active ; but he bears in mind how much better he himself would do this or that if it were not for some forbidding circumstance . ''

		The chapter entitled '' The Smoking-Room '' is all the better for being written by a non-smoker , a shrewdly observant on-looker with no fumes from his own pipe or cigar to dim the clearness of his vision .

		Enjoyment of these agreeable and often illuminating studies in human nature -- most of which , by the way , are reprinted from the ''

		The corvee , or enforced days of labor , was rigidly de - manded by the seignior , as well as a share of the fisheries and ferry receipts .

		In
1850	DATE	, the very last of the seigniorial rights was purchased by appro - priations made by the
Canadian Parliament	ORGANIZATION	for that purpose , and the feudal system was at an end in
America	LOCATION	.

		The monograph is in keeping with the high standard of scholarship shown in preceding volumes of the series .

		VasarVs ' '' ` Lives '' in new form .

		It is evidence of some real saving grace in a book when new editions of it are still published after three and one-half centuries .

		That
Giorgio Vasari	PERSON	's '' Lives of the Italian Artists , '' first published in
1550	DATE	, continues to be republished , retranslated , and reedited , shows that it is one of the books that we can not do without .

		We may and do reject many of
Vasari	PERSON	's stories , for we know that he never con - sulted a document , that mere accuracy was a minor virtue in his mind , that personal bias entered largely into his appraisements , so that to be born -LRB- like him - self -RRB- in
Arezzo	LOCATION	, or to be a follower -LRB- like himself -RRB- of
Michelangelo	LOCATION	, was the surest passport to an honor - able place in his hierarchy .

		But all these deductions being made , it stiU remains true that he knew what he was talking about , being himself both architect and painter ; that he had seen personally nearly everything he described ; and that , more than any of his contemporaries , he was gifted with a narrative power and a dramatic sense which not only set him above all biogi-aphers of his own time , but keeps him among the best of all time . ''

		The Florentine masters , '' it has been said , '' are the Dr.
Johnsons	PERSON	of Art ; they are so much more fascinating in the pages of their
Boswell	PERSON	than in their own works . ''

		This is so true that the names of some artists whose works are merely second-rate have been perpetuated almost solely because of their mention by
Vasari	PERSON	.

		A selection from the '' Lives '' is therefore of value , and such we now have in a handsome volume ar - ranged and translated by
E. L. Seeley	PERSON	and published by
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		We in
this twentieth century	DATE	have a great advantage over those for whom
Vasari	PERSON	wrote , in being able to have before our eyes reproductions of the pictures mentioned in the text .

		The eight colored plates in Mr.
Seeley	PERSON	's volume are of special beauty ; there are also twenty - four full - page half-tones .

		Many scholars have wrestled with aVouZTsoti .

		the Book Of Job .

		Its problem has been one of the mysteries of the
Bible	LOCATION	, about which writers have agreed and disa - greed for twenty centuries .

		But there is universal agreement that it is one of the most interesting pieces of the literature of ancient times .

		Its pre - sentation in the form of a drama , though not pre - cisely of such a drama as we find in classic times , lends to it uniqueness .

		Within recent times many books have appeared that have for their purpose the popularization of this great work .

		The most notable of these is Professor
Genung	PERSON	's `` The Epic of the Inner Life , '' which sets forth the hero , Job , with all his inner struggles and conflicts , making the work '' a record of a sublime epic action , whose scene is the solitary soul of a righteous man . ''

		The newest is entitled '' Studies in the Book of Job , '' by the Rev.
Francis N. Peloubet	PERSON	, famed throughout the Sunday-school world for his '' Select Notes on the International Lessons . ''

		His wide experience in preparing pedagogical literature has been tellingly utilized in the production of this book .

		He has collected striking quotations from scores of sources , and has so arranged his matter that by its aid a class or an individual wishing to do real work in this field can do it in an effective and interesting manner .

		A full bibliography , chai ` ts , plans , and modern methods of study , give the student or teacher a real vade mecum on this most troublesome but fascinating book of the Old Testament -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 319 BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		The Romantic Revolt , '' by Professor
Charles Edwyii Vaughan	PERSON	, is added to the series of '' Periods of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean Literature , '' edited by Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	and pub - lished by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		The series is now within a single volume of completion , and needs only the treatment of the later nineteenth century that the editor has allotted to himself to give us the satisfac - tion of viewing the twelve volumes in a row .

		Mr.
Vaughan	PERSON	's book , just published , covers the
last quarter of the eighteenth century	DATE	and the earliest years of its successor .

		It is an exceptionally interesting period , and the book is exceptionally readable .

		The chapter on
Germany	LOCATION	is the longest , as it should be , for it is con - cerned with the great period of German literature and thought , with
Lessing	PERSON	,
Schiller	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Kant	PERSON	. ''

		The Shirburn Ballads , '' edited by Mr.
Andrew Clark	PERSON	, and published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, is a volume which now makes public for the first time a manuscript contained in the library of the
Earl of Macclesfield	ORGANIZATION	,
Shirburn Castle	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxfordshire	LOCATION	.

		The manuscript dates from the
early seventeenth century	DATE	, and most of the eighty ballads are new to scholarship .

		Such of them as are dated range from
1585	DATE	to
1616	DATE	, which is almost exactly the period of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's creative activity , a fact which students of our great dramatist will appre - ciate .

		As the editor remarks , this collection helps to bridge over the gap between the earlier ballads and those of the post-Restoration period .

		The variety offered is considerable ; there are ballads of religion and of poli - tics , festive ballads and ballads of earthquakes and monsters .

		They are evidently copied from printed exemplars which were circulated in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		We have commented from time to time upon the separately-published sections of the '' Classified Cata ^ logue of the Carnegie Library of
Pittsburg	LOCATION	, '' and we now welcome the complete work in three stout volumes , aggregating nearly four thousand pages .

		The decimal system of classification is employed .

		Author and sub - ject indexes fill about one-half of the third volume .

		Descriptive annotation of titles is largely employed in this catalogue , a feature which makes the work valu - able for reference even to those who are not within reach of the particidar library whose resources are here displayed . ''

		Three Phi Beta Kappa Addresses , '' by Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, is a volume published by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The addresses are `` A College Fetich '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- , the Cromwell address -LRB-
1902	DATE	-RRB- , and `` Some Modern College Tendencies '' -LRB-
1906	DATE	-RRB- .

		A good deal has been said about Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's change of heart on the subject of the classics , as evidenced by a com - parison of the first and third of these addresses , but the author stoutly protests against the notion that there is any essential contradiction between the two deliverances .

		Three briefer papers , resulting from Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's rela - tions with
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, round out the volume to respectable dimensions .

		Mr.
W. G. Rawlinson	PERSON	's descriptive handbook to
Turner	PERSON	's '' Liber Studiorum , '' first published in
1878	DATE	, is now issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a thoroughly revised edition .

		During the thirty years since the first appearance of this work , Mr.
Rawlinson	PERSON	has accumu - lated a large amount of additional material , and the incorporation of this in the new edition makes his volume gtill more emphatically the most satisfactory commen - tary on the Liber now obtainable .

		Notes .

		A new edition -LRB- the seventh -RRB- of Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	's '' Birdcraft '' attests the popularity and use - fulness of that weU-known manual .

		There are illus - trative plates in profusion , and the volume has rounded corners for the purpose of making it pocketable .

		It takes a volume of nearly seven hundred pages to print '' A Catalogue of the Collection of Mammals in the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Illustrations of a num - ber of rare species add greatly to the value of this work , which has been prepared by Dr.

		NOTES 347 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 348 THE ABUSE OF QUOTATIONS .

		The '' Academy '' proposes a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Quotations .

		It would be an excellent idea , if only such a society could be given the power to administer appropriate punishments for the violation of its laws .

		The penalties should be graded as to severity , the heaviest being reserved for those blunders against which the public has been warned so repeatedly as to deprive the defence of igno - rance of any possible justification .

		We would suggest , as particularly deserving of heavy sen - tences , those offenders who credit
Walpole	LOCATION	with saying that '' Every man has his price , '' Buff on with asserting that '' The style is the man , '' Lee with relating that '' When Greek meets Greek , then comes the tug of war , '' and the Declaration of Independence with claiming that men '' All are born free and equal . ''

		The hardened crim - inality which is capable of these offences , and others of similar gravity , would seem to be out - side the scope of mercy , and in their cases no plea of extenuating circumstances should avail .

		Not exactly to be classed as malefactors , yet surely not to be acquitted of something verging upon criminal negligence , are those who per - petuate such misquotations as '' We are such stuff as dreams are made of , '' '' More matter and less art , '' and '' There is a soul of goodness in things evil . ''

		In these cases , the misquota - tion affects only a single insignificant word , and therein may be found some shadow of excuse for the errors , but a careful writer will take pains not to make even these trivial slips .

		Some sort of apology is also possible for the popular misquotation whose motive is the pithiness re - sulting from condensation .

		It is not a very serious matter to speak of '' a delusion and a snare , '' for few have ever hunted down Lord
Denman	PERSON	's words in the British law reports , and found them to be `` a delusion , a mockery , and a snare . ''

		Jefferson 's famous saying about office-holders is another example of this sort . ''

		Few die , and none resign '' is really an im - provement upon '' -LSB- Vacancies -RSB- by death are few ; by resignation , none . ''

		And even
Bulwer	PERSON	's '' In the lexicon of youth , which fate reserves For a bright manhood , there is no such word As Fail '' does not suffer from the common epigrammatic 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, misstatement , '' In the bright lexicon of youth there 's no such word as Fail , * ' although the violence done the original is serious and on the whole inexcusable .

		There is one particular form of misquotation that always excites our ire because of the sheer wantonness of the inaccuracy which it embodies .

		It is the quotation in which a word is changed to make it fit the construction of the context .

		We frequently hear concerning some person who seeks to escape the limitations of his en - vironment that `` No pent-up
Utica	LOCATION	contracts his powers , '' or are told in accents of scornful superiority about '' the mob of gentlemen who write with ease .

		* ' Now this substitution of `` his '' for `` your '' and of '' write '' for `` wrote '' is a device legitimate enough in itself , but the retention of the inverted commas is unpardon - able .

		It would be quite safe to leave them out ; no one woidd credit the writer with having originated the phrase .

		There aire many quota - tions that one should be ashamed to mark as such , so completely have they become a part of the common consciousness of educated people .

		When a phrase has acquired this universal cur - rency , anyone should feel free to use it without acknowledgment , and even to modify its ortho - dox form .

		It is an over-meticulous habit that marks such tags of speech as `` yeoman 's ser - vice '' and `` the ruling passion , '' and `` grind the faces of the poor , '' for everybody knows that they are older than the wi'iters who use them .

		But we insist that if quotations are marked , they shoidd be literally exact .

		This consideration leads us naturally to the overworked quotation , from which there seems to be no escape , short of turning hermit and eschewing the companionship of print .

		From the black type of the newspaper headlines and from the lips of after-dinner speakers called upon to make a few appropriate remarks , from the sophomorical essayist and from the garrulous retailer of gossip or anecdote , it emerges unabashed and extorts from reader or listener many an inward groan .

		It confronts us upon the printed page , and its deadly worl ^ of hebe - tation is done ere we are aware ; it is mingled with the spoken word , and a conventional polite - ness makes such cowards of us all that re - sentment is resti * ained and the offender goes unscathed -- presumably to multiply his offence to the distress of countless future victims .

		We are told for the thousandth time about the dearth of snakes in
Iceland	LOCATION	-LRB- or
Ireland	LOCATION	-RRB- and revile the memory of
St. Patrick	LOCATION	; we hear for the ten thousandth time that the maker of a nation 's ballads is more influential than the maker of its laws , and we wish that one
Fletcher	PERSON	of
Saltoun	PERSON	had succumbed in infancy to an ex - cess of oatmeal porridge .

		These are the expe - riences that make us realize how wise a man was Hobbes when he said -- but we refrain . ''

		Classical quotation , '' observed Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, '' is the parole of literary men all over the world . ''

		But he by no means intended his re - mark to apply to those innocents who speak of maintaining the '' statu quo , '' who remind us upon every jjossible pretext that aU
Gaul	PERSON	is divided into three parts , and who , with a cynical and sickly smile , murmur '' varium et mutabile ' whenever the subject of woman is under discus - sion .

		The shades of
Horace	PERSON	and
Virgil	PERSON	must experience a ghostly shudder when they com - pare notes about some '' upstart crow , beautified with our feathers , '' who makes pretentious use of their words to conceal the poverty of his own thought .

		It is an easy trick , this thoughtless employment of hackneyed tags from the classics , but it does not impose upon anyone whose opin - ion is worth considering .

		Admitting the truth of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's saying that '' next to the origina - tor of a good sentence is the first quoter of it , '' what shall we say of the last quoter thereof , espe - cially if the sentence is two thousand years old , and has been reduced by much use to a homoeo - pathic attenuation of its original potency .

		Quotations from foreign languages form a conspicuous feature of our more ephemeral current literature , and their use is an abuse in a great many cases .

		It would hardly be fair to complain of the way in which a novel by Du Maurier or Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	is interlarded with French or Italian phrases , because to those writers the foreign language in question is almost vernacidar , and we may be sure that accuracy and artistic discrimination will char - acterize whatever use is made of it .

		But it is different with the average young woman novelist who peppers her pages with foreign words -LRB- we may not call them strange words because use has made them distressingly familiar -RRB- for the sake of supposed effect .

		Many are the pitfalls that yawn for the writer of this venturesome sort , possessed of a smattering of the tongues , and into them she stumbles with unerring in - stinct .

		The pitfall of `` double entendre '' numbers its hundreds , and the pitfaiU of '' bete noir '' its thousands of victims .

		Even if actual syntactical dangers are escaped , the parade of linguistic attainment is more likely than not to be futile , either because it is clearly forced , or because it contributes nothing to the thought .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 329 There are occasions when the foreign word or phrase is inevitable , but in the majority of in - stances it serves only the purpose of making a pretentious show , and we can account for it only upon the theory that its exploiter reckons upon the carelessness or the ignorance of the reader .

		It is certainly desirable that something shoidd be done to direct the attention of reckless quo - ters to the error of their ways .

		Writers who can trust to memory for quotations other than those most familiar are rare indeed among the scribbling tribe .

		And every writer possessed of a conscience knows that the only safe rule is to verify his quotations before making them .

		Every such writer , moreover , has a distinct and shuddering recollection of particular perils which have in his own experience been averted only by adherence to this salutary practice .

		The suggestion of a
S. P. C. Q.	PERSON	is , of course , whimsical .

		It gave us an opening for this dis - cussion , but can hardly be expected to provide a close .

		The proper training of the literary conscience offers the only real remedy for the evil , and that is a difficult matter .

		It all comes back to the question of education , and we are inclined to believe that in science -- the science which the artistic temperament finds unconge - nial and affects to despise -- - the true remedy is to be found .

		This is the essential function of science in our educational systems , to create the habit of exactness in thought and speech , and the literary worker needs it in its most rigorous form quite as much as the physician or the engineer .

		Science alone provides the efficacious means for controlling all the vices of slovenli - ness , and impressionism , and imaginative va - grancy to which human nature is prone , and which are responsible , not only for the abuse of quotation , but also for many other kinds of even more serious mischief .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A TENDENCY TO RELAPSE INTO BARBARISM , ill Speccll as well as in manners , a disposition to obliterate in our use of language those finer distinctions and shades of meaning that are the slow growth of thousands of cen - turies of evolution , and to return to the more meagre and less specialized vocabulary of the savage , is ever present among the civilized .

		Daily we awake to the sense of some new loss due to our indolence and care - lessness .

		Useful words of ancient lineage lose their peculiar value by being allowed to become synonymous with other words which needed no new synonyms , and we are forced to various shifts to make good our losses -- if we can .

		Even so careful a writer as
George Eliot	PERSON	is guilty of euphuistically in the sense of euphemis - tically .

		The writers and speakers who any longer attempt to distinguish between proposition and proposal , or indeed who use the shorter form at all , are exceed - ingly few .

		Not long ago , at a rather turbulent meet - ing of Harvard students , gathered to hear Mr.
Stead	PERSON	on the subject of peace , the chairman .

		Professor
Miin	PERSON	- sterberg , who has the fine language-sense of a psychol - ogist and a scholar , had occasion to express himself very nearly as follows : '' Had I known this to be one of the objects of the meeting I shoidd not have con - sented to preside '' ; whereupon a bumptious under - graduate from the audience called out , '' I would not have consented , '' an unmannerly incorrection that was approvingly greeted with laughter and applause .

		So diligent have we been , even at
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
Massa	LOCATION	^ - chusetts , m eliminating our shalls and shoulds that now their correct use strikes the ear as a solecism .

		The
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	manifestation of relapse toward barbarism was one of speech and maimers at the same time .

		Perhaps the one tends to beget the other .

		• • • Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's reproof of
Boston	LOCATION	for hug - ging the memory of her glorious past is stoutly resented by that alert and patriotic New Englander , Mr.
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	, who refuses t & believe with our English critic that
Boston	LOCATION	no longer heads the procession of intellectual progress in
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, it will be remembered , asserts that '' there broods over the real
Boston	LOCATION	an immense effect of finality , '' which became fixed about
1875	DATE	.

		In rejoinder , Mr.
Mead	PERSON	pertinently points to the '' Atlantic Monthly '' as still in the lead among literary magazines ; declares that , with
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	just across the
Charles	PERSON	, and Tufts over in
Medford	LOCATION	, and
Boston	LOCATION	Uni - versity , and the
Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	, and
Simmons College	ORGANIZATION	, and all the rest , within the city limits ,
Boston	LOCATION	is still the chief seat of the higher education in
America	LOCATION	, as it is also a patron of the best music to be heard any - where ; and as for the modern intellectual movement , '' there is not in
London	LOCATION	a centre of discussion where the burning questions of social reform are threshed out so freely and thoroughly as in the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	's
Saturday	DATE	afternoons . ''

		But Mr.
Mead	PERSON	is as tired as
Emerson	LOCATION	at last became of the foolishness of those who try to place
Boston	LOCATION	in `` a theatrical attitude of virtue to which she is not entitled and which she can not keep . ''

		He makes a good point in declaring that the more we study our past and our great poets , the more we live with and catch the spirit of these poets , the more clearly we shall see that in their day they formed the mere '' remnant , '' the '' mugwumps , '' the '' antis , '' whom the ever-conservative mass of commonplace citi - zens smiled at ; and the more likely will the present
Boston	LOCATION	be to `` bring to our contemporary problems the radical and resolute spirit which they brought to theirs . ''

		All this will of course be as so much Chaldee or Assyrian to the intently forward-looking Englishman who stoutly refused even to travel the few miles between
Washington	LOCATION	and Mt.
Vernon	PERSON	for the sake of viewing what is historically the most interesting spot in
America	LOCATION	.

		• • • The expulsion of the crucifixes !

		What a title for a drama !

		It is the subject of a long , learned , and eloquent brochure by
Seiior Jos ^ Enrique Rod6 of Monte	ORGANIZATION	- video .

		He writes in protest against the action of the authorities of
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	in removing the Crucifixes from the Hospitals of that comitry , which may mean only a step in the new liberalism of
South America	LOCATION	.

		It 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, - is difficult to overstate what the Crucifix has been to the civilization of that continent .

		As the
Southern Cross	ORGANIZATION	looks down upon Andean peaks and valleys , upon Amazonian sylvas , upon La Plata 's plains , it sees every - where in town or village or cluster of houses or single hacienda its similar work the carved or gilded Christ dominating human habitations .

		These Crosses have been thus planted in every remotest recess by the fiery yet disciplined and devoted sons of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the native populations have been gathered around them and tamed and trained and made useful to themselves and to society .

		While we of the North have been marching to conquest under the oriflamme of Poor
Richard	PERSON	's Almanac , our neighbors to the South have developed a richly picturesque and imag - inative life under the sign of the
Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Dial has quoted before the answer made by the
Padre	LOCATION	of a Bolivian Mission to an American traveller who asked him what he taught the Lidians in his charge . ''

		Why , SeKor , '' he said in surprise , '' we teach them poetry and theology . ''

		And now the ideals of
Franklin	PERSON	seem to be winning over the ideals held by this simple-minded priest .

		We are afraid that it is inevitable , at least for a time , -- but it nevertheless seems a pity .

		• • • Pedigrees made to order for the American trade are often ridiculed , and justly , in the English journals .

		As an example , Mr.
Cyrus K. Jonker	PERSON	, a plain citizen of `` the states , '' is represented as arriving in
London	LOCATION	, where , with the help of the British Museum and a spe - cialist in ancestry , he speedily becomes the happy pro- prietor of a prefix , being thereafter known as
Cyrus K. de Jonker	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	.

		But why may not everyone who so desires lay fearless claim , even if not always in the direct male line , to royal or at least noble extraction ?

		Think of it a moment : Each one of us has , or had , four grandparents , eight great-grandparents , sixteen great - great-grandparents , and so on in geometrical progres - sion .

		We need go back only fifteen generations , or about five centuries , to find ourselves blessed with 65,536 ancestors -- diminished of course in some cases by the intermarriage of kin .

		Each one of this small army rejoiced in a like host of progenitors .

		Now what likelihood is there that , out of the millions who within recorded time are collectively responsible for our exist - ence , there was not some one or more in whose veins ran blue blood ?

		The lowly clodhopper is the heir of all the ages ; and the further back he has to go to find his regal or ducal ancestry , the greater the glory thereof .

		Let us all , then , without any foolish pedigree - hunting , unblushingly assume a rfe or a von or a van , or its equivalent in whatsoever tongue we prefer , and in imagination dwell forever after with the titled and great .

		The universality of the best literature is eloquently urged by Mr.
J. Alfred Spender	PERSON	in a read - able and sensible contribution to '' The Nineteenth Cen - tury . ''

		Style , simplicity , profundity , human appeal , -- these and other recognized qualities of good literature go naturally together , maintains Mr.
Spender	PERSON	; and he adduces the writings of
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and others of the immortals . ''

		I confess , '' says
Carlyle	PERSON	, '' I have no notion of a truly great man that could not be all sorts of men .

		The poet who could merely sit on a chair and compose stanzas would never make a stanza worth much . ''


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's influence , though he emphasized conduct and preached Hebraism , nevertheless made for culture in its narrower sense .

		Our writers , thinks Mr.
Spender	PERSON	, should be encouraged to be less careful of their reputa - tions and more prodigal of their gifts .

		We are again reminded that '' every generation needs living writers to interpret the present and even to re-interpret the past in the light of the present . ''

		The richer and fuller literature for which this writer declares the public is now ready and waiting will come , he is convinced , as soon as we '' banish the idea that popidarity is necessa - rily a mean art to be eschewed by good writers , and restore the true doctrine that literature is neither a trade to be pursued by inferior writers nor a secret to be guarded by superior writers , but the appeal of the best men to the greatest number of their fellow - countrymen . ''

		It is a much-discussed question -- our present literary needs and literary outlook -- that Mr.
Spender	PERSON	touches on , and we welcome his honest expres - sion of opinion .

		Nevertheless there will always be a gifted few , in all branches of art , whose appeal can not by any possibility reach '' the greatest number of their fellow-countrymen . ''

		To how few of his fellow - countrymen did Milton appeal !

		• • • The
Hispanic Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, which Mr.
Archer M. Hxmtington	PERSON	has been so active and so gener - ous in organizing and endowing , is pushing the work of cataloguing its treasures of art and literature now gathered in the society 's building at
Audubon Park	LOCATION	,
New York City	LOCATION	.

		There are at present in the library more than fifty thousand volumes in Spanish and
Portu	LOCATION	- guese , which the objects of historic and artistic interest in the museum help to illustrate and explain .

		A student reading in the library about fourteenth-century pottery , for example , may go upstairs to the museum and there see the very thing his author has described .

		In the words of the society 's secretary , Mr.
Mansfield L. Hillhouse	PERSON	, '' it is the intention of the society to make it possible here in
New York	LOCATION	to study the history , lan - guage , literature and art of
Spain	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	.

		At the present time the Spanish and English peoples do not understand each other .

		It is our purpose to do away with this misunderstanding . ''

		Our conflict with
Spain	LOCATION	, brief and one-sided and not exactly glorious though it was , has at least done good in quickening our interest in the history and literature and life of a picturesque and fascinating people , some small part of whose ancient prestige and prosperity seems now to be returning to sweeten the bitter cup of defeat in war .

		Curious and significant is the vitality of a conquered nation 's language and literature .

		Its tongue and its pen often prevail where its sword has proved least effectual .

		... The latest literary wrangle -LRB- of an unacrimoni - ous sort -RRB- reported from
London	LOCATION	, now that the
Benson	PERSON	-
Wright	PERSON	dispute over
Pater	LOCATION	is ancient history , is the disagreement between Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	and Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	over the latter 's life of Shakespeare just published in the '' English Men of Letters '' series .

		Especially does Mr.
Lee	PERSON	take issue with his fellow biographer on the question whether
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's writings reveal the author ; whether , as Mr.
Raleigh	PERSON	contends , ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	is the only biographer of Shake - speare , '' or , as Mr.
Lee	PERSON	is said to maintain , the work of so great a creative artist is essentially impersonal -- which was the opinion of another great creative artist ,
Robert Browning	PERSON	, as indicated in two of his poems .

		But even though a man may very easily write m such wise as to betray no secret of family history , is it after all
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 possible to write impersonally ?

		When a great author appears to achieve this impersonality we call it artistic detachment , and that itself , so far as it goes , is a self - revelation .

		The lesser author , striving to leave self behind and to attain the impersonal , becomes merely artificial and unconvincing ; and that likewise is a rev - elation of the writer -- a revelation , however , of his limitations .

		In one word , a
Bartlett	PERSON	pear tree can not bring forth crab apples , and men do not gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles .

		Were our vision keen enough we should always see the author in his works .

		Thk right paper and light for reading is a matter that must always concern him to whom , as the old Roman bookworm long ago expressed it , life with - out literature is death .

		Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	has given lis much earnest advice on the subject of eye-strain ; and now Dr.
Louis Bell	PERSON	, in a paper read before the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Sciences , cautions us to beware of excessive light and of glazed paper .

		For evening use the good old student lamp , easily adjustable , readily shaded , and , even with Standard Oil paying forty per cent , dividends , not costly to maintain , is rec - ommended .

		The naked Welsbach mantle , a terror to the rouged and faded beauty , is equally to be shunned by the night reader .

		Electric lamps likewise , even the incandescent , often err on the side of brilliance ; while the arc is only less objectionable than the pitiless lime - light .

		The shining paper so common in these days of half-tone illustrations , especially for magazine use , dazzles the eyes of one forgetful that the angle of re - flection is equal to the angle of incidence , and even with the utmost care is trying to the vision .

		Two authors of a recent work on hygiene , considerately re - fusing to violate one of its important principles , insisted that their book should be printed on dull paper , although at the sacrifice -LRB- grievous to the enterprising publishers -RRB- of attractive process-print embellishments .

		Let us hope that the era of glaze and glitter in bookmaking may soon be past .

Thomas Traherne	PERSON	's poems , in more accessible form than that of the first limited edition , ought to find their way to a considerable number of readers .

		In his now neglected essay on '' Urn Burial , '' Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	asks , '' Who knows whether the best of men be known , or whether there be not more remarkable persons forgot than any that stand remembered in the known account of time ? ''

		This query , though perhaps in other words , is one that naturally occurs to the reader of Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	's preface to the poems .

		By a most curious chain of accidents , and after an oblivion of two and a quarter centuries ,
Traherne	PERSON	was unearthed , and is now , it may be hoped , coming to his own , although his king - dom may not be of quite such splendor as his discoverer and editor would have us believe .

		But readers of Her - bert and

		• • • Literary leisure in the civil service seems to be considerable among our British cousins .

		According to '' The Academy , '' a large number of the manuscript novels received by
London	LOCATION	publishing houses are written on expensive paper bearing the government stamp .

		The inference is even drawn that '' the whole strength of the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	is engaged in the important work of literary production . ''

		Possibly these would-be authors are emulating the example of the late Andr ^ Theuriet , who spent a large part of his life in the office of the
Minister of Finance	ORGANIZATION	, but did not allow the daily grind to check the flow of beautiful poems and fascinating novels from his pen ; and at his death a few weeks ago he left a long list of these works of the imagination to his credit , besides having enjoyed Academic honors for the last ten years of his life .

		But our British civil servant has no Academy of Immortals to which he can hope to be elected , scribble he never so industriously .

		• • • An unappreciated public library is that located at
North Charleroi	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	.

		At the recent twenty-third annual meeting of the
North Charleroi Citizens ' Library Association	ORGANIZATION	the surprising announcement was made that in the last year only one of the four or five hundred inhabitants of the town had made use of the library , which can boast a collection of five hundred and fifty volumes wherewith to minister to the intellectual needs of the place .

		As one of the directors expressed it , ''
North Charleroi	LOCATION	seems to have found too many other amusements , such as roller-skating , dancing , bowling , and card-playing , to pay attention to good reading . ''

		The situation at
North Charleroi	LOCATION	very nearly realizes the ideal fondly cherished by the Bodleian librarian who thought his position would be a very tolerable one if the visitors would only keep away .

		The yellow-backed French novel in sober dress is now to be seen in
London	LOCATION	, bearing the imprint of the well-known publisher , Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	.

		It is reported to be this publisher 's purpose to issue a series of French books in cloth covers , instead of the customary yellow paper favored by the
Paris	LOCATION	trade .

		This innovation should appeal to the British reader , who is fond of things solid and lasting .

		In this form French fiction will no longer have to be read on the sly , and thrown into the closet at the sound of approaching footsteps .

		This outward dignity , too , may help to work a change for the better in the inward worth of the French roman .

		We have had the rehabilitated saloon ; why not now the rehabilitated French novel ?

Samuel Warren	PERSON	's one hundredth birthday , cel - ebrated last month , recalls the exuberant vanity of this ambitious and successful author .

		Not content to await the due meed of praise that would have come to him as the acknowledged author of '' Ten Thousand a Year , '' he chose to issue the book anonymously , and then did his best to make the authorship leak out accidentally and to the astonishment of a world consumed with curi - osity .

		His repeated asking of liis friends if they had any idea who wrote the great novel at last wearied one of them , who replied : `` Yes ,

		War Memoirs of a
Confederate IiEADER	ORGANIZATION	.

		* General
Alexander	PERSON	's '' Military Memoirs of a Confederate '' is remarkable for three reasons .

		First , it is a critical account of which the object '' is the criticism of each campaign as one would criticise a game of chess , only to point out the good and bad plays on each side , and the moves which have influenced the result . ''

		As an artil - lery officer the author had exceptional oppor - tunities for observing the battles of which he writes ; his position also prevented him from being involved in the controversies that arose later among the leaders who exercised independ - ent commands ; thus he has no course of his own to defend , no theory to maintain .

		Second , the work is noteworthy as a contribution from the Lower South .

		Heretofore nearly all Southern accounts of the war have been from the
Virgmia	LOCATION	point of view , -- and there is quite a difference between the way the average Virginian looks upon the war and the point of view of a Georgian or a Texan .

		The Virginian has always had that exalted opinion of himself , his people , and his state that the
New Englander	ORGANIZATION	has exhibited , and this feeling is faithfully re - flected in the post-helium writings , -- the rest of the South must give precedence to
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		This book will tend to correct the
Upper South	ORGANIZATION	notion that
Lee	PERSON	,
Jackson	PERSON	, and
Virginia	LOCATION	did it all ; the author , being a Georgian , feels no compunction in criticising
Virginia	LOCATION	leaders .

		Finally , it is the work of one who was a good soldier and is now a soimd philosopher as to the political results of the war , for like most other Confederates he insists that the causes and results of the war were political .

		An extract from the preface illustrates this .

		`` As to the causes of the war , it will , of course , be understood that every former
Confederate	ORGANIZATION	repudiates all accusations of treason or rebellion in the war , and even of fighting to preserve the institution of slavery .

		... Our struggle -LSB- was -RSB- ... for that right of self - government which the Englishman has claimed , and fought for , as for nothing else , since the days of
King John	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB- But -RSB- ... the world has not stood still m the years since we took up arms for what we deemed our most invaluable right ... We now enjoy the rare privilege of seeing what we fought for in the retrospect .

		It no longer seems so desirable .

		It would now prove only a curse .

		We have good cause to thank God for our escape from it , not alone for our sake , but for that of the whole country and even of the world .

		Had • Military Memoirs of a Confederate .

Critical Nar	ORGANIZATION	- rative .

E. P. Alexander	PERSON	.

		With portrait and maps .

		New York : Charles
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		our cause succeeded , divergent interests must have soon further separated the States into groups , and this continent would have been given over to divided nationalities . ''

		Nearly all will agree that it was well that the political theories for which the South fought were lost ; but some will still maintain that the real cause of the war was not political but social -- that is , the presence of the negro ; and that while the South lost , as it ought to have lost , its contention for state sovereignty , it finally maintained , perhaps even too successfully , its position in regard to the inequality of the races .

		The fimdamental cause of the war was negro slavery , and the fundamental outcome was the race problem .

		The South fought a long war for its '' corner stone , '' and then foimd that the relative status of the races could be maintained without slavery .

		So the ex-Confederates can easily give up the superficial political principle .

		The narrative is confined to accounts of those battles and campaigns in which the author was engaged .

		The most important chapters are those relating to the first and second battles of
Manassas	LOCATION	,
Seven Pines	LOCATION	, the Seven Days ,
Cedar Mountain	ORGANIZATION	,
South Mountain	LOCATION	,
Antietam	LOCATION	,
Freder	PERSON	- icksburg , ChanceUorsville ,
Gettysburg	LOCATION	,
Chick	ORGANIZATION	- amauga , the Wilderness , and
Petersburg	LOCATION	.

		The list shows that
Alexander	PERSON	was a busy soldier .

		The style is clear and simple ; there is no strain - ing for effect , no rhetorical outbursts .

		The comments upon the principal military leaders and their tactics and strategy will please the soldier and the student , but not the average reader or the hero-worshipper .

		For the scape - goats , however , --
McDowell	PERSON	, Huger ,
Long	LOCATION	- street ,
Porter	PERSON	,
Howard	PERSON	, and
Hooker	PERSON	, -- General
Alexander	PERSON	has good words ; for their failures , he says , others were often to blame .

		Naturally the weight of criticism falls upon the Confederate leaders , since the author was best acquainted with the conditions under which they operated .

		Upon Generals
Joe Johnson	PERSON	and
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	some severe judgments are passed .

		The latter is charged with shirking fight during the Seven Days battles in order to save his men and to hold
Sunday	DATE	prayer meet - ing , while
Johnson	PERSON	is said to have saved the fight for the Confederates by getting woimded and thus out of command .

		Of
McClellan	PERSON	, whom he thinks was often of great assistance to the Confederacy , it is said : '' He would have been an excellent chief of staff , but was imfit for the command of an army .

		He was as utterly without audacity as
Lee	PERSON	was full of it .

		His one fine quality was his ability to organize and discipline .

		He constructed a superb machine , which , being once
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 333 constructed , would fight a battle with skill and courage if only let alone .

		McClellan , during the Seven Days , let it alone , absenting himself as if by instinct .

		Never but at the battle of
Sharpsburg	LOCATION	was he present on any field , and his presence , by keeping
Porter	PERSON	's corps out of action , made a drawn fight of what would otherwise have been a Federal victory . ''

		The Confederate plan of carrying the war north of the
Potomac	LOCATION	is condemned as useless . ''

		No army , '' the author says , '' large enough to meet the Federal army , could support and supply itself by wagon-trains , ... for any length of time .

		Whenever , therefore , we crossed the Potomac going northward , we were as cer - tain to have to recross it coming southward , in a few weeks , as a stone thrown upward is cer - tain to come down . ''

		Such criticism , it appears to the reviewer , fails to take political motives into consideration .

		Lee went to
Sharpsburg	LOCATION	and to
Gettysburg	LOCATION	to win foreign recognition for the Confederacy .

		But , as
General Alexander	ORGANIZATION	shows ,
Lee	PERSON	's army at
Antietam	LOCATION	and at
Gettys	LOCATION	- burg was not well handled , nor were those fights well planned .

		In both places only the blunders of the Federals saved him .

		Of the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	fight it is said : '' The official reports are a painful record of insuffi - cient comprehension of orders and inefficient attempts at execution , by officers each able to shift the blame of failure upon other shoulders than his own .

		Between the lines the apparent absence of supervision excites constant wonder .

		But everywhere that the troops fought their conduct was admirable .

		... It must ever remain a grave reflection upon the Confederate conduct of the battle that the weakest part of the Federal posi - tion was the only portion which was not attacked ... Of the third day it must be said , as was said of the charge of the Six Hundred at
Balaklava	LOCATION	, ' Magnificent , but not War ! ' ''

		The Federal commander at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	is also severely criticised . ''

		It must be ever held a colossal mistake that
Meade	PERSON	did not organize a comiterstroke as soon as he discov - ered that the Confederate attack had been repulsed .

		He lost here an opportunity as great as
McClellan	PERSON	lost at
Sharpsburg	LOCATION	.

		Our ammunition was so low , and our diminished forces were , at the moment , so widely dis - persed along our unwisely extended line , that an advance by a single fresh corps , the 6th for instance , could have cut us in two .

		Meade might at least have felt that he had nothing to lose and everything to gain by making the effort . ''

		It is the opinion of Alexander that instead of going north of the Potomac in
1862	DATE	and
1863	DATE	the
Virginia	LOCATION	armies should have made use of '' interior lines '' and relieved the Confederate armies in the
West	LOCATION	.

		This could have been done with comparative ease and promised better suc - cess .

		But here was illustrated the disregard of the
Lower South and Southwest	ORGANIZATION	by the
Upper South	ORGANIZATION	.

		On this matter the author says : '' It is a fatal mistake that we failed to utilize the single advantage in the game of war , which the Con - federacy enjoyed ... We occupied the ' Interior Lines , ' and could reenforce from one flank to the other , across our country , more quickly than the enemy could discover and follow our movements by roundabout routes .

		Only by such transfers of her armies could the South ever hope to face her adversaries with superior , or even with equal , numbers -- by demanding double duty of her regiments , fighting battles with them alter - nately in the east and in the west ... Unfortunately no one but Longstreet seems to have appreciated this . ''

		Critical estimates are given of numerous other Federal and Confederate generals , but space permits mention of but few .

		Of Confederates , Early and
Ewell	PERSON	are frequently found wanting , as at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	and in the
Wilderness	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is worthy of note that little or no faidt is found with President
Davis	PERSON	for interfering in military affairs .

		Of all the Federal leaders .

		General
Alexander	PERSON	has the highest professional respect for Grant .

		Some military critics have declared that Grant possessed no ability as a strategist , -- Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	, for example , has criticised unfavorably his con - duct of affairs in
1864	DATE	; but our author takes issue with these .

		The real crisis of the war came , he asserts , not at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	or in any other battle , but just after the Wilderness campaign , when for three days Lee was deceived as to
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's whereabouts .

		Meanwhile , the latter had safely gone before
Petersburg	PERSON	, the back door to
Richmond	LOCATION	. ''

		Thus the last , and perhaps the best , chances of Confederate suc - cess were not lost in the repidse at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, nor in any combat of arms .

		They were lost during three days of lying in camp , believing that Grant was hemmed in by the broad part of the James below City Point , and had nowhere to go but to come and attack us . ''

		At that time the North was greatly depressed and almost ready to negotiate for peace .

		Had Lee reached
Peters	PERSON	- burg before Grant , the latter would have suf - fered a bloody repulse where , as it was , he was only checked .

		The North could not have en - dured another defeat .

		So Grant 's manoeuvre was strategy of the highest order .

		But in addition to criticism of the tactics and strategy of the commanders , the book contains a mass of information and opinion relative to general conditions on both sides .

		From no other account can one get so clear an idea of the weaknesses and the strength of the Confederate army .

		Up to the end of
1862	DATE	, the author says , it was not at all well organized , and its cavalry and artillery were not used to the best advantage until too late .

		Its strength lay in its good leaders and good soldiers .

		On the other hand , 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, the Federal army had a splendid organization and fine men , but was badly led .

		However , as he shows , it fought very well without leaders .

		Of the contrast between
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	troops in
1861	DATE	, an interesting description is given .

		Alexander had been out West when the news of war came , and after resigning his com - mission he returned by way of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Both sections were then arming .

		Of the ap - pearance of the soldiers he says : '' The camps near the principal Northern towns were all of regiments .

		Those of the South were mostly of a company each .

		The arms of the Northern troops were generally the long-range rifled muskets .

		Those of the Southern troops were almost universally the old - fashioned smooth-bore muskets .

		The Northern troops were always neatly imiformed in blue , their camps seemed well equipped , and there was generally some visible show of military discipline about them .

		The Confederate uniforms were blue , gray , or brown , and sometimes uniforms were lacking .

		There was , too , a noticeable contrast in the physical appearance of the men , the Northern and Western men having more flesh and better color .

		As physical machines , to withstand hardships , a casual observer would have pronounced them superior to their antagonists .

		But I lived to see that appearances may deceive . ''

		The Confederates ,
General Alexander	ORGANIZATION	thinks , were inclined to use too few men in assaults , to fight too much and manoeuvre too little ; the Federals sometimes used too many men -- they got in one another 's way , as at the '' Bloody Angle '' and at the '' Crater . ''

		Both sides lost much by making progressive , -- that is , piece - meal , -- attacks , as at the Seven Days ' fight ,
Gettysburg	LOCATION	,
Chickamauga	LOCATION	, and
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	.

		Until
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, this had been mainly a
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral failing , -- hence the saying of
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	which became '' an article of our stead - fast faith : ' We sometimes fail to drive the enemy from position , but they always fail to drive us . ' ''

		Throughout the entire work , the author mani - fests disapproval of all '' grand-stand '' move - ments ; such cavalry raids as those of
Stuart	LOCATION	,
Pleasanton	LOCATION	, and
Sheridan	PERSON	did more good than harm , he says , to the enemy .

		From the many military mistakes made during the war some fundamental lessons must be learned : orders must be definite , precise , and have no '' saving clauses '' ; a good staff organization is a prime necessity ; the commander must go in person and see that very important orders are obeyed ; and there must be no confusion of authority .

		The practical application of these principles is shown in numerous instances .

		Every chapter is sprinkled with military maxims in the most concise form .

		West Point might well use the volume as a textbook on military science .

		Here and there the personal reminiscences of the author are sandwiched in between the ac - counts of battles , but not nearly so many as we should be glad to have .

		It is in this part that we find the significant little stories that so illuminate a critical text .

		In telling of the way the inferior Confederate artillery suffered at
Antietam	LOCATION	, he says : '' As to how our artillery fared in opposition , we may judge from a remark made to me two months later by Col.
S. D. Lee	PERSON	, ... ' Pray that you may never see another
Sharpsburg	LOCATION	.

		Sharpsburg was Artillery HeU . ' ''

		And to illustrate the effect upon the Confederates of the sight of the great numbers of the Federals at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, the following is told : '' To this day there survive stories showing how the Confederates were impressed by this tremendous display .

		One , still told by guides at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, is that a cry was heard in the Confederate ranks , ' Have we got all creation to whip ? '

		And another of the time was that the Federal commander was heard to give his orders : ' • Attention , Universe !

		Nations into line / By Kingdom !

		-- Right wheel .

		^ '' But not until the very last did the Confederates fully realize the great odds against them .

		The following quotation will illustrate conditions in the West as early as
1863	DATE	: '' We were so deficient in horseshoes that on the advance to
Knoxville	LOCATION	we stripped the shoes and saved the nails from all dead horses , killing for the purpose all wounded and broken-down animals , both of our own and those left behind by the enemy .

		During the siege , the river brought down a number of dead animals thrown in within the town .

		Our men were nearly as badly off for foot gear as our animals .

		I have seen bloody stains left on frozen ground where our infantry had passed .

		In the artillery we took the shoes from the feet of the drivers to give to the cannoneers who had to march .

		Our rations were also frequently not even the reduced rations now issued to the whole army .

		Corn , imground , was often the only ration . ''

		In everything , except leaders and courage , the Federals were superior from the beginning : all along the Confederates had ammunition and guns inferior to the Federals ' -- before the Con - federates got rid of flintlocks the Federals had breech-loading magazine guns ; the
Federals	ORGANIZATION	also had war-balloons and engineer corps .

		Of the emptiness of the Confederate larder much less than usual is said , but it is amusing to note the appreciation exhibited even now by the dignified general when he writes of the captured Federal eatables at
Manassas	LOCATION	, or of that side of English bacon which he `` borrowed '' and carried on his saddle to
Appomattox	LOCATION	.

		Since General Alexander so frankly acknow - ledges that the political principles for which the
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 South contended ought to have been lost , it is interesting to have his opinion of just what good resulted from all the fighting , especially after there was no hope of independence .

		It is the usual ex-Confederate view , now coming to be somewhat better understood . ''

		In every war there are two issues contended for .

		First , is the political principle involved ; which with us was the right of secession .

		The second is prestige or character as a people .

		Conceding our cause , did we defend it worthily , history and posterity being the judges ?

		We lost the first issue ; and the more utterly it was lost , the better it has proved to be -- for ourselves , even more than for our adversaries .

		Without detract - ing from their merit , but displaying and even enhancing it , we have gained the second by a courage and con - stancy which could only be fully developed and ex - hibited under the extreme tests endured , and by the high types of men who became our leaders .

		Is not that end worthy of the extreme price paid for it , even to the last drop of blood shed at
Appomattox	LOCATION	?

		I am sure that to the army , any end but the last ditch would have seemed a breach of faith with the dead we had left upon every battlefield . ''

		The Religions of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		* The series of '' Lectures on the History of Religions '' is on the whole an excellent one , although most of the volumes are by men who were imder the disadvantage of being widely separated from their subjects in race , distance , and time .

		This , however , is not the case with the sixth volume of the series , on '' The De - velopment of Religion in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
George William Knox	PERSON	of
Union Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		As
Professor of Philosophy and Ethics	ORGANIZATION	in the
Imperial University of Tokio	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Knox	PERSON	lived long among the people of whose thought he treats , was familiar with their char - acter and records , and enjoyed scholarly asso - ciation with their learned men .

		Hence he was not , like the majority of the older writers on Japanese religions , liable to be misled by erroneous and obsolete data , nor to be carried away by the currents of subjective fancy .

		At every step he has sought to verify his examina - tions and conclusions by careful research and inquiry .

		Now that it is beyond dispute that the first '' Japanese '' were straight-eyed , full-bearded people who spoke an Aryan tongue , who later were conquered and absorbed by some Malay or

The Development of Religion	ORGANIZATION	in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		William
Knox	PERSON	.

		New York :
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		By OeoTge from the neighboring mainland -RRB- , we are not surprised to find that the three strata of re - ligions in
Japan	LOCATION	are , by name ,
Shinto	LOCATION	,
Bud	PERSON	- dhism , and Confucianism , -- that is , natural or insular religion ; the great Aryan faith , which blended Hindoo and Mongol ideas ; and , finally , the Chinese system , which , first in its simpler form furnished rules of life , and then in its philosophical evolution gave a creed to the more cultured classes in
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	.

		Chronolog - ically , Shinto lived , grew , and finally suffered deglutition , in the eighth century , becoming for a thousand years a virtual
Jonah	PERSON	in the Bud - dhist whale 's belly .

		The `` great fish '' which contained this precious treasure is known in Japanese history as Riobu Shinto , -- that is , Mixed Shinto .

		It certainly became the undo - ing , in modern times , of many a supposedly learned European who accepted the phenomena of a Buddhist dogmatic achievement for the real Way of the Gods .

		The English scholars ,
Satow	PERSON	,
Aston	ORGANIZATION	, and
Chamberlain	PERSON	, by their re - searches since
1870	DATE	, have discredited the reports of Kempfer and his copyists .

		How lively , in
1868	DATE	, were the hacking by swords of the Bud - dhist deities in Tokio , that in the eyes of infur - iated patriots had so long defiled the idolless temples of the original Shinto !

		How vigorous the purge , when the Riobu Shinto temples were changed from art museums to Quaker-like meeting-houses !

		These were emptied of their Buddhistic emblems , including priceless works of art which were scattered throughout
Europe	LOCATION	.

		While the dispossessed shavelings gnashed their teeth , the full-haired Shinto shrine-keepers came into place and office .

		The escheated estates on which , for a millennium , Buddhist monks had fattened , dropped into the public treasury to furnish and equip a public school system .

		Thus by a stroke of politics the ecclesiastical fraud of a thousand years was rectified and pure Shinto came back to power .

		Dr.
Knox	PERSON	, being a scholar and knowing these things , does not depend upon unre vised ency - clop # edias , or on the modem school of superficial writers on
Japan	LOCATION	, or on hostile critics of pagan faith .

		With the ease and poise of a trained scholar , he shows us that the development of religion 4n
Japan	LOCATION	was neither continuous nor by resident forces , and hence not by any of that kind of '' evolution '' which used to be dog - matically taught us .

		Japanese religion , like its civilization , was caused in great measure by contact with foreign peoples and civilizations .

		The early Japanese had no ancestor-worship , nor did they possess those Chinese institutions 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, which were afterward so liberally borrowed .

		As with other races , neither organized family life nor modern gentleness of demeanor are traceable in the records of their ancient days .

		Shinto is simply the religion of nature .

		The modern literary revival of Shinto , chiefly by a few scholars of the
eighteenth century	DATE	, has really nothing in common with the ancient life , except as we justify Chauvinism , or the degra - dation of religion into a political machine to secure national unity .

		When we leave the austere simplicity of Shinto in the
Miya	LOCATION	and pass into the
Tera	ORGANIZATION	or Buddhist temple , we depart from a hut and enter a palace of art .

		Here we find architecture , painting , carving , music , incense -- all that is known of external decoration in the
Southern	LOCATION	forms of Christianity and the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	devel - opment of Buddhism .

		Properly speaking , Shinto has no sacred book or ethical code , while but to transport the Buddhist canons one would need a camel train or freight cars .

		No wonder they have never been translated into Japanese !

		Dr.
Knox	PERSON	well calls this Aryan religion '' the worship of the Absolute . ''

		Buddhism in
Japan	LOCATION	heightened and broadened the emotions stimu - lated by Shinto .

		What an amazing revelation to the islanders was this Aryan religion !

		Kobo , perhaps
Japan	LOCATION	's mightiest intellect , proclaimed the ancient gods of Nippon to be incarnations of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then the Aryan faith entered upon a mighty missionary development .

		Once rooted in the whole Japanese empire , a new growth of doctrinal evolution burst forth .

		It would be hard indeed to say what phase of the human mind , as expressed in the processes of the Greek or Roman , or the reformed phases of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , is not to be matched in Japanese Bud - dhism .

		Disestablished in
1868	DATE	, its leaders lost hope for a time ; but now Japanese Buddhism has adjusted itself to the new conditions .

		With the same masterly hand , Dr.
Knox	PERSON	treats Confucianism , first as polity and ethics , and then as a world-system .

		We can not go into the historical details presented , except to say that in
China	LOCATION	in the twelfth and in
Japan	LOCATION	in the seventeenth century Confucianism became a philosophical creed and the Chinese '' new theology '' under Chu Hi attempted a synthesis of all Asiatic thought .

		In its fresh form it became the religion of the learned , while Bud - dhism was left for the comfort of the ignorant and the lowly .

		To-day , in
Japan	LOCATION	, one group of young men would find the nation 's future in a return to the worship of the Absolute ; while another and more influential group sets forth a glorified Bushido as the hope of salvation .

		Both schools recognize , however , that in the modem world the conditions do not obtain which made for those forms of religion in the past .

		A third group , holding to the best in the past , would combine it with the noblest truths of our modem science , philosophy , and religion .

		With Dr.
Knox	PERSON	-LRB- after forty years ' acquaintance with the Japanese mind and heart -RRB- , we hold to the faith that these dreams are to be realized in some better form than is yet conceived .

		By her blood , her genius , her history , her ethnic inheritances , and her geographical situation ,
Japan	LOCATION	is the one country in all the world best fitted to accom - plish the final synthesis of the world 's religions .

		In her great book on '' String Figures , '' now before `` us , Mrs.

		A Study of Cat 's - Cradle in Many Lands .

1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 337 Really , it is the latter side of the study , the practical side , that Mrs.
Jayne	PERSON	develops most fully .

		It is uot so much her purpose to make known the finished patterns produced by vari - ous peoples , as to enable all to reproduce them in the very way in which the natives produce them .

		It is true that Dr.
Haddon	PERSON	, of Cam - bridge
University	ORGANIZATION	, who has given much serious study to the subject , has written an Introduction to the work , in which he presents the ethnog - raphy of cat 's - cradle , and that Mrs.
Jayne	PERSON	her - self devotes a part of her first chapter to the same subject ; but the bidk of the book is strictly practical , devoted to illustrated direc - tions for making specific figures .

		As some of these figures are complex and are constructed only through a series of complicated and somewhat difficult movements , ten or fifteen stages being required at times , this description is by no means easy , and demands a special technical vocabulary .

		Dr.
Haddon	PERSON	and Mr.
Rivers	PERSON	some time ago proposed a method of recording the making of such figures , and de - veloped a scientific but difficult and repellant nomenclature .

		Mrs.
Jayne	PERSON	, appealing to her larger public , simplifies both nomenclature and description , and becomes comprehensible to the average intelligent reader .

		Her illustrative cuts are clear , and are made from the point of sight of the person constructing the pattern .

		In each case , every stage in the development of the figure is illustrated .

		Thus , one who desires to do so may by a little care and atten - tion really construct the ninety-seven different patterns which are here described in detail and illustrated by upwards of eight hundred figures .

		Turning now to the subject itself , we find that string games may be roughly classed into '' figures , whereof the purpose is to form final patterns ^ supposed to represent definite objects ; those which are tricks ^ wherein , after much complex manipulation of the strings , the entire loop is suddenly drawn from the hand by some simple movement ; and those which are catches , wherein , when certain strings are pulled , the hand or some of the fingers may be unexpect - edly caught in a running noose . ''

		Mrs.
Jayne	PERSON	presents all the examples of these three classes -- patterns , tricks , and catches -- that she has found .

		A few weeks ago I would have assumed that every American was acquainted with the good old game of '' cat 's - cradle '' ; to-day I know better , but shall assume that most readers at least remember it .

		With a loop of string , by the use of both hands a figure is formed to which the name '' cat 's - cradle '' is given .

		It is an attractive , rather simple , symmetrical pat - tern , which does not even remotely suggest either a cat or a cradle .

		In removing this from the two hands of the maker , a second player produces an entirely different design , which among us is usually nameless , but in some parts of
Europe	LOCATION	has a distinctive cognomen .

		The first player now removes this , producing a third pattern .

		Frequently the players can go no further , but experts may continue up to an eighth pattern , although the final designs may vary somewhat with different players .

		This game is known to exist in
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Neth	LOCATION	- erlands ,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	; it probably occurs in all other European countries .

		Mrs.
Jayne	PERSON	calls the eight patterns `` cradle , '' '' soldier 's bed , '' '' candles , '' '' manger , '' '' dia - mond , '' '' cat 's eye , '' '' fish in a dish , '' and '' clock . ''

		These forms , so widely known in
Europe	LOCATION	, are also known and made in the same way in
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
Corea	LOCATION	,
the Philippines	LOCATION	,
Borneo	LOCATION	, and perhaps in
Java	LOCATION	,
Celebes	LOCATION	, and
Australia	LOCATION	.

		This series , with but a few patterns , requiring two players who alternately remove one pattern thereby producing a new one , is believed by Dr.
Haddon	PERSON	to have originated in
Asia	LOCATION	and to have travelled from there , in rela - tively recent times , into
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He therefore calls it the '' Asiatic type . ''

		More curious , more varied , more widely dis - tributed , is his '' Oceanic type . ''

		Here usually one player works alone .

		Taking the string lood upon his hands , by various manipulations anp movements he produces a final -LRB- named -RRB- pattern .

		This ends his task .

		If he chooses , he may remove the string and proceed to the construc - tion , from the beginning , of another pattern , or still another .

		Sometimes not only the two hands but the mouth of the player , even his toes , feet , or legs , may be needed for the construction ; occasionally the help of another person 's hands is needed .

		Figures of this Oceanic type are made in
Australia	LOCATION	,
New Guinea	LOCATION	, Melanesia and
Polynesia	ORGANIZATION	, and by Eskimo and many North American Indian tribes .

		The designs are often striking and attractive , and their construction is complex .

		There is not a definite series of patterns , limited in number , found everywhere through this vast area , -- but here some , there others , are found .

		The same final pattern may be produced in different ways ; but usually , in separated areas , the same method produces the same form .

		Some patterns have a wide distri - 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, bution ; others , so far as now known , may be limited to a single people and a small district .

		Sometimes a story accompanies the making of a figure or succession of figures , when the dif - ferent patterns may be considered as the illus - trations of the tale .

		It is possible that at times religious associations connect themselves with the game .

		Careful comparative study of the patterns of the Oceanic type may yield inter - esting residts .

		Two patterns of the Oceanic type are found among Europeans .

		One of them was made for me recently by a student , under the name of '' crow 's - foot . ''

		Mrs.
Jayne	PERSON	calls it '' the leashing of
Lochiel	LOCATION	's dogs , '' and reports it from
Scotland	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Algeria	LOCATION	, and
Australia	LOCATION	, and says it is known to the
Ulimgu of Africa	LOCATION	and the Navajos and
Chero	PERSON	- kees of
North America	LOCATION	.

		It has the widest known range of all string-patterns . ''

		Tallow dips '' is also a European pattern , made by one player , with no expectation of conversion to a new figure in removal by a second player .

		The temporary patterns made during its construc - tion have independent names , and a story is told which they illustrate .

		These two patterns -- '' crow 's - foot '' and '' tallow dips '' -- curious in themselves and interesting in distribution and accompaniment , raise questions deserving fur - ther study .

		Mrs.
Jayne	PERSON	presents two figures procured from Otabenga -- the `` pygmy '' from the
Kasai	LOCATION	district -- and refers to two or three other African patterns .

		Dr.
Haddon	PERSON	states that few had been reported from the dark continent .

		Since Mrs.
Jayne	PERSON	's book was published , three articles on African string-figures have appeared in the Journal of the
Anthropological Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		During my recent visit to the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	, I found two series , quite distinct .

		One of these was the regidar Oceanic type of which more than sixty patterns were encountered ; the other , quite unlike all yet reported , comprised at least fifty patterns .

		Details regarding both will be pub - lished presently .

		It will be seen that Mrs.
Jayne	PERSON	's book is curiously interesting .

		It is issued in excellent form .

		Besides the many cuts illustrating the figures and their modes of construction , there are many full-page plates of natives making string-figures , or who have made such .

		Many of these are interesting , but not all .

		The frontispiece is pretty ; it not only has no raison d ^ etre , but is out of place .

		A true '' cat 's - cradle picture '' of white children would have been appropriate ; but a picture of a white child -- no matter how pretty and '' cute '' -- making barbarous '' lightning '' patterns is not the picture to form the frontispiece of such a '' ^ * ^ ^ '

		The
History of Literary Censorship	ORGANIZATION	.

		* As the art of writing came into existence in very early times , it was invested with such a degree of mystery that it was viewed with super - stitious awe by the uninitiated , even as it is by primitive peoples at the present time upon their first coming into contact with it .

		The art was restricted to the sacerdotal classes , until the Phoenicians got hold of it and used it for com - mercial ends .

		Had it remained the monopoly of the priests or of any other class , it would have continued to be an instrument of enslave - ment instead of becoming one for the liberation of mind and thought .

		It was natural , however , that the classes who at first held a monopoly of the province of letters shoxdd be jealous of any intrusion upon their domain ; and their opposi - tion to such intrusion has opened up that long chapter in the history of literature known as Censorship .

		The ancient rulers , while recog - nizing books as capable of great benefit to society and to religion , also held them in sus - picion as powerfid means of spreading ideas subversive of religion and of political govern - ment .

		Augustus , who ordered the writings of Labienus publicly burned , is cited by Tacitus as the first ruler who undertook to punish the written or spoken word ; and his example was followed by his successors upon the imperial throne .

		The mind of the reader may go back to another and not altogether unrelated inci - dent , which occurred in the winter house of a
King of Judah	ORGANIZATION	, when
Jehudi	PERSON	cut and burned the book of the prophet
Jeremiah	PERSON	because it contained prophecies against the king and his kingdom .

		Christianity , as it developed , endeavored to assume the supervision of literature so far as it was able .

		The Apostolic Constitutions forbade Christians to read any books of the Gentiles ; and a synod of Bishops in
Asia Minor	LOCATION	, about A. D. 150 , condemned and prohibited the read - ing of the
Acta Pauli	ORGANIZATION	.

1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 published by councils , by individual ecclesiastics , or by civil officers acting under the influence of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, cautioning the faithful against certain literary productions , and threatening penalties ranging from confiscation of property to imprisonment , excommunication , and death .

		About the year 365 , a canon of scripture was adopted by a provincial synod in
Laodicaea	LOCATION	, which was afterwards revised and adopted by a
General Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		This action on the part of the Church was the exercise of a certain amount of discrimination in regard to other literatures , even though the other literatures might be Christian in character and thoroughly orthodox , and was of the nature of ecclesiastical censor - ship .

		The
Church	ORGANIZATION	's supervision of literature was so far developed and organized in the time of Justinian that certain bishops were deposed for laxity of supervision of the literature circu - lated in their various sees .

		As the
Roman Church	ORGANIZATION	developed into the ecclesiastical headship of the world , as a matter of course its claim as the legitimate successors of the imperial authority was asserted ; and as long as authors were for the most part of the clergy , and the universities were under the con - trol of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the task of the ecclesiastical authorities in keeping a watch upon the litera - ture produced was comparatively easy , although Disraeli tells us that '' the monks had a part of their libraries called the inferno ^ which was not the part least visited , for it contained or hid all the prohibited books which could be smuggled into it . ''

		The invention of printing , however , while it was at first hailed by the ecclesiastical authorities as a means of spread - ing the pure gospel and the instruction of the Church , was soon discovered to be a two-edged sword , and more to be feared than courted ; and the task of censuring books calculated to do harm to the religion or the morals of the faith - ful was made a thousand times more difficult because of the fleetness of the wings provided by the printing-press for the thoughts of heretics .

		The Inquisition , dating from the
Council of Toulouse	ORGANIZATION	in
1229	DATE	, was reorganized in
1542	DATE	, under a Bull of
Paul III.	PERSON	; and in the following year the Inquisitor-General issued an edict for the suppression of heretical literature and of books written by heretics .

		This was followed by Papal bulls and Inquisitorial edicts extending into the seventeenth century .

		What is usually regarded as the first of the long series of Roman Indexes was compiled by the theological faculty of the
University of Louvain	ORGANIZATION	, in
1546	DATE	, under the authority of the famous buU
Coena Domini	ORGANIZATION	issued just ten years previously .

		From this time on to the time of the Coimcil of Trent , the com - pilers of the Roman Indexes based their work upon Indexes which originated in
Spain	LOCATION	or the
Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		In
1559	DATE	, being the time of
Paul IV.	PERSON	, the responsibility for the censorship of books was assumed by the Papal authority , and the first of a series of Papal Indexes was pub - lished under the title of Index Auctorum et Lihrorum Prohihitorum .

		Twelve years later , under
Paul V.	PERSON	, the Congregation of the Index was organized and the task of compiling the Index was committed to that body .

		The con - gregation still exists and carries on its work .

		In
1564	DATE	the Tridentine Index was published under the authority of Pope
Pius IV	PERSON	.

		and the
Council of Trent	ORGANIZATION	, and marked an epoch in the history of Censorship .

		Its list was more com - prehensive than any that had preceded it , and formed the basis of all subsequent Indexes .

		But its chief importance was in its formulation for the first time of definite censorship rules to be followed by future censors and compilers .

		And from that time on , the authority of the
Papacy	LOCATION	, acting through the Congregation of the Index , for retaining the general direction and control of Censorship , was generally recognized through - out the Catholic world , excepting in
Spain	LOCATION	, where the Inquisition held sway and was jealous of any interference with its powers .

		The Index of
Benedict XIV.	PERSON	, issued in
1758	DATE	, marked a decided change in the policy of Cen - sorship , inasmuch as it was the last attempt made by the Papal authorities to maintain a general censorship of the world 's literature .

		The compilers of later Indexes , down to the latest -LRB-
1900	DATE	-RRB- , have contented themselves with repeating the general rules or principles by which the faithful are to be governed ; while the lists are limited almost exclusively to works of a doctrinal character , the teachings of which are found to be in one respect or another open to condemnation .

		The number of books abso - lutely prohibited becomes smaller , the greater number of books cited being placed upon the list of lihros expurgandos ^ the readmg of which was forbidden only until certain corrections or eliminations had been made ; and there was no attempt to condemn -LRB- except under general rules and principles -RRB- the increasing number of Pro- testant books .

		There are , therefore , in the history of the Indexes , three periods of interest and import - ance .

		In the first -LRB- from
1559	DATE	and the Index Auctorum et Lihrorum down to the final ap - pendices to the Tridentine Index -RRB- almost the 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, only subject-matters considered were the great questions raised by the Reformation .

		In the second period , extending to the Index of Bene - dict
XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- 1758 -RRB- , the character of the works placed on the lists indicated questions of doctrine , opinion , and conduct , arising within the Church , the condemned writers being for the most part ecclesiastics .

		The third is the modern period in which censorship of literature has taken the form of statements of general principles to be followed , rather than that of lists of condemned books ; and the attempt to characterize the mass of the world 's literature has been abandoned .

		In his '' History of Literary Censorship '' as revealed in the Prohibitory and Expurgatory Indexes , Dr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	has found a large field for his scholarly investigation , and one that bears a close relation to that in which he has previously delved in his works on '' Au - thors and their Public in Ancient Times '' and '' Books and their Makers during the Middle Ages . ''

		A history of literature that does not give due consideration to the subject of Censor - ship and its influence upon the production and the distribution of books is incomplete ; and Dr.
Putnam	PERSON	's exhaustive treatise , in two volumes aggregating between eight and nine hundred pages , leaves little to be desired by the student of the subject .

		From his long established posi - tion in the world of books , it is but natural that the author should be most attracted to that phase of his subject which has to do with the distribution of literature ; but this phase is pur - sued without neglect of the others .

		The arrange - ment of material according to the cyclopaedic method , with the expectation that the work will be chiefly used for purposes of reference , has necessitated considerable repetition , for which the author apologizes in his preface .

		It may be remarked in passing , however , that the value of the work as a book of reference might have been enhanced by the provision of a more com - plete general index .

		The results of the author 's investigations of the influence of censorship on the undertakings of authors , publishers , and booksellers , in the several European states , could not be adequately summarized here .

		The effect of the censorship was not everywhere the same .

		For the Papal Indexes , while in form binding on the entire Church and throughout all the states classed as
Catholic	LOCATION	, were actually in force in the several states only when accepted and confirmed by the respective rulers ; and a number of them were never so accepted in
France	LOCATION	or in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		In the former country , censorship was carried on by commissions of ecclesiastics acting under the direct authority of the crown ; while in
Spain	LOCATION	the Inqiiisition carried on an independent sys - tem of literary censorship and repression , and lists of books condemned by the Spanish In - quisitors do not accord with those of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		In some countries where the prohibitory indexes were ineffectual , great publishing houses grew up , as in the case of Elzevir in Ley den .

		In Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's work we find not only the most complete schedule of the Prohibitory and Expurgatory Indexes that has yet been compiled , but also a detailed account of most of them .

		There are many interesting instances in which the history of authorship and publishing comes in close touch with general history .

		Such , for example , was in connection with the Index of Pope
Clement VIII	PERSON	.

		-LRB- 1596 -RRB- , and the Concordat agreed upon between the Pope and the
Venetian Senate	ORGANIZATION	in regard thereto .

		For a century and a half , under the Concordat , the Venetian Repub - lic persistently refused to authorize the publi - cation within its territory of any augmentation of the
Clementine Index	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was while this prolonged struggle was in its acute stages that Fra
Paola Sarpi	PERSON	came into prominence , and
Paul	PERSON	the Friar prevailed against Paul the Pope in the contest for the maintenance of the liber - ties of the press in
Venice	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Putnam	PERSON	considers the Thirty Years ' War in
Germany	LOCATION	-LRB- 1618-1648 -RRB- an extreme applica - tion of the principle of Censorship . ''

		The power of the Emperor , and that of the Catholic princes who associated themselves with him , was directed to the suppression of Protestantism in
Germany	LOCATION	, and with this , to the control , under the direction of the Roman Church , of German thought and of German intellectual develop - ment ... And the control and restrictions of the operations of the printers constituted an essential part of the purpose of the Pope , the Emperor , and their allies , the Jesuits and Dominicans . ''

		The long trial of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	by the Inquisition , during the first half of the seven - teenth century , resulted in the presentation of his condemnation in the Index of
1664	DATE	; and it was not until
1835	DATE	that the names of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	,
Copernicus	LOCATION	, and
Keplar	PERSON	were finally omitted from the Index .

		The Index lists , as Dr.
Putnam	PERSON	points out , are marvels of bibliographical inaccuracy , and present some amusing reading .

		To select at random some of these curiosities of literature : One Index enters '' Franc Baconus '' and '' Franc Verulam ' '' as two distinct authors , and not until nearly a century later does the ftdl
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 name ,
Baron Verulam	PERSON	, appear .

		The name of
Anne Askew	PERSON	is entered as ''
Anne	PERSON	a Skene '' in the Index of
1590	DATE	, and in the Index of
1597	DATE	as ''
A. S. Keuue	PERSON	. ''

		In conclusion it should be said that Dr.
Putnam	PERSON	has pursued his investigations in a wholly impartial spirit .

		In his final chapter he presents a summary of the opinions formed in regard to the present literary policy of the
Church of Rome	ORGANIZATION	by certain representative persons within that fold ; and everywhere he evinces a spirit of fairness which can not fail to commend itself to the intelligent adherents of that faith .


Arthur Howard Noll	PERSON	.

		The Catechism up to Date .

		* There is an old saying that '' Except ye become as little children , ye shall in nowise enter the Kingdom of Heaven . '' ''

		The teaching of
Sir Oliver Lodge	ORGANIZATION	would seem to indicate , contrariwise , that '' Except little children he - come as elderly philosophers , they shall in nowise , '' etc. .

		In his preface to the new cate - chism , he justly observes that all who have to do with children must feel the difficulty of '' instructing them in the details of religious faith , without leaving them open to the assaults of doubt hereafter , when they encounter the results of scientific enquiry . ''

		They must indeed ; but exactly the same is true of any instruction whatsoever .

		Can I so instruct my students in the details of the Darwinian faith that they wiU be immune to the assaults of all subsequent investigators ?

		The very thought is enough to make
Darwin	PERSON	turn in his grave .

		Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	is justly esteemed as an eminent physicist , and one who has not been in the least immune to the '' results of scientific enquiry . ''

		Why , then , should he desire in the religious field that which he would be the first to depre - cate in the scientific ?

		Presumably he would say , if confronted with the above , that it was not quite fair , -- that if one would caref uUy read his book he would find it fuU of imcertainties , questions , and doubts , of indications of the imperfections of our knowl - edge and of references to the better light to be expected in later days .

		All this is true ; and yet the formulation of a catechism or creed is against the spirit of science , and as formulated it seems to me of doubtful value to young or old .

		Even if the fact had not been so boldly • The Substance op Faith Allied with Science .

		By
Sir Oliver Lodge	ORGANIZATION	.

		New York : HarDer
& Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		stated at the outset , it is an attempt to bind the mind , to produce a body of dogma which will resist free thought in later years .

		To most people , religious or irreligious , a period of men - tal ossification comes at last ; but Heaven pre - serve us from proposals to make the young prematurely old , and thereby , according to a respectable authority , less eligible to the
King	LOCATION	- dom !

		Probably this sad result would not readily come about , from the fact that most of the catechism would fall as on deaf ears .

		The music of the following would probably be less audible to the young than that of the spheres , and certainly no more pleasing : '' What caused and what maintains existence ?

		Of our own knowledge we are unable to realize the mean - ing of origination or of maintenance ; all that we our - selves can accomplish in the physical world is to move things into desired positions , and leave them to act on each other .

		Nevertheless , our effective movements are all inspired by thought , and so we conceive that there must be some intelligence immanent in all the processes of nature , for they are not random or purposeless , but organized and beautiful . ''

		Incidentally it may be remarked , that while the words random and purposeless have no meaning in a monistic philosophy , they do rep - resent empirical realities , which are part of the processes of nature .

		It is absurd to infer any - thing because the universe is not what it could not be according to the fundamental postulate ; actually , no positive or negative statement can be made about the totality of things , the '' pro- cesses of nature '' as a whole .

		Again , our author says : '' Is man helped in his struggle upward ?

		There is a Power in the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	vastly beyond our compre - hension ; and we trust and believe that it is a Good alid
Loving Power	ORGANIZATION	, able and willing to help us and all creatures , and to guide us wisely , without detriment to our incipient freedom , '' etc. .

		We are inclined to prefer the frank paganism of the Old Testament , and the persuasive ethics of Jesus -- so rich in human imagery , so elo - quent of the '' Ahness of Things , '' as
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	called it .

		While protesting against the Catechism -- and the tide of our protest has risen higher every time we have returned to the book -- we must recognize the fundamental excellence of its author 's general aim , and the probability -- indeed , certainty -- that he will accomplish much good by his crusade against the more un - scientific elements of current religious dogma .

		We can not fail to sympathize heartily with his desire that in the destruction of the ancient forms of religion the thing itself may not be 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, destroyed .

		We can hardly doubt that even his Catechism , when preached by himself , is interesting and profitable ; but we venture to suggest that if he seems to find it practically a source of inspiration , that is because any man so combining learning and good-will is worth listening to , whatever his topic .


T. D. A. COCKERELX	PERSON	, .

		The
Spanish Discovery of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Mr.
Filson Young	PERSON	's account of ''
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	and the New World of his Discov - ery '' is -- as is frankly announced in its preface and clearly betrayed in its pages -- mainly popular in character .

		Yet it is well worth our careful consideration .

		The writer makes no pretense at original research , and much of the matter in the two interesting volumes is a mere adaptation -LRB- often careless in small particulars -RRB- of early narratives , especially of such as are given in
Thacher	DATE	's work on
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , Mr.
Young	PERSON	's indebtedness to Thacher is every - where apparent , even in the peculiar wording of a chapter heading ; but , in the arrangement of material , he has greatly improved upon that author 's voluminous and heterogeneous work .

		For instance , after giving us an original de - scription of the birth-place , antecedents , and life of
Columbus	LOCATION	, down to the time of the equipment of the expedition of
1492	DATE	, he has followed the course of each successive expedi - tion ; but , instead of introducing all the extant documents bearing upon the same event , he has collated them , or , perhaps more frequently , has taken some one of them -- say an epitome of a lost journal , a letter like that of Dr.
Chanca	PERSON	, or an independent account like that of
Porras	LOCATION	-- and has used it almost in its entirety .

		The result is , not a confused mass of original sources put in for purposes of minute comparison , but a sustained narrative that never flags in interest .

		In one respect only can an exception be taken to the general commendation implied in the preceding paragraph .

		Mr.
Young	PERSON	's arrange - ment of material is often faulty , and decidedly so in the matter of the
Earl of Dunraven	ORGANIZATION	's note .

		This note applies to the first voyage , and is technically of inestimable value ; but it prop - erly belongs , not to the body of the text -LRB- unless , indeed , it take the place of several pages that *

		With a Note on the
Navigation of Columbus 's First Voyage	ORGANIZATION	, by the
Earl of Dunraven	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes , illustrated in photogravure , etc. .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Young	PERSON	himself has written , and which it might weU do since the two accounts duplicate all secondary ideas -RRB- but to the Appendix .

		Placed as it is near the end of the second volume , and yet not within the Appendix where it would be convenient for enumeration , its presence is likely to be overlooked and its very great im - portance minimized .

		The early part of Mr.
Young	PERSON	's work -LRB- the summary of biographical data -RRB- has been referred to as an original description ; but it is hardly that , or at least it is so only in the matter of rhetorical form , since it is in the main an almost wholesale adoption of
Vignaud	PERSON	's theories and conclusions .

		In point of fact , Mr.
Young	PERSON	's absolute dependence upon this indefatigable scholar is very evident , and never more so , presumably , than in the case of his reflections upon the character of
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		Those reflec - tions -- and they are numerous , and a trifle light in tone -- are nothing more or less than an expansion of
Vignaud	PERSON	's letter to Mr.
White	PERSON	- law
Reid	PERSON	.

		For
Harrisse	PERSON	, for Major , and for
Winsor	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Young	PERSON	manifests a great respect ; but he is unjustly critical of
Washington Irving	LOCATION	.

		Note , for example , his contemptuous allusion to
Irving	PERSON	's work , an allusion that will un - doubtedly arouse a certain resentment in many a reader 's mind .

		Irving wrote at a time when the modern method of historical criticism was still in its infancy , yet he conformed to its principles as far as his professional knowledge extended and his opportunities allowed .

		More - over , his attitude toward this particular work was certainly that of the honest investigator ; and , although since his day specialists have pronounced his characterizations of the great Admiral to be more or less ideal , and have lowered the personal estimate , corrected statis - tics , and added many new facts to our knowledge of the incidents of the discovery , nevertheless the biography of
Columbus	LOCATION	that so charmed the readers of the middle nineteenth century is admittedly the most famous that has ever appeared , and is still one of the best .

		At all events , there is nothing in it that can be stigmatized as '' profoimdly dull . ''

		Irving never descended to mere twaddle , and never found it necessary , in order to make his hero live again , to be suggestively coarse , disgust - ingly flippant , or ridiculously common .

		He was always the man of exquisite literary taste , of refined and gentlemanly instincts .

		Here let us consider the one great and glar - ing defect of Mr.
Young	PERSON	's work .

		It lies in the
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 spirit of levity that more or less pervades it .

		Advances in knowledge that have cost years of exhausting labor are made light of ; and this the real student of history , himself serious of purpose and earnest in endeavor , can scarcely be expected to forgive .

		He may admire the writer 's easy flow of language , his vast fund of information , and the structural perfection of his work ; but he will never be convinced that it is necessary to be frivolous in order to be interesting .

		He may realize that his own abili - ties , controlled as they perforce must be by the destructive tendencies of the age , are inadequate for popularized construction ; yet he will shrink from having noble truths placed in a trivial set - ting .

		The incongruity will be too much for his magnanimity , and incline him impatiently to ignore redeeming qualities and forget that the world has waited long for an accurate account of the Spanish discovery of
America	LOCATION	, and that Mr.
Young	PERSON	's production is pioneer in its nature , somewhat lacking in dignity no doubt , but none the less admirable , ^ ^ ^ a

		Briefs on New Books .

		Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	has te ^ BeZZtt ^ ^ d ^ ^ `` pleasantly familiar with what is now known as the
Benson	PERSON	book , a book written ostensibly by a bachelor , or perhaps by a widower -- preferably of delicate constitution -- who rides a bicycle and has a store of beautifid thoughts and high ideals that press for utterance , although the utterer -LRB- who writes in the first person and usually signs only his initials -RRB- pro- fesses a noble indifference whether his writings shall ever be published , since he writes merely be - cause it is a necessity of his natiu'e , like breathing . ''

		The Letters of One : A Study in Limitations ; by Charles
Hare Plunkett	PERSON	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- bears the un - mistakable Benson stamp , in conception and execu - tion .

		A poor bachelor of fine literary taste and slender achievement is in love , or thinks he is , with a rich and refined woman a little older than he , who would marry him if he could bring himself to exchange an ideally beautiful relation for a practi - cally useful one .

		But his dreamy , artistic tempera - ment recoUs at the thought of close and constant intimacy with his beloved ; and his letters to her , which compose the book , refine upon and attempt to explain the curious fact that just because he loves her and wishes always to love her he can not ask her to marry him .

		Through five long months and something like 170 pages of print this uncom - fortable and ineffectual person makes love in his anaemic fashion -- a sort of negative courtship -- until the lady , evidently a woman of some sound common sense and a saving remnant of self-respect , wearies of the Platonic trifling , and the letters abruptly cease .

		Much space is given to talk about literature as a jealous mistress to whom the letter - writer has dedicated himself , and who will brook no rival .

		He speaks of himself as intensely pre - occupied with his work , and adds : '' If you knew how haunted I am by cadences , phrases , words , the colour of language , methods of expression , you would think I had no time for anything else . ''

		Yet he carelessly uses the superlative degree of com - parison where the merest rudiments of grammar call for the comparative , and twice writes '' if one was , '' instead of '' if one were , '' to denote a sup - position contrary to fact .

		But perhaps his emotional disorder had unbalanced his grammatical judgment .

		As a tmir de force in the portrayal of love-madness at the summit of its absurdity , the little book is a sort of curiosity .

		The author , be he Mr.
Benson	PERSON	or a close imitator of his manner , has the cleverness of a practised writer of introspective habits .

		Such love as he depicts , if one may call it love , is not impossible to the fastidiously artistic temperament ; but is its minute and prolonged inspection worth ovu ' while ?

		It is a little curious , finally , that this book and '' Beside Still Waters '' -LRB- of acknowledged Bensonian authorship -RRB- , both issued simultaneously by the same publishing house , have each a reference to the odor of syringa blossoms as associated with a memorable event in early life ; each , too , has an apt allusion to '' Thi'ough the Looking-Glass '' ; and each pictures that fastidiousness of the sensitive artistic temperament that makes , or seems to make , wedded happiness impossible .

		These small coin - cidences , taken in connection with the striking like - ness of style , establish almost beyond a doubt the identity of authorship .

		Modern colonial government has no u ' ^ lalava uiore instructive chapter in its his - tory than the story of the evolution of British administration in the Malay states .

		Previous to 1874 the various Malay states were in continual warfare with one another .

		Quarrels and feuds , revolution and lawlessness , marked the ordi - nary course of affairs .

		In
1874	DATE	the native chiefs of Perak , admitting their inability to cope with these difficulties , made a treaty at
Pangkor	LOCATION	, and asked for a British resident official `` whose advice must be asked and acted upon in all cases other than those touching Malay religion and custom . ''

		A short time after this treaty the other Malay states made similar agreements with the British govern - ment .

		Another step in the evolution was made in
1895	DATE	, when the states of Perak ,
Selangor	LOCATION	,
Pahang	LOCATION	, and
Negri Sambilan	PERSON	agreed to a treaty of federa - tion , and formed what is now known as the
Fede	PERSON	- rated Malay States .

		Under this system the various British resident officials of the several states are responsible to a resident-general , who in turn is responsible to the governor of the Straits Settle - ments , the British High Commissioner .

		Such an 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, evolution in colonial administration , among such people as the
Malays	LOCATION	, marks a distinct feature in British government .

		To tell the story of this evolu - tion truthfully and judiciously requires a level head and an intimate knowledge of the Malay people , their customs , and their peculiar psychology .

		More - over , whoever attempts to tell the story should he close to the centre of the system of administration .

		All these conditions are amply and happily fulfilled by Sir
Frank Swettenham	PERSON	, late Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner for the
Federated Malay States	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir
Frank	PERSON	went out to the Malays in
1874	DATE	, and has therefore seen the evolution of the government in Malay almost from its very beginning .

		To give a sufficient background for his able discussion of the development of British paternalism in the Malay states , the author deals with the early histoiy of
Malacca	LOCATION	, and of those Settlements forming the British colony of which the capital is
Singapore	LOCATION	.

		Only one chapter is given to the Malay : his customs , prejudices , arts , language , and literature .

		The rest of the volume is devoted to the political history we have outlined .

		As a study in colonial government it is characterized by a just balance : the author is proud of the efforts of
England	LOCATION	in those states , yet he holds his enthusiasm in check by his sound political judgment .

		His volume , which is entitled '' British Malaya '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , may well rank as a masterpiece among the host of similar books written by the servants of the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor Henry
Cecil Wyld	PERSON	's '' His - yinS .

		* '' ^ ' ^ ^ ^ ^ * ^ '' ^ y ^ * * ^ ^ Mother Tongue '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a book such as has long been needed by teachers both in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and in
America	LOCATION	.

		There are already several good ele - mentary manuals of the history of English with which teachers can manage to get on very well ; but between the study of these books and that of the difficult monographs which the advanced student must attack there has hitherto been an unbridged gap .

		We know of none of the younger English scholars better qualified to write such a book than Mr.
Wyld	PERSON	, already well known for his investiga - tions in the palatalization of consonants .

		An enthu - siastic disciple of Sweet , he has had admirable train - ing , of which every page of the book gives evidence .

		The first eight chapters deal with such general sub - jects as the aims of linguistic study , sounds and their changes , how speech is acquired and trans - mitted , the working of analogy in language .

		Con - stantly the fact is emphasized that language is a living organism and that language processes of the remote past do not differ essentially from those which may be found in existence to-day .

		Then follow chapters on the Aryan mother-tongue and the Germanic family ; and the student is now ready for the five remaining chapters on English .

		The treat - ment of sound-changes in Old ,
Middle	LOCATION	, and Modern English is amply illustrated and , so far as we have observed , wholly clear .

		The problems of early modern pronimciation are treated with unusual fulness .

		The concluding chapter , on `` The Study of Present-day English , '' ought to be read and digested by everyone who is interested in encour - agii ^ g good habits of speech , and especially by those persons who , with all good intentions , have helped give birth to that curious species known as '' school - ma'am English . ''

		Mr.
Wyld	PERSON	rightly insists upon a careful distinction between written or literary and standard spoken English .

		Benson 's `` Beside Still Waters '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		But it is far from being purely imag - inary , since one feels that the author is giving gen - erously of his own deepest experiences and inmost convictions , in the form of reflections on questions of religion , education , literature , art , music , and philosophy .

		In mere externals , too , the life of ''
Hugh Neville	PERSON	'' and that of his creator largely coincide , even to points of detail .

		Both are sons of a high church dignitary , both pass from public school to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, thence to a post of not wholly con - genial routine work , and finally back to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, to a fellowship and a literary life .

		Middle age -LRB- the author 's age -RRB- is depicted as the most desirable period of life , with prospects of increasing richness of experience and ripeness of powers as the years accumulate .

		But in the lives of both
Hugh	PERSON	and his biographer the reader is vaguely conscious of a cer - tain hardness and bareness , the result of excessive self-concentration : the celibate literary life , how - ever full of high ideals and artistic enthusiasms , is not after all made to appear the most attractive sort of existence .

		Roundness and fulness , tenderness and warmth , are certainly lacking to it .

		The sacred authority of the inner voice is well insisted on , but with an iteration that tends at last to breed a little distrust of its infallibility .


Hugh Neville	PERSON	is an ardent seeker for and interpreter of the beautiful and the true as he sees them -- that is , as the author sees them .

		The detachment of the creative artist is not Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's : a delightful essayist of carefully reasoned ethical and literary convictions he is and will remain .

		As was to be expected , the style and finish of his book are exquisite , despite a few mis - prints , and one closes the volume with a sense of having enjoyed a rare treat .

		A mild surprise , how - ever , is felt at finding so correct a writer sanctioning the current questionable use of '' fierce . ''

		Refer - ence is made to the notion entertained by some
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 that `` Christ enforced upon men a fierce ideal of mortification and self-denial . ''

		Notwithstanding a tendency to repetition and undue elaboration -- a conspicuous lack of epigrammatic terseness , -- this book is the ripest , thoughtf uUest , best piece of work its author has yet produced .

		q ^ ^ ^ e title-page of Mr.
Booker	PERSON	T.
Washington	LOCATION	's volume on
Frederick Douglass	PERSON	in the '' American Crisis Biographies , '' published by
George W. Jacobs & , Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story of the slave who rose to be the Moses to lead his race out of bondage is very appropriately told by that other slave boy who has risen to be the
Joshua	PERSON	who is leading the race into the promised land of real independence through practical education and in - telligent labor .

		And the story is well told , with enthusiasm and admiration of the hero , but with self-repression , dignity , and a high degree of ability as a biographer .

		In this book Mr.
Washington	LOCATION	has shown that he can write well on other subjects than the education of the negro .

		In the portrayal of the character of
Douglass	PERSON	and of others who come into the story , in the description of the many striking scenes and of the development of the remarkable life of the great negro agitator , orator , and race - leader , in the history of slavery in
America	LOCATION	and of the movements for its abolition north and south , and in the judgments of public men on both sides of the slavery question , we see insight , breadth of view , and excellent power of discrimination as well as of literary expression .

		The book is interesting as a general treatment of the slavery question and as the biography of a man of power , and it is of permanent value as an account of the Abolition movement from the point of view of a member of the negro race .

		The general chapters on '' The Genesis of the Anti-Slavery Agitation , '' '' The
Fugi	ORGANIZATION	- tive Slave Law , '' '' The Underground Railway , '' '' The Enlistment of Colored Troops , '' '' Reconstruc - tion , '' and other topics of a similar nature , have been introduced to bring the work within the plan and pur - pose of the series of which it forms a worthy part .

		Amona the Miss
Elise Whitlock Rose	PERSON	's work `` southern '' ^ entitled '' Cathedrals and Cloisters of
France	LOCATION	.

		the South of
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a careful and conscientious study , in two volumes , of the ecclesiastical architecture of
Provence	LOCATION	, Lan - guedoc , and
Gascony	LOCATION	, with some account of the historical conditions that gave it birth and develop - ment .

		The text is fully and finely illustrated from photographs made expressly for the purpose by
Miss Vida Hunt Francis	ORGANIZATION	.

		Much of the territory that the artist and author have explored together is quite off the track of the ordinary tourist , and a complete guide in English to its architectural interests probably does not exist , whereas the authoritative French works are either very long or very technical .

		Miss Rose explains that in studying the cathedrals of the South one must immediately abandon the popular ideals of size , majesty , and architectural importance .

		In the South the cathedral is simply the bishop 's church , sometimes large and imposing , -- in which case it is generally modern and ugly , -- but much oftener small , modest , badly restored , half ruined , or inartistically complicated in design by the warring ideas of many * builders .

		But if the architecture is seldom interesting except in frag - ments or from the point of view of a painstaking student of transition periods , the romantic legends , curious traditions , and often no less curious history of
the Southern	ORGANIZATION	cathedrals go far to offset the bad taste of their builders , and consequently to lighten and diversify Miss Rose 's study .

		She writes im - personally but informally , employs few technicalities , and describes and criticises in a general way rather than in detail .

		Her method is neither so terse nor so orderly as the traveller , with less ample leisure than her own , may wish .

		For the stay-at-home reader also these volumes will prove somewhat too diffuse to hold his interest , although the unusual beauty of the illustrations will do a great deal towards keeping him in touch with the text .

		The wisdom ^ '' thirteen short , crisp chapters of of a modern conversational give and _ take , Mrs. J ^ neria .

		The Bird of Time : being
Conversa	ORGANIZATION	- tions with Egeria '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of the book in which these characters have their exits and their entrances .

		Egeria , clever and intellectual , of course , like her namesake of old , says more good things than anyone else in the book .

		Comforting to men as well as women is this dictum of hers : '' There need be no long , cold winter .

		There is no longer , thank goodness !

		any definite line marking the boundary between youth and old age .

		Why , the woman who to-day is cele - brated for distinctive charm and beauty , ripe views , disciplined intellect , cultivated and manifold gifts , would , forty years ago , have been relegated to the heavy ranks of the dowagers and grandmothers ; forced by the stern conventions of prevailing opin - ion to retire from the game just as she had gained a mastery of the rules . ''

		Frequent and apt are
Egeria	ORGANIZATION	's quotations , but once she goes a little astray in trying to cite
Pascal	PERSON	's famous saying as to what would have happened had Cleopatra 's nose been shorter ; she makes the subsequent history of the world turn on the presence or absence of a front tooth in the seductive Egyptian 's mouth .

		At the end of the book , after
Castilia	PERSON	has married the Judge ,

		346 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, A handbook of etching and engraving .

		The English translation of Dr. Fr .


Lippmann	PERSON	's `` Engraving and Etch - ing '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- should be welcomed by all who are interested in the sub - jects of which it treats .

		Though the literature of engraving is very abundant , there is no other work in English that so thorouglily covers the ground traversed by this excellent handbook .

		The history of the art is traced from the beginning in the mid -
dle of the fifteenth century	DATE	to the opening years of the nineteenth .

		All the engi-avers of note and many of the minor men are dealt with , and the character - istics of their work set forth with admirable clearness , the letter-press being supplemented by numerous illustrations which are wisely made of the exact size of the originals -- though in many instances this necessitated the reproduction of a detail instead of the entire print .

		The author , who was the keeper of the print room in the
Royal Museum	ORGANIZATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	, had unsurpassed opportunities for thorough and minute study .

		That he made good use of these the wealth of information packed into this volume bears wit - ness .

		Its compactness is not the least of its merits .

		The chapter on the technique of engraving tells in a few words just the things every collector needs to understand .

		The collector , it is true , will not find in it all he may wish to know , -- as for instance , lists of the authentic works of any of the engi-avers ; but the inclusion of such matter would be far beyond the compass of a handbook .

		This edition has been carefully revised by Dr.
Max Lehrs	PERSON	, Dr.
Lippmann	PERSON	's successor in the print room of the
Berlin	LOCATION	Museum .

		The translation , by Mr.
Martin Hardie	PERSON	of the
Victoria and Albert Museum	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, is all that could be desired .

		Musings , tnostly mystical .

		Suggestiveness is the most valuable quality of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's essays on all sorts of subjects .

		He widens wonderfully the mental horizon of his readers .

		`` The Measure of the Hours '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , named from the opening chapter on time - measuring devices , is his latest volume of collected pieces , all of them admirably translated , so far as one may judge without comparing the French , by Mr.
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos	PERSON	, and many of them offering something novel and worthy of more than a moment 's pondering .

		His tentative theory that life after death may mean an exchange of mortal powers for a new kind of consciousness , a sort of sixth sense whereof we can no more form a conception at present than a man born blind can conceive of color , is well presented , but of course not new .


James Hinton	PERSON	, to name no others , has somewhere elaborated an ingenious argument to the same effect .

		The one literary essay in the collec - tion , that on ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' attributes the preemi - nence of this tragedy to the fact that the madness of the aged king enables him , in his very human and appealing distress , to be grandly lyrical and passionate without running into bombast .

		The chapter on intelligence in plants will please the sentimental school of naturalists , but to the strictly scientific it will be foolishness .

		The essays on our social duty and our anxious morality , themes of practical import surely , are not exactly remarkable for poise and precision .

		On the other hand , the remarks '' In Praise of the Fist '' are unexpectedly good and to the point .

		ig ^ g ^ .

		autumn is revived by the recent publication of his volume on Balzac in the `` French Men of Letters '' series -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Even reserved admirers of
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	will easily concur with Brunetiere in placing the great novelist with Sainte-Beuve ,
Hugo	PERSON	,
Comte	ORGANIZATION	, and two or three savants , as the writers who have exerted the greatest influence upon nineteenth-century
France	LOCATION	.

		They may also agree that his work formed a point of departure for the modem novel .

		But this great critic goes further : '' Balzac is the novel , '' he tells us ; his power of drawing genre pictures makes his novels of tremen - dous historical and social value ; he gives , for the first time , an exact representation of life , and treat - ing life thus faithfully he evades the stigma of '' immorality '' ; he '' created '' the novel-form , trans - formed the drama , and even changed the manners and customs of life .

		Brunetifere insists that in judging Balzac one should consider his work in its entirety -- the Human Comedy as a whole .

		His originality lay in his universal conception of life coupled with his realism .

		Balzac 's art , for this very reason , comprised no power of selection , and was in no way self-conscious ; he wrote without any theory of art , since the mere representation of life was his aim .

		Brunetifere 's entire treatment of his subject , being a study of
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's work and in no sense a biography , tends to stimulate investigation and discussion , and can hardly be disregarded in any study of
Balzac	LOCATION	's literary art .

		A volume of Whistleriana The volume entitled '' Whistler : Notes and Footnotes and other Memoranda , '' in which Mr.
Albert E. Gallatin	PERSON	has reprinted some fifteen reviews and other fugitive articles contributed to various period - icals , is made notable by the inclusion of reproduc - tions of two hitherto unpublished drawings by
Whistler	LOCATION	in the author 's possession , and of one of his drawings for the catalogue of Sir
Henry Thompson	PERSON	's collection of '' Blue and White . ''

		The charming water-color , '' Symphony in Gray -- the Thames at Dusk , '' that forms the frontispiece to the book , is excellently reproduced and will be of interest to admirers of the master 's work .

		It is a pity that the size of the original is not stated .

		The `` Studies of Poppies '' -LRB- sic -RRB- done in pastel , has not come out so well ; the grain of the half-tone block is rather painfully in evidence and results in an effect too mechanical to be satisfactory .

		Of the other plates in the volume , the grotesques by
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	, from the originals in the
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 347 Academy in

		The book is handsomely printed on hand-made paper , and in nearly all the details of fine book-making is impeccable .

		Mr.
Gallatin	PERSON	's notes are thoughtful and suggestive , and have the merit of brevity .

		The sale of the book in
England	LOCATION	is reported to have been enjoined by Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's executrix , a basis for the action having been found in the print - ing of facsimiles of

		It is difficult to see for whom this work is designed .

		It is not a text-book , for it lacks the neces - sary apparatus , and it is written in too dry and con - densed a style to attract the general reader .

		It is , moreover , far from impeccable as regards accuracy and soundness of judgment .

		These introductions are printed in both French and English .

		Upwards of fifty composers in aU are represented , from
Chambonniferes	LOCATION	and

		NOTES .

		380 ONE HUNDRED BOOKS FOR SUMMER READING 381 A select descriptive list of the season 's best Fiction and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	books .

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 384 THi : BREA TH OF ROMANCE .

		The breath of romance bloweth where it listeth , but we know not whence it cometh nor whither it goeth .

		So indefinable is its nameless charm that we hardly know even what to caU it .

		Try to give a definition of romance , and you are baffled ; analyze it , and it disappears ; put your finger on it , and it is not there .

		One might as well chase the rainbow or reach out for the simset radiance .

		It is of the nature of poetry ; it is sometimes akin to religion ; it always has in some measure the element of won - der ; in first love it is a potent presence ; and we may question whether it entirely leaves us except with the breath of life itself .

		At times we feel that it is life , that with the complete fading away -LRB- were such a thing possible -RRB- of the vision of its unrealized , its ever-to-be-desired beauty and excellence , there would die also the very soul within us .

		And yet one feels that it is utterly different from self .

		Nothing is more emphatically the not-seK .

		To attain the romantic , we long to be where we are not , to do what we are not now doing .

		If in
Syracuse	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, we would be in
Syracuse	LOCATION	,
Sicily	LOCATION	; from
Paris	LOCATION	we turn eyes of desire toward
Rome	LOCATION	; gliding down the
Rhine	LOCATION	, we wish to exchange our steamboat for a gon - dola , the river for a canal in
Venice	LOCATION	.

		Anywhere but here , -- any time but now !

		Anything to escape from self !

		We are filled with a divine unrest .

		The savage has been defined as a be - ing who has no past and no future ; and so we -- at least until we have attained the peace that passeth understanding -- refuse to find perfect content in the here and now .

		We race through one novel only to take up another , and if pos - sible a better ; delight our souls with
Keats	PERSON	, and then leave him for Chaucer ; follow breath - less the rapid story of
Benvenuto Cellini	PERSON	's eventful life , and straightway ask for
Amiel	ORGANIZATION	's Journal .

		The remote in time and place are romantic only so long as they are remote . ''

		A ship , '' says
Emerson	PERSON	, '' is a romantic object to those who behold it from the shore , not to those on board .

		* ' To honest
Nick Bottom	PERSON	in good old
England	LOCATION	the African lion is an object of shuddering fascination , '' for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion , living . ''

		The imperious craving for the ideal and the 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, romantic is never more strongly upon us than when we are in love .


John Newton	PERSON	, sea-captain , slave-trader , hard and severe divine , and not too sympathetic friend of
Cowper	PERSON	, had his expe - rience of this , for he was once most desperately in love ; and in that golden time he used to go all the way -LRB- on foot , we may suppose -RRB- from
London	LOCATION	to
Shooter	ORGANIZATION	's Hill , wherever that may be , simply to look toward the quarter where dwelt the future Mrs.
Newton	PERSON	.

		Not that he could catch the faintest glimpse of gable-end or chimney-pot to mark the sacred spot , for she lived far beyond the range of his vision even after he had travelled all those miles and climbed to the top of the hLU ; but it gratified the lover , as he afterward assured a friend , to be able merely to look in her direction ; and this pleasure he indulged in regularly once a week , and sometimes twice .

		What drove New - ton to seek the summit of Shooter 's Hill must have been the '' pricking pain '' of which
Plato	ORGANIZATION	tells us . ''

		Man 's soul , in a former state , '' he says , '' was winged , and soared among the gods ; and so it comes to pass that , in this life , when the soul , by the power of music or poetry , or the sight of beauty , hath her remembrance quickened , forthwith there is a struggling and a pricking pain as of wings trying to come forth , -- even as children in teething . ''

		Romance is not a thing made by novelists and poets , as the matter-of-fact man asserts , any more than the peach is made by its bloom , the brook by the babble of its waters , or the volcano by its crater .

		Against any such theory the romancer himself protests . ''

		Let us look up in fear and reverence , '' exclaims Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	in glowing phrase in '' The Minister 's Wooing , '' '' and say , ' God is the great maker of romance .

		He , from whose hand came man and woman , -- He , who strung the great harp of Existence with all its wild and wonderful and manifold chords , and attuned them to one another , -- He is the great Poet of life . '

		... The scoffing spirit that laughs at romance is an apple of the Devil 's own handing from the bitter tree of knowledge ; it opens the eyes only to see eternal nakedness .

		K ever you have had a romantic , uncalculating friendship , a boundless worship and belief in some hero of your soul , -- if ever you have so loved that all cold prudence , all selfish worldly considerations , have gone down like driftwood before a river flooded with new rain from heaven , so that you even forgot your - self , and were ready to cast your whole being into the chasm of existence , as an offering before the feet of another , and all for nothing , -- if you awoke bitterly betrayed and deceived , still give thanks to God that you have had one glimpse of heaven .

		The door now shut will open again . ''

		But the romance of love and friendship is , as already intimated , only a part , though the most important and interesting part , of romance as a whole .

		Goethe has said that nothing is more significant of a man 's character than what he finds laughable .

		More significant even than the amusing or ridiculous is that wherein a man finds charm , wonder , poetry , romance .

		There is a romance of science , of natural history , of astronomy , of pure mathematics even , and of metaphysics , as tridy as there is a romance of love and of friendship .

		Jenkin on '' Bridge Construction , '' or Crehore on `` The Mechanics of the Girder , '' or Stoney 's '' Theory of Stresses , '' may not contain so much poetry or romance for you or me as for the artificer in wood and iron and stone .

		Ruskin 's '' Seven Lamps of
Archi	LOCATION	- tecture '' has far more .

		Archimedes , in his dream of a fulcrum firm enough and a lever long enough to enable him to tumble the earth about in space , betrayed the romantic tempera - ment .

		The romance of an epoch expresses itself through its typical genius .

		The chapters of
Alexander	PERSON	's romance were military cam - paigns ; the
Gracchi	PERSON	wrote theirs in terms of agrarian laws ;
Demosthenes	PERSON	has left his in the form of orations .

		All the world has read or has heard about
Darwin	PERSON	's epoch-making ro - mance ; for that the theory of evolution is , in certain aspects , a splendid romance , can not be denied .

		Its author comes no nearer to absolute proof of his conclusions in `` The Origin of Species '' and '' The Descent of Man '' than does
Cervantes	PERSON	to proof of the essential beauty and dignity and sanity of his hero 's character .

		Romance did not die in
1832	DATE	with
Scott	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, but it presently assumed new form in
Darwin	LOCATION	's pages , flashed a new light in his dis - coveries , and took possession of a new domain .

		The product of the '' scientific imagination '' was for a period , for an interim , to serve as food for the romance-hunger of the English - speaking world .

		But it was a scientific imagi - nation held well in hand ; not even
Poe	PERSON	's '' Fall of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Usher '' being more circum - stantial .

		It dealt in fullest detail with the actual , thus meeting the demands of an age somewhat surfeited with romance of the old - fashioned kind , an age that had outgrown the instinct that in childhood asks for what can not be -LRB- the fairytale -RRB- , and in manhood demands what might be -LRB- the story of love , of friendship , of war ,
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 361 of religious devotion -RRB- .

		Such an age no longer wishes , in
Hazlitt	PERSON	's words , to be what it is not and to do what it can not , but still craves , even in the actually existent , some glimpse of the yet unattained , some glamour of romance , some subject-matter for wonder .

		In ripe maturity as in callow infancy , man hungers for the ideal , the unrealized , and -LRB- he is driven to confess it -RRB- the imrealizable .

		A realizable ideal would be intolerable .

		The more and more nearly ap - proachable , but never quite attainable , can alone charm us .

		Romance , no more than religion , has any - thing to fear from science .

		The more extended the sphere of the known shall become through scientific research , just so much larger a surface will it present to the circumjacent unknowable ; and in this latter reside the wonderful , the romantic , the poetic , the ideal .

		What
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	said twenty-seven years ago about the hopeful future of poetry is no less true of romance , the two shading imperceptibly into each other .

		This promising future of what we may , borrowing from
Wordsworth	PERSON	, call `` the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge , '' is limitless .

		To close with
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's words , its future '' is immense , because in poetry -LSB- and in romance in the large sense -RSB- , where it is worthy of its high destinies , our race , as time goes on , will find an ever surer and surer stay .

		There is not a creed which is not shaken , not an accredited dogma which is not shown to be questionable , not a received tradition which does not threaten to dissolve .

		Our religion has materialized itself in the fact , in the supposed fact ; it has attached its emotion to the fact , and now the fact is failing it .

		But for poetry -LSB- and romance -RSB- the idea is everything ; the rest is a world of illusion , of divine illusion .

		Poetry attaches its emotion to the idea ; the idea is the fact .

		The strongest part of our religion to-day is its unconscious poetry . ''


Percy F. Bicbuuell	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The eighty-eighth birthday of an old New - Englander whom many outside of little old
New England	LOCATION	delight to honor was celebrated a few weeks ago , when Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	completed four-score and eight years .

		Father Knickerbocker proudly claims her as his child , for she was born in
New York	LOCATION	, in Marketfield Street , near the present
Produce Exchange	ORGANIZATION	, where a few ancient brick houses of that time -LRB- 1819 -RRB- are still to be seen .

		The tribute of a bowl of roses from the Greeks of
Boston	LOCATION	was , of course , a touching reminder to Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	of the reflected fame she still enjoys as widow of Dr.
Samuel G. Howe	PERSON	, whose ardent participation in the Greek war for independence now lies more than three-quarters of a century in the past , but has very recently been vividly recalled to memory by his daughter 's publication of the young surgeon-soldier 's diaries .

		As reviving memories of a much later war , let us quote a few words from Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's account of the writing of her famous '' Battle Hymn , '' She was returning from a parade of Federal troops , and `` to pass the time away we sang `
John Brown	PERSON	's Body . '

		Some of the marching regiments took it up , and it was passed along the road until the echoes reverberated for miles .

		My pastor asked me why I did not put the spirit of `
John Brown	PERSON	's Body Lies a-Mouldering in the Grave ' into some graceful and expressive words .

		I told him I had tried .

		One morning soon after that I awoke suddenly about daylight , and the lines I wanted were vaguely run - ning through my mind .

		I arose and wrote them down .

		They were published in the
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, and the editor -LSB-
Lowell	PERSON	-RSB- named them ' The Battle Hymn of the Republic ' ''
Emerson	PERSON	as judged by his classmates and his teachers at college passed for neither very studious nor very brilliant , but most amiable , winning , and modest , and given to blushing on small provocation .

		Some of his fellows even thought him dull , and very few predicted for him a distinguished future .

		Mr.
Fraii B. Sanborn	PERSON	touched on this interesting matter at the celebration of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's 104th birthday , and adduced also the judgment of another contemporary ,
Alcott	PERSON	, who wrote -LRB- about 1838 -RRB- of his not then famous feUow-townsman : '' The day shall come when this man 's genius shall shine beyond the circle of his own city and nation ; it shall flash across the wide water , and receive the homage of other peoples .

		Emerson is destined to be the high literary name of this age .

		Other men we have who ply small trade in the nooks and comers of this wide sea , and whose wares are pedled at this place and that ; but this man 's genius is cosmopolitan , and shall be in demand wherever man has risen above the mere mechanics and utilities of life . ''


Theodore Parker	PERSON	, after a dozen years ' acquaintance with
Emerson	PERSON	, spoke of his culture in a way that , as Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	intimates , contrasts strangely with Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's later pro- nouncement .

		Parker wrote : ''
Emerson	PERSON	's literary culture is of him , and not merely on him .

		His learning appears not in his quotations , but in his talk .

		His reading gives a certain richness to his style , which is more literary than that of any Amer - ican writer ; as much so as
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	's . ''

		The later critic assures us that '' his reading was strange but not learned . ''

		Yet who shall assert that
Parker	PERSON	, whose reading was both strange and learned , was no good judge of literary culture ?

		The failure of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's young associates to discern the embryo sage need not cause surprise .

		Schoolboys are pro- verbially quick to take the measure of a man , but are as blind to undeveloped genius as the rest of us .

		362 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, Stories of extraordinary thefts have done much to enliven the pages of literature ; and they also at times relieve the humdrum monotony of life , though not to the equal satisfaction of all parties concerned .

		In prose fiction ,
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	has given us '' The Stolen White Elephant . ''

		In the drama ,
Susannah Centlivre	PERSON	amused
London	LOCATION	play-goers a generation ago with the comedy of `` The Stolen Heiress , '' and
Paul Merritt	PERSON	entertained them with '' Stolen Kisses '' -LRB- not the most extraordinary kind of stealing , it must be admitted -RRB- , while patrons of the present-day stage have enjoyed the complications of `` The Stolen Story . ''

		The rich plunder of the Forty Thieves made glad the heart and plethoric the pocket of the poor Persian woodcutter
Ali Baba	PERSON	; and a far different kind of theft brought sorrow to the hearts of many pious members of a
New England	LOCATION	community in much more recent times , as may be read in a slender pamphlet printed about fifty years ago and entitled , '' Stolen !

		From Many Citizens in
Cambridge	LOCATION	, on the 4th Instant , the Rest and Quiet of the Holy Sabbath Day '' -- by reason of the unpuritanical determination of the
Union Railway Company	ORGANIZATION	to run its cars on
Sunday	DATE	.

		Finally , it was but yesterday , so to speak , that some energetic Japanese patriots -- vandals , the indig - nant
Koreans	LOCATION	would call them -- carried off the massive white marble pagoda of P'ung - duk from the environs of
Seoul	LOCATION	, which one would have supposed to be as improbable a bit of souvenir-collecting as the purloining , if we can imagine it , of our Wash - ington Monument by the English , or the pocketing of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's tomb at
Riverside Park	LOCATION	by -LRB- let us say -RRB- some nephew or grandson of
Jefferson Davis	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it has long been a subject of remark that truth is stranger than fiction .

		What invention of the fancy could rival that remarkable larceny of a well belonging to
Abraham	LOCATION	, which , as we read in '' Genesis , ''
Abimelech	ORGANIZATION	's servants violently carried away ?

		The longevity of a good joke is a matter of common knowledge .

		A juicy joke of pronounced human flavor enjoys -- to quote from one of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's long-forgotten sonnets -- '' more days than went to make the gem that crowned the white top of Methu - salem . ''

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has lately written a good but almost too erudite account of certain transfers and transmissions and re-applications and -LRB- if one may say so -RRB- reincarnations of tried and tested stories .

		His unusual familiarity with Scotch history and legend furnishes him with abundant illustration of the imperishability of a tale that contains elements of universal appeal .

		He even goes so far as to assert that '' an Egyptian myth of a sort only quot - able in scientific circles is current among the most untutored Australian black fellows , whose ancestors may have heard Ham narrate it in the

		A story has recently been told of one of our college professors who is said to be so absent-minded that , after leaving his house and posting on the door the hour of his expected return , if he comes back before the advertised time he sits down and waits for him - self to come and open the door .

		Rumor , ever fertile in invention , would have us believe that at a recent spiritistic sSance in
Rome	LOCATION	a table violently hurled itself at
Signore Gabriele d'Annunzio	PERSON	and chased him with fell intent around the room ; and this astonishing display of ferocity on the table 's part is attributed to the lately-deceased poet
Carducci	PERSON	as instigator and prime mover , the lamented bard being known to have cherished very unfriendly feelings toward his junior fellow-poet .

		But there is more to tell .

		Not content with phy - sical violence , the quadrupedal agent of
Carducci	PERSON	's animosity proceeded to rap out some very uncom - plimentary opinions of the hated one 's literary pro- ductions .

		Friends of the young man are now apprehensive of what may occur if a certain famous actress , with whom he is at variance , crosses the bar before him .

		Combining their forces , his two enemies might easily toss a grand piano at him in an un - guarded moment , or give him his quietus with one of the ample wardrobes in which he keeps his ninety-nine changes of raiment .

		The question was recently raised in the

		It was decided by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that this question must be determined by the circum - stances of each case , separately considered .

		And so the indignant , if not indigent , author is likely to find himself mulcted for not selling his wares out - right instead of patiently waiting year after year for the uncertain royalties that constitute his preca - rious revenue .

		This command of invective is no more than might have been expected in an ex-editor of a certain
London	LOCATION	literary review issued on the last day of each week ; and the fact that Mr.
Harris	PERSON	once wrote a book himself on '' The Man Shakespeare '' probably gives him in this instance additional confidence and freedom in ventUating his vocabulary .

		It may be , however , that he , no more than his victim , looks upon this kind of smartly-picturesque denunciation as serious criticism ; nay , more , it is very possible that , in the kindness of his heart , he is printing this array of unusual adjectives and nouns as the surest means of advertising an excellent book .

		* One of the recurrent joys of our latter - day springs is the forthputting of the many books which may be broadly classed as garden - books , since they have to do with flowers in somebody 's gardens , either man 's or
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's .

		For the sake of the almost limitless power and range of their suggestion , it is easily forgiven the writers of many of these essays into well - known or imknown fields that they handicap their work with recitals of the sayings and do - ings of all sorts and conditions of men , women , and even babies ; but it is always a far greater pleasure to find that the writer has trusted to the growing green things themselves for the interest of the book , and has left out the sug - gestions of human presence save an occasional modest '' I. '' It is thus with the beautiful vol - ume entitled '' Natures Own Garden , '' which has come to us from over-seas , from which it will be so great a pleasure to quote that only a thin thread of comment is needed to hold the excerpts together .

		The keynote of Mrs.
Clarke	PERSON	's work is struck in the words of Richard JefPeries which stand in the place of the dedication that should have been offered to his beloved memory , so full is the book of the spirit that came into the world with
Thoreau	PERSON	and found its highest exemplar in the author of '' The Story of My Heart . ''

		It would hardly have been possible to write '' Na - ture 's Own Garden '' had not Jefferies shared with us the wonderful and beautiful thoughts born of his close friendship with English fields and commons , English lanes and hedgerows , English copses and woodlands , and the banks of English brooks and rivers .

		The dear un - praised growths which Nature has always loved , and to which he gave the devotion of his too - short life , but which men often call common or even unclean , by his earnest disciple are treated with the sympathy and justice with which he ever won '' the secret of the weed 's plain heart . ''

		Eyes hungering for beauty are again , as in
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	's enchanting pages , persuaded to look at things that are near and common , and to find it there ; and herein lies the value of this book .

		Rarely has attention been more clearly called to the decorative possibilities of many obscure water-loving plants ; rarely have nature 's ways *

		of grouping and massing , the value of wide plantings of single species , or the infinite fore - thought for succession , been better understood ; and still more rarely has a book been so filled with an ever-present sense of the relations of each tiniest moss with the universe of life .

		To give a taste of the quality of the book , we quote a passage on English grass-fields in
June	DATE	. ''

		When each and all of the Nature Gardens are so lovely in their own particular way , it is unwise to show partiality ; and yet there is something dangerously like it , if I say that the gardens of the grass-fields in
June	DATE	seem to hold the largest possibilities of any .

		. '

		.

		.

		The corn-fields have their very definite beauty , but there is not the variety of plants growing among the corn that the grass can muster . ''

		It seems such a perfectly content and satisfactory family , studding the green with all colours : white and yellow , orange , blue and pink of many shades .

		And there are not the obvious signs of struggle ; so many of the species stand in an orderly height with each other -- all can drink up the moisture below , and sway in the warm air freely ; a garden of much beatitude .

		As the weeks of
June	DATE	add together , the flowers ' strength and the strength of the grass seem to rise and swell into the fullest tide of the flowers ' year . ''

		The woods are busy , and the hedges showing all their strength of beautiful things ; but the heart of Jime seems in the grass-fields standing for hay .

		One watches the growing magnificence with a joy that becomes fret - ted with a fear -- for there wiU be a sudden turning of that tide , not at the hand of Nature , for her proceedings are never sudden , but at the hand of man . ''

		Here is a pretty picture of the Harebell : '' There is a distinctive thinness and lightness in the
Harebell	LOCATION	flowers that suggest the surround of the wind ; the flower that living on high land is evolved during months of ceaseless wind-rush .

		Utterly unlike the Orchid of the woods , constructed of moisture-laden cells , the Harebells have been formed under circum - stances when moisture was at a minimum .

		The winds dry ofP all evaporation rapidly when the Harebell is '' '' blooming , and
July	DATE	and
August	DATE	sunshine beats down upon the land extracting the value of every thunder shower .

		It is as if the pale blue-bells were stretched to the attenuation of parchment by constant adaptation to the wind-rush -- constant gift to the demand of cir - cumstance , yet nothing painfully , for all is orderly in the slow steps by which sensation is expressed in char - acteristic form .

		Being perfected as wind-flowers , they bend to it with ease in all ways ; sudden gusts or fierce onslaughts when
September	DATE	catches the flower with storms , are met by the
Harebell	PERSON	's wiriness of growth as accustomed events ; it is equal to them as a natural contact of surrounding . ''

		Heather has seldom been better portrayed than in this extract : '' This is the garden-ground proper for the
Heather	PERSON	, where there is wide space for it , and the slopes and hollows , down to the bed of the peaty streams where the sundew thrives and catches all its need of the great insect-humming world that dances over the purple sea .

		THE DIAL 365 under the sun ; all the run of light and shadow over it ; all the himi and song above it ; and the life of the tribes in Nature that creep and burrow and tunnel out their homes deep in the
Heather	PERSON	roots -- this is the glory of one of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's best gardens .

		And where the land is the
Heather	PERSON	's own , it makes and names the place so in its own language of pure colour : crimson that is deep where the sprays tuft in shadow , and crimson that , catching the blue of the sky on all the myriad of little bells , turns a softer and bluer note on the upper swells of the land , and on into the long distance where the haze wraps blue and crimson together as one , and in all of it the glory of the
Heather	PERSON	sings in the silences .

		The heat beats down upon it , and brings out the aromatic scent powerfully , something pungent and yet sweet , as baffling to close scrutiny as the shifting of colour-lines to the eye ; the division-lines of partitions are not there ; in both these is the weaving to and fro of much com - plexity that defies decision . ''

		But the moors in
Summer	DATE	are not for decisions , but for the receiving of matters that are given in breadth and place ; songs sung through great chords .

		It is like being '' in

		Many of the wide margins bear pen-drawings for the comfort of the reader who does not know what borage looks like or what stitchwort is .

		Many other large colored plates are due to the clever brush-work of the author ; but here is to be felt something of the disappointment that always accompanies the eager glance which first greets any effort to express the meaning of flowers in a mass .

		One can not always recognize the flowers of the text in the plates , -- they are often too broad in treatment and too vague in color ; but they add greatly to our pleasure by a certain stimulating quality which unites the plant to the landscape in a very delightful way .

		The dome of the British Museum reading-room is thought to be in danger of collapse ; hence the room is to be closed for repairs during the

		It has been conjectured that the only reason why the dome has not long since fallen on the studious heads beneath is that the density of the atmosphere , which has caused so many of those heads to ache , upheld the structure and so saved them from what might have made them ache - still worse , or have even put an end to their capacity for aching at all .

		Studies in Anim al. .

		IiIfe .

		* The latest volume in the '' Nature Series '' of illustrated works dealing with various phases of the living world is concerned with a group of animals that bring to the minds of most read - ers only a shudder of horror .

		Seekers for thrills will not find in the pages of Mr.
Ditmars	PERSON	's '' Reptile Book '' much exciting literature , though they may run across some good snake - stories , and can readily satisfy the most morbid appetite for a chilly feeling down the back or for that undesirable tension of the scalp that most of us experience at the rustle of a snake in the grass .

		One has only to scan the many photographs of serpents in various attitudes of action and repose , which the author has very cleverly collected , to appreciate how effective a temperance tract he has unwittingly prepared !

		If , however , the reader turns from a casual inspection of the book to a careful perusal of its pages , he very soon finds that all reptiles are not as black as they are painted , -- that , indeed , they may even become exceedingly interest - ing .

		Turtles , alligators , lizards , and even some snakes , make tractable and interesting pets , learn to eat from their keeper 's hand , and , if properly kept , thrive in captivity .

		It is high time that man as a rational being should stop his indiscriminate bruising of serpents ' heads and limit the action of his heel to those that actually do menace human life .

		Some species -- as , for example , the gopher snakes -- are bene - ficial to the farmer by their destruction of ro - dents , and most of the common species are at least innocuous .

		Let us hope that Mr.
Ditmars	PERSON	's book may do something toward increasing the number of advocates of the rights of even snakes to life , liberty , and the pursuit of such vermin as they need .

		The author , as Keeper of Reptiles in the
New York Zoological Gardens	ORGANIZATION	, has had exceptional opportunities to study this interesting but much neglected group under ideal conditions .

		His photographs are most excellent , and are very life-like with a few exceptions where preserved material appears to have been used .

		366 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, `` My camera has worked hard and faithfully , and the details of structure have been fully portrayed ; but in a work like this colour value in the pattern is of great importance , and here the camera has its limitations , though assisted by the ray-filter and colour-sensitive plates .

		A great amount of work was done upon the negatives themselves , and in this the use of restraining dyes formed an important part ; some of the developed plates were put through a half-dozen processes before they passed a satisfactory test .

		Those illustrations of snakes that are blotched or ringed with scarlet -LRB- a diffi - cult problem for the camera -RRB- are good examples of the final result . ''

		The author exhibits a fine scorn for details of nomenclature , and for anatomical and structural features , especially internal characters not easily seen by the careless observer .

		It is very evident , however , that more care on his part to insure the correct terminology would have added greatly to the permanent value of his work , and fur - thermore that its general usefulness would have been greatly enhanced by a more generous in - clusion of pertinent anatomical , physiological , and oecological detail .

		It is to be presumed that the general reader would be quite as much in - terested in the structure of the poison glands and fangs of the rattlesnake , or in the peculiar pineal eye of lizards , or in the relations of color changes in reptiles to heat and cold , as in ex - tended accounts of the superficial markings of various species .

		This narrow approach to the subject has somewhat marred the proportions of an otherwise valuable treatise .

		A series of popular essays on the natural history of ants and other insects that exhibit highly developed instincts and habits are in - cluded in a volume entitled '' Nature 's Crafts - men , '' from the pen of the veteran entomologist and student of insect activities .

		Dr.
Henry C. McCook	PERSON	.

		The score of chapters are , for the most part , revisions or expansions of recent magazine articles , supplemented by considerable new material , and all are abundantly illustrated .

		They are largely drawn from the field of the author 's specialty , the study of ants and spiders , with a number of original studies of wild bees , water spiders , caddis flies , wasps , and ant-lions .

		The various chapters deal with such subjects as the life of the queen ant , the dispersal of ant colonies , the aphid herds and the habits of ants in the care of their aphid flocks , the personal hygiene of ants and methods of emmet sanita - tion , the slave-making forays and the relations between captor and vassal , the so-called agri - cultural ants , and the curious honey ants of the far West .

		Not the least interesting chapter is that which deals with aeronautic spiders . ''

		Let one walk in the fields on a warm
October	DATE	day when a soft breeze is blowing .

		If he will stoop low and glance along the meadow , his eye will catch the sheen of myriads of fine silken filaments .

		They float from every elevated spot .

		They fringe fence-posts and hedges .

		They stream like pennants from tall weeds .

		They interlace the foliage of bushes with delicate meshes , or flutter like ribbons from their tops .

		These are the ropes and netting of ballooning spiders . ''

		If , now , one will glance upward , he will be apt to see long , white , sinuous filaments drifting through the air , over tree-tops , across streams , far aloft , or perhaps low enough to be within reach .

		If he will grasp one of these threads he may find in his hand a small spider ; but not always , for many drifting filaments are simply trial threads , or loose bits of the drag-lines which spi - ders are apt to throw out as anchors when they walk .

		His captive will be a flying-spider , arrested in aeronautic flight , and the silken filament is , in fact , her balloon . ''

		Dr.
McCook	PERSON	's work is popular in the sense that it deals with '' phases of natural life that come most easily into common thought and in - terest , '' but its spirit is scientific and its literary form is excellent .

		The character of the con - tents , the interesting nature of the observations related , and the clearness and grace of the author 's style , all combine to place the book in the first rank of popular natural histories .

		While the author of '' The Reptile Book '' has yielded to the English , or perhaps entomologi - cal , habit of appending a common name to each species , in almost all cases coined directly from the Latin scientific name , Dr.
McCook	PERSON	has wisely presumed that the intelligence of his readers is sufficient to justify the use of the scientific name without the accompanying vul - gar patronymic .

		Mr.
Charles John Cornish	PERSON	, the author of '' Animal Artisans , '' was an English school - master at
St. Paul 's School	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, an
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	man , and a contributor for many years to '' The Spectator '' and '' Country Life '' -LRB- English -RRB- of essays on natural-history subjects .

		This volume of essays , edited by his wife , is to the American reader an interesting revelation of the attitude of the educated Englishman toward natural history .

		The range of topics discussed is indeed a wide one , reaching from the '' Fauna of the Railroad '' to ''
Canary Culture	ORGANIZATION	, '' and from '' The Simple Life '' to '' Animals and their Clothes , '' Running through the nearly two-score chapters is a great deal of clever field observation upon the ways of animals , -- observations such as a sportsman-naturalist , imbued with a love of nature , and endowed with a keen eye for sig - nificant , interesting , or unusual phenomena , might make .

		These observations are recorded in excellent form , and , as might be expected .

		THE DIAL 367 with abundant literary and historical allusion , as in the following example : '' Whence the legend of the swan-song came is not very certain .

		It was one of the tales of the ancients ; but , like most other fables concerning birds and beasts , was very early questioned .

		Even Pliny , in his great reservoir of nonsense about animals , doubted it ; and so did Athenseus and others .

		Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	noted it among his ' vulgar errors . '

		But the call of the hooper swan , as it flies , is very striking , and when uttered by night may well have given rise to the story . ''

		One receives the impression that the natural history here recorded is the outcome of an avo - cation .

		It lacks the tension , and the critical point of view , of the trained scientist .

		It reveals a temper of mind fostered by and perhaps expressed in the many British natural history field-clubs , a diversion akin to the Briton 's love of sport , but with added intel - lectual and aesthetic elements .

		How rarely , indeed , in the rush of our American life , do we find time or occasion to cultivate this con - templative temper of mind toward nature !

		In the rivalry of our vocations have we not too much neglected the contribution which this avocation might make to the sanity and health of our intellectual life ?

		* Although it is comparatively but few years since Americans began to take a vital interest in gardening , and in beautifying the surround - ings of their homes , the number of writers on the subject has grown so rapidly that one is tempted to vary the words of Solomon to read , '' Of making many garden books there is no end .

		Yet so long as they contain something novel either in matter or form , there can hardly be too many of them .

		tended chiefly for English readers , has hardly less interest for garden-makers in this country , especially those who would plant or improve woodland .

		The secondary title of the book , '' Home Woods , Home Landscape , '' suggests its character ; and although Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	has several chapters on other aspects of garden - making , it is the larger eifects and methods that he here makes prominent .

		In the begin - ning , he fulminates with something of the same sort of indignation
Ruskin	PERSON	shows against false ideas of beauty , and he is a sharp critic of pre - tenders and pretentious writers .

		He himself is a serious and earnest worker in landscape gar - dening -LRB- he scorns the expression '' landscape architect , '' which he considers a contradiction in terms -RRB- , and he illustrates his principles with numerous examples of work already carried out .

		Some of the specific subjects considered are flowering shrubs and trees , climbers , rock and wall gardens , the wild garden , the aspects of the flower garden in different seasons , the '' new '' rose garden , marsh , bog , and water gardens , fragrance , the orchard beautiful , lawns , and playgrounds .

		Nearly half the book is de - voted to the home woods -- the woodland gar - den , the large trees of the northern forests , evergreen covert , underwoods , mixed woods , waste in planting , fencing for woodland , and other branches of the subject .

		The author has a final chapter defending his use of common English names of plants and trees ; and here we must differ with him .

		He is doubtless right in his contention that the Latin names , which are subject to change at the hands of scientists , are frequently confusing or misleading to the amateur ; but since the popular English names are not always common to all English-speaking countries , a glossary that would furnish a com - mon meeting-ground would make the book more valuable .

		There is a fairly good index , and the book is dignified in appearance , without illus - trations .

		Mr.
Eben E. Rexford	PERSON	, whose name is found in the tables of contents of many popular mag - azines as an authority on gardening topics , has brought some of these papers together in a vol - ume entitled '' Four Seasons in the Garden . ''

		The title is an arbitrary one , for the chapters , while they include such titles as `` Spring in the Garden , '' '' The Garden in
Summer	DATE	, '' '' The Flowers of FaU , '' '' FaU Work in the Garden , '' and '' The Winter Window-Garden , '' embrace others that come under none of these headings and are apparently in no special order of arrangement ; nor is winter in the out-door 368 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, garden considered at all , save very incidentally .

		In other words , the book is not what its title might indicate -- a guide to the seasons in their order .

		It is likely to be most serviceable to beginners in garden-making .

		The author 's language is simple , his style is popular , and he gives facts and instruction in an easily under - stood form .

		Especially on such subjects as lawns , flower-beds , back-yard gardens , window - boxes , the growing of bulbs , etc. , the book will be helpful and suggestive .

		The chapter on `` A Garden of Native Plants '' suggests some of the lovely shrubs , vines , and plants that can be secured to beautify even the smallest garden .

		To many city dwellers , accustomed to make a garden only of bedding-plants , these hints will come as a revelation .

		Possibly an undue share of attention is given to in-door gardening , but the chapters on '' The Culture and Care of Palms '' and '' The Use of Growing Plants for Table Decoration '' will no doubt prove very useful in helping to provide floral decorations for the table .

		Two chapters on `` Rural and Village Improvement Societies , '' which should be read by men as well as women , close the book .

		There is a colored frontispiece , also twenty-six other illustrations from photo - graphs ; and the volimie is presented in some - thing of a gift-book form , by means of decorated end-papers and title-pages , embellished with numerous excerpts from the poets .

		There is also a good index .

		A wholly different type of work , -- in fact , so far as we know , something really new in this now wide field , -- is Mrs.
Mabel Cabot Sedgwick	PERSON	's '' The Garden Month by Month . ''

		This really does take up , not garden work , but the garden denizens , according to each month in which they appear in the greater part of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The floral year , taking the vicinity of
Boston	LOCATION	as the standard , is made to begin with
March	DATE	and end with
September	DATE	.

		The scope of the information is denoted on the title-page as '' describing the appearance , color , dates of bloom , and cultivation , of all desirable hardy plants for the formal or wild garden , with additional lists of aquatics , vines , etc. '' This is not distinctively a reading book , to be enjoyed in an easy-chair while the imaginative gardener plans his next year 's accomplishments , or dreams of a paradise that he may never have , -- rather , it is a reference book , present - ing much information in tabular form , with illustrations intended as an assistance to the text , whose pages will be a guide to those who might be misled by florists ' and seedmen 's catalogues and to readers of books that abound in unfamiliar names .

		The inclusion of a color - chart is a new feature , and shows that the author justly considers color-effects the most important thing to be considered when planning a garden .

		Another distinctive feature of the book is that it confines itself to hardy perennials -LRB- and a few tender ones -RRB- , the annuals having been omitted because of their varying season of bloom .

		Never - theless , if the supplementary list of fifty desir - able annuals had been classified according to color also , it would be of undoubted assistance to the beginner who takes this book as a guide .

		The color-chart is so painstaking , with so many minute gradations , that it is worthy of special mention ; inasmuch as the listed flowers , as stated in the preface , have nearly all been carefully verified by the chart .

		The author modestly disclaims perfection in this feature , while feeling that her chart is probably as accurate as any that can be made .

		This is doubtless the case ; but it only goes to show anew that color resides in the eye of the beholder , for several instances could be cited where the color-sense of the author and that of the reviewer do not quite agree .

		The illus - trations , as has been said , are intended for ser - vice rather than for beauty merely , and many of them reaUy fulfil this purpose , yet there are a number that ai'e not of sufficiently sharp out - line to enable one unfamiliar with the flower to picture it plainly to himself .

		The tabular arrangement is by color -LRB- which includes the popular description and a nmnbered reference to the chart -RRB- , by English name , botanical name and synonyms , description -LRB- with hints on cul - tivation , etc. -RRB- , height , situation , and time of bloom .

		The appendix includes , besides the lists mentioned on the title-page , bog-garden or marsh plants , plants conspicuous for their foliage , a few of the best ferns , and some minor supplementary lists .

		The index is fuU and carefully made .

		Altogether , this is a most valuable book for the shelves devoted to one 's garden library , in a location handy for reference .

		THE DIAL 369 Dramas of the Wild .

		* The opening
summer	DATE	, with all its other allurements , offers us an absorbing drama of wild life , if we will but place ourselves in the audience of the discerning .

		To do this is not difficult , since the stage is everywhere except on city streets , and the conditions of seeing some part of the play are only a little time , patience , and desire .

		But the drama grows in intensity as it draws farther away from centres of human life , and the conditions of witnessing it become less easy of fulfilment , so that even if our desire is great most of us miss the su - premely thrilling scenes and must learn of them by hearsay .

		It is impossible not to envy Mr.
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	the freedom of this out-door theatre which years of devoted attendance have given him ; but the envy gives place to gratitude , after all , for the competence with which he makes us see what we could not have seen for ourselves .

		His collection of stories just now published imder the fascinating title '' The Haunters of the Silences '' reports with skill and vividness dramas of wild life beyond the range of ordinary observation , where the prim - itive instincts of the brute play their tragedy against a spacious and lonely background which tremendously enhances the significance of every action . ''

		In the ancient wUd , '' he writes , '' there were three great silences which held their habi - tation unassailed .

		They were the silence of the deep of the lake , the silence of the dark heart of the cedar swamp , and the silence of the upper air , high above the splintered peak of the mountain . ''

		There is the silence , too , of the far frozen north , and the darkness and silenee of the sea , whose depth Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	confesses he has not penetrated , but whose secrets he at least cleverly approximates .

		Wrapped in the mystery of such surround - ings , even hunger and bestial hate and lust of blood become tolerable dramatic forces , admissi - ble for their very grimness and power .

		One re - sponds in spite of himself to the glory of combat when the polar bear feels the slash of the wal - rus 's mighty tusks , or in the deep-sea battles for life with the narwhal .

		-LRB- Is it not , by the way , an addition to ordinary knowledge of the polar * The Haunters of the Silences .

		bear that he is a masterly swimmer and diver ? -RRB-

		There is no escaping sympathy for such heroic failures as those of the drake whose flight is cut short by the '' terror of the air , '' or of the king salmon whose repeated efforts to leap the falls leave him torn and bleeding on the rocks below .

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	has a sense of the continuity of the struggle which is almost new , and which some - times carries these plays into a third or fourth act .

		The shrew-mole -LRB- for the dramatis perso7icB are not all of large proportions -RRB- that kills the black snake is himself killed by the fox , and the mink that catches mice is caught by an eagle .

		Man appears sometimes as the benefi - ciary of this chain of fate , sometimes as himself the deus salvator .

		A mariner is imprisoned on his wrecked boat by a shark , and is unable to dive even for a pole to hoist his signal of distress , until a sword-fish mercifully -- for the man -- cuts the shark in two .

		And , most tremendous and grewsome of all , a diver caught in the toils of a devil-fish in the dark caverns of the sea , -- `` a colossal , swollen , leprous - looking bulk , spotted and pallid , '' with huge tentacles that seem to grow with every cut given them , -- is saved by the providential intervention of a killer whale .

		Stories of horses , deer , bear , lynx , and beaver , and a most delicious tale of an ant imprisoned in a pitcher-plant , complete the volume .

		The end - ing is not always tragedy .

		Even man , who is too likely to play the part of the villain when an animal is the hero , is shown to be capable of pity and of justice .

		A more satisfactory resolution of the conflict between human and sub-human interests has seldom been given than in the story of the himter who traps a lynx , but later is obliged to accept the lynx 's help against a pack of wolves , and so gives the animal his well-earned liberty .

		For this large-minded fairness , as well as for the other reasons sug - gested , the book belongs to the small but fortunately growing class of the best nature story-books .

		It is praise enough of Mr.
Bull	PERSON	's spirited illustrations that they help rather than hinder the imagination , even with the most difficult subjects .

		In contrast to the vigorous movement of these pieces .

		Dr.
Madden	PERSON	's '' Forest Friends '' fur - nishes a good example of the static drama .

		It fills a real need in supplying a record of the animal life of regions near at hand in the early days of man 's occupation .

		A boy of seven , the author settled with his parents on the shores of
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	in the time of the '' uncleared forest , the unbroken soil , '' and set about mak - 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, ing friends with the forest itself , and with the gentler classes of its inhabitants .

		He was soon , with no other stimulus than his natural bent , in '' thorough sympathy with nature , a sympathy which makes living worth so much more , and which always furnishes a happy relaxation from the more sordid , hard , material cares of life . ''

		A deer runway near the pioneer 's cabin was the most potent factor in this sympathetic educa - tion , and the yomig nature-lover soon began to feel that '' a day upon which a deer is seen is better than another day , '' and to do what he could to save the beautiful creatures from being run into the lake by a brutal dog and there murdered -LRB- there was no other word -RRB- by the dogs more brutal master .

		Foxes , squirrels , rabbits , birds , and even bears , came in for their share of the boy 's friendly curiosity ; while wolf , lynx , and on one memorable night a pan - ther , supplied the element of fear .

		If Mr.
Madden	PERSON	does not attempt to enhance the situa - tion with any tense exercise of dramatic art , he at least catches the significance of what he sees , and sets forth interesting facts .

		For example , of the osprey he writes : '' The gentlest of all birds of prey is the osprey fisherman .

		The most timid and least capable of self - protection among the song birds did not fear him , spar - rows , warblers , and other small birds alighting on his very nest when he was at home , and sitting on the same branch with him when he rested after a hard task at fishing , '' And for Chicagoans these statistics bear a moral : '' The immense numbers of birds -LSB- passenger pigeons -RSB- destroyed here were killed and captured for shipment to
Chicago	LOCATION	... During this time -LSB- from
March to August	DATE	-RSB- there were sent to
Chicago	LOCATION	on an average 12,500 dead birds daily , making a total of 1,500,000 for the whole
summer	DATE	and 80,352 live birds shipped by rail alone .

		Add to these figures the numbers that were disposed of otherwise , the numbers of yoimg which rotted in their nests , the parents having been caught and killed , and the total could not have been less than 1,000,000,000 . ''

		Again the reader is conscious of a pang of envy for a life so free and eventfid as that once near us , and is ready to echo
Thoreau	PERSON	's wish that his '' neighbors were wilder . ''

		Suppose there were still a place within easy reach where any day one might see '' a big bear , a panther , a lynx , a wild cat , a hungry wolf , or several of them , '' how much city folks might vary and enrich their lives , and '' nature-alize '' themselves by visits to such a spot !

		Mr.
McGaffey	PERSON	's little volume , '' Outdoors , '' brings some comfort in the fact that there are still dramas in miniature played near at hand by creatures of our common experience .

		But unfortimately the newspaper sketches which compose the book present the man with the gun as the hero of most of these dramas , and game birds and the lesser animals as the victims .

		The wi'iter is capable of better things ; for in speaking of the winter woods he says : '' The philosophy and inner revealments of snow - enveloped woods are not to be enjoyed with a gun .

		If you bring the gun along the hunter 's instinct will urge you on , and some things will escape you . ''

		Why not apply this discovery to other seasons in the year , when the preponder - ance of things to see over those of winter is certainly as great as the preponderance of temp - tations to shoot ?

		The advice to sportsmen which the book contains is not full enough or new enough to compensate for the disappoint - ment this point of view causes the nature-lover .

		Nevertheless , Mr.
McGaffey	PERSON	's appreciation of the background of these naturalistic plays in one act is so delicate and often so poetically worded as to gain him grateful acknowledg - ment .

		The marshes in
April	DATE	are to him an epitome of the year 's loneliness , where '' above the reeds there is a level sea of silence , '' broken occasionally when a lone teal scurries past , '' the very sense of music in his flight , the least possible crisping of the air to mark his sym - metrical course . ''

		An equally delicate sense of action against this background leads him to say of the flight of common birds that '' observation and experience will give one the power to read the channels and winding aisles of light and air as a book 's pages may be scanned , '' and that '' bird-flight is the warp and woof of the seasons , spun in the wind 's looms , visible as it ' passes , yet fading as it is seen . ''

		There is a quick sense of character , too , which promises well for what Mr.
McGaffey	PERSON	wiU do when he ceases to write , as it were , gun in hand .

		From the woman who fishes '' in a bewilder - ingly attractive costiune that ought to reconcile the fish to their fate , '' to the woodchuck who sits on his burrow '' ruminating on the perfidy of man , '' each actor that passes over the stage has suggestive possibilities .

		The three books in our present group strik - ingly bring out the fact , pertinent to some cur - rent newspaper discussion , that the man who goes to the woods to learn gets more permanent value , both for himself and others , than the man who goes to himt .

		The steel-cold click of the hunter 's gun sounds in all his facts , because he has shown disrespect for the greatest fact of aU -- life .

		Even a little romancing is preferable to that .

		But there is no real danger of romancing .

		Travels Far and Near .

		* '' With Fancy unfurled , I can go round the world by the old Marlboro road , '' boastfully sang
Thoreau	PERSON	.

		With more truth the reader of books of travel can assert that he , with Fancy unfurled , with the spirit of the wandering foot and the devouring eye , can go round the world at his own fireside .

		In his imagination he may go out of his country and out of himself ; he may climb mountains , cross deserts , visit Prester
John	PERSON	's country , meet strange people , hunt savage animals , and saunter amid bewitching scenes , -- do all these things without the discom - forts and inconveniences that may weary the flesh in much actual travelling .

		For such travellers our present group of books offers an unusually attractive invitation to travel across four continents , to meet all sorts and conditions of men , and to see how the world wags beyond their own hearthstones .

		All of the volumes aim to combine entertainment with their varied store of information , and all have the added charm of illustrations .

		One of the most fascinating books of travel which we have read in several years is entitled '' The Desert and the Sown . ''

		The author ,
Miss Gertrude Lowthian Bell	PERSON	, made the trip through
Syria	LOCATION	, from

Alexandretta	LOCATION	, and up into
Asia Minor	LOCATION	, alone save for her Arab attendants .

		As
Miss Bell	ORGANIZATION	has an acute knowledge of the people and of their language , '' the fine and subtle tongue , the Modern Syriac Arabic , '' obtained by previous travel and experience in the
Moslem East	LOCATION	, her book is more than the note-book of the casual traveller .

		She is not unmindful of the political conditions existing there under Turkish rule , and , being En - glish , very serenely suggests that were
Syria	LOCATION	under British pi-otection political matters there would be vastly bettered .

		Such , too , seems to be the opinion of the hard-pressed native .

		But interesting as the political gossip was to Miss Bell , she is manifestly more interested in the people , the sons of the desert , whom she met at their lowly occupations , at the market-place , and in their natural unspoilt diver - sions .

		To her , a camel-driver , an old sheikh , a water-seller , a market-place , a little-known temple , a far-from-the-path convent , a fragment of an entab - lature , an exchange of talk between herself and a native about some half-forgotten lore or ancient tradition of the desert , are more attractive than the affairs of nations , and even more enticing than the better-known places --
Damascus	LOCATION	, for instance , which she treats as a passing phase of desert travel less interesting than a native village .

		Page after page in the book offers tempting bits for quotation , some little scene that brings the heart of the desert home to the reader , -- such a scene , for example , as a deal in corn between natives , where , '' but for my incongruous presence , and the lapse of a few thousand years , they might have been the sons of
Jacob	PERSON	come down into
Egypt	LOCATION	to bicker over the weight of sacks with their brother
Joseph	PERSON	. ''

		Or , what is probably more uniquely pleasing in the book , we should like to quote , did our space permit , many pages of lively conversation held with the natives , pages that reveal the speaking Arab , such talk as one seldom finds in books of travel .

		But on the whole
Miss BeU	PERSON	's book is too uniformly good to reveal much in a quotation ; it must be read in its entirety to be appreciated .

		The author has made a distinct contribution to the literature of travel , and has put her name far up on the list of women who have written good travel-books .

		Mr.
Frederic Courtland Penfield	PERSON	's volume en - titled '' East of
Suez	ORGANIZATION	, '' with the auxiliary notation , ``
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	, '' is a book of detached sketches , which treat of such varied topics as the
Suez Canal	ORGANIZATION	,
Pearl Fishing	ORGANIZATION	in the
Gulf of Manar	ORGANIZATION	,
Bombay	LOCATION	, a visit to the palace of the
Maharajah of Jeypore	ORGANIZATION	, a description of the
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	,
Benares	LOCATION	,
Calcutta	LOCATION	, Penang -LRB- the portal which separates `` The East '' from `` The Far East '' -RRB- ,
Singapore	LOCATION	,
Hong Kong	LOCATION	,
Canton	LOCATION	-LRB- `` the most satis - fying , fascinating , and puzzling city in the
Orient	LOCATION	, if not in the whole world '' -RRB- ,
Macao	LOCATION	-LRB- the tiny Por - tuguese colony which plays the part of an
Oriental Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
Japan	LOCATION	's Commercial Future , and the
Kaiser	PERSON	's play for Chinese trade .

		These topics Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	treats in a most entertaining manner ; for he is gifted to an unusual degree with a discerning 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, eye , and has the happy faculty of enlivening his descriptions with a quickening humor and a sym - pathetic spirit .

		But the author prides himself more on the fact that his volume is a '' purpose '' book of travels , a '' book of journeyings loaded with gentle preachment . ''

		The gist of his purpose lies in his plea for a judicious and systematic campaign on the part of our government and our commercial giants for a larger share in the trade of the world , for by this only can we hope to compete successfully with
Germany	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	for Oriental commerce , and , incidentally , to make our
Panama	LOCATION	Canal a formida ^ ble competitor with the
Suez Canal	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		What the American , zigzagging up and down and across that boundless region spoken of as ' East of
Suez	ORGANIZATION	, ' fails to see is the product of Uncle
Sam	PERSON	's mills , workshops , mines , and farms .

		From the moment he passes the
Suez Canal	ORGANIZATION	to his arrival at
Hong Kong	LOCATION	or
Yokohama	LOCATION	, the Stars and Stripes are discovered in no harbor nor upon any sea ; and maybe he sees the emblem of the great republic not once in the transit of the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		And the products of our marvellous country are met but seldom , if at all , where the American wanders in the
East	LOCATION	.

		He is rewarded by finding that the light of
Asia	LOCATION	is American petroleum , but that is about the only Western commodity he is sure of encountering in months of travel . ''

		This indictment , if it may be so called , is to be met , Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	insists , by a radical liberalizing of our marine law ; that is , our government must sub - sidize our merchant marine coincidently with the building of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal .

		Then , and not until then , shall we be able to compete with the
Kaiser	PERSON	, whom the author not infelicitously styles '' Trade - Lord William . ''

		Lack of space precludes our giving an adequate discussion of the many excellent fea - tures of this notable book .

		Few books of travel lately written in this country excel it , and we pre - dict it will be more than a book of an hour .

		Mr.
Perceval Landon	PERSON	's '' Under the Sun , '' al - though a book about
India	LOCATION	, is by no means one of bald facts about that country .

		The author does not give a summary of mere historical data about the diverse social , political , and religious activities of
India	LOCATION	; he does not give the statistics of deaths from starvation , snake bites , and the ravages of wild animals ; he makes no adventitious arguments con - cerning the conflicts between the native and the English governments ; he does not concern himself unduly with the peculiar religious beliefs of the natives ; and , finally , he boldly asserts that his book is not a record of the late tour of the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	, nor is it in any sense a guide-book .

		It is intended rather for those who have already travelled in
India	LOCATION	, or who know
India	LOCATION	through an extended course of reading .

		Mr.
Landon	PERSON	, whose knowledge of that country is based on a series of '' annual wanderings '' through it , purposes to indicate '' the widely different local colour that distinguishes one Indian city from another , '' to make an impression - istic picture of Indian life and travel which will supplement the usual books of description and information .

		Many of his narratives of famous per - sons and events -- like that which gives the hitherto incomplete story of
Nana Sahib	PERSON	and the great Indian mutiny of just a half - century ago , and of Scindia , '' the most remarkable character in all
India	LOCATION	, '' are of thrilling interest .

		The volume is handsomely illustrated and attractively printed .

		A reader of Mr.
Landon	PERSON	's book who fails to get a correct orientation of
India	LOCATION	and of its complex life may readily find his bearings by reading Mr.
Sidney Low	PERSON	's '' Vision of
India	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr , Low gathered his materials during the progress of the Prince and the Princess of
Wales	LOCATION	through
India	LOCATION	, on which occa - sion he was the special correspondent of a
London	LOCATION	journal . ''

		It has been my aim , '' says Mr.
Low	PERSON	, '' to reproduce something of the impression which our vast and varied dominion of the
East	LOCATION	-- almost a world in itself -- leaves on the mind , in its splendour and its contradictions , its colour and its mystery , its wealth and its poverty , its medley of classes , creeds , and peoples : to hint at a few of the absorbing problems suggested by the contemplation of this strange and fascinating amalgam . ''

		The volume is a study in the contrasts between the Old and the
New India	LOCATION	-- the
India	LOCATION	of the
Native	ORGANIZATION	and of the English ; of gold and rags ; of places , sacred and profane ; of the virtuous and the unvirtuous Maharajahs ; of the old gods and the new spirit ; of
Siva	PERSON	and the locomotive engine ; of
Kali	PERSON	and modern electricity , and of the conflict between modern inventions in general and the ancient social and religious customs of the country .

		Out of this abundant material Mr.
Low	PERSON	has written a book so profitably full and accm-ate , so acute in observation , and 80 enlivening , that it may be called a remark - ably illuminating book about
India	LOCATION	.

		That it has received commendatory notice from such high authorities as Lord
Curzon	PERSON	and Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	speaks much for the author 's qualities as an observer and writer .

		Mr.
Albert B. Lloyd	PERSON	has labored as a missionary for ten years in the northern and the western parts of the
Uganda Protectorate	LOCATION	in
Africa	LOCATION	, during which time he has had two furloughs to
England	LOCATION	, and on th6 occasion of each visit he has published a volume bearing on his life and work in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		His recent residence of five years was , for the most part , in the remote and little known Acholi country ; and it is of this region that his volume entitled ''
Uganda	LOCATION	to
Khartoum	LOCATION	'' has to do .

		Although Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's primary interest in
Africa	LOCATION	was his missionary work , an interest which is manifest everywhere in his writings , that feature does not overburden his vol - ume .

		He is a missionary who takes out a big-game hunter 's license , and who , moreover , bags his full quota of game both big and small , in order to feed the natives and to reduce his expense account as well .

		Few books describing sport in
Africa	LOCATION	contain more thrilling tales than this one .

		On his return trip to
England	LOCATION	, Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	passed down the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, a distance of
1150	DATE	miles , through the gi-eat marshes that drain the life-giving waters before they reach the Soudan .

William Gerstin	PERSON	's scheme of con - serving the water by moving the whole of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	bed fifty or sixty miles to the east , to an entirely new channel more than two hundred miles long .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 373 thereby turning the main stream away from the great sudd-covered marshes , will , according to Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	, make the Soudan a veritable garden-spot .

		Alike for readers interested in missionary work in
Africa	LOCATION	, and for those interested in it as a land of adventure , Mr ,
Lloyd	PERSON	's book will be satisfactory .

		The book on '' Portuguese East Africa , '' by Mr.
R. C. F. Maugham	PERSON	,
H. B. M. Consul	PERSON	for the dis - tricts of Mosambique and
Zambesia	LOCATION	, and for the territory of
Manica	LOCATION	and
Sofala	LOCATION	, sketches in an unusually entertaining and instructive way the his - tory , scenery , big-game hunting , and native life , in the supposed legendary land of Ophir , the treasure - land of
King Solomon	LOCATION	.

		The opening chapters deal with the history of Portuguese colonization in
East Africa	LOCATION	and with the establishment of colonial gov - ernment there under the guidance of the
Mosam	PERSON	- bique Company -- two items of interest that have hitherto received inadequate attention from writers on
Africa	LOCATION	.

		But the greater part of the book is con - cerned with big-game hunting in that district .

		As that part of
Africa	LOCATION	, before the disastrous visitation of the rinderpest in
1896	DATE	, had more varieties and greater abundance of big game than did almost any other region , Mr.
Maugham	PERSON	was fortunate in being able to explore it and hunt through it in its earlier state .

		As far as the natives are concerned , the author agrees with the local government in deplor - ing the efforts of zealous Europeans to educate them above their rank .

		`` The negro , '' argues the writer , `` was sent into the woi-ld for an end , and for one end only -- namely , manual labor . ''

		It must be a satisfaction to be thus in the Creator 's confidence .

		Of the country itself , the author is of the opinion that when the demon of malaria is checked by making Europeans immune to its evU effects , then Portuguese East
Africa	LOCATION	, an exquisite fairy-like land , will offer one long round of interest and delight to visiting Europeans .

		As Mr.
Maugham	PERSON	has more than ordinary skill in narration and description , his book will interest the casual as well as the confirmed reader of records of travel .

		In his trips to various corners of the earth , Mr.
Michael Myers Shoemaker	PERSON	has been accustomed to travelling in a rather leisurely manner ; but in his latest book , '' Winged Wheels in
France	LOCATION	, '' he whisks us thi'ough a five thousand mile journey in a twenty - four horse-power motor-car at the rate of forty-five miles an hour .

		We begin our trip with him at Nice , and go through
Provence	LOCATION	to
Aix	LOCATION	, where we catch a glimpse of the castle and the story of King Ren ^ , thence to Aries ,
Narbonne	ORGANIZATION	,
Carcassonne	LOCATION	,
Lourdes	PERSON	-LRB- the city of miracles -RRB- ,
Pau	LOCATION	, and on to restful Birratz before we go speeding into
Spain	LOCATION	.

		From
Spain	LOCATION	we run into central
France	LOCATION	in search of the unique and the fantastic .

		Touraine ,
Anjou	LOCATION	,
Brittany	PERSON	,
Normandy	LOCATION	,
Picardy	LOCATION	, come in quick suc - cession ; and finally
Paris	LOCATION	is reached , a city where an automobile is more of a necessity than a luxury for one who wishes to explore the environs of the city .

		We glide from
France	LOCATION	through the moun - tains of the
Vosges	LOCATION	into the
Rhine Valley	LOCATION	, over the
Col de la Schlucht	ORGANIZATION	to
Freiburg	LOCATION	, ^ to the
Black Forest	ORGANIZATION	, thence into
Switzerland	LOCATION	, to
Geneva	LOCATION	, and finally to Aix-les-Bains , where we finish our delightful but breath-taking journey with Mr.
Shoemaker	PERSON	.

		He is always interesting and entertaining in his books , but we prefer him when he travels at more leisure than the motor-car permits .

		The volume is pleas - antly written and admirably illustrated .

		A very readable and not unprofitable book is Mr.
W. D. McCrackan	PERSON	's `` The Italian Lakes . ''

		The author informs us , in his sub-title , that his volume is the '' record of pilgrimages to familar and unfamiliar places of the ' lakes of azure , lakes of leisure , ' together with a description of their quaint towns and villa gardens and the treasures of their art and history . ''

		He takes us in leisurely fashion from
Pallanza	LOCATION	to
Solferino	LOCATION	and among the famous lakes , sketching the varied scenery of Lake Come , the seclusion of the lake of Iseo , the charms of
Maggiore	PERSON	, the emerald recesses of
Lugano	LOCATION	, and the special attractions of all the sub-Alpine lakes both large and small .

		In the background of his sketches the author traces the human interest which has enlivened the history of the region ; we feel the presences of
Virgil	LOCATION	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, CatvQlus ,
Garibaldi	LOCATION	,
Mazzini	PERSON	,
Cavour	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Manzoni	PERSON	,
Stoppani	PERSON	,
Donizetti	ORGANIZATION	, and other famous personages whose names are associated with the Italian lakes .

		To some of the commoner and more modern themes , -- such as the quaint costumes of the Brianza peasant women , the silk-worm culture , lemon culture , etc. , -- the author gives due consideration .

		While in no sense a guide - book , this little volume will be very acceptable to travellers intending to visit any of the Italian lakes .

		After taking many incurious glances at
Portugal	LOCATION	on his various flittings through that country , Mr.
Mai	PERSON	` tin
Hume	PERSON	determined to overcome his ingrained prejudices against the '' Garden by the Sea '' by seeking a more intimate knowledge of the land and of the people .

		His volume entitled '' Through Portugal '' is , he tells us , '' a self-prescribed penance for my former injustice toward the most beautiful country and the most unspoilt and courteous peas - antry in
Southern Europe	LOCATION	'' ; and his sojourn in the land of which he writes was '' a continual and un - adulterated delight from beginning to end , bringing refreshment and renewed vigor of soul , mind , and body , opening to my eyes , though they had seen much of the world , prospects of beauty unsurpassed in my experience , and revealing objects of antiqua - rian and artistic interest unsuspected by those to whom the attractions of the regular round of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean travel have grown flat and familiar , '' What - ever Mr.
Hume	PERSON	describes in and about
Oporto	LOCATION	,
Bussaco	LOCATION	,
Coimbra	PERSON	,
Alcobaga	LOCATION	,
Cintra	ORGANIZATION	,
Lisbon	LOCATION	, or places of lesser note , is done with a well-considered and creditable enthusiasm , and in an unusually graceful style .

		The publishers have added to the writer 's stimulating descriptions a goodly number of pleasing color-prints that contribute much to the attractiveness of the volume .

		374 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, Mr.
William Seymour Edwards	PERSON	, in his book en - titled '' In the Mexican Highlands , '' tells about his trip into the mountain regions of
Mexico	LOCATION	, and also gives fla , shHght glimpses of
New Orleans	LOCATION	,
Vera Cruz	PERSON	, and
Havana	LOCATION	.

		His book is enlivened with pictures of wayside scenes , theatres , cafds , a bull-fight , a trip to the Mexican mines , and other odds and ends in the life of our neighbors over the southern border and in
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		The Mexicans struck him as intelli - gent and progressive , both in affairs of government and business .

		The Cubans impressed him as being over-zealous in their desire for liberty , -- in fact , as somewhat revolutionary in disposition against our paternal government .

		Few regions of the world have more wonderfully picturesque and romantic scenery to offer to the traveller than has the southwestern part of the
United States	LOCATION	, in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado	LOCATION	.

		It is of this region , with its matchless vision of natural beauty , its prehistoric ruins , and its unique present-day cliff-dwellers , that Dr.
T. Mitchell Prudden	PERSON	writes in his readable little volume entitled '' On the Great American Plateau . ''

		As befits such a land .

		Dr.
Prudden	PERSON	's methods of travelling are of the leisurely sort , -- with his own pack-train and camp equipment .

		Incidentally in his book he makes a vigorous plea for the protection of the natives , for the careful gathering of their legends , and for the stopping of the unbridled vandalism which is fast devastating the ruins of the ancient cliff-dwellers .

		Only too soon , the author assures us , wUl the natives cease sending messages to the gods by rattlesnakes , if some adequate pro- tection is not provided against the onslaught of semi - civilization with its attendant evils .

		Dr.
Prudden	PERSON	's style is notably vigorous and enthusiastic .

		Mr.
Harry De Windt	PERSON	, the experienced traveller and well-known author of many readable books of travel , journeyed as a newspaper correspondent through
Montenegro	LOCATION	,
Herzegovina	LOCATION	,
Bosnia	LOCATION	,
Servia	LOCATION	,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	,
Roumania	LOCATION	,
Southern Russia	LOCATION	, and the Cau - casus , in the order named .

		He recounts his trip and records his observations in the volume entitled '' Through Savage
Europe	LOCATION	, '' the title accurately describing the '' wild and lawless countries between the
Adriatic	LOCATION	and Black Seas . ''


Montenegro	LOCATION	, says the author , has the advantage of a good ruler in Prince
Nicholas	PERSON	;
Herzegovina	LOCATION	and
Bosnia	LOCATION	prosper under Austrian rule ;
Servia	ORGANIZATION	, to which a major part of the book is devoted , attempts to rule itself with but little success .

		Mr.
De Windt	PERSON	takes particular pains to have the reader understand that
King Peter	PERSON	of Servia should be back in
Paris	LOCATION	playing the part of a boulevardier rather than attempting to fill the throne of
Servia	LOCATION	, and that the murdered King
Alex	PERSON	- ander was a man competent to rule so volatUe a people .

		For the regicides -- the author unknow - ingly was entertained by one of them -- he has the utmost contempt .


Bulgaria	LOCATION	, which Mr. De Windt well calls '' the land of unrest , '' impressed him as a factor to be weighed when considering Balkan matters .

		Very fittingly , Mr.
De Windt	PERSON	's interesting book ends with his trip into
Russia	LOCATION	, where he saw the red flag of anarchy wave in the riot at
Odessa	LOCATION	.

		The distinctive merit of this book lies in the fact that the author visited these same countries a gener - ation ago , and consequently is competent to gauge the various lines of progress made in these ever - changing hot-beds of European discord .

		No story in the history of modern exploration is more pathetic than that of the death of
Leonidas Hubbard	PERSON	, Jr. , in the forsaken and dead land of Lab - rador .

		In the
summer of 1903	DATE	an expedition led by
Hubbard	PERSON	attempted to reach
Lake Michikamau	LOCATION	by ascending the
Nascaupee River	LOCATION	, but , missing their route , the party wandered about for two months without reaching the lake .

		On the return journey ,
Hubbard	PERSON	died of starvation , leaving his two compan - ions , Mr.
Dillon Wallace	PERSON	and a half-breed Indian , to struggle back to civilization .

		Of that disastrous expedition Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	has written in another vol - ume .

		In his present book , entitled `` The Long Labrador Trail , '' Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	tells how he fulfilled the compact with
Hubbard	PERSON	'' that in case one of us fall the other would carry to completion the explo - ratory work that he had planned and begun . ''

		To trace Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	's route through the waste lands of Labrador would serve but in a small way to indi - cate the valuable account of his heroic endeavor to fulfil the wish of his friend .

		His party reached the sought-for lake , where , on account of the short food supply , all of its members save the author and a companion returned home ; the advance party , how - ever , penetrated Labrador , reaching
Fort Chimo	LOCATION	, and finally returned in mid-winter to
Hamilton Inlet	LOCATION	, after a journey with dogs , komatik , and snow - shoes , of two thousand miles .

		Few readers of Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	's volume will be interested in the scientific data gathered by the party , but none can fail to enjoy the author 's accovmt of his expedition , and to applaud the noble incentive that led him to return to bleak Labrador to carry out the plans of his former companion .

		jj .


E. Coblentz	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's praise of Professor
Raleigh	LOCATION	is whole-hearted , and in striking contrast with certain other critics ' dispraise of the accomplished author of the latest Shakespeare biography and study . ''

		This work , '' writes Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, '' is one of the series of English Men of Letters , but it shines among the others like the moon among the stars .

		Mr.
Raleigh	PERSON	has little to say about
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, nothing about
Miss Corelli	PERSON	, nothing about the gifted Bacon .

		His theme is the poet Shakespeare ; the poet rather than the man , though the man , too , is happily adumbrated , on the evidence of his works , and of tradition .

		The book is a delightful treatise on poetry , with no pryings about Mr.
W. H.	PERSON	, and no pedantries about anything ... Mr.
Raleigh	PERSON	must be an unique professor of English literature ! ''

		Few indeed are the teachers of English Uterature who are so peculiarly fitted for their task -LRB- though task is the wrong word -RRB- as to deserve no part of the censure implied in
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's ascription of his early interest in his country 's classics to the fact that , in his college days , English studies had not gained admission to the curriculum .

		THE
DIAL 375 Recent Fiction	ORGANIZATION	.

		* When ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	'' swam into the ken of novel-readers a few months ago there were many of us who felt that we could realize for the first time in our own experience what it was to have lived in the days of '' Pickwick '' and '' Pendennis . ''

		It was far and away the best novel of the year , and of many years ; its excellence , moreover , was of the specific sort that is associated with the Mid - Victorian age of fiction rather than of the sort to which the popular modern novelist aspires .

		It was evident that the author was a man steeped in the best traditions of the older fiction , though none the less a man now living in the
twentieth century	DATE	and responsive to the currents of its thought .

		His advanced age was suflicient to account for this phenomenon ; but nothing short of native genius could account for the rich geniality of this first product of a septua - genarian .

		Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's second novel , now following fast upon the heels of its predecessor , proves to be a work no less remarkable , and one equally productive of almost unalloyed delight .

		It is also a work of the same soul-satisfying length , and the reader who has acquired in self-defence the habit of rapid reading is hereby warned that if he skims '' Alice-for-Short '' it will be to his own serious loss .

		To emphasize the metaphor , we will say that the cream reaches to the dregs , and is not the super - imposed covering of a sub-stratum of watery fluid .

		`` We make t-he acquaintance of Alice at the age of six , and her story , in one sense , is of the simplest .

		The child of a drunken couple , caretakers of a decayed
Soho	LOCATION	house that was once a mansion and now provides quarters for artist folk and tradesmen , she makes her entry upon the scene as the central figure in a cruche cassSe episode , which brings her • Alice-for-Short .

		to the attention of the '' first floor , '' who has hitherto ignored both her existence and that of the '' exten - sive basement with cellarage , '' which is her home .

		In other words , she drops the jug of beer Avhich she is fetching from the public house , and is con - soled in her plight by Mr.
Charles Heath	PERSON	, amateur artist , who inhabits a '' studio '' in the
Soho	LOCATION	house The young man in question -LRB- and this is much to the point -RRB- is the son of well-to-do parents who live in
Hyde Park Gardens	LOCATION	, and who , contrary to all traditions , countenance and even encourage their son in his misguided ambition .

		Presently , the child 's parents engage in a drunken quarrel which ends disastrously to both .

		The man deals his wife a murderous blow with the first convenient imple - ment -LRB- which chances to be a hammer -RRB- , and then , realizing what he has done , ends his own life with a dose of cyanide .

		This makes an orphan of
Alice	PERSON	, and her '' first floor '' friend and protector sees noth - ing for it but to take the child to his own home and turn her over to his adored and adorable sister .

		In her new environment , the child occupies a tentative status for a while , but proves so winning that she soon becomes a permanent fixture in the household .

		During the ensuing two years , the adorable sister meets and weds a rising young physician , and her brother , enticed into the web of a young woman of dubious extraction -LRB- just then serving him as a model -RRB- , rashly makes her his wife .

		At this junc - ture , sixteen years are permitted to elapse , and when we have recovered from the bewilderment occasioned by the leap , we learn that the young physician has become a famous alienist and a leader of his pro- fession , that
Charles	PERSON	has discovered his mistake and divorced his faithless wife , and that
Alice	PERSON	has grown up to be just what we have a right to expect -- one of the most lovable creatures to whom a novelist ever gave the breath of life .

		Of course Charles and
Alice	PERSON	are meant for one another , but each is so absurdly afraid that the other 's motive would be self-sacrifice rather than the love that ought to bind husband and wife that it is a long while before the critical moment is reached when their mutual devo - tion of friendship is discovered to be inadequate , and their relation becomes what it should have been long before .

		Thus the story , after much delay -LRB- against which protest would be ungrateful indeed -RRB- , ends happily .

		But although the above is its essen - tial outline , a good half of the stor ^ is as yet unsketched .

		The title-page describes it as '' a dichronism , '' and thereby hangs another aspect of the tale .

		The old
Soho	LOCATION	house has a past , a past compounded of love and hatred and gi'im tragedy , and remotely related to Alice herself .

		Glimpses of this past are vouchsafed us during the years of
Alice	ORGANIZATION	's childhood .

		A mysterious jewelled ring is discovered , some old portraits offer elusive hints , several ghosts make casual appearances in the liouse , and the skeleton of a murdered woman is disinterred in the cellar .

		No solution of these mysteries is offered until many years afterwards , when they are half-forgotten , and then , by means of recovered 376 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, documents , and particularly by the revelations of an old woman , restored to sanity by an operation after sixtyyears of aphasia as an inmate of Bedlam , the whole complication is pieced together , and we get a fairly connected history , stretching back as far as the
early eighteenth century	DATE	, apd involving the fortunes of
Alice	ORGANIZATION	's forbears .

		It makes a story of extraordinary interest , although its demands upon the constructive imagination are severe .

		And we can not quite forgive the author for his ghosts , which are not really needed , and which are left unrationalized -- just ghosts and nothing more .

		A carping critic might possibly find fm ` ther causes for offence in the overplus of sentimentality which marks the book , and in the garrulity of its narra - tion , for the writer , after the manner of his com - peers from Fielding to
Thackeray	PERSON	, cares little for the details of construction , and makes any kind of an excursus whenever he pleases , discoursing easily upon art and human natm-e to the impediment of all orderly progress .

		But only a crabbed partisan of the formal could place his hand upon his heart and sincerely aver that he would willingly spare any of these irrelevancies .

		They add salt and savour to a novel which even without them would be reckoned a remarkable example of the art of fiction at its noblest .

		Finally , we may make a sug - gestion that has delightful possibilities .

		``
Joseph Vance	PERSON	'' and '' Alice-f or-Short '' are novels contain - ing each something like a quainter of a million words .

		Such books are in one sense the products of a lifetime , and even in the most literal sense are not written in a day or a year .

		May it not be that their author has been writing books of this kind for longer than we fancy , and that he has stores of accumulated manuscript that may yet see the light ?

		After his luckless collaborative excursion into the fields of detective mystery and treasure-seeking , Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	has found his way back to his native heath -- or rather moor -- and once more gives us a tale of the rustics whom he knows so well . ''

		The Whirlwind '' is a tragedy of elemental passion , worked out in the lives of a man and a woman of primitive instincts .

		Both are of lowly birth and without education ; the man is in addition a sort of religious fanatic .

		The tragedy is of the
David	PERSON	and
Uriah	PERSON	type , the part of
David	PERSON	being taken by the farmer who employs
Daniel Brendon	PERSON	and his wife .

		His sin is Boon followed by repentance , and even by religious conversion , but knowledge of the woman 's lapse from virtue has accidentally come into the possession of a former suitor for her hand , who bides his time , and plans a dramatic revenge .

		When
Daniel	PERSON	's eyes are opened at last , he `` sees red , '' and starts on the warpath .

		His vengeance is balked by the natural death of t ^ he betrayer and the suicide of the faithless wife .

		He then joins the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	, and the story ends .

		It is a story told with all the sombre power which we are wont to expect of its author , and the severity of its tragic outline is somewhat softened by the scenes which portray the homely psychology and the rustic wit of the Dartmoor peasantry .

		It is a story that more than ever makes us feel that Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	has found a worthy successor ,
Sylvia Thesiger	PERSON	was born in an English country town , and the liquid music of the neighboring mill stream was so wrought into the consciousness of her childhood that she ever afterwards dreamed of running water .

		This pretty fancy suggested to Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	a title for his story of Sylvia 's life , and so he named the book '' Running Water . ''

		Her father had been a famous Alpinist in his younger days , but certain unfortunate happenings had forced him , long before the story opens , to abandon his favorite pastime , and even to change his name .

		He had , in short , been convicted of crime , and was doomed to a term of imprisonment .

		Thereupon his wife , a selfish and frivolous person , had left him , taking with her the child
Sylvia	PERSON	, who has grown up with no knowledge of her father beyond a shadowy notion that he is living somewhere in
London	LOCATION	.

		The passion for the mountains is in her blood , and we make her acquaintance at
Chamounix	LOCATION	, where her mother 's nomadic life has brought her , and where she is about to make her first ascent .

		This expedi - tion brings her into contact with a young English - man , also a lover of the Alps , and a seasoned climber .

		The combined influences of the man and the mountain bring upon her an emotional crisis , and she forms a great resolution .

		A continuance of the life she has been leading becomes intolerable , and she determines to leave her mother , and seek a home with her unknown father .

		After joining him in his
London	LOCATION	house , and incidentally taking him greatly by surprise , she discovers him to be a very shady character , who makes a precarious living by his wits at the expense of whatever gullible victims come within his reach .

		The developments of the narrative from this point are very ingenious and interesting .

		She finds herself at times in positions both questionable and dangerous , but v ^ ith the aid of the Englishman who has befriended her in the opening chapters , and who becomes her declared lover , she averts the perils that threaten her , and even exerts a softening influence upon her father 's criminal character .

		The story ends , as it began , in the Alps , with an exciting expedition over a dan - gerous pass , and a semi-tragic situation that keeps us in breathless suspense for a time .

		These ele - ments of human and natural interest combine to make a tale of singular fascination , over which the mountain glamour is cast with such compelling effect that it acts as a shaping influence upon the lives of all the persons chiefly concerned .

		A sad and simple story of bleak
Siberia	LOCATION	, almost unbearable in the intensity of its tragic pathos , is called '' The Long Road , '' and is the work of Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	.

		It opens with the long march of a band of exiles , and deals with the fortunes of Stepan Iline -- a child when the tale begins , but soon there - after a man , sober and thrifty of life , happily mar - ried , and blessed with children .

		In an evil hour ,
Stepan	PERSON	incurs the enmity of the brutal governor of
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 the province , who devises for him a punishment of ingenious cruelty .

		Expelled from the province of
Irkutsk	LOCATION	, this victim of tyranny is permitted to travel elsewhere in
Siberia	LOCATION	at his will , but is for - bidden to remain longer than ten days in any one place .

		Thus driven from his home ,
Stepan	PERSON	constructs a sort of house-wagon , and , taking with him wife and children , becomes an itinerant peddler .

		To the hard - ships of this existence are sacrificed one by one his wife and his two children , leaving him with nothing to live for but the burning hope of revenge upon the wanton author of his miseries .

		For years he seeks the opportunity to strike , and at last his enemy lies within his power .

		But the sight of his enemy 's child , a little girl strangely like the one he himself mourns , softens his heart , and by an almost super - human effort he foregoes his cherished revenge .

		The rest of the book recounts endless wanderings , and the gradual thawing in his breast of feelings long congealed ; he finds in service to his fellows a kind of solace for the grief that ever grows older , and dies beloved by the simple folk whom he has helped during the closing years of his pilgrimage .

		The story is deeply moving , and is related with knowledge of the life depicted and a rare degree of artistic restraint . ''

		Poison Island '' is a romance compounded of familiar ingredients .

		In a general way , it strongly suggests `` Treasure Island , '' while , to be more specific , Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	has permitted himself the employment of certain devices that he has used before to humorous effect -- the elderly dame who writes atrocious verses , and the strangely assorted company who set out upon the expedition which is the raison d'etre of the story .

		The scene is Fal - mouth and its neighborhood , and the time that of the closing period of the Napoleonic wars .

		There is , of course , an ancient mariner with a mysterious past , and equally of course , a chart to indicate the location of the treasure .

		The actual expedition in search thereof occupies only about a third of the narrative , being preceded by an account of the youthful hero 's schooldays , and by various fantastic happenings .

		The author 's happy faculty for sketch - ing eccentric types of character is exhibited at his best , and we thoroughly enjoy the quaint company that he provides for us .

		When the island is reached -LRB- in the
Bay of Honduras	LOCATION	-RRB- , it is found to be inhab - ited by a singular old gentleman whose chief delight is in the reception of treasure-seekers .

		He has the amiable habit of luring them on by smooth words , and of poisoning them just as their quest is about to be crowned with success .

		In the present case , however , he relents , and concludes to poison himself instead , leaving the treasure-seekers in possession . ''

		The Diamond Ship '' is just the sort of story we expect from Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	, but is rather above the average of his later work .

		It escapes his besetting tendency to be over-fantastic , and tells a reasonably straightforward tale of villainy unearthed and virtue rewarded .

		It is , of course , cheaply melo - dramatic throughout , but the excitement is well - contrived .

		It is about a gang of international thieves , who make jewels their specialty , and who have for their rendezvous a pirate ship drifting idly about the
South Atlantic	LOCATION	, far from the track of travel .

		A determined Englishman , with the aid of an agree - ably exaggerated Irishman , conceives it to be his special mission to destroy this band of outlaws , and put the '' diamond ship '' out of commission .

		He is spurred to his best efforts by the fact that they have a young woman , with whom he has fallen in love , in their clutches .

		Before the denouement is reached , there is abundant action , on sea and shore , and exciting adventures follow one another fast enough to keep the most practised reader breathless in his endeavor to keep up with them .


Roger Blois	PERSON	is a young Australian of wealth and cultivation , who comes to
England	LOCATION	to make the acquaintance of his kinsfolk .

		He is the prospective heir of
Colonel Blois	LOCATION	, an English country gentleman , whose daughter he is destined to marry .

		Soon after his arrival , and before he has introduced himself to his relatives , he is brought accidentally into con - tact with one
Herbert Gammage	PERSON	-LRB- also a relative , although a distant one -RRB- , whose exact counterpart he is in form and feature .

		The resemblance is only superficial , for
Gammage	ORGANIZATION	is a flabby and vulgar creature , just then very much down on his luck .

		This acquaintance is formed at a sea-coast village , and
Roger	PERSON	goes out for a swim .

		An hour or two later ,
Gammage	PERSON	discovers his clothes , hastily infers that he is drowned , and has the brilliant inspiration * to don the garments , leaving his own in exchange .

		The next step is to take possession of
Roger	PERSON	's belong - ings at the hotel , examine his papers , and fit himself for his new part .

		Learning from a letter of invita - tion that
Colonel Blois	ORGANIZATION	expects his Australian kins - man in a few days , the imposter presents himself at the appointed time , and his manners , which are very surprising indeed , are charitably accounted for by his Australian upbringing .

		In the meantime ,
Roger	PERSON	, who has been rescued in a somewhat bat - tered condition , is taken to the neighboring farm - house which
Gammage	PERSON	has been visiting , and there , despite his protestations , he is held to be
Gammage	PERSON	in fact , and his notion that he is someone else is treated as a phenomenon of the mental derangement from which he is supposed to be suffering .

		This complication ties him up for some time , which gives the imposter so much leeway .

		In the end , of course ,
Roger	PERSON	escapes , establishes his identity , startles
Gammage	PERSON	by his reappearance , and marries the young woman .

		All of which makes Mrs.
Alfred Sidgwick	PERSON	's story of '' The Kinsman '' an excep - tionally bright and entertaining work of fiction .

		Sir
Elyot Ingall	PERSON	, upon his father 's death , finds himself the heir to a distinguished name , a large county estate , and a burden of debt so heavy that title and manor seem little more than a mockery .

		But the young man has stuff in him , and at once plans for himself a life of industry and economy that , he has reason to hope , will clear the estate in the course of a score of years .

		He might relieve 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, his necessities by selling his timber , but he has a passionate love for the ancient woods that have become his property , and a deep conviction that a possession of this sort is a sacred trust rather than a merely personal appanage .

		Even more than his own trees , he loves the
Dower Woods	PERSON	, a neighboring forest -LRB- once a part of the ancestral estate -RRB- , now in the ownership of a neighbor who shares to the full his feeling concerning such possessions .

		At this point of our outline , the heroine must be introduced .

		She is the oldest of seven children , whose parents have some pretensions to gentility , but who lead a poverty-stricken existence in a cheap house on the fringe of the metropolis .

		Her beauty is of the appealing sort , even to the cold-blooded reader ; in Sir
Elyot	PERSON	, when chance -LRB- aided by design -RRB- brings them together , she awakens the deepest of romantic passions .

		Their engagement follows , although there is no prospect of anything more than an engage - ment for many years .

		Meanwhile the owner of the
Dower Woods	ORGANIZATION	determines to leave it to his young friend , in whose hands he knows it will be safe from the axe .

		But he has been so charmed by the heroine that he is half inclined to leave it to her instead of to her prospective husband .

		In his indecision , he prepares two wills , but , being persuaded by his lawyer that it would be unwise to make the bequest in that indirect fashion , is about to destroy the will drawn in favor of the heroine , when he dies unex - pectedly .

		After his death , this will alone is found , and of the other no trace can be discovered .

		Then Sir
Elyot	PERSON	, knowing nothing of either will , goes to
America	LOCATION	to remain two or three years .

		During his absence , his betrothed is informed of her ownership of the
Dower Woods	PERSON	, and her essentially shallow and pleasure-loving natm-e can see in this accession of fortune nothing more than the opportunity of gratifying her longings for luxury .

		She secretly arranges to have the timber cut , and with the pro- ceeds enters upon the career of a woman of fashion .

		When
Elyot	PERSON	returns , he discovers with horror the devastation , and later , with far gi-eater horror , that the woman he has loved is the one who has dealt him this blow .

		The shock of the discovery kills his love for her , and almost kiUs him in the literal sense .

		The other will turns up after a whUe , and the hideous work of the axeman is stopped , but only after irreparable injury has been done to one of the most beautiful bits of woodland natm ' e in
England	LOCATION	.

		The story closes with the heroine 's marriage to a '' bounder '' who has pursued her for years , with the rehabilitation of
Elyot	PERSON	's fortunes and his union with the vicar 's daughter -LRB- whom we have known all the time to be the right woman -RRB- , and with their joint resolution to devote the rest of their lives to restoring , as far as may be possible , the ravaged forest .

		On its merely human side , this is a singu - larly impressive and well-managed story ; to the lovers of trees , who can share in
Elyot	LOCATION	's passion , it is an inexpressibly poignant tragedy .

		It is entitled `` Sir
Elyot	PERSON	of the Woods . ''

		The author .

		Miss
Emma Frances Brooke	PERSON	, is a
Newnham College	ORGANIZATION	woman and a Fabian socialist , who has been writing novels for a dozen years or more , but is compara - tively unknown to American readers .

		Mr.
Robert Morss Lovett	PERSON	's second novel , `` A Wingfed Victory , '' is the story of a self-sacrificing girl , in whom the desire to be serviceable is instinc - tive , and who , under conditions that would have been discouraging to anyone less stout of heart and cheer - ful of soul , shapes for herself a successful career of usefulness .

		Her devotion is lavished successively upon a baby brother , who dies at an early age , a sel - fish and worldly sister , who is adopted by a wealthy relative , and upon a somewhat disreputable father , who is distinguished by a bent for philosophical con - versation and a disinclination to work for an honest living .

		When the heroine goes to college , which a lucky windfall enables her to do , she finds a new object of devotion in a feUow-student who poses as an unrecognized genius , and who is in reality a cub , weak , selfish , and conceited .

		The two are thrown together both in school and in settlement work , and the girl finally marries him , mistaking for love her pity for his weakness .

		This leads to much wretch - edness , but he has the grace to end his existence after a while , leaving his widow free to marry the man who was obviously destined for her .

		The story is , for the most part , one of college life , the college in question being a sort of composite of the three situated in and near
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The story is inter - esting and cleverly wrought , but is marred by a vein of the sort of sentimentalism that affects the modern amateur sociologist , and by a false sense of values in the social life of the college community .

		The author seems also to be deficient in the power of consistent characterization , and leaves us consider - ably in doubt as to what he would have us think of most of the persons who figure in his novel .

		A good old-fashioned story of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	in the days of
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	, a story told with the affected garrulity of reminiscent old age , may be found in Mr.
Ruel Perley Smith	PERSON	's '' Prisoners of Fortune . ''

		It is mainly a story about pirates and hidden treasure , for pirates were very real in those days , and they undoubtedly hid a good deal of treasure , although for the most part so effectively that no one has been able to find it since .

		But the
Boston	LOCATION	lad who is the hero of this romance finds the private hoard as a matter of course , and rescues the distressed heroine -- who is a sort of
New England Lorna Doone	ORGANIZATION	-- from the villainous gang who have held her in dm-ance .


Virginia Central	LOCATION	is the subject of focal interest in Mr.
Lef	PERSON	fevre 's ''
Sampson	PERSON	Rock of Wall Street . ''

		The name , as may be surmised , is that of a railway and not of a young woman .

		There is a young woman concealed somewhere within the intricate • mesh of the narrative , but she is not a real person , and hence does n't count .

		Sampson Rock is a mag - nate who has acquired millions by manipulation of the stock market .

		He plans to acquire further millions by depressing V. C stock , buying control at bargain prices , and then selling the road to
1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 379 another which he ah-eady controls .

		The ingenious and subtle procedure whereby he expects to accom - plish his purpose is explained with much particu - larity , and the reader is never taken for very long or very far from the sound of the ticker .

		Now
Sampson Rock	ORGANIZATION	has a son , his namesake , familiarly known as
Sammy	LOCATION	, and this hopeful youth , having made the grand tour , returns to
New York	LOCATION	and enters his father 's office .

		When he learns of the buccaneering enterprise directed against
Virginia Central	ORGANIZATION	, he evolves an ingenious little scheme of his own , which is no other than that of acquiring the control for himself .

		Presently , the old man discovers that some unknown operator is putting a spoke in his wheel , and in consequence thereof the stock rises at the wrong time .

		This very nearly brings
Sampson	PERSON	face to face with ruin , when
Sammy	PERSON	shows his hand , and the father 's feelings are divided between chagrin at his own discomforture and admir - ation of the unsuspected '' business '' capacities of the son .

		It makes a fairly interesting story upon a subject that is essentially devoid of any vital human interest .

		No question of morality ever seems to enter the head of any of the persons concerned .

		No review of a season 's fiction would be complete without mention of at least one romance of the '' Zenda '' sort .

		Our present instance is '' The King - makers , '' by Mr.
Armiger Barclay	PERSON	.

		The Kingdom of Sergia is , like all the others , torn by dynastic intrigue , and in danger of falling prey to the Russian bear .

		When the rightful sovereign has won his kingdom , he should by rights have been wedded to his royal cousin , but has already pledged himself to an English girl , while the cousin has given her heart to an Irish suitor .

		At this juncture , a bit of folk-lore is very neatly worked in , and the Sergians are reconciled to the acceptance of a foreign queen because she seems to realize the fulfillment of an omen which means much to their superstitious natures .

		This smoothes away the difficulties that beset the other pair of perplexed lovers , and senti - ment receives the full measure of its dues .

		This romance is diflPerentiated from others of its class by the fact that the action , untU very near the end , takes place in
England	LOCATION	, where the whole plot is hatched , and the sinews of war are provided .

		As long as invention can produce stories as good as this , we shall not greatly object to them on the score of being mere variants upon a well-worn theme .

		A dashing story of adventure in the Empire of the Tsar is given us by Mr.
Arthur W. Marchmont	PERSON	, with '' In the Cause of Freedom '' for a title .

		A travelling Englishman comes upon a Polish maiden , in the company of a notorious conspirator , both pur - sued by the police , in a village of Russian
Poland	LOCATION	.

		The conspirator is dispatched early in the game , and the maiden is left on the Englishman 's hands .

		Being high-spirited and impressionable , the English - man is nothing loth to accept the charge , and the pair lead the police a merry chase all the way to
Warsaw	LOCATION	, where the action culminates in street riots and other forms of excitement -
Louis Armitage	PERSON	, an instructor in a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	school , is in
New York	LOCATION	for a vacation , and is taking the air in
Central Park	LOCATION	.

		He is suddenly hailed by a young woman in a passing carriage , who calls him
Julian	PERSON	, and insists upon his coming home with her .

		During the drive , he is informed that he is her long - lost husband , supposed to be dead .

		Denial proves useless , and the situation proves so pleasant to the man , especially when he discovers the luxurious nature of his new existence , that after some feeble searchings of conscience , he falls into the part that a bizarre fate seems to have assigned him , and plays it for all it is worth .

		He is especially inspired to persist when he discovers that the woman who '' claims him -LRB- and with whom by this time he is wildly in love -RRB- has fallen into the clutches of an unscrupu - lous lawyer , who is enriching himself at her expense .

		At least , he will countenance the deception until he has unmasked the villain .

		But the villain has a little unmasking game of his own , for he soon sus - pects
Louis	LOCATION	to be an impostor , and takes measures for his arrest .

		Then follows a hasty flight from
New York	LOCATION	, in company with his recently acquired wife , on their private yacht .

		Detectives pursue them , and finally the wife seems to be convinced that the man is not
Julian	PERSON	after all , whereupon she leaves him stranded .

		This is a great shock to him , so great , indeed , that it suddenly awakens dormant memories , and he realizes that he is Julian in fact , and that as
Louis	LOCATION	he has simply been a sufferer from dual personality .

		Moreover , his wife -LRB- who is really his wife -RRB- had been sure of it aU the time , and had planned the shock -LRB- under the advice of an alienist -RRB- for the express purpose of reviving his lapsed memory .

		It is not often that a novel has as unex - pected a denouement as this , and the writer has displayed no little ingenuity in sustaining the mys - tification until he is ready to clear it away . ''

		The Castle of Doubt '' is the name of this entertaining fab - rication , which is the work of Mr.
John H. Whitson	PERSON	.

		Miss Stanley 's '' A Modern Madonna '' is , in its outline , the familiar story of the woman who marries a man for his showy qualities and social position , without any serious effort to sound his character , and who soon thereafter learns that his love is a superficial and evanescent affair .

		When she dis - covers , early in the narrative , that he is no more than a shallow and impulsive creature , and faithless into the bargain , she separates herself from him .

		The scene of the novel is
Washington	LOCATION	, and the rejected husband , taking advantage of a law that formerly disgraced the statute-book of the District , makes a wiU removing their child from the custody of the mother , and placing it in the hands of his elder brother , a soured person who disapproved of the marriage , and who regards all women with sus - picion .

		Presently the husband is murdered by a woman whom he has betrayed , and the circum - stances of the crime are such as to make the brother believe that the wife is the guilty person .

		Acting upon this conviction , he insists upon taking posses - sion of the child , and , the law having ruled in his 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, favor , the mother is forced to take flight with her offspring .

		For several years she eludes pursuit , but finally the detectives discover her hiding-place , seize the child , and put it in the hands of its lawful guardian .

		In the end , the truth of the murder comes out , the fact of the mother 's innocence is established in the mind of the only man who has ever doubted it , and the outcome of the whole complication is that the mother marries the man whom she has hitherto most hated , while he , filled with remorse for the consequences of his error , seeks , by the depth of his newly-awakened love , to atone for the wrong he has done the suffering woman .

		A large section of the story is devoted to an account of a political agitation for the repeal of the statute which has in this instance abetted so wicked a wrong .

		In this aspect , the book degenerates into a piece of pam - phleteering , and suffers correspondingly as a work of art .

		But it is , on the whole , a strong novel , exhibiting variety of incident , depth of feeling , and a genuine gift of characterization .

		A delightful story of the South , a story of com - paratively recent years , although rooted in an episode of the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	occupation of
New Orleans	LOCATION	during the Civil War , is told in `` The Price of Silence , '' from the accomplished pen of Mrs.
M. E. M. Davis	PERSON	.

		The heroine belongs to an exclusive old famUy of the French Quarter , but there is a sup - posed blot upon her birth .

		A document is in exist - ence which seems to indicate that the most terrible of all disgraces -LRB- from the distorted Southern point of view -RRB- is hers ; in other words , that there is a slight infusion of negro blood in her veins .

		This document is stolen by
Butler	PERSON	's provost officer in the sixties , and in the eighties , when the story proper begins , is in the possession of a son of that officer , an unscrupulous scoundrel who has somehow secured an entrance into
New Orleans	LOCATION	society , and who uses his knowledge to blackmail the girl 's famUy , and to force the girl herself into marriage with him .

		Meanwhile , the right sort of hero makes his appear - ance , foils the villain , disproves the dark imputation upon the girl 's lineage , does pretty nearly every - thing else that a truly devoted hero ought to do , and at last wins the heroine .

		The stoiy is told with unfailing animation , and pictures with great fidelity the traits of the old French society now rapidly passing from view as a distinctive element in the life of the ancient city of
Bienville	LOCATION	.

		The '' Pocket Book of Poems and Songs for the Open Air '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , compiled by Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	, is one of those anthologies , so numerous of late , which find their pattern in Mr.

		The inclusion of some sixty old English songs and bal - lads , with the original musical scores , is a unique feature of considerable interest .

		Colored end-papers , showing inside and outside views of the '' Red Lion '' inn , are supplied by Mr.

Francis S. Walker	PERSON	's beautifid illustrations in color re - tained out of seventy-nine in the original edition .

		`` A Book of the Pyrenees , '' by Mr.
S. Baring-Gould	PERSON	, is essentially a guide-book , but one that is readable as well as practically helpful .

		It combines much history and geography with its detailed information for tourist use , and has twenty-five photographic views by way of illustration .

		The

		The form of the volumes is both pretty and serviceable .

		A group of related essays from the pen of Miss
Margaret W. Morley	PERSON	on the natural history of grass - hoppers , locusts , crickets , katydids , walking-sticks , and other common insects is published under the title '' Grasshopper Land '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The book is a well - executed piece of sugar-coated science , intended for children or amateur naturalists , and is couched in lit - erary rather than scientific form .

		It abounds in classical and historical references , and its anatomical and ento - mological data are trustworthy .

		The author 's style is pleasing , and the illustrations are exceptionaUy spirited .


1907	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE
DIAL 381 Messrs. Herbert B. Turner & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a '' Prac - tical European Guide , '' by Mr.
M. D. Frazar	PERSON	, who has been engaged in the '' tourist business '' for many years .

		It is a small book , but it contains a great deal of infor - mation about hotels , routes , fares , and noteworthy sights .

		A book of more limited scope , and consequently greater particularity , is Miss
