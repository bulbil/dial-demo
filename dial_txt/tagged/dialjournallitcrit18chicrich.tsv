ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON	PERSON	.

		The death of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, on the third of
December	DATE	, in his
South Sea Island	LOCATION	home , is a grief to the whole English-speaking world .

		Wherever our tongue is spoken , in
England	LOCATION	and in
America	LOCATION	, in
India	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, and
South Africa	LOCATION	, his name has been a house - hold word for at least ten years past , and his books have brought delight into countless lives , young and old .

		Now , that rare spirit has left its too frail tenement , and only a memory re - mains with those who loved him .

		Even the healing airs of the
Pacific	LOCATION	availed to prolong only for a few brief years the precious existence upon which disease had already fastened when
Bournemouth	LOCATION	was exchanged for
Samoa	LOCATION	; but those years , few as they have been , have proved the most richly productive of his career , and our grief becomes the more poignant when we realize that he has been stricken in the very fulness of his powers , and when we think of what treasures one more decade of his life might have added to our literature .

		As it is , the list of Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's books is a long one , longer than stands to the credit of many a writer who rounds out the scriptural tale of years .

		And when we consider , on the one hand , the physical disabilities under which the author labored , and , on the other , the fault - less workmanship as well as the prevailing man - liness and sanity of his output , we must reckon him among the most remarkable literary fig - ures of the time .

		He served a long and pain - ful apprenticeship to his art ; he waited until he felt himself well in hand ; and then , in spite of bodily conditions that would have daunted the will and quenched the ambition of the great majority of men , he began that steady stream of literary production whose flow was to cease only with his life .

		He would seem to have taken deeply to heart
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	's noble maxim that the free man thinks of nothing less than of death , and , with death for years staring him in the face , he asserted his spiritual freedom by writing volume after volume , in which the predominant note is one of cheer and in which the morbid finds scarcely a foothold .

		One thinks of
Condorcet	LOCATION	in prison , waiting for the THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, summons of the executioner , yet living '' in an elysium that his reason has known how to cre - ate for itself , and that his love for humanity adorns with all purest delights . ''

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	, in spite of his excursions into other fields of literature , will be best remem - bered as a novelist .

		He has seemed , indeed , of late years to recognize that this was his true vocation ; and most of his recent work , as well as most of that planned for the immediate fu - ture , was in fiction .

		His novels are far from being of equal excellence .

		Some of them `` Prince
Otto	PERSON	, '' `` The Black Arrow , '' `` The Wrong Box , '' '' The Wreckers , '' '' The Ebb - Tide , '' must be regarded as relative failures with some insistence upon the relativity .

		The '' Strange Case of Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	, '' with all its fantastic psychological strength , is hardly to be ranked among the masterpieces .

		But of '' The Master of
Ballantrae	LOCATION	, '' of '' Kid - napped '' and its sequel '' Catriona , '' and of the best of the '' New Arabian Nights '' stories , there can be no question ; nor can there be any of ''
Treasure Island	LOCATION	, '' equally good reading for young and old .

		Little fiction of the last ten yeare has so fair a chance of immortality as these books .

		Of the many volumes of miscellaneous prose other than fiction , it is hard to single out those most likely to live .

		Hardly one of them is without its admirers if not its zealous partisans .

		Among the collections of essays , the ''
Virgin	PERSON	- ibus Puerisque '' volume has perhaps the warm - est place in the affections of the most discrim - inating readers .

		But let no one on this account neglect the '' Familiar Studies of Men and Books , '' the '' Memories and Portraits , '' or the papers gathered under the title of '' Across the Plains . ''

		As for the altogether delightful books of travel , we find it impossible to choose be - tween `` An Inland Voyage '' and '' Travels with a Donkey in the
Cevennes	LOCATION	. ''

		And of course a special word must be given to the group of books that deal with life in the
Southern Seas	ORGANIZATION	, to the fiction of the '' Island Nights Entertain - ments , '' to the fact of '' A Footnote to History , '' and to the stirring verse of the '' Ballads . ''

		In this connection , we instantly associate Mr.
Stev	PERSON	- enson with
Melville	PERSON	, and ``
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, '' and Mr.
Charles Warren Stoddard	PERSON	; and he seems to head the list .

		As for Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's verse , while it is of no great consequence , yet it can not be left un - mentioned .

		Besides the '' Ballads '' already alluded to , there is `` A Child 's Garden of Verse , '' that unique illustration of the projec - tion of an adult into a youthful mind , and the collection called '' Underwoods , '' containing many charming poems of nature and of friend - ship , written in English and in
Scots	LOCATION	, and from which we must select as the writer 's own sin - gularly fitting epitaph this lovely '' Kequiem '' : '' Under the wide and starry sky , Dig the grave and let me lie , Glad did I live and gladly die , And I laid me down with a will . ''

		This be the verse you grave for me , Here he lies where he longed to be , Home is the sailor , home from sea , And the hunter home from the hill . ''

		He has his wish now , for with the news of his death came the statement that he had been buried upon the summit of a mountain over - looking his Samoan home .

		The story of the dead writer 's life may be simply told , and for it he has himself supplied the facts .

		Born in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	,
November 13 , 1850	DATE	, of a family of lighthouse engineers , he was destined for the ancestral calling .

		He attended school and university in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, discovered that he did not want to be a civil engineer after all , tried the law , finding that equally distasteful , and determined to train himself for the profession of letters .

		At the age of twenty-three he began those wanderings in search of health that were to end only in the antipodes .

		We can trace these wanderings in his books , beginning with '' Ordered South , '' and continuing the series through '' Travels with a Donkey , '' '' An Inland Voyage , '' '' Across the Plains , '' and '' The Silverado Squatters . ''

		The latter two books resulted from a steer - age trip to
America	LOCATION	in
1879	DATE	, and a journey to the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	on an emigrant train .

		While in
San Francisco	LOCATION	he married Mrs. Os - bourne .

		During the ensuing years , he lived at
Bournemouth	LOCATION	, in
Scotland	LOCATION	, and in various
Continental	ORGANIZATION	resorts .

		In
1887	DATE	he made a sec - ond visit to
America	LOCATION	, and spent a winter in the
Adirondacks	LOCATION	.

		The summer following , he went to the Samoan islands , became so fascinated with the place that he purchased an estate , and settled down for the remainder of his days .

		How few those days were to be , we now know .

		But six years of domestic happiness and of healthful activity were no small boon for a man whose whole adult life had been a struggle for existence , and we doubt not he appreciated the blessing to the full .

		At all events his best was done in that peaceful retreat , and he himself was probably glad to accept it as his final rest - ing-place .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL IBSEN 'S NEW PLAY , `` LILLE JSYOLF . ''

		Since the publication of `` En Folkefiende '' in
1882	DATE	, every second year has been marked by the appearance of a new play from the pen of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		Two years may seem a long time to be given to the composition of a prose drama that occupies less than two hours in the acting , and fills a printed volume of very modest dimensions ; but we are assured by the author 's biographer that the two years really go to the making of the work , and that the final pro- duct is the result of a labor limce for which few mod - ern writers have the requisite patience .

		It is only after careful study that we may comprehend the in - finite pains bestowed upon every detail of these re - markable works , or realize that few poets give their verse the elaboration bestowed by Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	upon the polished prose of his dialogue .

		The new play , which has just been received from
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, and of which translations into English , German , French , Russian , Dutch , Hungarian , Bo - hemian , and Polish have been arranged , is entitled ''
Lille Eyolf	PERSON	, '' and is in three acts .

		Coming after ''
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	'' and ''
Bygmester Solness	PERSON	, '' it is a relief to the reader , for it is simpler in plan and more obvious in significance .

		Many of its passages are far-reaching in their implications , and strike into the very depths of the soul ; but the reader is not all the time haunted by the suggestion of some elusive allegory , some hidden meaning that leads him a will-o ' - the-wisp chase and lands him in a bog of conjecture .

		Even the most ardent of symbolists may possibly be content to take this play for what it is , and see in it nothing more than a direct tran - script of life under ideal conditions arranged by a consummate artistic sense .


Alfred Allmers	PERSON	and his wife ,
Rita	PERSON	, have been mar - ried for some ten years , and have one child , a boy of nine , named Eyolf .

		The child has been crippled in infancy , and is just reaching the age when he real - izes the difference between himself and other boys sound of limb .

		The father , passionately attached to his child , has determined to devote himself to his happiness , and bring what harmony is yet possible into a life so unfitted to battle for itself .

		He thus states his new-found aim : '' I will try to bring to light all the rich possibilities that are dawning in his childish soul .

		I will bring to full growth , to flower and fruit , every germ of noble purpose within him .

		And I will do more than that .

		I will help him to harmonize his wishes with what things are attainable by him .

		For now they are not in harmony .

		He longs for things that will be unattainable all his life long .

		But I will create joy in his mind . ''

		These plans are all broken off by the accidental drowning in the fjord of the child , whose winsome figure , like that of Mamillius in `` The
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' makes but the briefest appearance upon the scene , then passes from our sight , although never from our memory .

		The remaining two acts of the play are essentially a study of two women and their relations with All - mers .

		The one is his wife , the other
Asta Allmers	PERSON	, supposed to be his half-sister .

		With the latter he has grown up from childhood in the closest inti - macy .

		Now , following close upon the loss of the child , comes the discovery that the supposed rela - tionship of brother and sister does not exist ; and the other discovery , which both realize as by a light - ning flash , but which neither ventures to commit to words , that they are more to one another than even a brother and sister can be .

		This situation , which is treated with the greatest delicacy , closes the sec - ond act .

		Allmers .

		Asta !

		What are you saying ?


Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Head the letters .

		Then you will see and under - stand .

		And perhaps you will forgive my mother , also .

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Putting his hands to his head . -RSB-

		I can not grasp it , can not hold fast to the thought .

		You ,
Asta	ORGANIZATION	, then you are not ?


Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		You are not my brother ,
Alfred	PERSON	.

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Quickly , half-defiant , gazing upon her . -RSB-

		Well , but how does that alter our relations after all ?

		Not in the least .


Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB- Shaking her head . -RSB-

		It alters everything ,
Alfred	PERSON	.

		Our relation is not that of brother and sister .

		Allmers .

		No , no !

		But as sacred for all that .

		It will al - ways be as sacred .


Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Do not forget that you are subject to the law of mutability , as you said but now .

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Looking searchingly at her . -RSB-

		Do you mean by that ?


Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB- Quietly , but deeply stirred . -RSB-

		Not a word more , dear , dear
Alfred	PERSON	.

		-LSB- Taking up some flowers from a chair . -RSB-

		Do you see these water-lilies ?

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Nodding slowly . -RSB-

		They are of the sort that shoot up far up from the depths .


Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		I picked them in the pool .

		There , where it flows out into the fjord .

		- -LSB- Holding them out to him . -RSB-

		Will you have them ,
Alfred	PERSON	?

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Taking them . -RSB-

		Thank you .


Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB- With tearful eyes . -RSB-

		They are like a last greeting to you from from little Eyolf .

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Gazing upon her . -RSB-

		From Eyolf out yonder ?

		Or from you ?


Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB- Softly . -RSB-

		From us both .

		Come with me to
Rita	PERSON	.

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Taking his hat and murmuring . -RSB-


Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Eyolf .

		Little Eyolf !

		The character of
Rita	PERSON	, the wife , is less transpar - ent than that of
Asta	ORGANIZATION	, and her motives are not so easily laid bare .

		In the first act she is presented to us as attached to Allmers to the point of grudg - ing him his interest in his intellectual pursuits , his affection for his ` sister , and even his absorption in the child .

		She sees with delight the prospect of a marriage between
Asta	ORGANIZATION	and a young engineer who has for some time been laying siege to the sister 's heart .

		Rita .

		I should be very glad to see a match made between him and
Asta	ORGANIZATION	.

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Discontented . -RSB-

		Why would you like that ?

		Rita .

		-LSB- With rising emotion . -RSB-

		Because then she would have to go far away with him .

		She could never come out to us the way she does now .

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Looking at her with amazement . -RSB-

		What !

		Would you like to get rid of
Asta	ORGANIZATION	?

		Rita .

		Yes , yes ,
Alfred	PERSON	.

		Allmers .

		But why in all the world ?

		Rita .

		-LSB- Passionately throwing her arms about his neck . -RSB-

		Because then I should at last have you for myself alone .

		Yet not quite then even .

		Not wholly for myself .

		-LSB- Bursting into convulsive tears . -RSB-

		Oh ,
Alfred	PERSON	, Alfred I can not give you up I THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	,
Allmers	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB- Gently freeing himself . -RSB-

		But , dearest
Rita	PERSON	, be reasonable .

		Rita .

		No , I do n't care the least bit about being reasonable .

		I care only about you .

		For you alone in the whole world .

		-LSB- Flinging herself upon his neck again . -RSB-

		For you , for you , for you !

		Allmers .

		Let go , let go , you hurt me .

		Rita .

		-LSB- Releasing him . -RSB-

		If I only could .

		-LSB- With flashing eyes . -RSB-

		Oh , if you only knew , how I have hated you !

		Allmers .

		Hated me ?

		Rita .

		Yes , when you sat in there by yourself , brooding over your work .

		Long , long into the
night	TIME	.

		-LSB- Plaintively . -RSB-

		So long , so late ,
Alfred	PERSON	.

		Oh , how I hated your work !

		Allmers .

		But now I have given it all up .

		Rita .

		-LSB- Laughing harshly . -RSB-

		Indeed !

		Now you are absorbed in something yet worse .

		Allmers .

		-LSB- Excited . -RSB-

		Worse !

		Do you call the child some - thing worse ?

		Rita .

		-LSB- Vehemently . -RSB-

		Yes , I do . '

		!

		In the relation between us two , I call him that .

		For the child , the child is besides a living human being , he is .

		-LSB- With increasing agitation . -RSB-

		But I will not bear it ,
Alfred !	PERSON

		I will not bear it , and I tell you so !

		Allmers .

		-LSB- In a low voice , looking fixedly at her . -RSB-

		I am almost afraid of you at times ,
Rita	LOCATION	.

		Rita .

		-LSB- Darkly . -RSB-

		I am often afraid of myself .

		And for just that reason you must not arouse the evil in me .

		This scene strikes the keynote of
Rita	PERSON	's character .

		She displays jealousy , undoubtedly , but jealousy of a complex sort , jealousy even more morbid than that passion usually is .

		The problem of the re - maining two acts is that of working out the effects of the child 's death upon this passionate nature , and upon the nature , equally passionate in its depths but outwardly more restrained , of Allmers .

		To trace the process by which these stricken souls find peace would be impossible without translating the greater part of the two acts that follow .

		For peace finally comes or we are at least assured that its advent is imminent to her , through love , now first realized , for the memory of the lost child ; to him , through a deeper penetration into the mystery of life .

		At first dazed with grief , the future a blank to both , they instinctively turn to one another for help , and , in community of grief , grope towards that higher plane of thought and feeling which is attain - able by the courageous , but , perhaps , only through the refiner 's fire of suffering .

		We leave them with the ascent well begun , and the goal dimly in view .

		Moved by a common impulse of altruism , they re - solve , thus bereft of their own child , to make bet - ter and brighter the lives of the village children about them , the very children who had made no ef - fort to save Eyolf from his fate .

		In this lovely scene , and in the play of which it is the ending , we find once more the Ibsen that to some of us , at least , has seemed wellnigh lost of re - cent years , the idealist of '' Brand '' and ''

		THE DIAL COMMUNICA TIONS .

		ENGLISH LITERATURE IN AMERICAN LIBRARIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The rapidly increasing interest in the study of English literature in American schools and universities , and the recent suggestion in THE DIAL that the leading specialty of the new
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	should be English literature in the broad sense of the term , lends renewed value to the statistics and statements contained in the '' Notes on Special Collections in American Libraries '' issued from the
Harvard College Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		From this docu - ment I summarize briefly the descriptions of the chief collections in English literature as reported from all the great libraries of the country except the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The best general collections are probably those at
Harvard	LOCATION	, in the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, in the
Lenox Library	LOCATION	at
New York	LOCATION	including the
Duyckinck	PERSON	collection of 15,000 volumes in literary history , and in the
Sutro Library	ORGANIZATION	at
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Considerable collections also exist at
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	; at
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	-LRB- especially complete in regard to
Beowulf	LOCATION	-RRB- ; at
Lafayette	LOCATION	College -LRB- Professor
March	DATE	's collection in Old and Mid - dle English , said to be '' nearly complete for
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxon '' -RRB- ; in the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Historical Society 's Li - brary ,
Boston	LOCATION	, including the Dowse collection of '' best editions and rarities in English literature '' ; at the Uni - versity of
Vermont	LOCATION	-LRB- the
George P. Marsh	PERSON	library -RRB- ; the collection of periodicals and of transactions and publi - cations of learned societies in the
Chicago	LOCATION	Public Library ; at
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	; the material originally used by
Noah Webster	PERSON	in preparing his dictionary , belonging to the
Hartford Library Association	ORGANIZATION	; and a few others of less importance .

		In addition to those specified above , the chief special collections are as follows : The
Barton	PERSON	collection in the
Boston Public Library	LOCATION	, nearly 14,000 volumes , mostly
Shakespeariana	PERSON	and rare editions of English Drama and Poetry .

		The Shakespeare collection of
1000	DATE	volumes in the
Lenox Library	LOCATION	, including all the early editions .

		Other Shakespeare collections as follows : The
Wisconsin State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	,
1200	DATE	volumes ; the
Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, 1200 volumes -LRB-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and the Drama -RRB- ; the
Columbia College Library	ORGANIZATION	, 700 vol - umes ; the
St. Louis Public Library	LOCATION	, 600 volumes ; the
Peabody Institute	ORGANIZATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	, 500 volumes ; the
Brown University Library	ORGANIZATION	, 400 volumes , including many rare pamphlets ; and the recently acquired collection at
the University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Harvard ,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and the Lenox have also considerable collections on
Milton	LOCATION	.

		The folk-lore collection of 5800 volumes at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is '' sup - posed to be the largest in existence . ''

		Harvard also has valuable
Shelley	PERSON	and
Carlyle MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		and books .

		The
Boston Athenaeum	ORGANIZATION	has a Byron collection of over 200 volumes .


Lafayette College	ORGANIZATION	has special collections on
Priestley	LOCATION	, De Foe ,
Junius	PERSON	, etc. .

		The
Lenox Library	ORGANIZATION	has a fine collection of incunabula , including a portion of the first English printed book ,
1474	DATE	, and other specimens of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	and the early English printers .

		Viewing these summaries as a whole , it is evident that there is nowhere in the
United States	LOCATION	any really satis - factory and fairly complete collection in the great field of English literature .

		A few special collections offer a promising beginning in one or more narrow parts of the field , but extended study and research over any wide area is hardly possible in this country .

		Of course no American library could ever hope to rival the British Museum or the Bodleian in their particular field , but it is a disgraceful lacuna in the endowment of American scholarship that research in almost any direction -LRB- except perhaps in Shakespeare study and in one or two mod - ern subjects -RRB- demanding any but the simplest and most elementary materials can only be prosecuted abroad .

		In no field except that of history and literature is one of the chief documents of history are great collections of books so necessary as in the study of literature , and the most universal of the arts will never attain to its proper dignity in American civilization until adequate material means for its fostering and promotion are af - forded .

		The
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	could supply no greater need than by a collection of the literature of the En - glish tongue .

		THE PERILOUS USE OF UNKNOWN TONGUES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A great many people firmly believe that a knowledge of Latin is not at all necessary in order to get through this life successfully , but one might suppose that all would agree as to the necessity of such a knowledge to anyone who attempts to use the language .

		The sorry plight into which some of the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	officials were thrown by the lack of this knowledge has been pointed out by one of your correspondents .

		Let me call attention to a few similar cases of unsuccessful wrestling with an unknown tongue .

		In a ponderous work on the '' Principles of Economic Philosophy , '' pub - lished several years ago , the principle `` omnium vivum ex ovo '' is stated , and , as if purposely to clear the printer of blame , we have as its counterpart '' omnium ovum ex vivo . ''

		Perhaps nothing better should be ex - pected from a work on political economy published in the midst of a campaign , but it is only a few months since no less a magazine than '' The Atlantic Monthly '' was guilty of '' omm ' a Gallia , '' in quoting from the first sentence of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's Commentaries !

		By the help of Mrs.
Partington	PERSON	, with her '' omnibi , '' the process of re - duction from the third to the first and second declen - sions is complete for all genders , though the stems do not happen to coincide .

		But this is not all ; along comes '' The Cosmopolitan '' with '' monstrum informwm ingeus , '' which would have been much more terrible to
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	than was Polyphemus to ^ Eneas . ''

		Ad valorwm , '' on the editorial page of '' The Independent '' a few years ago , may have been a mere typographical error ; but '' ex unwm quadraginta '' -LRB- of the number of dishes of soup from one can of some new preparation -RRB- , which I culled from a polyglot street-car advertisement in
Bal	LOCATION	- timore , is doubtless to be ascribed to the same cause operating in the other instances mentioned : crass ignor - ance of the language .

		Horace says : '' Ludere qui nescit campestribus abstinet armis , '' which offers a very important suggestion to those who attempt to use Latin without some little knowledge of its forms .

		Since writing the above , I have received the
Decem	PERSON	- ber '' Education '' -LRB- fresh from
Boston	LOCATION	/ -RRB- with the informa - tion -LRB- p. 255 -RRB- that Gudeman 's '' Dialogus de Oratoribus '' contains '' a prolegomena . ''

Jan. 1	DATE	, Iffefo MOKE MEMOIRS OF LITERARY The qualities that won for Mrs.
Anne Thack	PERSON	- eray
Ritchie	PERSON	's `` Records of Tennyson and
Brown	PERSON	- ing '' so cordial a welcome on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	are once more pleasantly in evidence in her '' Chapters from Some Unwritten Me - moirs . ''

		Essentially the volume is a retrospect of the author 's girlhood , which seems to have been divided pretty evenly between
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, and the opening sentence sounds its key - note : '' My father lived in good company , so that even as children we must have seen a good many poets and re - markable people , though we were not always conscious of our privileges . ''

		Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	opens the series of pen-portraits which form the staple of her book with a lively sketch of her `` first poet , ''
Jasmin	PERSON	-LRB-
Jaquou Jansemin	PERSON	, in the langue d' Oc -RRB- , the barber-poet of Agen .

		She met Jasmin at a party given in his honor by Lady Elgin at
Paris	LOCATION	; and the outer man of the tonsorial bard fell wofully short of her young ideal .

		She had learned at school some of his beautiful verses , and her fancy had painted a poet to match something in the Byrouic way , with a distinctive touch of '' the warm South '' superadded .

		But alas !

		when the real Jasmin dawned upon her at Lady
Elgin	ORGANIZATION	's rout , it was no belated troubabour that she saw , but a stout jovial figure like an over - ripe Bacchus a jolly , red , shining face , with round prominent features , framed with little pomatumy wisps of hair -LRB- smacking all too plainly of the shop -RRB- , and a Falstaffian torso clad in a gorgeous frilled shirt over a pink lin - ing .

		She could have cried for vexation .

		It was her first illusion perdue . ''

		That the poet ?

		not that , ' I falter , gazing at
Punchinello	LOCATION	, high-shouldered , good-humored . '

		Yes , of course it 's that , ' said a little girl , laughing at my dis - may ; and the crowd seems to form a circle , in the cen - tre of which stands this droll creature , who now begins to recite in a monotonous voice . ''

		Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	understood French pretty well at the time ; but of Jasmin 's jiatois she could make nothing .

		To her untrained ear the reci - tation was a meaningless '' cAi , cAa , chou , at - chiou , atchiou , atchiou , '' a kind of mellifluous ProvenQal sneeze , to the rhythm of which the ample shirt-frill beat time , as the voice rose and fell .

		It leaves off at last , and there is a moment of silence , and then a buzz of low - voiced ad - * CHAPTERS FROM SOME UNWRITTEN MEMOIRS .

		As we move towards the door again , we once more pass Mr.
Locker	PERSON	-LRB- of the `
London	LOCATION	Lyrics ' -RRB- , and he nods kindly , and tells me he knows my father . '

		Well , and what do you think of Jasmin ? '

		he asks ; but I ca n't answer him , my illusions are dashed .

		... I who had longed to see a poet !

		who had pictured something so different !

		I swallowed down as best I could that gulp of salt-water which is so apt to choke us when we first take our plunge into the experience of life . ''

		Yet Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	had been that evening in a throng of poets , as she learned later ; for
Lamartine	LOCATION	,
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	,
Girardin	PERSON	,
Merimee	PERSON	, and some others , were of the company .

		And he too of the red face and the shirt-frill was a poet a poet of the people , writing from his heart in his own dialect ; one of the school , as Sainte-Beuve says , of
Horace	PERSON	, and of Theocri - tus , and of Gray , and '' of all those charming studious inspirations which aim at perfection in all their work . ''

		It was at
Paris	LOCATION	, also , that Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	met her first musician ; and here there was no dis - illusionment .

		She accompanied , one morning , as she relates , a friend of her grandmother 's on a visit to the lodgings of one whose name and identity were not at first made known to her .

		The friend was a Scotch lady of rank , who to the harshest of exteriors joined the mildest of souls ; and her errand on this occasion was plainly one of kindness , for there was a large basket in the carriage containing a store of viands and bottles .

		Arrived at a small house in a side street near the Arc de Triomphe , the carriage stopped , and the lady got out , care - fully carrying her parcel .

		The door was opened by a slight delicate-looking man with long hair , strangely bright eyes , and a thin hooked nose . ''

		When Miss X. saw him she hastily put down her basket , caught both his hands in hers , began to shake them gently , and to scold him in an affectionate reprov - ing way for having come to the door .

		He laughed , said he had guessed who it was , and motioned her to enter , and I followed at her sign with the basket followed into a narrow little room , with no furniture in it what - ever but an upright piano and a few straw chairs stand - ing on the wooden shiny floor .

		He made us sit down with some courtesy , and in reply to her questions said he was pretty well .

		Had he slept ?

		He shook his head .

		Had he eaten ?

		He shrugged his shoulders and pointed to the piano .

		He had been composing something I remember that he spoke in an abrupt , light sort of way would Miss X. like to hear it ? '

		She would like to hear it , ' she answered , ' she would dearly like to hear it ; but it would tire him to play ; it could not be good for him . ' ''

		THE DIAL 9 He smiled again , shook back his long hair , and = seated himself at the piano ; and instantly the room was filled with a rain of continuous sound , a fluent stream of rippling melody that rose and fell , and swelled and died away again , until the strained ear scarcely caught its echo .

		There was a magician at the keys . ''

		The lady sat absorbed and listening , and as I looked : at her I saw tears in her eyes great clear tears rolling down her cheeks while the music poured on and on .

		I ca n't , alas , recall that music !

		I would give anything to remember it now ; but the truth is I was so interested in the people that I scarcely listened .

		When he stopped at last and looked tound , the lady started up .

		` You must n't play any more , ' she said ; ` it 's too beautiful ' and she praised him in a tender , motherly , pitying sort of way , and then hurriedly said we must go ; but as we took leave she added almost in a whisper with a humble apologizing look ' I have brought you some of that jelly , and my sister sent some of the wine you fancied the other day ; pray try to take a little . '

		He again shook his head at her , seeming more vexed than grate - ful .

		` It is very wrong ; you should n't bring me these things , ' he said in French . '

		I wo n't play to you if you do ' but she put him back softly , and hurriedly closed the door upon him and the offending basket , and hast - ened away . ''

		The player was Chopin . ''

		Never forget , '' said Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	's companion , '' that you have heard
Chopin	PERSON	play ; for soon no one will ever hear him play any more . ''

		Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	's historian , or rather her '' pro- fessor of history , '' was not a Thiers , or a Guizot , or even a Lamartine .

		It was a certain quaint old body who , for the behoof of very young ladies , made a feint at giving historical lectures , keep - ing herself laboriously a chapter or so ahead of her pupils , and plunging -LRB- Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	re - members -RRB- into the bloody chaos of the Merov - ingian and Carolingian times with a zest com - ically at odds with her own appearance .

		This
Madame P.	PERSON	, whose purse was even leaner than her lectures , is the heroine of a pleasant story of
Thackeray	PERSON	, the truth of which is now vouched for by his daughter . ''

		When my father came to
Paris	LOCATION	to fetch us away , he was interested in the accounts he heard of the old lady from his mother and cousin .

		... I was sent one day to search for a certain pill-box in my father 's room , of which he proceeded to empty the contents into the fire - place , and then , drawing a neat banker 's roll from his pocket , to fill up the little cube with new napoleons , packing them in closely up to the brim .

		After which , the cover being restored , he wrote the following prescrip - tion in his beautiful even handwriting : ' Madame P. ... To be taken occasionally when required .

		Signed , Dr.
W. M. T.	PERSON	' '' Years after , when
Paris	LOCATION	was besieged by the Germans , and
Madame P.	ORGANIZATION	was in sorer straits than ever before , '' Dr.
W. M. T.	PERSON	's '' generous prescription was repeated this time in the form of a draft on the
Rothschilds	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was learned later , however , that the beleaguered old lady had scorned to apply the money to the purchase of luxuries above the horrible frican - deaux and salmis of rats and mice to which her neighbors were reduced , subscribing it rather , as she proudly said , '' to the cannon which were presented by our quartier to the city of
Paris	LOCATION	. '' ''

		My father , '' observes Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	, '' had a weakness for dandies . ''

		Magnificent speci - mens of the '' Dandiacal body '' used to cross her vision sometimes , as they passed through the hall to the study ; but there was one that outshone the rest as the sun the stars in bright - ness .

		This splendid person , she remembers , had a little pencil-sketch in his hand ; and it seemed to her impossible that so grand a being could be so feeble a draughtsman . ''

		He appeared to us one
Sunday	DATE	morning in the sun - shine .

		When I came down to breakfast I found him sitting beside my father at the table , with an untasted cup of coffee before him ; he seemed to fill the bow - window with radiance as if he were Apollo ; he leaned against his chair with one elbow resting on its back , with shining studs and curls and boots .

		We could see his horse looking in at us over the blind .

		It was indeed a sight for little girls to remember all their lives . ''

		It was indeed ; for the visitor was Count D'Or - say the brilliant being who -LRB- as
Richard Doyle	PERSON	relates -RRB- so impressed a literary man of the day that the latter was heard to roar out in dismay at a city banquet where D'Orsay was present , above the din of aldermanic gabbling and gob - bling , '' Waiter !

		for
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's sake bring melted butter for the flounder of the Count ! ''

		He could not bear that the waiter 's omission should rest as a blot upon his country 's cookery .

		No literary memoir of the period would be complete without a glimpse of the Carlyles .

		Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	first saw the sage at a dinner at her father 's , given for
Miss Bronte	LOCATION	; and she remembers him then chiefly as railing at the appearance of cockneys upon Scotch mountain - sides .

		There were also too many Americans there for his taste ; '' but the Americans were as gods compared to the cockneys , '' he kindly added .

		Later , the old house in Cheyne Row -LRB- the Mecca of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's '' millions of trans - atlantic bores '' -RRB- , became a familiar spot to her ; and here she heard from the lips of Mrs. Car - lyle many stories that have since strayed into print . ''

		If , '' said the poor lady pathetically on one occasion , '' if you wish for a quiet life , never you marry a dyspeptic man of genius . '' ''

		I remember , '' Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	adds , '' she used to tell us how , when he first grew a beard , all the time he had saved by ceasing to shave he 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	spent wandering about the house , and bemoan - ing that much was amiss in the universe . ''

		If Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	was , as tradition says , a shade nearer Xanthippe than
Griselda	LOCATION	, there was as - suredly much in her universe to explain and palliate the fact .

		Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	's notes on the Carlyles close with a characteristic little story that will bear re - telling .

		It seems that irreverent thieves having broken into the sanctuary at
Chelsea	LOCATION	and carried off the dining-room clock , it was arranged by some of the then aging philoso - pher 's friends to formally present him with a new one .

		Lady Stanley was elected spokes - woman on the occasion : '' It was
Carlyle	PERSON	's birthday , and a dismal winter 's day ; the streets were shrouded in greenish vapors , and the houses looked no less dreary within than the streets through which we had come .

		Somewhat chilled and depressed , we all assembled in Lady
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's great drawing-room in
Dover Street	LOCATION	, where the fog had also penetrated , and presently from the farther end of the room , advancing through the darkness , came
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	.

		There was a moment 's pause .

		No one moved .

		He stood in the middle of the room without speaking .

		No doubt the philosopher as well as his disciples felt the influ - ence of the atmosphere .

		Lady
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	went to meet him . '

		Here is a little birthday present we want you to accept from us all , Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	, ' said she , quickly pushing up before him a small table upon which stood the clock ticking all ready for his acceptance .

		Then came another silence , broken by a knell , sadly sounding in our ears . '

		Eh , what have I got to do with Time any more ? '

		he said .

		It was a melancholy momenjt .

		Nobody could speak .

		The unfortunate promoter of the scheme felt her heart sink into her shoes . ''

		But we have quoted enough from Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	's pleasant and , in its light way , mat - terful little book to show its scope and tenor .

		Other chapters treat of further
Paris	LOCATION	and Lon - don memories , of tours on the continent , includ - ing a visit to
Weimar	LOCATION	, of '' Mrs.
Kemble	PERSON	, '' etc. ; and there are pleasant glimpses throughout of
Thackeray	PERSON	and his circle .


E. G. J. MlKABEATJ	PERSON	AND THE FRENCH REV - OLUTION .

		* In the prefatory note to the two volumes con - taining the twelve lectures recently delivered by Professor Von Hoist before the
Lowell	LOCATION	In - stitute , the distinguished author asks readers and critics to take the pages for what they pur - port to be : not a book on the French Revolu - tion , but merely some lectures on it , given under prescribed limits .

		These lectures were pre - * THE FRENCH KE VOLUTION , Tested by
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's Career : Twelve Lectures on the History of the French Revolution .

Callaghan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		pared for delivery before a great popular audi - ence , such as a forceful speaker of eminent reputation always commands in the lecture-hall of the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		Before such an audi - ence the lecturer had a right to assume that there were only a few who had made a special study of the Revolution , sufficient to enable them to follow the presentation of a single phase of the great movement without much prelim - inary explanation .

		The first six lectures , con - cerning the causes of the Revolution , were therefore given mainly as an introduction , to - prepare the audience for what the lecturer had to say about
Mirabeau	PERSON	, for whom he has a de - cided partiality .

		The main interest in these volumes opens with the seventh lecture , on the party of one man , the fourth party in the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	,
Mira	LOCATION	- beau . ''

		Yes , '' says the author , '' and -LSB- he -RSB- not only was a party of himself , but he knew be - forehand that it would be so , and was deter - mined that it should be so . ''

		In that assembly of twelve hundred deputies there were many of the best as well as most illustrious men in
France	LOCATION	; or , as La
Marck	PERSON	says , all the capac - ities , talents , energy , and spirit in the kingdom .

		Mirabeau was then forty years old .

		He was the best-known man in that period of the Rev - olution .

		His abilities were of the highest order .

		He was the greatest orator in the Assembly .

		It is claimed that he was its greatest practical statesman .

		I can not think that he desired to stand alone in the Assembly , having no party affiliations and wanting none .

		No one under - stood better than Mirabeau the difficult public questions that awaited solution .

		And no one understood better than he that even in public assemblies such questions can be solved best by a union of influential men acting together for a common purpose .

		The power to bring about such effective combinations is at least one of the best-known tests of practical statesman - ship .

		Nothing seems clearer than that
Mira	PERSON	- beau desired to be a leader of a party in the As - sembly .

		He desired especially , while retaining his seat as deputy , to be in the ministry , where he would have the privilege of approaching the king openly , and not , as the privilege was only once accorded to him , of approaching the king secretly and by a private door .

		It is because he was a party by himself , and not because he determined to be so , that his desire was never gratified .

		Under the law of
November 7 , 1789	DATE	, members of the Assembly could not enter the ministry .

		THE DIAL 11 vain efforts to make combinations with influen - tial men to secure for himself a secret position behind the throne , from which , without any department for himself , his unseen hand should direct all the departments , through a king who had no will and no fixed purpose except to re - ceive from
Rome	LOCATION	his directions and from the armies of
Europe	LOCATION	his defence .

		Rivalry , jeal - ousy , and the inability of Frenchmen to appre - ciate statesmanship , have been assigned as reasons for his failure .

		The explanation is not adequate ; for it is not true .

		Frenchmen are not wanting in magnanimity .

		Mirabeau him - self explained the cause of the difficulty , often saying : '' Ah !

		how the immorality of my youth injures the public weal . ''

		His conduct during the Revolution completes the explanation .

		His life , from beginning to end , is a significant illustration of the fact that character , such as
Washington	LOCATION	's or
Hampden	LOCATION	's , is more influential ven in popular assemblies than oratory and talent .


Arthur Young	PERSON	says : '' In every com - pany , of every rank , you hear of Count
Mira	PERSON	- beau 's talents ; that he is one of the best pens in
France	LOCATION	, and the first orator ; and that he < 3ould not carry , from confidence , six votes in the states . ''

		This explanation was satisfactory to
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries .

		It has been generally accepted by eminent writers on the Revolution , from that day to our time .

		It is not accepted by Professor
Von Hoist	PERSON	, who seems to think that the time has not yet come ior full justice to
Mirabeau	LOCATION	.

		It is claimed that the immorality of his youth was such as was common in that time ; but that , when he entered public life at the time of the Revolution , his ambition was aroused , he became a new man , and the immorality of his youth should not be counted against him .

		Unfor - tunately , venality , the vice of his public life , is one that is more destructive to the founda - tions of public welfare than all the vices of his youth .

		Mirabeau 's failure to win the confi - dence of his contemporaries will not be under - stood when his vices in public and in private life shall have been forgotten .

		The account of
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's venality is given in the writings of La
Marck	PERSON	with coloring as favorable as honest friendship could use .

		They knew each other prior to the Revolution .

		They were both in the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		Meeting in the As - sembly ,
Mirabeau	PERSON	made the first advances , ask - ing La
Marck	PERSON	to sound the court , and saying to him : '' Let them understand at the chateau that I am more disposed towards them than against them . ''

		In that interview , and in sub - sequent ones , the purpose of La
Marck	PERSON	was formed .

		He says : '' I wished to contribute to the preservation of the throne , as to the defence of the unhappy king who occupied it .

		To bring to the cause of the king Count Mirabeau , who seemed to be the most violent and the most dan - gerous enemy of the throne , to put him in the rank of its most powerful defenders , seemed to me to be an essential service to render . ''

		To effect this service La
Marck	PERSON	had many inter - views with the queen , and , finally , one with both king and queen . ''

		When the king en - tered , '' says
La Marck	PERSON	, '' without any preamble and with his usual brusqueness , he said , ' The queen has told you that I have decided to em - ploy Count Mirabeau , if you think it is in his intentions and in his power to be useful to me . ' ''

		After some suggestions by
La Marck	PERSON	, to the effect that all the revolutionary chiefs might be induced to enter into the service of the king , the suggestions in relation to the other chiefs being ignored , the king said that what should be done with
Mirabeau	PERSON	must be kept a profound secret from the ministers .

		It was then agreed that the king should pay the debts of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	, amounting to 208,000 francs , allow him
6000	DATE	francs a month for his expenses , and should de - posit with La
Marck	PERSON	the king 's notes of
France	LOCATION	amounting to 1,000,000 francs , which should be delivered to
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	at the close * of the Assembly , if , in the meantime , the king should be satisfied in relation to
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's fidelity .

		In addition to these gifts , it was afterwards agreed to allow three hundred francs a month to the copyist of Mirabeau , '' to pay for his si - lence , '' as La
Marck	PERSON	said .

		Mirabeau accepted these gifts gratefully , including the conditional promise as to the additional million francs which were to be given on
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's method : something down , and much more to follow .

		La
Marck	PERSON	was repeatedly charged to keep the whole transaction in the profoundest secrecy .

		Secrecy and silence are the well-known covers to venality everywhere .

		Mirabeau 's private agreement to enter into the service of the king was consummated about the tenth of
May , 1790	DATE	.

		Previous to that time , every door to a place in the ministry had been closed against him . ''

		If I were asked , '' says Professor
Von Hoist	PERSON	, `` what chapter of his whole history redounds , upon the whole , the most to his honor , not only as a statesman but also as a man , I should unhesitatingly answer : that of his relations to the court . ''

		I am far from thinking that this is , or ever will be , the judg - ment of history .

		It was not even the judgment 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan.	DATE	l r of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	.

		On the twenty-first of
October , 1789	DATE	, when he might have reasonably consid - ered that a place in the ministry was open to him , he wrote to La Marck : '' A great succour I can not accept without a place which makes it legitimate . ''

		A pension for public service previously rendered is a badge of honor ; a pay - ment secretly bestowed for political services to be rendered , '' without a place which renders it legitimate , '' was then , and is now , considered a badge of dishonor .

		It is to the credit of hu - man nature that the prejudice , vices , and ven - alities of Mirabeau account for his failure to gain the confidence of his contemporaries .

		But these are not all of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	.

		His nobler part will live .

		His fifty notes to the king contain the most valuable contribution to political science that has come down to us from the Rev - olution .

		In that view , and with the proper qualifications , his relations to the court will re - dound most to his honor as a statesman and as a man .

		Professor Von Hoist seems to undervalue the great qualities of
Lafayette	LOCATION	. ''

		Not many persons , '' he says , '' who have cut a prominent figure in great times have lost so much by hav - ing the search-light of critical history turned upon them as
Lafayette	LOCATION	. ''

		The conduct and character of
Lafayette	LOCATION	were well known long before any such search-light was discovered .

		However it may be elsewhere , it was known , at least in
France	LOCATION	and in the
United States	LOCATION	, that in a long life tried by many tests , the conduct of
Lafayette	LOCATION	was exceptionally consistent , and that it was uniformly governed , not by passion , but by principle .

		In all emergencies he dis - played the same high qualities .

		He was early trained in the school of experience , under Wash - ington , whose friendship and confidence he al - ways retained .

		From the time when he first decided to come to
America	LOCATION	, if the testimony of La
Marck	PERSON	may be accepted , his whole after - conduct was impelled by a force of will that one rarely meets .

		His first experience led him to prefer con - stitutional liberty under a republic .

		In the
France	LOCATION	of that time , he agreed with almost all of the Revolutionary leaders that it was suffi - cient to secure constitutional liberty under a king .

		He and the other leaders failed to ar - rest the course of the Revolution at a point where nearly all of them wished it to stop .

		It is easier to break down a dam than to stay the consequent rush of waters .

		In the last period of
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's life , a small but determined party of men began to prepare for the second and more destructive Revolution .

		It was to that party that
Mirabeau	PERSON	, when interrupted , shouted : '' Silence aux trente voix ! ''


Lafayette	LOCATION	, with dauntless courage , long continued to resist the influence of that party .

		When it had acquired control of the king , the Assembly , the munici - palities , the clubs , and the armies , and resist - ance was no longer possible ,
Lafayette	LOCATION	honor - ably withdrew from the army he commanded . ''

		From the fifth of
October	DATE	, '' says our author , ''
Lafayette	LOCATION	was the most powerful man in the realm , not to do good , but to avert , as well as to bring about , some of the worst evils .

		There - fore one of the main points in
Mirabeau	LOCATION	's pro- gramme from that day on is to coax or to force him into an offensive and defensive alliance , or to break his power . ''

		The alternative is not correctly stated .

		Mirabeau , for several months , labored incessantly both to secure an alliance with the most powerful man in
France	LOCATION	, and at the same time to break him down .

		Lafayette had daily access to the king . '

		Mirabeau had not .

		Under his secret '' employment , '' he could only send his notes to the king , giving advice which was never followed .

		In half of these secret notes he assailed
Lafayette	LOCATION	with unscru - pulous malice .

		He carried on both purposes at the same time one openly , the other secretly .

		On the first of
June , 1790	DATE	,
Mirabeau	PERSON	wrote to
Lafayette	LOCATION	: '' Your great qualities have need of my impelling force ; my impelling force has need of your great qualities . ''

		On the same day , he sent his first note to the king , in which , through page after page , he employed his '' im - pelling force '' in unscrupulous detraction of
Lafayette	LOCATION	's '' great qualities . ''

		He failed to break
Lafayette	LOCATION	; and he failed , as he had failed with others , and for the same reason , to secure the coveted alliance .

		Lafayette did not know - all that is now known about the conduct of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	.

		He knew , however , enough , and therefore justly refused to take the preferred hand , as afterwards the Girondins refused to take the hand of Dan ton .

		The one , offered treacherously , was soiled with money ; the other , offered magnanimously , was stained with blood .

		Professor Von Hoist revives the stale charge relating to
Lafayette	LOCATION	's conduct on the fifth and sixth of
October , 1789	DATE	.

		He says of La - fayette : '' As to the part he played on the fifth of
October	DATE	, he himself has always seen a halo around his head . ''

		And again : '' Though it can not be directly proved that
Lafayette	LOCATION	rather liked to be led to
Versailles	LOCATION	, circumstantial evi - dence renders it likely . ''

		When
Lafayette	LOCATION	was hunting down the promoters of that movement ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 it was Mirabeau who thought it necessary to explain to
Lafayette	LOCATION	that he -LSB- Mirabeau -RSB- had no part in it .

		When , afterwards , the charge was made against
Lafayette	LOCATION	, he gave a digni - fied explanation , refuting the slander .

		Who has a better claim to be favorably heard in ex - planation of his conduct , when assailed , than a man like
Lafayette	LOCATION	, who always stood erect , and who therefore can bear to have the search - light of history turned upon every part of his illustrious career ?

		Sainte-Beuve says : '' All the reproaches against
Lafayette	LOCATION	in relation to the days of the twenty-second of
July	DATE	and the fifth and sixth of
October	DATE	seem to me to be abandoned or refuted . ''

		There never was a moment when
Lafayette	LOCATION	was not ready to risk his life , and , what was more to him than life , his deserved popularity , in the restraint of un - lawful violence ; nor when he failed in duty at the cost of principle .

		He was five years in the prisons of
Austria	LOCATION	.

		The doors of the dungeon at Olmutz were always open to him at any mo - ment when he should be ready to make the least denial of the political principles upon which his entire life was governed .

		In the treaty made after the victory over the Aus - trians at Campo-Formio ,
Napoleon	PERSON	inserted a stipulation securing to
Lafayette	LOCATION	his free - dom .

		In due time
Lafayette	LOCATION	returned to
France	LOCATION	.

		After thanking
Napoleon	PERSON	for his liberty , he re - tired to his estates .

		He was offered many po - sitions under the government , and refused them all , saying to Napoleon : '' The silence of my retreat is the maximum of my deference ; if
Bonaparte	PERSON	wishes to serve liberty , I am devoted to him ; but I can not approve of an arbitrary government , nor associate myself with it . ''

		He maintained the same attitude in subsequent con - versations with him .

		When some courtier said to
Napoleon	PERSON	that
Lafayette	LOCATION	was talking against him , '' Let that man alone , '' said
Napoleon	PERSON	; '' he has said more to my face than he will ever say behind my back . ''

		It was no false idol that the fathers of our Republic set up in
Lafayette	LOCATION	; and as long as pure character , consistent conduct , and noble sacrifice shall be admired , his memory , here , at least , will be honored .

		A NEW BOOK ox SHAKESPEARE .

		* '' Will it do to say anything more about Chaucer ? ''

		The question was put some time since by the late Professor of Belles Lettres at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		He thought -LRB- very fortunately for us -RRB- that it would do .

		Probably many people put the same question concerning
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, whenever they see a new book of
Shakespear	PERSON	- ian criticism .

		And yet it is fortunate for us that Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	thought it would do to say something more about Shakespeare .

		A good many books serve as bricks with which people succeed in building up a solid wall between themselves and the object of their study .

		This book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	serves a very different purpose .

		Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	has tried , to use his own words , '' to see Shakspere , so far as possible at this distance of time , as he saw himself . ''

		In this there seems at first nothing very out of the way , nothing which would mark a book out from many other studies of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , if you think of it , the task is not at all easy .

		Of course there is now at hand much whereby one may arrange the matter of historical perspect - ive , but in this case that is the least difficulty .

		The real difficulty is that people have got into the way of regarding Shakespeare as a phe - nomenon so out of the ordinary course of things that they never really think seriously of seeing him as he saw himself .

		Most people , and most critics too , feel about Shakespeare as did that noted man who had the plays bound like a fam - ily Bible and lettered '' The Inspired Book . ''

		He had a special table for it in the reception - room , with a marble top , I believe .

		The no - tion is fatal to the best criticism .

		It has usually been the order of the day to feel that if there were anything in the plays that we did not ad - mire or understand , it was our own fat-witted - ness that blinded us .

		Many people will dislike to give up this idea : it had , to say the least , the charm of simplicity a paramount excel - lence with most folks when ideas are in ques - tion .

		Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	, however , is very modern .

		He handles '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' with no more reverence than if it were
First Chron	ORGANIZATION	- icles . ''

		As an artist , '' he remarks of it , '' of course ,
Shakspere	ORGANIZATION	's task was to distract at - tention from the absurdity of his plot . ''

		Such boldness startles one .

		But after the first shock is over , it is found to be refreshing .

		There might be danger of running into mere imperti - * WILLIAM SHAKSPERE .

Barrett Wendell	PERSON	.

		New York
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, nence .

		But Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	probably found no especial need of guarding himself in this re - spect ; his book is modern , and scholarly too .

		To follow out his plan , Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	keeps two ideas well in the mind of the reader .

		First , he never forgets that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays were always produced for the pleasure of the au - dience of an Elizabethan theatre .

		That gives them an element which must be reckoned with , although it is circumstantial in character .

		Then , quite as important to realize , the man who suc - ceeded in pleasing the Elizabethans was a poet '' of first-rate genius , '' a man who worked out his conceptions according to the different im - pulses of an emotional life and an artistic tem - perament .

		On these lines is the problem worked out ; and as a result we have a book which , while it is neither an exposition of the Shake - spearian theory on the conduct of life , nor a statement of the Shakespearian practice in blank verse , delineation of character , and devel - opment of plot , does give us a conception -LRB- which we instinctively recognize as well founded -RRB- of the growth of the poet 's genius .

		Such a book will of course be compared with the somewhat similar study of Mr.
Dowden	PERSON	; and it may at once be said that neither book loses by the comparison .

		Mr.
Dowden	PERSON	's book was called '' Shakspere : His Mind and Art , '' but -LRB- if one can for a moment make the separa - tion -RRB- it said most about the former subject .

		Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	has more to say of the latter .

		In other words , while Mr.
Dowden	PERSON	exhibits in a profoundly interesting way a development of thought and feeling , Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	has succeeded rather better in showing the artistic character of that development . ''

		That the development which we are trying to fol - low is rather artistic than personal , however , we can not too strenuously keep in mind .

		The details of
Shak	PERSON	- spere 's private life , quite undiscoverable nowadays , are , after all , no one 's business .

		For the rest , nobody fa - miliar with the literature and the stage of his time can very seriously believe that in writing his plays he gen - erally meant to be philosophical , ethical , didactic .

		Like any other playwright , he made plays for audiences .

		He differed from other playwrights chiefly in the fervid depth of his artistic nature . ''

		One need not go the whole length with Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	and insist that the artistic side of the poet is the only one with which we have any concern .

		But it is undoubtedly a matter of absorbing interest . ''

		Our business , after all , '' says Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	, '' is not to fathom the depths of Hamlet , but only to assure ourselves of Ham - let 's relation to
Shakspere	ORGANIZATION	's development as an artist . ''

		That makes very clear just what we may expect ; we may desire something be - sides , but we must acknowledge the immense value of this particular acquisition .

		Mr.
Wen	PERSON	- dell leaves us in no doubt of his views upon certain possible additions . ''

		The unanswerable question which that last sugges - tion raises , however , as to whether
Beatrice	PERSON	and
Cleo	PERSON	- patra be different portraits of the same living woman who inspired the Sonnets , is impertinent .

		The
Shak	PERSON	- spere with whom we may legitimately deal is not the man , who has left no record of his actual life , but the artist , who has left the fullest record of his emotional experience .

		To search for the actual man is at once unbecoming and futile . ''

		It will probably occur to many that there is some middle ground between an aesthetic ap - preciation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's artistic nature and a prying curiosity into
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's personal affairs .

		To my mind , Mr.
Dowden	PERSON	's book represents such a mean , for it seems to me to give us Shakespearian thought in a way , almost abstract , which is not exactly artistic nor per - sonal .

		But the subject of this book is Shakespeare as an artist .

		And , fortunately , Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	has a very accurate power of appreciating the artistic nature .

		He has much that is very sug - gestive to say , in one place and another , as to what sort of man an artist is . ''

		In an artist of whatever kind , '' he remarks , '' a period of vigorous creative imagination declares itself after a fashion which people who are not of artistic temperament rarely understand . ''

		It is a pity , perhaps , but they do not .

		Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	has a good deal to say which may be of help .

		It is unnecessary to try to convey in a few words the net result of such a book .

		Yet a single quotation will do something to show into what conception Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	's method works itself out . ''

		Quite apart from its lasting literary value , apart , too , from its unique personal quality , the work of
Shak	ORGANIZATION	- spere has new interest to modern students as a complete individual example of how fine art emerges from an archaic convention , fuses imagination with growing sense of fact , and declines into a more mature convention where the sense of fact represses and finally stifles the force of creative imagination . ''

		There is a great deal more that one would like to say about the book .

		Its whole atmos - phere , its tone , is characteristic and agreeable ; its many bits of particular criticism are almost always put with a very nice touch .

		There may be a few whose ideas will be made no clearer by a comparison with the relations of
Fanny Ellsler	ORGANIZATION	and the Due de Reichstadt , or even with the career of
Louis Philippe 's Due de Choiseul-Praslin	ORGANIZATION	.

		But these characters are , to
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 tell the truth , kept far in the background and rarely intrude upon us .

		There are many charm - ing obiter dicta not the least of which is the remark that
Portia	PERSON	is '' an exquisite type of that unhappily rare kind of human being who is produced only by the union of high thinking and high living . ''

		Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	has produced an excellent and thoroughly modern book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		And when we say it is modern , we mean , not that it is new-fangled , nor that it is questionable , nor that it is flippant .

		We mean that it enables us to enjoy
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in a way that was im - possible to our grandfathers and grandmothers .

		SOCIAL , PROGRESS IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* The history of
England	LOCATION	is the history of European civilization , and in a sense the his - tory of humanity .

		Within the space of a thou - sand years her people have advanced from a condition of almost absolute barbarism to the front rank in culture and refinement .

		She has occupied this advanced position for several cen - turies .

		But in
the thirteenth century England	DATE	was far behind
Spain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and the other con - tinental countries , in all those arts of life which go to make up a highly developed society .

		The bulk of her population still lived in mud huts , cultivated only small strips of land which were held under feudal tenure , knew little and cared less for the outside world , were scattered over a sparsely settled territory , and had little music , no art , and only the modicum of literature which was offered in church chronicles .

		To - day her people are better fed , better clothed , better housed , better educated , better governed , and enjoy more of the comforts of life , than those of any other European country .

		To un - derstand this progress , the causes underlying it and making it in a sense necessary , and the conditions rendering it possible , is to under - stand the law of social progress and gain the key to the history of the race .

		We are no longer in doubt as to what con - stitutes real progress .

		parison of institutions and societies which is both exact and clear .

		Whatever be the cause , progress is the process by which the relatively complex grows out of the relatively simple or - ganization ; it consists of a series of changes in the structure , functions , and organs of the unit .

		Progress is the passing from simple , in - coherent , indefinite homogeneity , to complex , coherent , definite heterogeneity .

		At one end of the story stand the organisms having few parts , loosely held together , and but slightly related , while at the other are found bodies .

		having many intimately connected organs which depend entirely on each other for the full per - formance of their several functions .

		The char - acteristics of the process are a specialization of function , an integration and differentiation of parts , and a consequent complexity of struct - ure .

		It is the peculiar merit of the work that has been undertaken by Mr.
Traill	PERSON	and his co - laborers that the ideal set before them is the scientific explanation of
England	LOCATION	's progress , and the critical examination of the relation be - tween cause and effect in the several depart - ments of social life .

		They have undertaken to write English history on Darwinian lines ; forgetting dynastic struggle , court intrigue , diplomacy , and war , they have given the nar - rative of the material , moral , and intellectual progress of the people , and of the career of the English people as a society , '' not as a Polity , nor as a State among States . ''

		It deals with the manners and customs of the succeeding periods , with ways of thinking and feeling , with the art of getting a living .

		The work is almost encyclopaedic in character , but is in no way a compilation .

		It is more nearly a series of short excellent treatises by eminent specialists on the various phases of social life : on trade and agriculture , art and architecture , on language and literature , public health , mor - als , manners , the development of jurisprudence , the church , the army , the navy , science , edu - cation , religion , and the action and reaction between these different elements of our civili - zation .

		It is a stupendous task , and one which in - creases in difficulty as the story advances , and the accumulating facts grow too various in character to be massed together without risk of confusion . ''

		New activities arise which refuse to class them - selves under the old headings .

		Divisions of the subject throw off subdivisions , which themselves require later on to be further subdivided .

		In every department of our national life there is the same story of evolutionary growth continuous in some of them , intermittent in 16 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Industries multiply and ramify ;
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	begets child after child ; Art , however slowly in this country -LSB-
England	LOCATION	-RSB- as compared with others , diversifies its forms ; Learning breaks from its mediaeval tutelage and enters upon its world-wide patrimony ; Literature , after achieving a poetic utterance the most noble to which man has ever attained , perfects a prose more powerful than that of any living compet - itor , and more flexible than all save one ; and finally , Science , latest of birth , but most marvellous of growth , rises suddenly to towering stature , stretches forth its hundred hands of power , extending immeasurably the reach of human energies , and , through the reaction of a transformed external life upon man 's inner nature , profoundly and irreversibly , if still to some extent ob - scurely , modifies the earthly destinies of the race .

		What may be called the distribution of em - phasis thus becomes the greatest difficulty for the editor to overcome .

		It is therefore natural that just here the work should fall far short of the ideal .

		The various essays must inevitably differ widely in originality and in style , which is perhaps a happy incident of composite au - thorship .

		Some writers have assumed too much , while others have taken too little for granted , or have filled their pages with tedious quota - tions and long extracts from illustrative docu - ments instead of giving scientific conclusions based on a thorough study of the sources of historic information .

		Not infrequently a writer is guilty of speaking with that tone of authority which conveys the idea of absolute finality of judgment , while others leave their subject con - fessedly incomplete .

		All of these , however , are very minor defects when compared with the general result .

		Treating each department of social life in sev - eralty , it is true , has inevitably entailed a cer - tain amount of repetition ; but this need not have been allowed to be utterly superfluous , as is the reference to the '' great discontent among the la - boring classes , '' on page 270 of Volume II. , fol - lowing as it does an excellent account of this rebellion under Wat Tyler which is given by Mr.
Corbett	PERSON	a few pages earlier .

		Still less was it necessary that the statement of fact by different writers in the same volume be contradictory , as are the references to the
Black Death	ORGANIZATION	on pages 13 and 133 of the second volume .

		This is peculiarly unfortunate in view of the very contradictory opinions still held regarding even the general character of this fourteenth century and the importance of the Black Death as evi - dence of the preceding and as cause of the suc - ceeding condition of agriculture and of labor - ers .

		Was it in truth the golden age of the English laborer -LRB-
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , or a period of un - mitigated disaster , in which there were few years unmarked by famine and pestilence -LRB- Den - ton -RRB- ?

		The writer on
Public Health	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Creigh	PERSON	- ton , speaks with great vigor and acumen con - cerning the condition early in the century ; but unfortunately he is allowed , or has chosen to use , barely a page .

		It seems almost ungracious , however , thus to indicate possible faults and shortcomings , and apparently disparage a work of such marked excellence one which as a whole is so admir - ably well done , being conceived on the highest plan and executed with consummate skill .

		When completed , the work will include the results of the most advanced learning in English scientific circles regarding
England	LOCATION	's history .

		It will unquestionably be the best as well as the latest history , telling the whole story in the way best calculated to enforce the truth as to the causes of social progress and the real condition of ad - vancing civilization .

		The development of legal institutions and of jurisprudence is traced by the hand of a master ; the progressive expan - sion of industry and of commerce , the history of agriculture and its influence on the habits of the people , the action and reaction between the wants of the people and their economic movement , is sketched by economists who still utter the supply-and-demand shibboleth , but who nevertheless recognize the importance of '' a living wage '' and of the standard of liv - ing and social habits of the mass of the pop - ulation as affording the market which must in the long run determine the character of a coun - try 's production ; the gradual spread of educa - tion from the few monks who alone knew how to write in
Norman England	LOCATION	, to the farthest corner of
England	LOCATION	and to the lowest level of English society , the advance in the arts and sciences , and the increase in enlightenment through university , grammar school , and vari - ous associations for the advancement of science , the growth of language and literature , each phase of the intellectual development is treated separately and with a view to show its connec - tion with and influence on '' the progress of the people . ''

		Each chapter closes with an essay on manners and customs , which js apparently writ - ten by the editor , and seeks to give unity , con - tinuity , and logical completeness to the whole , and to show how industrial , intellectual , and religious forces register their influence in the social life of the people , in the dress , the amusements , the house and its decoration , meth - ods of eating and drinking , the literature and song , the every-day ways of living .

		The story begins with
England	LOCATION	before the
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 English when the earliest settler , the dark Ibernian , had been overcome by the tall and fair-hued Celt , and this Aryan tribesman , '' With his pride of race and his more advanced concep - tion of property as a subject not of common but of fam - ily ownership , had declined to the condition of a despised villager , so far as social and political importance were concerned ; the tribal chief had grown into the tribal king ; the free land of the tribe , alike with the common land of the villagers , had become tributary to him ; and the two communities , family and communistic , were alike his subjects .

		It was through the strife of tribal kings , with its consequence of the flight , the exile , and the appeal for Roman assistance of those who had been worsted in the struggle , that the way was opened for the conquest of
Britain	LOCATION	to the conquerors of Gaul ... Dim with the dust of centuries , yet still distinctly vis - ible in dialect and tradition , in boundary lines of shire and diocese , and in the strange survivals of prehistoric feud , the tribal divisions of
Celtic England	LOCATION	can still be traced , while the rule of the Roman has been forgotten , even where his villa and his storied gravestone remain . ''

		-LRB- I. , xxii.-xxiii . -RRB-

		In the second volume the progress of events is traced down through the Middle Ages and into the beginnings of modern
England	LOCATION	, when the
Church	ORGANIZATION	had passed its climax of prosperity and independence . ''

		Henceforth it prepares its own downfall by an even closer connection with the royal power .

		That royal power itself was beginning to show the influence of those theories and those events which were soon to cover all
Europe	LOCATION	with absolutist sovereignties .

		The new commercial classes , in whose support this absolutism was to find its practical basis , begin to manifest them - selves .

		Most rapid change of all , the feudal baronage had been , even in the preceding century , transforming itself into a modern nobility , intriguing for places and pensions , instead of taking up arms for local independ - ence . ''

		-LRB- II. , 277-278 . -RRB-

		The all-important lesson taught by these vol - umes is that development has been continuous and that there have been 110 violent breaks in the narrative , each succeeding social stage grow - ing naturally out of the preceding conditions through the action of forces of which it is pos - sible to measure the power for good and evil .

		Even the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	is no cataclasm .

		The break is more apparent than real .

		It is true '' the central administration and the local government , temporal and spiritual , had been taken over by a new set of men better man - agers , keener , more unscrupulous , less drunken and quarrelsome , better trained , hardier , thrift - ier , more in sympathy with the general
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean movements , more adventurous , more tem - perate . ''

		But it is equally true that the '' Nor - man conqueror built upon the main lines of that civil organization which he found in existence at his coming , and widely as the ' elevation ' of the completed structure may have departed from the prospective ideal of the
Saxon	PERSON	archi - tect , the ground plan remains his . ''

		Equally in evidence is the fact that it is im - possible to give definite boundary to the Mid - dle Ages .

		Commercial growth brings consti - tutional changes , and constitutional changes in turn favor commercial growth ; but in neither is there a sharp line between medisevalism and modern life .

		The reign of
Henry VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		is a period of transition ; it is marked by new ideas and new influences . ''

		But they are only as yet in germ .

		The printing - press is at work ; but its first result is destructive , almost paralysing to literature .

		America is found , both South and North ; but the effect on English industry and com - merce is hardly marked until
Elizabeth	PERSON	's reign .

		The new learning had made its way to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	with
Colet	PERSON	and
Erasmus	PERSON	; but no breath of hostility can yet be de - tected against Church dogmas . ''

		There is no sudden change , nor is the course of development a chapter of happy accidents .

		Each advance on social organization has its dis - tinct cause or set of causes , and telling the story of human progress is as definitely a science as is recounting changes in the physical structure of the earth , the movements of the heavenly bodies , or the way chemical forces combine to produce very unlike substances out of the same elements .

		It is a science , moreover , whose laws can not be broken with impunity .

		Humanity is slow in learning the lesson , but even a hasty reading of these pages should convince pessi - mistic reformers that no scheme of social pro- gress is worth a moment 's consideration which implies a sudden and radical regeneration of human nature , or which involves artificial ap - pliances outside the steady development of the wants and desires of mankind .

		Change is the law of life ; but it is change that is slow and gradual , and which comes practically through the almost unconscious action of forces lying deeply buried in human nature .


ARTHUR B. WOODFORD	PERSON	.

		EDWIX BOOTH 'S BETTERS .

		* When , a little time ago , Mr.
William Win	PERSON	- ter 's biography of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	came into hand and was read with a grateful sense of its ade - quacy by the admirers and friends of the great actor , it was supposed no superior memorial of that troubled genius would likely be added to our literature .

		A tender intimacy of many years ' duration between the two distinctly gifted * EDWIN BOOTH : Recollections by his daughter ,
Edwina Booth Grossman	PERSON	, and letters to her and his friends .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, men had qualified the critic to be the best proc - tor of the actor ; and the appreciative estimate of the professional achievements of the player was sweetened and enriched by a sympathetic knowledge of the man expressed in a tribute honorable alike to the memory of the dead and to the reputation of the living friend .

		But filial affection guiding the intelligence of an accomplished woman has done even more for the public 's gratitude in withdrawing , gently , tenderly , and with touching simplicity , the veil of privacy that guarded the domestic and per - sonal life of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, for the first time permitting his countrymen to view this chief glory of the American stage in the light of a character so fine and a nature so earnest , un - selfish , and devout , that admiration of the genius must hereafter be associated with loving regard of the man , so famous and yet so little known for what he was in heart and soul .

		Mrs.
Grossman	PERSON	's unaffectedly , almost art - lessly , written recollections of her father com - pose one of the most exquisitely beautiful and graciously impressive pictures of character to be found in literature ; and though there is but a detail here and there , though the few pages are mainly generalizations covering memories from the infancy to the mature womanhood of the writer , these , with the letters penned with no expectation that they would ever find their way to the printing press , must be accepted as a better and truer portraiture of the man than may be found in the most voluminous biograph - ical narrative .

		One yields so completely to the charm of Mrs.
Grossman	PERSON	's candor of love and pride as to enter feelingly into the spirit and sentiment of her own mind , moved by her emotions , animated by her spirit of affection , until , reading here and there among the letters , one feels how precious a thing it was to be near to the heart and close in the life of such a man .

		It is a new understanding of
Booth	LOCATION	, an under - standing that gives new dignity and worth , and brings the reader nearer in sentiment to the actor whose work we have viewed in silent awe or approved in tumultuous applause , little think - ing how much of mildness , diffidence , sweetness and sadness of spirit lay below the noble forces expended in the creation of characters that ranged from the boisterous mirth of Petruchio to the sublime madness of
Lear	PERSON	, and had in them all the passions of nature .

		We have known him in the craft , cunning , and knavery of lago ; in the woful melancholy and sombre philosophy of Hamlet ; in the frank , open but subtly abused honesty and generosity of Othello ; in the ambition-corrupted nobility of
Macbeth	LOCATION	; in the piteous bitterness of the laughing , rail - ing , mordant Bertruchio ; in the masterly counterpart of the age-broken and ingratitude - maddened Lear ; in the jocundity of gay and sportive roles ; we perhaps have known him in the easy moments when permitted friends have shared the pleasures of free and bantering , jest-enlivened conversation , with no more se - roius care than to keep cigars alight ; but here from his daughter 's pen is a picture of him as few , indeed , have known him : '' His nature was childlike , trustful , dependent , yet he was always my wise and loving counselor .

		How often would he quote the following adage to me : ' If your lips you 'd keep from slips , Of these five things beware : Of whom you speak , To whom you speak , And how , and when , and where . '

		He was essentially paternal and purely domestic ; and these qualities were never tarnished by public favor or worldly praise .

		In the home he was at his best among his favorite pipes and books , and surrounded by his Lares and
Penates	PERSON	.

		He loved personally to arrange the furnishings of his home , and carefully studied its merest details .

		He had a woman 's taste , and his artistic touch was every - where evident .

		His delight in adorning the home never led him into extravagant display , for his tastes were al - ways simple , and he had no love for ostentation ... With boyish enthusiasm he enjoyed every detail of farm life , and loved nothing better than to watch the growth of the trees he himself had planted .

		His love of ani - mals amounted , at one time , almost to a passion ... His loyalty to his friends , his reverence and considera - tion for the old , no matter in what station of life , and his manifold charities to the poor and needy , were not the least among his many virtues .

		His modesty in bestow - ing favors extended itself even to the members of his family , and his beautiful gifts to me were offered with a tender , shy reserve ... His unselfish devotion to his mother and invalid sister were -LSB- sic -RSB- conspicuous among his domestic traits .

		He was a loyal and devoted husband , and on many occasions , after the play , I have seen him tenderly nurse his invalid wife -LRB- to whom he was mar - ried in
1869	DATE	-RRB- , thus losing his much-needed rest .

		When scandalous tongues attacked the privacy of his home , he refused to contradict the false reports circulated , and invariably replied to my earnest protestations , ` My daughter , all will yet be well . '

		His dignity toward his detractors won for him a host of defenders .

		My inti - mate knowledge of his heroic sacrifices , his early strug - gles and privations , his crushing sorrow and bitter dis - appointments , had made my father a hero in my eyes , and I admire his noble manhood even more ardently than I cherish his genius ... His veneration for all religious subjects , his belief in the immortal life , his practical uses of the teachings of Jesus , and his convic - tion that God 's will is best , never forsook him even in the midst of his severest trials ; and though often the victim of the basest deception from so-called friends , who , in not a few instances cruelly imposed upon his trustful , generous nature , he remained almost childlike in his belief in the integrity of others .

		... I can - not speak without tears of the declining weeks of his beautiful life of his gentle patience during his last ill -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 ness -LRB- of seven weeks ' duration -RRB- , and of the childlike beauty of his countenance when all furrows of care and sorrow were smoothed away , and ' nothing could touch him further . '

		His last coherent words were addressed to our little children , whom we had taken to his bedside two days before he died .

		My boy called gently , ' How are you , dear grandpa ? '

		and the answer came loud and clear , in the familiar boyish way , ' How are you your - self , old fellow ? ' ''

		Exquisitely beautiful as is this picture of manly nobility and spiritual sweetness of char - acter , it is not merely the partial and affection - colored view of an only and tenderly , fondly cherished daughter .

		There is in the goodly num - ber of letters , written to mirthful impulse , or with serious emotion , or in strangely mel - ancholy but never wholly despondent vein , through a period of thirty years , scarcely one that does not in its measure confirm , in its sen - timent , in its candor , in its ingenuous sincere tone , the truth of this ideal .

		But the picture would be incomplete without some associated touches from the life of the woman , love of whom gave lofty purpose to the soul of Booth , grief for whose untimely sudden death very nearly betrayed to irredeemable desolation the genius that is so lustrous a part of
America	LOCATION	's pride of intellectual , artistic achievement .


Mary Dev	PERSON	- lin was the object of Booth 's first impassioned , romantic , exalted love , a love that was only `` this side idolatry . ''

		That she merited the ador - ation he gave to her is not to be questioned .

		Though she was no more than a girl when they were married , the dignity of her character , the generous quality of her nature , and the high di - rection of her exceptionally clear , pure , and lofty mind , fitted her perfectly to be the com - panion , comforter , guide , and sustaining in - spiration of a man whom the very nature of his genius made dependent upon some finer stim - ulus than his own too easily discouraged ambi - tion .

		What her influence upon him was , what herself must have been to him in the three swiftly speeding years of their blissful but earn - est union , this excerpt from one of her letters to him will sufficiently declare .

		It was written just before they were married , and is at once a hope for herself and a promise to him , both of which were happily fulfilled of time : '' This morning in my walk , I was thinking of the be - ing God had given me to influence and cherish , for you have ever seemed to me like what
Shelley	PERSON	says of him - self ' a phantom among men ' ' compauionless as the last fading storm , ' and yet my spirit ever seems lighter and more joyous when with you .

		This I can account for only by believing that a mission has been given me to fulfil , and that I shall be rewarded by seeing you rise to be great and happy . ''

		Ah !

		the angels surely will rejoice in heaven when that is achieved .

		Edwin , I have never told you yet , have I , of all the odd thoughts I have had , and do have , about you ?

		Well , on some of the days to come , when I am influenced by your loved presence , and after the singing of some pretty song , perhaps I will tell you . ''

		Among all the letters written by
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, none sets the man before us so clearly , so humanly , so compassionately , and yet so ad - mirably and lovably , as that of
March 3 , 1863	DATE	, addressed to his friend , Captain
Adam Badeau	PERSON	, beginning thus : '' By the time this reaches you , you will perhaps have heard of the terrible blow I have received a blow which renders life aimless , hopeless , darker than it was before I caught the glimpse of heaven in true devotion to her , the sweetest being that made man 's home a something to be loved .

		My heart is crushed , dryed up and desolate .

		I have no ambition now , no one to please , no one to cheer me ... You can feel my agony I know , and if while I was happy I failed to keep you advised of my whereabouts and doings , you see I think of you in my misery , and seek to pour out my flood of grief where I know it will not be despised .

		I should not complain even in my gulf of woe , for surely God is just , is good , is wiser than we , and nothing has ever so im - pressed me with the truth of this as
Mollie	PERSON	's death ... They tell me that time and use will soften the blow , and I shall grow to forget her .

		God forbid !

		My grief , keen as it is and crushing , is still sweet to me ; for it is a part of her ... What can I do or look upon that will not remind me of her ?

		All things I loved or admired she took delight in ; my acting was studied to please her , and after I left the theatre , and we were alone , her ad - vice was all I asked , all I valued .

		If she was pleased I was satisfied ; if not , I felt a spur to prick me on to at - tain the point ... Does n't it seem hard that one so young , so full of life , devotion , and promise should go so suddenly ?

		Would to God I were there with her .

		But I suppose that 's wrong ; I suppose I will be there shortly ... Madness would be a relief to me , and I have often thought that I stood very near to the brink of it .

		... God bless you , Ad !

		Be brave and struggle , but set not your heart on anything in this world .

		If good comes to you take it and enjoy it ; but be ready al - ways to relinquish it without a groan . ''

		It is only during the period of his immoder - ate grief , the influence of which was never wholly cast off , that the letters are in gloomy , sombre vein .

		Knowing how much melancholy was by nature in the mood of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, one is surprised , indeed , by the frequency with which humor , drollery , and a boyishness of capering fancy , got into his letters .

		He had a keen sense of the ludicrous , and comical conceits crop up continuously , while the jaunty air with which he disposes of all sorts of friendly and even business interests informs one how charming , how delightful a companion he must have been in some snugly comfortable corner , with close , familiar friends about him , his cheerful pipe sending coils of gray and azure smoke to wreathe themselves lazily into quaint and del - icate fancies above his head .

		Averse to society , 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, .

		he loved his friends , and from the first of these letters written to his prattling baby girl in the style so well known of fond parents address - ing their tempered wisdom to infant minds to the last , written to the Shakespearian scholar , Mr.
Horace Furness	PERSON	, whether the mood be grave or gay , the kindly , generous , loyal heart shines through , a temper wonderfully level with the spirit of charity that casts out malice .

		The let - ters indicate a man of taste , refinement , and artistic culture ; a mind above the gross de - mands of material success ; a soul that a trying , temptation-beset profession could not divert from its religious singleness ; a devotion to art ; sincerity of purpose ; and above all a spirit '' that fortune 's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks . ''

		These recollections and letters give us a wel - come addition to our knowledge of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, and one of inestimable value to theat - rical literature , besides being in themselves in - expressibly charming for an evening 's reading and for the after solace of many a tedious hour when the times seem out of joint .

		They teach a great lesson of charity and forbearance ; and there are those whose mission it is to teach God 's word , may learn something of benevolence , lov - ing kindness , and broad humanity , from the let - ters of our dead player .

		present-day problems is a noticeable feature of the work .

		Education , property , corporations , transpor - tation , taxation , money , criminals , pauperism , cities , the family , the church , international relations , these are the themes of successive chapters .

		The fundamental thesis of Professor
Hoffman	PERSON	's political science is the absolute and indivisible sovereignty of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is essentially the view taken by
Burgess	PERSON	and others .

		It is undoubtedly correct , if by sovereignty one means sovereignty within the sphere of human law .

		But the last word has not yet been said on this vital topic .

		The broad and vigorous view which the author takes of current questions is interesting .

		He holds that the earth belongs to civilization , and that the organized State may very properly do for the welfare of its mem - bers many things besides police duty .

		This is very far from the once dominant doctrine of laissez faire a doctrine which meant in substance simply `` every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost . ''

		The modern State is not organized socialism , but it is in fact highly socialistic .

		Perhaps it might bet - ter be called '' the cooperative State , '' in contradis - tinction from the other form .

		And it is this kind of
State	ORGANIZATION	which operates the common means of com - munication , which may operate means of transporta - tion , which provides education , cares for the poor and the insane , and in many other ways works for the general welfare .

		It is this kind of
State	ORGANIZATION	, too , , which may logically join with others in the interest of humanity to compel a semi-barbarous State to de - cent government .

		Common humanity should , for example , lead the civilized world to put an end , once for all , to the hideous farce known as the gov - ernment of
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		A government which can not or will not prevent such horrors as the Bulgarian outrages in
1876	DATE	and the Armenian horrors of
1894	DATE	is clearly unfit to exist .

		In short , the cooperative
State	ORGANIZATION	and cooperative States are the means which men are using to make life better worth living .

		They are not open to the reproach of paternalism .

		That was a phase of the personal autocracies which have now all but disappeared from the world .

		Coopera - tive democracies have taken their place .

		And it is this modern form of
State	ORGANIZATION	which Mr.
Hoffman	PERSON	pre - sents so cleverly .

		Mr.
Charles Borgeaud	PERSON	, in his little study of '' The Rise of Modern Democracy , '' tries to trace the ori - gin of that democratic movement which now dom - inates political society .

		He finds its germ in the Protestant Reformation , its early buds in the En - glish Puritan uprising of the seventeenth century .

		Mr.
Borgeaud	PERSON	shows very clearly that the Re - formation in both its phases was essentially demo - cratic .

		This was not clearly seen by many of the leaders .

		Luther and
Calvin	PERSON	were not democrats , either in religion or politics .

		The English eccle - siastical revolution under
Henry	PERSON	and
Edward	PERSON	and
Elizabeth	PERSON	was very conservative , and was not in - tended by its promotors to pass beyond an effective control .

		It was only under
John Knox	PERSON	in
Scotland	LOCATION	, and under the extreme Puritans who fought the
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 Stuart kings , that a real democracy was apparent .

		In truth , the popes and the kings who assailed Pro- testantism on the continent , as aimed at the very thrones of pontiff and monarch , were more far-see - ing than the reformers themselves .

		And when
James I.	PERSON	flouted the Puritan petitioners at
Hampton Court	ORGANIZATION	, he realized acutely , as did few others , the extreme danger to his royal prerogative coming from these simple-minded and pious people .

		The logical mean - ing of the right of private judgment , on which were founded the religious revolutions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , was certainly the sov - ereignty of the people over the
State	ORGANIZATION	as well as over the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American Constitution and the French Revolution are in a very true sense direct sequents of Luther 's ninety-five theses at
Wittenberg	LOCATION	.

		Part of this , Mr.
Borgeaud	PERSON	makes quite plain .

		He points out how democratic were the parliamentary army of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, and the Puritan settlers in
Mass	LOCATION	- achusetts and
Connecticut	LOCATION	and
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		And the settlement of those colonies was a part of the same movement as that which cost
Charles I.	PERSON	his head .

		An apt illustration of these premature efforts at democratic reform in the
State	ORGANIZATION	is the '' Agree - ment of the People , '' which was proposed by a large body of the army , in
1647	DATE	, as a settlement of the difficulties .

		The king was a captive , but was still king , the house of lords was yet a part of parlia - ment , and it seemed far from certain that the fruits of the wars would not be lost .

		The '' Agreement '' was in fact a sketch of a republican constitution for
England	LOCATION	.

		It contained such features as the adop - tion of a written constitution which should include a bill of rights and definite limitations on the pow - ers of parliament , abolition of king and lords , equal electoral districts , universal suffrage , and biennial parliaments .

		All this was in advance of the age .

		It took
England	LOCATION	forty years to reach the bill of rights , a half century to adopt triennial parliaments -LRB- soon changed at that -RRB- , two centuries to compass electoral reforms , and king and lords are yet part of parliament .

		But the great features of the '' Agree - ment '' were in fact put into operation in the dem - ocratic American colonies , and finally embodied in the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		So it is quite correct to say that the meeting of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's regiments in
1647	DATE	, which voted the '' Agreement , '' was really a preliminary caucus of which the Con - vention over which
Washington	LOCATION	presided in
1787	DATE	did the finished work .

		And
England	LOCATION	is slowly com - ing to the methods of American democracy .

		Mr.
Borgeaud	PERSON	is substantially right .

		Political democ - racy is a direct result of the overthrow of ecclesi - astical aristocracy .

		Dr.
Ellis Stevens	PERSON	's work on the '' Success of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	'' is devoted to the thesis of the English origin of the American Con - stitution .

		His task is not difficult to accomplish .

		The convention at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	did not evolve a frame of government from their own inner con - sciousness .

		They were a group of lawyers , judges , and statesmen , who knew quite clearly the defects of the Confederation , and used the material at hand in mending them .

		This material was the experi - ence of the several States , both as English colonies and as members of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and the English sys - tem of government and law .

		With all these things the convention were quite familiar .

		They knew that the quarrel of the colonists with
King George	PERSON	had been over what they deemed the essential rights of Englishmen .

		They were hardly likely to abandon these rights , or the accustomed means of guarding them , in the final structure of national government which was the outcome of the Revolution .

		And so it is not difficult to trace to an English origin , either directly or through the colonies , almost every clause of the Constitution .

		Incidentally , Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	de - votes considerable space to exhibiting the weakness of the claims of Mr.
Douglas Campbell	PERSON	in behalf of Dutch influence .

		Here again the author 's task is not difficult .

		Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's book is rather in - teresting than conclusive .

		That there was some result on American institutions by contact with the Dutch is quite possible .

		But just how much , and just what that result was , it would not be easy to estimate .

		The most striking part of Mr.
Stev	PERSON	- ens 's book is that devoted to the Executive .

		Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	brings out very clearly the really great power of the American President , and its quite di - rect derivation from the old form of English king - ship , as well as from the temporary revival of that form by
George III	PERSON	.

		An extended footnote details an interview of the author with the late ex-Presi - dent
Hayes	PERSON	, which gives an interesting view of American cabinet methods and of the very great ex - tent of executive powers , even as bearing on the ini - tiation and progress of legislation .

		The banking and currency measure now pending is a significant illus - tration .

		There is no doubt that Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	is in many ways a greater potentate than Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		We are a composite nation , to be sure .

		But our political organization and legal methods , like our national language , are undoubtedly English .

		The types have been rather unkind to Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	in a few instances . ''

		Cobbit '' for '' Cobbett '' on p. 144 , `` 1737 '' for `` 1787 '' on p. 146 , and '' Petition of Rights '' for '' Petition of Right '' on p. 207 , are cases in point .

		Otherwise the volume is a good ex - ample of bookmaking .

		Among the modern devices for putting the ma - terials of history within reach of scholars in general , that of making reprints of important documents is most valuable .

		Stubbs 's '' Select Charters '' is price - less to students of Old and Middle English institu - tions .

		Mr.
S. R. Gardiner	PERSON	's Selection of Docu - ments of the Puritan Revolution is also exceedingly useful .

		And now Mr.
G. W. Prothero	PERSON	has filled the gap between them by a series of reprints from the reigns of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	and James I .

		The Act of Su - premacy , for instance , is printed in full .

		Other documents are abbreviated more or less .

		Besides statutes , there are well-chosen extracts from the pro- ceedings of parliament , including the famous speech of
Peter Wentworth	PERSON	, for which that worthy wa 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, committed to the Tower ; there are executive docu - ments illustrative of constitutional tendencies of the times , taken from
Strype	LOCATION	,
Camden	LOCATION	, et al. ; there are not a few famous law cases reprinted
Bates	PERSON	's , and the impeachment of
Lord Bacon	PERSON	; and there is a mass of ecclesiastical documents .

		The selections are made with discretion , and are carefully indexed .

		The book well illustrates the modern method of his - torical study .

		At one time , not so long ago , his - tory was merely a branch of literature .

		It was read largely as a portion of '' polite letters , '' the main thing being literary style .

		To-day history is a branch of science .

		Literary finish is a desirable quality , but no more so than in a work on glaciers .

		The main thing is sound thought .

		And now no student is content to '' read '' history .

		He investigates .

		He wants the material from which a correct view of facts and their relations can be had .

		And he wants to work out this view for himself .

		In short , the modern student of history is quite like the intelli - gent reader of newspapers , who cares little for edi - torials , but wants all the news accurately reprinted .

		He can make his own comments .

		Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	's book gives a photographic reproduction of history in the making of a most important epoch in the development of the English people .

		With
Stubbs	PERSON	,
Prothero	PERSON	, and
Gardiner	PERSON	, one can study the
England of Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	and her pedantic Scotch cousin with some satisfaction . ''

		Common Sense Applied to Woman Suffrage '' is the title of a breezy little volume by Dr.
Mary Putnam-Jacobi	PERSON	.

		The author is learned and lucid and trenchant .

		But beyond all , she is unconsciously and deliciously convincing of the essential likeness of men and women .

		Men are quite apt to write one-sidedly .

		We call this partisanship .

		If we think with the writer , we like it .

		If we think otherwise , we rail at it .

		If we try to be even-minded , we won - der why a book should not be a scholar 's investiga - tion rather than an advocate 's plea .

		But then we know better .

		Books are written for all manner of reasons , sometimes for no discoverable reason at all .

		And this book is quite as partisan as a polit - ical editorial written by a mere man .

		That Woman Suffrage is coming there can be little doubt .

		In - deed , it is already here in some form .

		But whether we are ready to go on opening the ballot unreservedly to indiscriminate classes , is not so sure .

		Because an illiterate and fat-witted man may vote , is hardly a sound reason for granting that privilege to the same grade of woman .

		After the war we armed the freedmen with the ballot , for their self-defence .

		The outcome is hardly an irrefragable argument for unlimited suffrage .

		But if the ignorant sea-island negro may vote , why should the alert modern col - lege woman be unenfranchised ?

		Why , indeed ?

		Still , why should we enfranchise the ignorant sea-island negro woman ?

		This is the case in a nutshell .

		And would not the champions of a sexless vote be more helpful towards the political regeneration of which they dream , if at the same time they worked towards an intelligent and a responsible vote ?

		Mr.
D. S. Remsen	PERSON	, of the
New York	LOCATION	bar , devotes his little book on '' Primary Elections '' to a discus - sion of party organization and its improvement .

		His idea is to guard primary elections by an elab - orate system of provisions , substantially equivalent to an Australian ballot law with minority represen - tation .

		The main objection to his scheme is its complexity .

		Our whole body of democratic insti - tutions is tending to become a mechanism so vast and complicated that it may in the end require a tech - nical education to take any share in it .

		It is said that the President of the late
New York State	ORGANIZATION	Con - stitutional Convention was unable to mark his vote properly at the recent election .

		We are trying to remedy the evils of universal suffrage by ingenious self-acting devices .

		Perhaps we may learn in time some simple method which will do quite as well .

		Meanwhile , let us be rather slow in adding more cogs and wheels .

		Mr.
James Douglas	PERSON	discusses '' Canadian Inde - pendence ,
Imperial Federation	ORGANIZATION	, and Annexation , '' from a Canadian point of view .

		He argues that neither
Canada	LOCATION	nor the
United States	LOCATION	would have much to gain from a political union , while each would have not a little to lose .

		Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	is probably right .

		The idea of uniting in one great republic all
America	LOCATION	north of
Mexico	LOCATION	is one that tickles the fancy .

		But there are elements in the problem which can not be disregarded , and which at least admonish to make haste slowly .

		Certainly the status of the French in
Canada	LOCATION	is unlike anything with which we have to deal , and one which would be peculiarly annoying in our system .

		It is bad enough for us to be asked to make a state out of the Spanish peons in
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		But the
State of Quebec	ORGANIZATION	would hold such views of the relations of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	as would hardly accord with Amer - ican ideas .

		We do n't need
Canada	LOCATION	just now .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Memorials of
St. James 's Palace	ORGANIZATION	.

		The distinctive merits of first-rate English book-making are well exem - plified in two soberly elegant octavo volumes from the press of Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green	ORGANIZATION	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, entitled '' Memorials of St.
James	PERSON	's Palace . ''

		The author , the Rev.
Edgar Sheppard	PERSON	, Sub-Dean of the Chapels Royal , has spent several laborious years in the compilation of his work , pursuing his re - searches among the records of more or less remote royalty with a pious enthusiasm and a reverential sense of the semi-sacredness of his theme not very intelligible to the American mind , perhaps , but nevertheless interesting and instructive in its pres - ent results .

		Strange to say , in this age of never ending , ever multiplying books , the story of the whilom home of
England	LOCATION	's kings and queens , and the constituted centre of her court pageant and cere - monial , has never before been told in continuous
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 detail .

		Yet from time immemorial the
Palace of St. James	ORGANIZATION	's has been the cynosure of loyal British eyes , and its name has long been a potent one to conjure with in continental diplomatic circles .

		Scarcely a chamber , hall , or corridor in the venerable pile but has its curious and interesting personal or historical association .

		It contains , for instance , the room , of sombre memory to all leal Jacobitical souls , where
Charles I.	PERSON	slept away his last allotted hours beside the faithful
Herbert	PERSON	, and whence he passed , on that fatal frosty morning , ominous in the annals of mon - archy , to the scaffold at
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	.

		But St.
James	PERSON	's record -LRB- unlike that of grim Holyrood -RRB- is joyous rather than tragic mainly the chronicle of royal births , baptisms , and marriages , of shining court fetes and formalities , the whole pleasantly seasoned with a thousand and one odds and ends of piquant Walpolian chat and personalia .

		Into these and more important matters our author has gone exhaustively and enthusiastically , leaving no documentary stone unturned , and tracing the story of the Palace and its associations and regulations from the founding -LRB- before
A.D. 1100	DATE	-RRB- of its predecessor , a lepers ' hos - pital -LRB- '' spittle for mayden lepers , '' old
Howel	PERSON	calls it -RRB- dedicated to St.
James	PERSON	the Less , down to mod - ern times .

		Pictorially , the work is a notable one .

		There are eight full-page copper plates , mostly por - traits , besides a great number of full-page and text illustrations .

		Many of these are from rare originals in the Royal collections , and all are well chosen and germane to the text .

		More of the writings of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, The fourth volume of Mr.
Paul Lei	PERSON	- cester
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's collection of the Writ - ings of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- covers the period from
1784	DATE	to
1787	DATE	.

		Mr.
Jeffer	PERSON	- son as the representative in
Paris	LOCATION	of the new Re - public is an interesting figure .

		He was in a society thoroughly congenial to him , which he thought the most spirited , the most cultivated , and the most en - tertaining in the world .

		He had a penchant for spec - ulation , and
Paris	LOCATION	was the favorite resort of philos - ophers who had learned to respect and love one great American ,
Franklin	PERSON	, and who were delighted to add another American to their circle .

		If
Jeffer	PERSON	- son lacked the originality , profundity , and wit of
Franklin	PERSON	, his suggestiveness and enthusiasm suited the French temperament of the day , and kept alive the popular interest in the experiment in govern - ment across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Jefferson 's letters , whether written to ladies , men of letters , or statesmen , have a grace and charm suited to any age .

		He never lost an opportunity to extend the information about his own country , and to commend the virtues and happiness of his fellow countrymen as worthy of imitation .

		He was industrious in acquiring infor - mation as to new inventions and improvements in agriculture , which he communicated to his corre - spondents in the new world .

		Thus , we find him writing to
Edward Rutledge	PERSON	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
July 14 , 1787	DATE	: '' I was glad to find that the adoption of your rice to this market was considered worth attention , as I had supposed it .

		I set out from hence impressed with the idea the rice dealers here had given me , that the difference between your rice and that of Pied - mont proceeded from a difference in the machine for cleaning it .

		At
Marseilles	LOCATION	I hoped to know what the
Piedmont	LOCATION	machine was ; but I could find nobody who knew anything of it .

		I determined therefore to sift the matter to the bottom by cross - ing the Alps into the rice country .

		I found the ma - chine exactly such a one as you had described to me in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the year
1775	DATE	.

		There was but one conclusion to be drawn , to-wit , that the rice was of a different species , and I determined to take enough to put you in seed . ''

		This helpfulness was the best service
Jefferson	PERSON	could render his country - men at that time , and it shows the benevolent side of his character .

		English-German About a y ear a g Professor
Victor Comparative Henry of the University of Paris Grammar	ORGANIZATION	.

		published his '' Precis de Grammaire Compare'e de 1 ` Anglais et de PAllemand , '' and re - cently his own translation has appeared under the title '' Comparative Grammar of English and Ger - man '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book , as the preface points out , is intended to introduce ^ the comparative method to students having some knowledge of both languages , though for the English reader it will be intelligible after he has mastered the general out - lines of the grammatical structure of German .

		The author does not presuppose a knowledge of either Sanskrit or Greek , but deals with the subject simply from the Germanic side .

		The book includes a list of about forty of the most essential works on Ger - manic philology , and a short introduction on the classification and relation of the Germanic languages and dialects .

		The body of the work is divided into four parts , treating respectively Sounds , Words , Declension , and Conjugation .

		In the first division a brief survey of the elements of physiological pho - netics is followed by a study in which the vowels are traced back , by the inductive method , to their common prehistoric form .

		In a similar manner the laws of consonantal change are discussed .

		The treatment , though brief , is clear , and affords the beginner a presentation of the subject that is easily comprehended .

		The accepted results of recent Ger - man investigation are stated in such a way that the English-speaking student will find it advantageous to read what Professor
Henry	PERSON	has to say on the subject of Phonetics before taking up a work like
Sievers	ORGANIZATION	's Grundztige .

		The chapter , or rather section , on Words deals with the subject of derivation , and affords a systematic discussion of a subject upon which courses of lectures are frequently given at German universities , but upon which the literature that is useful to the beginner is meagre .

		Independ - ent of its scientific value , it affords the student an opportunity to enlarge and strengthen his German vocabulary ; for it exhibits clearly , and in a manner easily remembered , some of the most important points of agreement and difference between English THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, and German words .

		The two following sections deal with the inflections , and show the essentially Ger - manic structure of the English .

		The book concludes with an excellent index of English and of German words , the former containing some nine hundred entries and the latter a rather larger number .

		Va - rious errors in the French edition have been cor - rected .

		The work is satisfactorily printed , and the English is surprisingly idiomatic and accurate .

		All things considered , the work is an able and valuable one , and is unrivalled in English .

		The fourth volume of the '' Journal Snake Dance o f American Ethnology and
Archae	PERSON	- of the Indians .

		\ ology -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- continues the re - cords of the
Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological Expedition	ORGANIZATION	, and is a worthy successor to the previous volumes .

		It is dedicated `` to the memory of Mrs.
Mary Hemenway	PERSON	'' : a reminder of the loss to the world of a noble-hearted woman , liberal in her in - terested helpfulness of scientific work in
America	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Fewkes	PERSON	is the author of the volume , in the pre - paration of which he was assisted by Mr.
Owens	PERSON	and Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	.

		The chief author , deeply interested as he is in the comparative study of American In - dian Ceremonials , must have felt a special satisfac - tion in preparing this description of the famous
Snake Dance	ORGANIZATION	of the Mokis .

		The ceremony , which is celebrated but once in two years at any one pue - blo , was observed by Dr.
Fewkes	PERSON	at
Walpi	LOCATION	in
1891	DATE	and
1893	DATE	.

		The account given relates chiefly to the observance of
1891	DATE	, but is pieced out here and there with the later notes .

		A careful description of each stage of the nine days ' ceremony is presented ; uten - - sils , dress , gestures , songs , are minutely detailed ; illustrations help to clearness of understanding .

		No attempt is made to explain the significance of the ceremony , but the myth dramatized at one part of the performance is presented .

		This snake dance , in which living rattlesnakes are carried writhing in the mouths of the performers , has been for years a favor - ite subject with newspaper writers .

		But although some good material notably Captain
Bourke	PERSON	's book has been published , students will hail this carefully detailed account as perhaps the most valu - able contribution to the subject yet made .

		The living composers of
Germany	LOCATION	, The excellent series of '' Masters of Contemporary Music '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- has a new volume devoted to the living composers of
Germany	LOCATION	, written by Mr.
J. A. Fuller Maitland	PERSON	.

		A volume dealing with such names as
Brahms	PERSON	,
Bruch	PERSON	,
Goldmark	PERSON	,
Joachim	PERSON	, and
Clara Schumann	PERSON	, has a field of great interest , even though it be true , as the author thinks , that '' the tide of music which for so many years has favored
Germany	LOCATION	above all other nations seems almost at the ebb , at last . ''

		The enormous influence of Wag - ner upon the musical art of this century has in some ways repressed rather than stimulated the produc - tivity of his contemporaries in the same sphere of production ; German opera has indeed been marked by few works that can be called '' epoch-making . ''

		One living German composer , however , must be accorded a place among the immortals ,
Johannes Brahms	PERSON	, the defender of musical orthodoxy against the tendencies of the `` music of the future . ''

		In him no quality of greatness is lacking .

		His ideas are marked by grandeur , wealth , and originality ; he uses the old forms with ease and power , or devel - ops them into new organisms , full of suggestion and opportunity for his successors ; the greatest of his works are marked both by deep expression and ex - quisite beauty , and none of his writings are without signs of genius .

		Brahms 's principal works are dis - cussed and analyzed by Mr.
Maitland	PERSON	with great intelligence and sympathy .

		The portraits and bib - liography connected with each sketch are valuable features of the volume .

		`` Prose Fancies .

		Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's book of '' Prose Fancies '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is easy reading and gives the reader many pleasant moments .

		It is a pleasure not unmixed , for the good and the mediocre more than once join hands across the pages .

		If one could omit an unnecessary third or half of the volume he would have left a small handful of sketches whose charm is real .

		Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	, as one might surmise from the fine por - trait that faces the title-page , possesses a delicate fancy and clear insight .

		He is at his best , in this vol - ume , when he writes of serious things seen in the garb of graceful metaphor .

		His best mood is romantic , and when writing in that mood he produces some - thing that has the flavor of poetry and the outward form of art .

		Sometimes he turns out a sentence that penetrates quite through the surface ; as when he speaks of '' that delicate instinct for proportion , which is one of the most precious attributes of what we call a gentleman . ''

		Humor he has , too , which is pleasantest when it skims lightly over a subject ; the avowedly humorous pieces in the book smack - ing often of hack-work .

		The book has no one theme : the five and twenty sketches are unrelated , and range from facetious satire to thoughtful mus - ing on the Ewigiveibliche .

		If a common aim may be found , it is that the various papers protest against shams and unrealities .

		Repetitions and The many who feel that the more parallelisms in subtle effects of verse structure are English wrse .

		lef t un t ou ched by the ordinary met - rical analysis will open with interest a little volume by Professor
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	, entitled ''
Repeti	PERSON	- tions and Parallelisms in English Verse '' -LRB-
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Publishing Company -RRB- .

		These terms were used by
Longfellow	LOCATION	in writing of the characteristics of the verse -LRB- imitated from the Finnish -RRB- in his ''
Hia	ORGANIZATION	- watha '' ; but it is in
Poe	LOCATION	and
Swinburne	PERSON	that the wonderful poetical capabilities of repetition and par - allelism appear in their full development .

		Professor
Smith	PERSON	has traced the employment of these devices from the early ballads , through
Coleridge	PERSON	, to
Poe	PERSON	; and from
Poe	PERSON	, through Baudelaire , to
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 25 With an ear sensitive to catch the most delicate ef - fect , he at times , perhaps , tries to point out har - monies that do not exist ; but the reader will thank him for bringing out some hidden beauties that may have hitherto escaped him .

		No attempt is made to give a psychological explanation of the effects .

		Historical studies If Mr ''
CharleS Sea1	PERSON	' 8
Baldwin	PERSON	's In - of the English flections and Syntax of the Morte language .

		D'
Arthur	PERSON	'' is an earnest of what may be expected from
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's plan of co - operation with scholars in publishing works of special rather than of general interest , the publishers de - serve for this plan the thanks of the learned world .

		Mr.
Baldwin	PERSON	's book is a real contribution to the history of the English language , giving a clear state - ment , with copious and even exhaustive exemplifi - cation , of the main features of the language as fixed for the nonce in the usage of
Malory	LOCATION	.

		The sections treating of the verb ablaut , and of prepositions , are especially good .

		The faults of the book are not se - rious : the index should be fuller ; much might fitly have been treated here that has been left , presum - ably , to lexicography .

		The author 's commendable intention of editing selections from the '' Morte D' Arthur '' for school use will , when carried out , increase greatly the value of the present work .

		Mr.
William Blake	PERSON	's `` The Cross , The Cross as a Ancient and Modern '' -LRB-
Randolph	PERSON	-RRB- religious symbol .

		, .

		... . '

		gives much interesting information regarding the cross as a religious symbol .

		Part L , '' The Cross in the Orient , '' shows that it was used among the Early Aryans , the old Egyptians , Baby - lonians , Greeks , Scandinavians , and other pre-Chris - tian peoples .

		The various forms svastika , tau , etc. , are mentioned , and their meanings suggested .

		The Christian cross , and its variations in art , her - aldry , and architecture , are briefly considered .

		Part II. , '' The Cross in the Occident , '' presents the evi - dence regarding this symbol among North Amer - ican tribes before white settlement .

		The crosses of
Mexico	LOCATION	, of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	Mound-building tribes , etc. , are described .

		The style of the work is simple and readable , and the many illustrations more than a hundred add to the value of the book .

		Stratford ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
Stratford	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- is a thin volume of wood-cuts and pictured .

		and descriptive letter-press of which Mr.
Hallsworth Waite	PERSON	is the draughtsman and au - thor .

		The writing is interesting , and many of the sketches are decidedly good .

		Stratford and vicin - ity is the field of the artist 's pilgrimage , and the book records his impressions in simple prose and un - affected drawing .

		The eye for the picturesque is manifest , and if the sixty or more of illustrations never rise to brilliancy , they are never less than worthy of their theme .

		The book is a pleasant '' souvenir volume '' to the
Stratford	LOCATION	visitor , and a tantalizing glimpse of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's town and coun - try to the stay-at-home reader of the plays .

		`` Character Studies '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- , Character studies b Mr
Frederick Saunders	PERSON	, the ven - of literary folk .

		J , ... erable Astor librarian , is a volume containing pleasant and unassuming sketches of six distinguished literary persons whom it has been the author 's good fortune to meet or to know .


Edward Irving	PERSON	, Mrs.
Jameson	PERSON	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, Wash - ington Irving , and
Joseph Green Coggswell	PERSON	are the six , and the distinctive quality of their personalities is set forth in these wide-margined pages .

		The lit - erary criticism is genial rather than acute , the au - thor 's admiration cleaving first of all to those traits that go to make up manhood .

		The first word of the title is thus to be taken in its moral signification , and its promise is adequately fulfilled in a book that is , in the pleasanter sense of a much abused word , instructive .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A volume of '' Selections from the Poems of
Arthur Hugh Clough	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been added to the '' Golden Treasury '' series . ''

		The Bothie of Tober-na - vuolich '' fills the first half of the pretty little volume ; selections from '' Dipsychus `` and '' Amours de Voyage , '' with a few miscellaneous pieces , make up the second half . ''


Mari Magno	PERSON	'' is not represented .

		The best of
Clough	PERSON	is between these covers , and we fancy that pos - terity will still further sift his slender product , and really treasure not more than a score of pages .

		Miss
Frances E. Lord	PERSON	, of
Wellesley College	ORGANIZATION	, has done a simple but much-needed piece of work in her little book on `` The Roman Pronunciation of Latin '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		The work consists of two parts , '' Why We Use It '' and '' How to Use It . ''

		In the former we have collected the evidence upon which our knowledge of the pronunciation is based ; in the latter we have a number of helpful sug - gestions to teachers .

		There are many thousands of sec - ondary school and college teachers in this country who need just such a book as this , both for help in their daily work , and for the confuting of those uninformed per - sons -LRB- still found here and there -RRB- who imagine -LRB- and say -RRB- that we do not really know how
Cicero	PERSON	and Quintilian pronounced their native speech .

		Dr.
George Hempl	PERSON	, of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, deserves the thanks of all teachers of English for his admirable brochure on '' Chaucer 's Pronunciation and the Spelling of the Ellesmere MS. '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The pam - phlet is just what is needed by school and college teach - ers .

		It is better than Professor
Skeat	PERSON	's introduction to '' The Man of
Lawe	PERSON	's Tale , '' and the phonetic basis of its exposition is strictly scientific .

		The author recom - mends its use in connection with Dr. Sweet 's '' Second Middle-English Primer , '' to be followed by the
Morris	PERSON	- Skeat edition of the '' Prologue '' and '' Knighte 's Tale . ''

		We had hoped to find space for a notice of the Hon.
William Warren Vernon	PERSON	's '' Readings on the Inferno of Dante '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- adequate to the great importance of the work , but a brief description must suffice .

		It is similar in plan to the companion work on the ''
Purga	PERSON	- torio , '' of which a second edition is promised .

		Text , translation , and commentary run along together , filling the thirteen hundred pages of two thick volumes .

		Al - though the '' Readings '' are said to be '' chiefly based on the Commentary of Benvenuto da
Imola	LOCATION	, '' they are 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, really based upon the whole range of Dante literature , and if the student can have but one work of general criticism and exposition , this is decidedly the work that he must get .

		There is an introduction by the Rev.
Ed	PERSON	- ward
Moore	PERSON	.

		Commander
Charles N. Robinson	PERSON	,
R.N.	LOCATION	, has prepared a popular account of '' The British Fleet '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which describes in compact form , with many curious and instructive cuts and plates , '' the growth , achievements , and duties of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	of the Empire . ''

		The work has four sections , devoted , respectively , to the growth and history of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	, its administration , its mate - rial , and its personnel .

		There is a good index , and an interesting appendix upon the paintings , drawings , and prints that have been reproduced for purposes of illus - tration .

		In spite of the many earlier books upon this subject , the present volume really seems to occupy a place hardly filled before .

		Dr.
Norman Kerr	PERSON	's '' Inebriety or Narcomania '' -LRB- Tait -RRB- appears in a new and greatly enlarged edition .

		The au - thor 's experience in the treatment of inebriates has made him one of the foremost authorities upon the subject of this book , and we need hardly add that he handles it in a thoroughly scientific way .

		He contends strongly that alcoholism and the allied forms of mania are diseases and should be treated as such .

		He gives a great num - ber of cases from his own exceptional experience to es - tablish this assertion , and presents also the treatment which he has found to be efficacious .

		Dr.
Kerr	PERSON	is an attractive writer , and by avoiding the use of technical - ities he has produced a book which all classes can read intelligently .

		The usefulness of
William Ramsay	PERSON	's '' Manual of Ro - man Antiquities '' has been amply tested by the expe - rience of over forty years .

		A fifteenth edition now ap - pears , revised and partly rewritten by
Signor Rodolfo Lanciani	PERSON	, whose name is a sufficient guarantee that the work has been brought down to the date of the most recent excavations .

		The work , which is imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , is a substantial volume of nearly six hundred pages , illustrated with woodcuts and full-page photogravure * plates .

		The late Dr.
John Bradshaw	PERSON	was the compiler of '' A Concordance to the Poetical Works of
John Milton	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- now published , and perhaps more needed than a concordance of any other English poet yet un - provided with such apparatus .

		The earlier works of
Todd	ORGANIZATION	,
Prendergast	PERSON	, and
Cleveland	LOCATION	are manifestly inad - equate , and students will be thankful for this completer performance of the task .

		Dr.
Bradshaw	PERSON	, who died a year ago , was the editor of Milton in the new '' Aldine '' series .

		The present volume contains four hundred dou - ble-columned pages . ''

		Preparatory Physics '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
J. Hopkins	PERSON	, is a short laboratory course , mainly in mechanics , for schools of secondary grade .

		Mr.
H. N. Chute	PERSON	's '' Physical Laboratory Manual '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a similar text-book , possibly a trifle more elementary , and undoubtedly more attractive in arrangement and presentation .

		Mr.
J. Edward Taylor	PERSON	's '' Theoretical Mechanics Fluids '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is a small treatise especially devised for the unhappy English youth who are cramming for their examinations .

		The method is totally unlike that of the book just before mentioned . ''

		An Elementary History of Art '' -LRB- Imported by Scribner -RRB- , by Mrs.
Arthur Bell	PERSON	-LRB- '' N. D'Anvers '' -RRB- has long been a favorite among popular manuals .

		It now reappears in a fourth edition , carefully revised by the author .

		The work is used in
England	LOCATION	as a text-book in civil service examinations , a fact which testifies to its excellence .

		It attempts to cover the whole field archi - tecture , sculpture , and painting , is amply though not very satisfactorily illustrated , is well provided with in - dexes and glossaries , and its nearly six hundred pages are stoutly bound in half-leather .

		A group of recent publications for students and teach - ers of Latin , published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, com - prises the following books : `` The First Latin Book , '' by Messrs.
W. C. Collar	PERSON	and
M. G. Daniel	PERSON	-RSB- , of the Bos - ton schools ; `` Latin at Sight , '' by Mr.
Edwin Post	PERSON	, a book which teachers ought to find particularly useful ; an edition of '' The Odes and Epodes of
Horace	PERSON	, '' an - notated by Professor
Clement Lawrence Smith	PERSON	; and '' An Introduction to the Verse of Terrence , '' by Dr.
H. W. Hayley	PERSON	.

		We may mention in this connection Mr.
H. W. Auden	PERSON	's translation , from the sixth German edition , of
Herr C. Meissner	PERSON	's '' Latin Phrase Book '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The series of '' Contributions to
American Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tional History , '' edited for the
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	by Professor
Herbert B. Adams	PERSON	, has just been augmented by four volumes of great value .

		They deal , respect - ively , with the history of education in
Connecticut	LOCATION	and
Delaware	LOCATION	, and of higher education in
Iowa	LOCATION	and
Tennes	PERSON	- see .

		Each of these works is the study of a careful specialist , and treats exhaustively of its subject .

		When such a work shall have been done for every state in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, the historian of education in this country will have at hand something like an adequate collection of materials for his work , and it will be possible to pre - pare a general account of the subject with some claims to completeness . ''

		A History of Our Own Times , '' by Mr.
Justin Mc	PERSON	-
Carthy	PERSON	, has been a very popular book ever since its ap - pearance ten or more years ago .

		The popularity is , on the whole , deserved , in spite of the Irish bias and jour - nalistic method of the writer , for nowhere else is so readable a summary of the Victorian period to be found .

		We now welcome a reissue of the work -LRB-
Lovell	PERSON	-RRB- , made more serviceable than ever by an extension from
1880	DATE	to
1894	DATE	, the work of Mr.
G. Mercer Adam	PERSON	.

		The new edition is in two volumes , with a new index and some thirty portraits .

		It is also moderate in price .

		`` From Monkey to Man ; or , Society in the Tertiary Age '' -LRB-
Dibble	PERSON	-RRB- is the title of a romance of our remote ancestors , at the time when they were abandoning their earlier arboreal habit , and had discovered that two legs are better than four .

		Among other things , the book tells of '' the great expedition from Cocoanut Hill and the wars in Alligator Swamp . ''

		Mr.
Austin Bierbower	PERSON	is the author of this fanciful production , and Mr.
H. R. Heaton	PERSON	has provided it with illustrations .

		There is not a little humor in the development of the plot , and we come now and then upon a touch obviously satirical of intent . ''

		Stories from English History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from
Julius Csesar	PERSON	to the Black Prince , is well described by its title , the earlier sketches being given in the form of a dialogue , while those of a later period are plain tales .

		The author , the Rev.
A. J. Church	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, has included both legend and fact ; and though the stories are neces - sarily sketchy , they are as satisfactory as their extent permits .

		The illustrations are reproductions of ancient sculptures and engravings .

		THE DIAL 27 YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
December 25 , 1894	DATE	.

		Literary movements and schools arise , reach their cul - mination , and decline , with such rapidity , nowadays , that it is a question whether the well-worn phrase , fin - de-siecle , should not be altered to apply to the close of each succeeding year .

		It was one
B. Franklin	PERSON	, I be - lieve , a printer , who preached that immortal sermon , '' The Ephemera , '' using for his mouthpiece the insect to whom the sum total of existence was compressed within a single day .

		And
B. Franklin	PERSON	's typographical successor , Mr.
T. DeVinne	PERSON	, might well preach another such sermon , based on observation of '' the feeble fantasts and realists of the day , '' as they are styled by Mr.
Whit	PERSON	- ing of the
Springfield	LOCATION	'' Republican . ''

		Well , the real - ists have had their day or so at least Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	de - clares in '' The Forum , '' the fantasts are passing , and now we are wondering what will come after the ro - mancers .

		It is a good time , when everybody is indulg - ing in the festivities of the season and nobody is likely to hear you , to growl at literary and artistic vagaries .

		First of all , let me ask what we have done that the
Beardsley	PERSON	women should be flaunted at us from the boardings , as is being done by bill-stickers for '' The Masqueraders . ''

		We are tired of the
Beardsley	PERSON	women already , but I suppose they will serve to '' work '' the multitude for some time yet , and we must endure .

		As to posters in general , the mania is spreading with fright - ful rapidity . ''

		Art '' is to be seen on every fence , and tell it not in
Gath	LOCATION	in every grocery window .

		For several months I have been admiring the successive pos - ters of some unknown but enterprising magazine dis - played in a neighboring shop .

		A specially striking winter-scene drew my close attention , and I found my - self perusing a summary of the estimable qualities of 's soups .

		It is evident that we shall soon surpass the Frenchmen in their own field , and that the maga - zines will have to seek a new method of advertising . ''

		Tomato-can pictures '' will no longer serve as the de - signation of a popular Academician 's pictures among his less-successful rivals , and why ?

		Because pictures on tomato cans will soon be conformed to '' high art . ''

		Then there is Trilby . ''

		Caught at last !

		How one sympathizes with Mr.
Dick	PERSON	at times like these , and with his efforts to keep the head of Charles the First out of his Memorial !

		But there is no help for it . ''

		Trilby '' must be mentioned , for '' Trilby '' is to be dramatized .

		Pray ,
Messrs. Harpers	PERSON	, and pray , Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	, sup - press any more Trilby '' posters .

		Let Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	spell out the word in letters twenty feet high , if he chooses , but no pictures .

		Do not remove the last vestige of our enjoyment of them by such damnable iteration .

		Are we to have '' Trilby '' soap a la Svengali !

		Are we to have Trilby '' slippers ?

		Not in
New York	LOCATION	, at least , for they were several sizes too large in the story !

		How about '' Trilby '' living pictures ?

		The brain reels at the thought of the revenues to be gained by farming out `` Trilby '' privileges .

		Judging by the crowds at the
Fifth Avenue Galleries	ORGANIZATION
last week	DATE	, a travelling art - gallery containing the original drawings would bring in an immense sum .

		I should be glad to receive one per cent for the suggestion . ''

		Trilby '' must be now approaching the two hundred thousand mark in the '' States . ''

		A mere ten per cent of the retail price ,
$ 1.75	MONEY	, would net the author
$ 35,000	MONEY	for that many copies .

		Who would not write a '' Trilby , '' if he could , as your contemporary in this city remarks ?

		It was needless for that contemporary to repeat the old song , however , as to '' why people , when they discuss the relations of authors and publishers , so seldom give the publisher credit for common business sense .

		They do not seem to understand that publishers , like most men , are doing business on business principles . ''

		Do n't they ?

		I warrant the authors do .

		This quotation would far better read , '' I wonder why people , when they dis - cuss the relations of authors and publishers , so seldom give the author credit for common business sense .

		They do not seem to understand that authors , like most men , are doing business on business principles . ''

		How good that sounds .

		I hope Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	made a fine bar - gain .

		No doubt he will be
Baron Du Maurier	PERSON	, if the wind holds fair , and if he be eligible .

		Speaking of the profits of English novelists , there is one small item of American interest .

		Mr.
Edward Bel	PERSON	- lamy 's '' Looking Backward '' has just reached its four hundredth thousand .

		The sale for the past year or two has been slower but steady .

		He apparently has been following the practice of Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, of whom it is said that '' he has no work on hand just now ; he is en - joying the success of < The
Manxman	PERSON	' and meditating his next big book . ''

		Welcome ,
Messieurs les Anglais	ORGANIZATION	, to our golden grain , but restrain the tendency exhibited by certain eager brethren to put their feet in the trough .

		Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	is busily engaged at his country place in
Wallingford	LOCATION	,
Penn.	LOCATION	, with the final proofs of the ''
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream , '' which the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	will bring out in
March	DATE	.

		It was at one time rumored that Dr.
Furness	PERSON	had given up fur - ther work on his `` Variorum '' edition of Shakespeare ; but this is , happily , untrue . ''

		Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' by the way , the first of the series , appeared in
1871	DATE	.

		The ''
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream '' will contain a very full discussion concerning the allegory contained in
Oberon	LOCATION	's vision of the `` fair vestal throned by the West . ''

		The identity of the '' little Western flower , '' referred to a few lines further on , is discussed by various authorities in some fifteen pages of fine type .

		Mary ,
Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	, and
Lettice Knollys	PERSON	, wife of the
Earl of Essex	ORGANIZATION	, are , I believe , the most likely originals .

		Of all the season 's giftbooks , of the standard type , the '' Holland '' of
Signor Edmondo de Amicis	PERSON	, trans - lated by Miss
Helen Zimmern	PERSON	and published by
Messrs. Porter & Coates	ORGANIZATION	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, seems to me the most beautiful in its simple but elegant binding .

		The cover design embraces a delicate tracery of tulips , while the printing and the photogravures are as nearly per - fect as possible .

		The edition was sold out soon after publication , but a new supply was obtained in time for the late Christmas trade .

		This point is interesting as showing how large and constant the demand is for well - made standard works of literature .

		It is impossible to name all the literary , educational , and scientific events , which take place here at this season of the year .

		This week there is the seventh annual meeting of the
American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	, with a reception by President Low of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Next week will include the
Memorial Meeting	ORGANIZATION	in honor of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	; the recital of an act of Mr.
Walter Damrosch	PERSON	's opera , '' The Scarlet Letter , '' announced last year in this correspondence , for which Mr.
George Par	PERSON	- sons Latfcrop has written the libretto ; and the triennial
Twelfth Night	ORGANIZATION	celebration of the
Century Club	ORGANIZATION	, the only occasion on which all '' strangers '' are banished ?

		rom the rooms of the most hospitable of the great
New York	LOCATION	clubs .

		Dr.
John Chapman	PERSON	, for many years editor of '' The Westminster Review , '' and the intimate associate of

		The name of
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	heads the list of a com - mittee organized to secure the purchase of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's house in
Cheyne Road	LOCATION	,
Chelsea	LOCATION	.

		It is hoped to make a
Carlyle Museum	ORGANIZATION	of the building .

		A fund of about 4000 is needed , and subscriptions are invited .

		Re - mittances may be made to Mr.
A. C. Miller	PERSON	, 61
Cecil St.	PERSON	,
Manchester	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
L. J. B. Lincoln	PERSON	, the editor of '' Uncut Leaves , '' has begun the issue of a '' monthly letter of advance criticism and literary information . ''

		The first number has appeared , and consists of twelve pages of fresh and readable comment upon books recently , or ablaut to be , published , as well as notes upon the doings of literary folk in
New York	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		Our imports of books and other printed matter for the first nine months of
last year	DATE	amounted to a little over two and a half
millions of dollars	MONEY	, nearly half being dutiable .

		This is a falling-off of about twenty-five per cent from the figures for the corresponding period of
1893	DATE	.

		During the same nine months we exported books to the value of one and
three-quarters millions of dollars	MONEY	.

		The publication of that valuable weekly , '' Science , '' has just been resumed , under the direction of an edi - torial committee whose membership includes such lead - ers of American scientific thought as Professors New - comb ,
Mendenhall	PERSON	,
Pickering	PERSON	,
Remsen	LOCATION	,
LeConte	PERSON	,
Davis	PERSON	,
Marsh	PERSON	,
Brooks	PERSON	,
Brinton	PERSON	, and
Cattell	PERSON	.

		We heartily welcome the reappearance of the periodical after its long eclipse .

		Dr.
John Lord	PERSON	, the well-known writer and lecturer upon history , died at his home in
Stamford	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, on the fifteenth of
December	DATE	.

		He was one of the men of
1809	DATE	, and his birthday was that of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, De - cember 29 . ''

		Beacon-Lights of History '' is his most widely-read work .

		The Rev.
Alex. S. Twombly	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, of
Newton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, is preparing a memoir of Dr.
Lord	PERSON	.

		He would gladly receive memoranda of fact , letters from Dr.

New York	LOCATION	, on the
evening	TIME	of
January 4	DATE	.

		It will be held under the auspices of Mr.

St. Andrews Society	ORGANIZATION	, of that city , leading authors , artists , editors , and business men cooperating .

		Mr.

		Speeches are expected from Messrs.
Richard Henry Stoddard	PERSON	,
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	,
William Winter	PERSON	,

Parke Godwin	PERSON	,
David Christie Murray	PERSON	, and others .

		Mr.
Nelson Wheatcroft	PERSON	will recite a ballad and a selection from a story by
Stevenson	PERSON	, and musical in - terludes will be given by an orchestra .

		In
Whittier	LOCATION	's lately published Letters several refer - ences are made to the poem of ''
Barbara Frietchie	PERSON	, '' the historical basis of which has more than once been called in question .

		A note from Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	to the editor of this journal , not included in the recent col - lection , touches the point at issue , though , it must be admitted , not very conclusively .

		The note is dated from
Amesbury	LOCATION	,
Nov. 15 , 1885	DATE	, and in it Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	says : '' Of the substantial truth of the heroism of
Barbara Frietchie	PERSON	I can have no doubt .

		Mrs.
E. D. N. South	PERSON	- worth , the novelist , of
Washington	LOCATION	, sent me a slip from a newspaper , stating the circumstance as it is given in the poem , and assured me of its substantial correctness .


Dorothea L. Dix	PERSON	, the philanthropic worker in the
Union	LOCATION	hospitals , confirmed it .

		From half a dozen other sources I had the account , and all agree in the main facts .


Barbara Frietchie	PERSON	was the boldest and most outspoken Unionist in
Frederick	LOCATION	, and manifested it to the Rebel army in an unmistakable manner . ''

		The ''
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' under the new management of Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	, is making a fierce attack upon the new
Oxford School of English Literature	ORGANIZATION	.

		The follow - ing is a specimen of the slashing sort of criticism that is being served up weekly : '' The curriculum of the new School of English Language and Literature at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is now before us .

		To say that it justifies our fears of what such a
Board of Studies	ORGANIZATION	, as the
Board	ORGANIZATION	appointed for the regulation of this School , would be likely to pro- duce , would be to give a very imperfect idea of so de -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 29 plorable an exhibition of pedantry , ignorance , and incom - petence .

		Of pedantry , for all that has any pretension to satisfactory organization is the Philological portion ; of ignorance , for the boundary dates assigned to par - ticular epochs in our literature are often as muddled as they are misleading , while the selection of books prescribed for special study displays utter inability to distinguish between what is and what is not character - istic and significant in the works of individual authors , both particularly in relation to the authors themselves and generally in relation to the era at which such works appeared ; of incompetence , for two - thirds of what constitutes a literary education in the true sense of the term an adequate acquaintance with classical litera - ture , a knowledge of the principles of criticism , the possession of a good style , of sound judgment , of refined taste , and the like are in the provisions of this curric - ulum simply ignored .

		Regarded as a curriculum of Philology it is most inadequate .

		Regarded as a cur - riculum in Literature it is literally below contempt . ''

CHRISTINA GEORGINA ROSSETTI	PERSON	.

		The last day of the year just ended brought news of the death of
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	, the young - est of that famous quartette of brothers and sisters of whom Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	is now left the sole survivor .


Maria Francesca	PERSON	, who died in
1876	DATE	, was the oldest of the four , hav - ing first seen the light in
1827	DATE	.

		Then came
Dante Gabriel	PERSON	in
1828	DATE	,
William Michael	PERSON	in
1829	DATE	, and
Christina Georgina	PERSON	in
1830	DATE	.

		Miss
Rossetti	PERSON	gave early evidence of her poetic tal - ents , as is shown by the privately-printed vol - ume of `` Verses , '' dated
1847	DATE	.

		In
1850	DATE	, with her brothers , she wrote for the famous '' Germ , '' over the pseudonymous signature of ''
Ellen Alleyne	PERSON	. ''

		It was not , however , until
1862	DATE	that she took her destined place among the greater Victorian poets , with ''
Goblin Market	ORGANIZATION	and Other Poems . ''

		That volume was followed , in
1866	DATE	, by '' The Prince 's Progress and Other Poems , '' and , in
1881	DATE	, by `` A Pageant and Other Poems . ''

		It is upon the contents of these three collections that
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	's reputation must rest , although she did a considerable amount of other literary work .

		Before discuss - ing the character of her poems , we may dispose of the other books by a simple enumeration . ' ''

		Commonplace and Other Short Stories '' -LRB- 1870 -RRB- and `` Sing-Song : A Nursery Rhyme - Book '' -LRB- 1872 -RRB- are titles that speak for them - selves . ''

		Speaking Likenesses , '' a volume of `` quasi - allegorical prose , '' and '' Annus Domini : A Prayer for Every Day in the Year , '' both bear the date
1874	DATE	. ''

		Seek and Find , '' '' Called to the Saints , '' and '' Letter and Spirit , '' three religious works in prose , date from
1879	DATE	,
1881	DATE	, and
1883	DATE	, respectively ; while `` Time Flies , '' a reading diary in alternate verse and prose , appeared in
1885	DATE	, and was , we believe , her last published volume .

		These devotional books , which have both found and deserved a large and appreciative audience , are distinctly out of the common , but the spirit which finds expres - sion in them finds utterance still more intense and rapturous in the three volumes of song to which we now turn .

		It is not the least of the glories of English , poetry that two women should be numbered !

		among the singers whom we most love and !

		honor .

		It is perhaps idle to inquire whether Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	or
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	is to be es - teemed the greater poet ; the one thing certain is that no other English woman is to be named in the same breath with them .

		These two stand far apart from the throng , lifted above it by inspiration and achievement , and no ac - count of the greater poetry of our century can ignore them .

		If there is something more in - stinctive , more inevitable in impulse , about the work of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, there is more of re - straint and of artistic finish about the work of Miss
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		The test of popularity would assign to the former the higher rank , just as it would place Byron above
Keats	PERSON	and
Cole	PERSON	- ridge , or above
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	; but the critic has better tests than the noisy verdicts .

		38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, of the multitude , and those tests lessen , if they do not quite do away with , the seeming dispar - ity between the fame of the two women .

		The longer pieces which introduce Miss Ros - setti 's three volumes are not the most success - ful of their contents .

		It is rather to the lyrics , ballads , and sonnets that the lover of poetry will turn to find her at her best .

		Who , for example , could once read and ever forget such a sonnet as '' Rest '' ? ''

		Earth , lie heavily upon her eyes ; Seal her sweet eyes weary of watching ,
Earth	LOCATION	; Lie close around her ; leave no room for mirth With its harsh laughter , nor for sound of sighs .

		She hath no questions , she hath no replies , Hushed in and curtained with a blessed dearth Of all that irked her from the hour of birth , With stillness that is almost
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	.

		Darkness more clear than noonday holdeth her , Silence more musical than any song ; Even her very heart hath ceased to stir : Until the morning of Eternity Her rest shall not begin nor end , but be ; And when she wakes she will not think it long . ''

		Or '' who could escape the haunting quality of such a lyric as this : '' When I am dead , my dearest , Sing no sad songs for me ; Plant thou no roses at my head , Nor shady cypress-tree ; Be the green grass above me With showers and dewdrops wet ; And if thou wilt , remember , And if thou wilt , forget . ''

		I shall not see the shadows , I shall not feel the rain ; I shall not hear the nightingale Sing on , as if in pain : And dreaming through the twilight That doth not rise nor set , Haply I may remember , And haply may forget . ''

		The poem just quoted can hardly fail to re - call , in feeling , thought , and measure , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Rococo , '' and thus emphasizes the spiritual relationship of the author to the poets of the group sometimes styled '' Pre-Raphael - ite . ''

		Similarly , the perfect lyric called '' Dream - Land '' is clearly akin to '' The Garden of Proserpine , '' and it is not difficult to discern the same sort of kinship between
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Up-Hill '' and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' The Pil - grims . ''

		Now the point to be noted is that all three of Miss
Rossetti	PERSON	's poems were published in the volume of
1862	DATE	, while the three Swin - burnian poems date from
several years later	DATE	.

		There is , of course , no question of imitation in each case what remains a simple theme with the one poet is elaborated into a symphony by the other but it is difficult to escape the con - clusion that the man was influenced by the wo - man in all three of the cases .

		Particularly with '' Up-Hill '' and '' The Pilgrims , '' we note the common use of the dialogue form and the ab - solute identity of the austere ethical motive .

		Miss
Rossetti	PERSON	's verses sometimes suggest those of other poets , but we always feel that her art is distinctly her own .

		The divine sim - plicity of
Blake	ORGANIZATION	is echoed in such a stanza as '' What can lambkins do All the keen night through ?

		Nestle by their woolly mother , The careful ewe . ''

		The melting , almost cloying , sweetness of the Tennysonian lyric meets us in these verses : '' Come to me in the silence of the night ; Come in the speaking silence of a dream ; Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright As sunlight on a stream ; Come back in tears , O memory , hope , love of finished years . ''

		As for the influence of the great Italian , which shaped so powerfully the thought of every mem - ber of the
Rossetti	PERSON	family , it is less tangible here than in the work of her greater brother , yet to it must be attributed much of the ten - derness and the pervasive mysticism of her poems .

		It is perhaps most apparent in the two sonnet-sequences , ''
Monna Innominata	PERSON	'' and '' Later Life , '' both included in the volume of
1881	DATE	.

		And the influence of that brother who bore the sacred name of the Florentine is like - wise intangible but pervasive .

		We get a glimpse of it in ''
Amor Mundi	PERSON	, '' for example , and in many a vanitas vanitatum strain .

		But we must repeat that
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	's genius was too original to be chargeable with anything more than that assimilation of spiritual influ - ence from which no poet can hope wholly to es - cape , and which links together in one golden chain the poetic tradition of the ages .

		If in most of the provinces of the lyric realm Miss
Rossetti	PERSON	's verse challenges comparison with that of our greater singers , it is in the religious province that the challenge is most imperative and her mastery most manifest .

		Not in
Keble	LOCATION	or
Newman	PERSON	, not in
Herbert	LOCATION	or
Vaughan	PERSON	, do we find a clearer or more beau - tiful expression of the religious sentiment than is dominant in
Miss Rossetti	LOCATION	's three books .

		In this respect , at least , she is unsurpassed , and perhaps unequalled , by any of her contempo - raries .

		In her devotional pieces there is no touch of affectation , artificiality , or insincerity .

		Such poems as '' The Three Enemies '' and '' Advent '' in the first volume , '' Paradise '' and '' The Lowest Place '' in the second , and many of the glorious lyrics and sonnets of the third , will long be treasured among the religious clas - sics of the English language .

		Perhaps the poet 's highest achievement in this kind is the
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 '' Old and New Year Ditties '' of the first vol - ume .

		Some such claim , at least , has been made by no less an authority than Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	for the closing section of the poem . ''

		Passing away , saith the World , passing away ; Chances , beauty , and youth sapped day by day ; Thy life never continueth in one stay .

		Is the eye waxen dim , is the dark hair changing to gray That hath won neither laurel nor bay ?

		I shall clothe myself in
Spring	DATE	and bud in
May	DATE	: Thou , root-stricken , shalt not rebuild thy decay On my bosom for aye .

		Then I answered : Yea . ''

		Passing away , saith my Soul , passing away ; With its burden of fear and hope , of labor and play ;
Hearken	ORGANIZATION	what the past doth witness and say : Rust in thy gold , a moth is in thine array , A canker is in thy bud , thy leaf must decay .

		At
midnight	TIME	, at cock-crow , at morning , one certain day Lo , the Bridegroom shall come and shall not delay : Watch thou and pray .

		Then I answered : Yea .

		* ' Passing away , saith my God , passing away :
Winter	DATE	passeth after the long delay ; New grapes on the vine , new figs on the tender spray , Turtle calleth turtle in
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's
May	DATE	, Though I tarry , wait for Me , trust Me , watch and pray .

		Arise , come away , night is past , and lo it is day , My IOTC , My sister , My spouse , thou shalt hear Me say .

		Then I answered : Yea . ''

		It is peculiarly fitting that the author of these fervid and solemn verses , written for one New Year 's season , should herself have passed away on the very eve of another .

		NOVELS AND NOVEL READERS .

		Just as the term father implies the correlative term child , so does a novel imply a novel reader .

		It were hard to imagine a piece of fiction without an audience , even if the audience number but one and be furnished by the author himself .

		Readers , then , being necessary , it touches the quick of the fictionist 's interest to inquire : What is the attitude of the present-day patrons of tales towards the dif - ferent kinds of fiction purveyed for their delecta - tion ?

		Is the purpose-novel preferred , or the light and cynical analytic study , or the frankly objective adventure-tale of your true romanticist ?

		Would Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	win the popular plebiscite , or Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- son , or Messrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Doyle	PERSON	, and
Weyman	PERSON	?

		Of course a categorical reply could only be made on the basis of counting noses : the pure mathemat - ics , of the problem will always be out of reach .

		Still , what with the test of sales , the talk of society , and the a posteriori analyses of the critics , an opin - ion of some solidity may be attained .

		The writer has made a point of conversing with divers sorts of folk who care for fiction -LRB- and who , outside of the absolutely illiterate class , does not care for it ? -RRB-

		, and has been both interested and instructed by the tes - timony thus derived .

		Blending the illumination gained in this way with that from other sources , he has concluded that novel-readers may be divided , roughly , into three classes : first , those who care for fiction as art primarily , and get their main pleasure from its truth to life , its character analysis , and its construction ; second , those whose interest centres in the thesis of the book , and who care little or nothing for form , style , and other distinctively lit - erary features ; and third , those to whom a novel is above all else a story , something to amuse and charm , an organism with movement , and zest of life .

		That division of novel-readers which looks for and relishes to the full the art of a bit of fiction is comparatively small , and for obvious reasons .

		Here belong the critics , the connoisseurs of literature .

		To such it matters not so much if a story be pleasant , or whether or not it teaches sound morality and su - perinduces a better opinion of one 's fellow-men .

		If it have construction , vital character-drawing , and verisimilitude , if it possesses stylistic distinction and dramatic power , they are satisfied .

		The analytic student of the novel comes in the course of time to put his attention on these things to the exclusion of everything extraneous ; he reads more as a scientist and less as a human being .

		This is at once the privilege and the penalty of the critical function .

		It is only the very great books that can wrest him from this self-conscious and dubious coign of vant - age and set him cheek by jowl with ordinary hu - manity , breathless in watching a piece of life and personally involved in the fortunes of the dramatis personce in the grip of the sweetest and ` strongest of obsessions .

		Such , as a rule , is the critic 's place and state of mind .

		Not always , even in his case , however .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, suffering , one might almost say , from a surfeit of culture , likes nothing so well as the novel with '' go '' and color and life , contradistinguished from that of analyses and the mooting of problems .

		Conceiving the end of art to be '' pleasure , not edification , '' he makes a plea for `` the Fijian canons of fiction , '' meaning thereby that those nawe natives in their stories '' tell of gods and giants and canoes greater than mountains , and of women fairer than the women of these days , and of doings so strange that the jaws of the listeners fall apart . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, in short , is fond of beautiful impossibilities in a novel .

		But it is none the less fair to say that the critic-class , as such , reads with '' Art for art 's sake '' perpetually engraven upon its censorious front .

		And it is also plain that the audi - ence thus furnished the fictionist is so small as to be numerically contemptible , and in the vulgar mat - ter of sales as unimportant as the p in pneumonia .

		To these professionals of criticism may be added a fraction of the reading public which uses their method , or in amateurish fashion , albeit honestly , follows in their wake .

		Very young persons whose education has been large and experience limited , and who for these reasons take themselves au grand serieux , and are more or less self-conscious in their psychological habitudes , belong here ; here belong , too , older , hardier , and more sensible people of a natural intellectual keenness , the ab ovo analysts of life , and of literature as its expression .

		These swear 40 -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's dicta , and , as to quality , are of the aristoi among readers , coveted by all genuine artists .

		But neither of these subsidiary classes swell the critic-class , caring for the art of a novel first of all , to proportions invalidating our claim that it is decidedly the smallest of the three , and , so far as immediate influence and the substantial return of figures is concerned , the least important .

		The second and larger class embraces readers who object not to didactics in their novels .

		To them a polemic in the guise of literature is as acceptable as a pill , sugar-coated to the taste , to the thorough - going homoeopathist .

		Many falling into this cate - gory enjoy literature per se , to be sure ; but they like it also to convey some thoughtful thesis , prefer - ring , so to say , the luxuriously cushioned barouohe of fiction to wrestling with the same problem in the Irish jaunting-car of sociology , or science .

		Hence is derived a good part of the audience rallying to the '' Heavenly Twins '' and '' A Yellow Aster '' ; or that which a few years ago took up arms for ''
Rob	PERSON	- ert
Elsmere	LOCATION	. ''

		A part , not the whole , we must repeat ; because these tendenzgeschichten , as the Germans call them , are far more than mere preach - ments and special pleadings ; often containing the vivid characterization of flesh-and-blood creatures , the one red drop of human life which is precious .

		But it is undeniable that the immense amount of talk evoked by such books had never been forth - coming were they not a stage upon which to dis - play the puppets of theory and argument .

		Right here opinions violently clash , and schools form as naturally as rocks crystallize .

		Plenty of earnest and honest devotees of the novel will have it that art and story interest may be supplied in a book , plus the presentation of some vital question of the day , adding by so much to its importance and at - traction , and lifting fiction , traditionally regarded as a '' light '' division of literature , into a more le - gitimate place , until it ranks with serious -LRB- too often a synonym for dull -RRB- literature .

		It is , in fact , a lit - erary cult , at the present writing , to be '' serious '' in the novel ; as it was a social cult , during the re - cent panic , to be poor .

		It was the book more pain - fully and self-consciously didactic than any other in English fiction within several years , which pro- voked the most discussion not critical controversy so much as the more powerful unpredicable popular interest of society .

		The vogue and stimulation of
Madame Grand	ORGANIZATION	's strong if unequal and inartistic essay in the field of social analysis were little short of phenomenal , although now , striking work in other sorts of fiction having since obscured it , one thinks of this study of the marital relation with
Villon	PERSON	's refrain rising to the mind : '' Where are the Snows of Yester-year ? ''

		For a season , it is even likely that the believers in purpose-fiction outnumbered not only the critical minority already characterized , but also the old-fashioned followers of the healthier tale whom we are to reckon with under our third division .

		For a season only , however , we should guess ; there is a sort of rabies of interest which destroys by its own violence , and already may be seen the after-effects of what has been cleverly dubbed the '' woman revolt in fiction . ''

		Still , this interest , this excitement , if temporary , has its sig - nificance , and goes to show that a wider and deeper appeal to humankind can be made through the novel , and will be made , an appeal touching grave ques - tions and the most sacred relations , as perhaps through no other form of the written word .

		It will not do to sneer at tendency literature as lying out - side of critical attention :
Terence	PERSON	's line applies to literature even as to life , and nothing in fiction that broadly stirs his fellow men and women can be alien to the true critic 's function .

		Yet it is plain , and to be plainly stated , that this popular furore over a dominant piece of purpose - fiction tends to obscure critical tests and canons .

		Those who read as they run , incline , under such in - fluence , to judge a work by the amount of imme - diate noise and intelligent comment it begets , and as a consequence one hears absurdly exaggerated encomium . ''

		The Heavenly Twins , '' for example , is put on a par with '' Marcella '' ; the truth being that beside Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's finished and masterful work of art , it is ill-constructed , false to life , faulty in drawing , and terribly diffuse , in fine , the jour - ney-work of a brilliant novice .

		The interest awak - ened by such a production is largely adventitious , because based on an appeal lying beyond artistic tests .

		It is well to have this clearly in mind here in the
United States	LOCATION	, where comparative criticism is but locally conceded , and where for this reason a stern insistence upon the criteria of artistic perfec - tion is of all places most needed .

		It is not cause for complaint that a host of readers , the palpable majority of whom are women , welcome novels hand - ling with more or less elan the relations of the sexes ; the repression , by the Anglo-Saxon traditions of convenance in fiction , of all that side of social phe - nomena , results , as might be expected , in an excess of curiosity and excitement which have their mor - bid manifestations ; but the residuum of all this fer - ment will be a broader outlook and a freer concep - tion of motifs .

		If , however , we do not learn to apply rigidly and with malice prepense to any fic - tion whatsoever , man-made or woman-begotten , the universal rules of art , a parlous state is ours .

		That section of society which elects the purpose-novel as its special pet and pride may gratify its taste under promise to exempt none of this popular product from the Rhadamanthian judgment by the which all fiction must be judged ; and with the agreement to keep clearly dissevered in their own minds the appeal of art and the appeal of thought .

		The readers of a more genial habit and a more traditional standard make up our third and final class .

		They care for a story for the story 's sake , and , bothering not overmuch if its likeness to life be dubious , go so far as to open arms to a fine rep - resentation of the improbable .

		They stand by
Bal	ORGANIZATION	- zac 's phrase -LRB- rarely obeyed by the master himself -RRB- that the novelist should depict the world , not as it
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 is , but as it may possibly become .

		And it is this sort of folk , we would contend , which on the whole is the best-balanced , the most humanistic , and in the long run the most influential , among novel-read - ers .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	inclines to contemn a species which , to his view , still loves the rattle and the woolly horse in literature .

		But if he , or any other seeker after truth , will pursue the Socratic method , conversing with fellow mortals in the chance jostle of the social plexus , he will get evidence pushing towards our conclusion .

		The fact is that , despite all our rather self-conscious prating about art , and notwithstanding our somewhat feverish enthusiasm over introspective social questions , the clear-headed and sound-hearted folk , who -LRB- thank heaven ! -RRB-

		are the warp of our social fabric , do not care to fret and fume for any such thing .

		They go to the novel for rest , amusement , illusion ; as the lovers of Thack - eray and
Dickens	PERSON	did , of
Scott	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	; as thousands now are doing with ''
Trilby	PERSON	, '' as true a child of the elder romanticists as was ever born .

		They have a deep-seated prejudice against fiction with a bad ending ; so far from wishing to have a great book stamped indelibly on the mind at a first contact , they are glad to possess , as a cultivated reader expressed it to the writer , `` the pleasant habit of forgetting a novel , '' assuring additional de - light in the event of re-perusal .

		`` The world is two - thirds bad , I know , '' says the Advocatus diabole to the stickler for high art and serious purpose . ''

		Your ' realism ' teaches me nothing , it simply repeats un - savory and belittling facts of life ; and I would have none of it .

		Give me lies rather than literal ities , or , better yet , the half-truths of a scene where the light is accented and the shadows put in corners where they belong . ''

		Now this is unphilosophic perhaps , but it is natural and -LRB- pace Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and those who jump with him -RRB- it is healthy , very .

		The trouble with the Howellsian view of fiction is that it is professional , and so not generally applicable .

		He is perfectly right for himself .

		But to argue pro and con as to this attitude of the readers who clamor for pleasant and incident - thronged novels , and who are the casus essendi of the Romantic reaction we are now witnessing , is , after all , aside from our main line of argument .

		We are not justifying their position or attacking it : we would simply register the fact of their exist - ence , and express the conviction that , while equal in intelligence and possibly excelling in common-sense either of the two other classes , they are to-day , and will be more surely to-morrow , the strongest in num - bers , and thus for practical reasons are to be respect - fully regarded by the maker of tales .

		Mr.
Craw	PERSON	- ford , in his chapters on `` The Art of Fiction , '' insists that it is the novelist 's primary business to pur - vey amusement .

		The believers in romances have a sneaking sympathy with this position , though many of them would claim , and rightly , that along with the pleasure may go a noble stimulation of ideals affording that instruction through the divine indi - rection of art which is as far removed from didac - ticism as from the irresponsibility of the thorough - going realist .

		The advantage of those whose view - hallo is for illusion lies in their being in the line of a wholesome tradition , since men and women have gone more steadily to fiction for just that than for aught else : and again , in their now perceptible and daily waxing in strength , a phenomenon due to the noticeable reaction , on the one side from the strained probing of psychologic problems ; on the other , from the art substituting form for substance and a qui - escent pessimism for the cheerful bustle and vigor of red-blooded humankind .

		It is an audience to depend on in any age , this of the romance readers , and in quality such that the writer of fiction may well trust himself to deserve its plaudits ; it is a con - stituency which he should hesitate to lose , even if there appear to be a temporary appetite for the mor - bid or the naturalistic .

		It is a backing which , year in and year out , will sell his books and establish his fame and make his copyright a valuable inheritance to his children .

BURTON	PERSON	.

		`` MIRABEAU AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION . ''

		- A REPLY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I request you to publish in the next issue of your esteemed journal the following statements , hoping and trusting that you will willingly do so in justice , not only to myself , but also to the readers of THE DIAL .

		Like every writer , I must expect to be criticized .

		Like every writer I have , however , a right to claim that my writings be not reviewed in such a way that readers of the criticism , who have not read the work criticized , must necessarily believe me to have written something totally different from what I have actually written .

		Without questioning in the least the motives of Mr.
D. L. Shorey	PERSON	, the reviewer of my Lowell lec - tures on the French Revolution in THE DIAL , I charge him with having done so to the extent it possibly can be done without saying any direct untruth .

		The in - ferences drawn by Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	from my statement in regard to
Mirabeau	LOCATION	's being and wanting to be a party by himself are his and not mine .

		The unbiased reader of the book will readily see why they are palpable fal - lacies , though at first sight they seem to be irrefutable logical conclusions .

		The only explanation of Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's misconception that I can find is that he seems to have read the lectures without paying any attention whatever to the statement of facts they contain .

		To hurl
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's exclamation , '' Ah !

		how the immoral - ity of my youth injures the public weal , '' as a shaft against me , is strange , for I quote it -LRB- II. , 236 -RRB- , endorse it most emphatically , show its tremendous import with minute detail , make it in fact one of the two main pil - lars of my whole argument .

		The same holds good of the question of lack of confidence in
Mirabeau	LOCATION	to such a de - gree that I must fain believe Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	to have skipped the twenty or more pages -LRB- scattered -RRB- treating of it .

		That Mirabeau '' became a new man -LRB- when he en - tered public life at the time of the revolution -RRB- '' he entered it much earlier , as Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	can find briefly stated in the lectures '' and the immorality of his youth should not be counted against him '' is not 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan.	DATE	. ''

		claimed '' by me .

		Nowhere is such a statement made in the lectures , but they contain many a page showing very elaborately that my opinion is in truth much more nearly the directly opposite one than that I am made to hold .

		From Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's expatiations on the pay - ment Mirabeau received from the court , the reader must conclude that I either pass it over in silence or justify it .

		I state the facts much more fully than he does , charge him -LRB- M. -RRB- with being `` sorrily unscrupu - lous about how he got the money he wanted to spend , '' declare his '' extravagant joy '' over the king 's liber - ality '' was more than undignified , it was revolting , '' but explain the transaction and reduce the charge of '' venality '' to what is warranted by the facts .

		Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	does not make the slightest attempt at contro - verting the facts adduced by me .

		About Lafayette Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	and I disagree .

		In his opinion there was no need of '' having the searchlight of critical history turned upon '' the general , for he says : '' The conduct and character of
Lafayette	LOCATION	were well known long before any such search-light was dis - covered -LSB- !

		? -RSB-

		.

		However it may be elsewhere , it was known at least in
France	LOCATION	and in the
United States	LOCATION	, that in a long life tried by many tests , the conduct of
Lafayette	LOCATION	was exceptionally consistent , and that it was uniformly governed not by passion , but by principle .

		In all emergencies he displayed the same high qualities . ''

		If Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	thinks that that is the way in which not only one serious historical writer , but all critical history , can be disposed of , in case the results of investi - gation have the misfortune not to be to his taste and to run counter to wide-spread popular opinions well , then we differ , that is all .

		Again he does not make the slightest attempt at refuting the facts which I ad - duce of course only an infinitesimal part of those fur - nished , in my opinion , by
Lafayette	LOCATION	's whole career in support of my views ,
Lafayette	LOCATION	himself being one of my authorities .

		Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's calling a charge '' stale '' does not undo incontestably-proved facts , and to hear in
1895	DATE	an unsubstantiated opinion of Sainte-Beuve in such a question quoted as decisive is surprising .

		To learn that
Mirabeau	PERSON	was far from being free from blame in his relations to
Lafayette	LOCATION	, and that he at the same time grossly flattered and bitterly denounced him , the reader need not turn to Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's review ; it is freely stated and blamed , but besides explained in the lectures .

		If the main contents of my lectures can be said to be at all alluded to by Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	, it is done in two or three words and in such a way that nobody can possibly guess from them what the thesis is I have tried to prove by the facts , or rather what I maintain to be demonstrated by the facts .

		DEPARTMENTAL LIBRARIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		There has lately been originated in
Chicago	LOCATION	a type of libraries the career of which will greatly interest library workers in this country .

		The
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	was the first , and now the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	seems to follow in its lead .

		Great general libraries have hitherto had their staff divided into departments according to the various classes of library work : there has been a catalogue department , a reference department , an ac - cession department , and so on .

		A cataloguer has been supposed to have in his head the most minute details of every science for cataloguing purposes .

		The refer - ence librarian had to be acquainted with the standard literature in all the different branches of human knowl - edge .

		In former times there were such encyclopaedic geniuses , who were able to grasp , as it were , the whole universe in one birds-eye view .

		That time is now past and gone for ever .

		Today every special science in - cludes more details than the whole field of scientific thought did fifty years ago .

		The librarian who would be something more than the go-between of the card catalogue and the shelves , who would be able to cata - logue and classify a collection of books without con - stantly consulting other catalogues , who would be able to rely upon his own knowledge , in short , one who would treat the library profession as he would one of the lines of an educator 's work , must specialize .

		It was in recognition of this that the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	was organized as a '' departmental '' library , and that the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	now seems to be tending in the same direction .

		A couple of years ago ,
Miss Edith Clarke	PERSON	of the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	gave in the `` Library Jour - nal '' -LRB-
September , 1891	DATE	-RRB- a very interesting account of the working of the departments in the
Newberry	LOCATION	, and I refer the reader to this paper for more detailed inform - ation .

		These libraries are divided into departments of science , there will be one department of medicine , one of music , one of social sciences , and so on .

		This plan will enable each assistant in the library to become ac - quainted with every detail of the technical side of his work .

		In this way , furthermore , he will feel the neces - sity , and the possibility , of keeping his specialized knowledge up to date .

		As it is now in most libraries , the cataloguer , or the reference librarian , always feels the necessity of keeping himself acquainted with all the departments of science ; and as this is an absolute im - possibility , he will either feel that he is not doing , and can not do , his duty as well as he should , or and this is perhaps most often the case he will content him - self with a certain superficiality , will content himself with the scant knowledge he can pick up in looking through the current magazines and in glancing over the pages of the new books as they come under his eyes .

		In the departmental libraries , and in the special libra - ries , all this is changed .

		The librarian will feel that the field of literature with which he is to deal is within his grasp .

		He can pursue studies in the special line that interests him , without feeling that there are other things that he , in so doing , more or less neglects .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	, more especially in
Germany	LOCATION	and in the
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian countries , where , outside of the university libra - ries , few libraries of any importance exist , the library assistants are all university men ; and the tendency is to allow none but graduates -LRB- that is , doctors of philosophy and their equals -RRB- in the profession , because the librarian ought to be a specialist in any science and acquainted with scientific methods .

		This can be carried too far .

		The specialist will very often be narrow-minded , and in the library field nothing is more needed than men of broad minds .

		The departmental library , while giving the advantage of dividing the work on scientific lines , will keep the special departments in one organization , and thus facilitate the intercourse between the different departments .

		The staff of such a library will acquire the character of a university faculty , and this character will impose upon the members of the staff the unity of the special fields of work in which they are engaged .

		THE DIAL 43 Nefo MEMORIES OF SEVENTY YEARS .

		* '' Threescore and Ten Years '' is the title of a lively and readable , if at times rather sketchy , volume of reminiscences from the pen of Mr.
W. J. Linton	PERSON	, the well-known engraver .

		While the book is largely a record of the author 's impressions of the many distinguished people he met during his career in
England	LOCATION	and in this country , sufficient data are given to convey a fair notion of his own varied past and strong personality .

		Born at
London	LOCATION	in
1812	DATE	, Mr.
Linton	PERSON	was early apprenticed to
George Wil	PERSON	- mot
Bonner	PERSON	, wood engraver ; and wood engrav - ing has been , we take it , despite pretty constant activity in the fields of authorship , journalism , and political and philanthropic agitation , sub - stantially his sheet anchor and real calling through life .

		Mr.
Linton	PERSON	's journalistic expe - rience has been , nevertheless , considerable .

		In 18412 he was editor of a Chartist newspaper called the '' Odd Fellow , '' and in
1845	DATE	of the `` Illustrated Family Journal , '' which latter sheet he gave up in the same year to succeed
Douglas Jerrold	PERSON	on the '' Illustrated
Maga	PERSON	- zine . ''

		In
1849	DATE	he was for a few weeks sub - editor , under
Thornton Hunt	PERSON	, of the '' Spec - tator '' ; and shortly after he joined Hunt in starting the '' Leader , '' an ambitious journal which was to be '' at once an organ of the European Republicans and the centre of an English republican party , after the manner of the
National	ORGANIZATION	and the Reforms in
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		The '' Leader '' of which Hunt was chief ed - itor ,
G. H. Lewes	PERSON	literary editor , and our au - thor editor for foreign matters did not last long .

		Says Mr.
Linton	PERSON	: '' I had soon to find that Hunt 's and
Lewes	LOCATION	's sympa - thies with the Republican party were not to be depended on , that they merely wanted to exploit the connection for the commercial advantage of the paper ... which led no whither , running , under the capricious direction of Hunt and
Lewes	LOCATION	, like
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's Irishman 's pig , ' up all manner of streets . ' ''

		As a free-lance journalist , Mr.
Linton	PERSON	did yeoman service , both in prose and verse , in the twin causes of political liberalism and general philanthropy ; and he was an active speaker and organizer on the popular side during the Chartist and similar movements .

		As an author , his credit rests chiefly on an excellent treatise on his own art , '' The Masters of Wood En - * THREESCORE AND TEN YEARS ,
1820	DATE	to 1890 : Recollec - tions .

		By
W. J. Linton	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		graving '' a work to which , he tells us , is due the fact that ''
the University of Yale	ORGANIZATION	has hon - ored me by conferring on me the degree of Master of Arts . ''

		For twenty-seven years Mr.
Linton	PERSON	has been a resident of this country , a trip to the States in
1866	DATE	'' to organize a party for
Italy	LOCATION	'' leading to the more substantial and fruitful , if less imposing , result of his perma - nent engagement by
Frank Leslie	PERSON	to conduct the pictorial portion of the '' Illustrated News . ''

		It may be gathered from the foregoing facts that Mr.
Linton	PERSON	has been a radical , or at least an advanced liberal , in politics universal re - publicanism of the vague , high-soaring ,
Giron	PERSON	- dist type being his ideal .

		He is akin , one may believe , to the class of minds dominant in the
latter half of the eighteenth century	DATE	, whose dogmas of human perfectibility and the divine right and innate virtue of that masterful ab - straction , the `` people , '' nerved men like Robes - pierre and Saint Just to the commission of Utopian follies which even now , in the face of the lessons of
1794	DATE	, we seem in some danger of seeing repeated .

		Writing of Mr.
Linton	PERSON	to Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy	PERSON	in
1849	DATE	,
Carlyle	PERSON	spoke as follows ; and we quote the description , not for its presumed literal accuracy , but be - cause we all know the sort of man
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	would be apt to apply it to : '' Also do not much mind
Linton	PERSON	, who is a well - enough meaning , but , I fear , extremely windy creature , of the
Louis Blanc	PERSON	,
George Sand	PERSON	, etc. , species . ''

		Were we to try our own hand with the brush , we should perhaps paint Mr.
Linton	PERSON	as one of those amiable and well-intentioned people who , seeing everything refracted through the mists of their own super-sensibility , make a life bus - iness of righting wrong and relieving distress , seldom distinguishing between unmerited pains and pains that are penalties , knocking the shackles off the innocent victim and the con - victed gallows-bird alike , and not seldom tak - ing their pay , like their immortal type in Cer - vantes , in the abuse and ridicule of their cli - ents .

		In revolutionary times Mr.
Linton	PERSON	might have been a lesser
Tom Paine	PERSON	, tempered and diluted with the humane vagaries of an Anach - arsis Clootz .

		As times went , he did a vast deal of not altogether futile writing , speechifying , and organizing , in behalf of oppressed Italians , Poles ,
Irish	LOCATION	, of anybody , in short , that ap - peared to him to have a grievance , to the no small neglect , as he confesses , of his own proper work of engraving .

		Passing from our impressions of Mr.
Linton	PERSON	to his impressions of others , we find a long list 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, of names , eminent or notorious , ranging from
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	to Mme. Blavatsky ; from
Carlyle	LOCATION	to ''
Ben '' Butler	PERSON	; from
A. Bronson Alcott	PERSON	to
Mace	ORGANIZATION	the pugilist ; from
Tennyson	LOCATION	to Tupper the latter of whom might have passed , says Mr.
Linton	PERSON	, '' as a most respecta - ble grocer and possible church-warden '' ; from
Swinburne	LOCATION	to
Robert Montgomery	PERSON	; from Rus - kin -LRB- to whom Mr.
Linton	PERSON	sold Brantwood -RRB- to
Oeorge Francis Train	PERSON	, whom he once saw mak - ing a speech in support of his self-imposed Presidential candidacy .

		Train , he adds , spoke fluently and well , though with not much in his words . ''

		During his speech he went to one end of the plat - form , and , taking hold of his nose with one hand , ran across the platform to the other end , saying : ` Let my nose alone ! ' '

		That , ' he added , ` is the Democratic party ! '

		Then , taking his nose with the other hand , he ran back : ' You , too , let my nose alone !

		That is the Republican party .

		I do n't mean to be led by the nose by either . ' ''

		Prominent on the list of Mr.
Linton	PERSON	's ac - quaintances are
Dickens	PERSON	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Hood	LOCATION	,
Brown	PERSON	- ing ,
Leech	ORGANIZATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Mazzini	PERSON	,
Cruikshank	PERSON	, Hay don ,
Emerson	LOCATION	, Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and others ; and his impressions of these , where he chooses to give them , are given with a can - dor and an independence of conventional esti - mates that is refreshing .

		Touching
Dickens	PERSON	, whose '' real vocation was as an actor of low comedy , '' who '' was not the gentleman , '' and who had '' no soul of nobility in him , '' he quotes the following story : '' When he and
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	and
Wills	PERSON	-LRB- the editor of ' Household Words ' -RRB- went out , taking
Dickens	PERSON	's doc - tor with them , to eat ' the most expensive dinner they < sould get , ' it was an action that marked the Amphitryon of the feast , if not the others also .

		It is an unpleasant anecdote , but it was told me by the doctor himself , who had to prescribe for all three next day . ''

		It is certainly not a little amusing to think of this spiteful satirist of American gluttony and neglect of table proprieties thus deliberately setting out to gorge himself to the point of apoplexy , and taking his doctor along with him as a precautionary measure .

		Landor , Mr.
Linton	PERSON	never saw , though he corresponded with him , and once received , through
Browning	PERSON	, a dubious token of his re - gard in the shape of a picture '' supposed to be by
Michael Angelo	PERSON	. ''

		The gift seems to have done little more credit to the donor 's heart than to his connoisseurship : '' Landor at one time had a large collection of pic - tures , supposed to be genuine , but seldom if ever of any worth .

		This '
Angelo	PERSON	' might be of that sort .

		I called on
Browning	PERSON	to look at and to speak about the picture .

		It was a ' Last Judgment , ' a poor and very unpleasant composition , too large and too unpleasant to be hung in a private house , a gift as of a white elephant , neither to be accepted nor refused .

		I got out of the difficulty by
Browning	PERSON	telling me that the old man had no right to give it , as all his ' belongings ' really belonged to his brother ,
Robert Landor	PERSON	, on whom
Walter Savage	PERSON	was living .

		So
Browning	PERSON	took charge of the elephant and relieved me . ''

		Mr.
Linton	PERSON	recalls
George Cruikshank	PERSON	as '' a well-built , good-looking , good-natured man , a bluff speaker who could call a spade a spade . ''

		His bump of reverence must have been poorly developed ; for the author remembers him ex - claiming , with some impiety , in regard to a publisher who had misquoted him in a dispute over the price of some work , '' My dear sir , the publisher is a liar ! ''


Cruikshank	PERSON	, however , seems to have lived , and even flourished , for some years after this incident .

		Speaking of
Leech	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Linton	PERSON	tells the story of the public castigation of one
Bernard Gregory	PERSON	, a black - guard journalist turned actor , at the hands of those he had pilloried in his scandal-mongering sheet , '' The Satirist . '' ''

		On a certain morning
London	LOCATION	streets were pla - carded with the following notice : ` Gentlemen of Lon - don !

		Mr.
Bernard Gregory	PERSON	, the editor of the '' Sat - irist , '' will appear to-night at Covent-Garden Theatre , in the character of Hamlet . '

		The placard had been put out by the ' Punch ' contributors , the object suffi - ciently obvious : to oppose
Gregory	PERSON	, who was notori - ous as a rascally blackmailer .


John Leech	PERSON	called on me in the morning to tell me of their purpose and to ask me to go .

		Of course I went , and took a friend with me ; and we got forward seats in the pit .

		Looking round I saw a lot of rough fellows who , I concluded , were hired as claquers for
Gregory	PERSON	, and was not with - out fears of a fierce conflict .

		The curtain drew up , and the action of the play began in all serenity ; but so soon as Hamlet appeared , an outcry , a burst of execration , rose so suddenly , and was so general , that one saw at once no opposition could make head against it .

		Hisses and hootings , cries of ' Off !

		Off !

		Blackguard !

		Scoun - drel ! '

		and the like , were hurled at the actor ; and the whole performance was stopped .

		Nothing was thrown except the storm of vociferation .

		Gregory faced it awhile , undauntedly impudent , then tried to make his voice heard in protest , but it was drowned in the roar of indignation .

		... At length he gave in , and as the curtain came down he seemed to cower and crouch be - neath .

		Then the manager came forward to withdraw the piece , and the conspirators went out to moisten their parched throats .

		Leech was hoarse for days . ''

		An amusing afterpiece to this tragi-comedy was the appearance of the noted pugilist ,
Jem Mace	PERSON	, as a witness in the suit for conspiracy brought by
Gregory	PERSON	against the Duke of
Bruns	PERSON	- wick , who , having been grossly assailed in '' The Satirist , '' took a leading part in the riot .

		Mace , too , had been present and prominently active . ''

		He did not deny the part he had taken , but denied
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 having been hired for the conspiracy .

		He was asked : ' What made you active in such a matter ?

		what inter - est had you in it ? '

		His interest , he replied , in public morality ; he could not help protesting against such a man disgracing the stage or words to that effect .

		The judge complimented him , and said he was glad to find so much public spirit in the parish in which he had his own residence . ''

		It is to be regretted that the tide of journalistic scurrility has even in
England	LOCATION	since risen to such a point that even the professional prow - ess of the high-minded Mr.
Mace	PERSON	would be as the broom of Mrs.
Partington	PERSON	to the
Atlantic	LOCATION	against it .

		Hastily running over a few of Mr.
Linton	PERSON	's briefer characterizations , we find
Bronson Al	PERSON	- cott set down as '' a strange , mystical , gentle old philosopher , very gracious , very wordy , rather incomprehensible '' ;
Walt Whitman	PERSON	as '' a fine-natured , good-hearted , big fellow , a true poet who could not write poetry , much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of form , perhaps ^ s fatal a mistake in a poet as in a painter '' ; Mme. Blavatsky as '' a fat , vulgar - looking woman , not , one could not help think - ing , at all likely to be mistaken for a prophet - ess , no sibyl , but a veritable old witch , with nothing venerable about her '' ; Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	as '' the highest poetic genius now living in
America	LOCATION	'' ; Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	-LRB- in
1861	DATE	-RRB- as '' a young man looking like a boy , and with a boy - ish manner , jumping about as he became ex - cited in speaking , yet interesting and attract - ive '' ; Place , the '' Westminster tailor , '' as a `` fierce Malthusian with a large family '' ; Ros - setti as '' an Italian of the time of the Medici , not without thoughts and superstitions of that period , a man of genius both in art and liter - ature , one , however , hindering the other , the literary predominating , and by which he will be best recollected '' ; and
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	as '' a good-looking , interesting old lady , very deaf , but cheerful and eager for news , which she did not always catch correctly . ''

		Of Miss Martineau Mr.
Linton	PERSON	adds : '' With all her manly self-dependence and strict inten - tional honesty , with all her credit for practical common sense , she was as much a poet as her brother , the Rev.
James	PERSON	; a romancer even in the region of economical facts , even in those hard ' Poor Law Tales , ' when under
Lord Brougham	PERSON	she was preparing to prove the neces - sity for the Poor Law Amendment Act , that crowning harshness of Whig rule .

		She has never had justice done to her on this ground of romance . ''

		In his chapter on American poets Mr.
Lin	PERSON	- ton quotes a letter from
Whittier	LOCATION	, written in reply to his request for the exact date of the latter 's birth , to which we beg to call the at - tention of the poet 's excellent biographer , Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	gives the date as '' the 17th of
December , 1807	DATE	'' ; but we find Whit - tier writing : '' My birthday was the very last of the year
1807	DATE	. ''

		Mr.
Linton	PERSON	's book is , as we have tried to show , lively , pleasantly discursive , and strongly individual in tone , its main fault being an oc - casional tendency to run reminiscence into a mere list of notable names .

		The pages on the Chartist agitation , its aims , its incidents , and its heroes , are of stable interest .

		Materially , the volume is a tasteful one ; and there is a fine portrait of the author , showing a most kindly and venerable face truly '' a face like a bene - diction . ''

		THE WAY OF THE GODS IN
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		* To an audience of Athenians on Mars ' Hill ,
Paul	PERSON	said : '' Ye men of
Athens	LOCATION	, I perceive that in all things ye are altogether supersti - tious . ''

		One might likewise stand before an audience of Japanese and say : '' Ye men of
Nippon	ORGANIZATION	, I perceive that in all things ye are alto - gether superstitious . ''

		For most faithfully and devoutly do the mass of the Japanese worship their innumerable deities , estimated with the indefinite expression , '' eighty myriads . ''

		And the relation between men and gods there is so familiar that the former , when calling the lat - ter to receive homage and hear prayer , use the same method , the clapping of the hands , that is employed in summoning servants .

		Thus , in
Japan	LOCATION	, deities are treated like domestics ; in
America	LOCATION	, domestics conduct themselves as if they were deities !

		And these Japanese gods are so numerous , so ubiquitous , and so demo - cratic , that Mr.
Percival Lowell	PERSON	, in his new book on ''
Occult Japan	LOCATION	, '' is '' tempted to in - clude them in the census , and to consider the population of
Japan	LOCATION	as composed of natives , globe-trotters , and gods . ''

		It was in an unexpected and strange way that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	himself , though a Western '' bar - barian , '' got into the presence of the gods , and , after that introduction , was enabled to culti - vate their acquaintance .

		He was ascending , for recreation , a sacred mount , named Ontake , when he fell in with three pilgrims , and became an uninvited spectator of a series of esoteric rites of divine incarnation .

		This interesting revela - tion led him into further investigation , and re - * OCCULT
JAPAN	LOCATION	; or , The Way of the Gods : An Esoteric Study of Japanese Personality and Possession .

		By
Percival Lowell	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, suited in a series of papers on '' Esoteric Shinto , '' read before the
Asiatic Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Japan	LOCATION	and published in the '' Transactions '' of that body .

		These papers , revised , together with about a hundred additional pages and four illustrations , make up ''
Occult Japan	LOCATION	, '' which is a very in - teresting and valuable contribution to the study of folk-lore , anthropology , and comparative re - ligion .

		This book contains a minute description of several '' miracles , '' such as '' the ordeal of boil - ing water , '' '' walking bare-foot over a bed of live coals , '' `` climbing a ladder of sword-blades , '' '' the descent of the thunder-god '' into a kettle of boiling rice , `` calling down fire from heaven '' to light the tobacco in a pipe , etc. .

		The last two were absolute '' fakes '' ; but the first three were actually performed in Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's pres - ence .

		The theory of the Japanese with refer - ence to miracles is that they can be performed only by those who are absolutely pure in body and heart , and who , to obtain that purity , have gone through with certain sacred rites .

		But that theory was demolished when Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's '' boy '' suddenly jumped out of the audience and climbed the ladder of sword-blades .

		The successful performance of these miracles is as - cribed by Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	to two things '' a thicker skin in the priests -LSB- the performers -RSB- and a thicker skull in the people . ''

		And it seems quite probable that '' doubtless credulity is the mother of miracles , but doubtless , also , with the far eastern family of them , a pachyderma - tous sole step-fathers the process .

		For most of them are questions of cuticle . ''

		From the miracle of walking barefoot on live coals an interesting `` moral '' has been evolved , and is thus explained by the high priest : '' The object of the rite is that the populace may see that the god when duly besought can take away the burning spirit of fire while permitting the body of it to remain .

		For so can he do with the hearts of men ; the bad spirit may be driven out and the good put in its place while still the man continues to exist . ''

		About one-third of the book is given up to the subject of '' incarnations , '' or '' possession by the gods . ''

		In order to enjoy a divine visit , human beings must be pure ; and the two chief exercises that induce purity are washings and fasting , '' ablution and abstinence . ''

		There are three forms in accordance with which a relig - ious trance is brought on ; the elaborate Rybbu ceremony , employed by those who have fol - lowed that confused mixture of Buddhism and Shinto ; the pure Buddhist ceremony , which is peculiar in that '' the god shows a preference for feminine lips '' ; and the pure Shinto cere - mony , which is plain and simple , and lacks the excessive ritual of the other two .

		The details of all these forms are fully described , and a very careful comparison is made by Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	.

		It is impossible to summarize this portion of his book , which must be read in toto ; but it is pos - sible to quote a characteristic passage or two : '' It -LSB- the pure Shinto ceremony -RSB- is nothing more or less than a divine banquet , with the god himself for an after-dinner speaker .

		The dinner is all-essential to the affair , as it is to all Shinto rites .

		For the Shinto prac - tice of dining its deities is not confined to the ceremony of possession .

		Wherever the gods are invoked , for any cause whatsoever , they are induced to descend by the prospect of a dinner .

		A repast stands perpetually pre - pared on all Shinto altars ; shrines being , to put it irrev - erently , free-lunch counters for deity , while every Shinto service is but a special banquet given some particular god .

		One comes to conceive of a Shinto god 's life as one continuous round of dining out .

		To induce an after - dinner mood in a god whom one wishes to propitiate is doubtless judicious . '' ''

		But such -LSB- shams -RSB- are easily exploded .

		An unex - pected pin in a tender part of the possessed 's body instantly does the business .

		For a god is sublimely su - perior to being made a pin-cushion of , while a mere man invariably objects to it . ''

		A chapter is devoted to pilgrimages and pil - grim clubs .

		The former are called '' peripa - tetic picnic parties , faintly flavored with piety '' ; and yet , with reference to Shinto , are '' more than foot-notes to its creed . ''

		The pilgrim clubs are '' not an imported institution , but a custom indigenous to
Japan	LOCATION	'' ; they contain generally a membership of from one hundred to five hun - dred persons , while the largest club has about twelve thousand members .

		These clubs are regularly officered and carefully managed ; and they send on the annual pilgrimages represen - tatives chosen by lot .

		The pilgrimage to Ise , where '' there is nothing to see , and they wo n't let you see it , '' is made in
spring	DATE	, '' when the cherries blow '' ; other pilgrimages are made in midsummer ; and at both seasons pilgrims and pilgrim clubs have '' the right of way . ''

		In the last hundred pages of the book is given a metaphysical discussion of hypnotism , trances , etc. , with special reference to '' things Japanese . ''

		There is an analysis of certain Japanese mental characteristics , such as lack of originality , un - common imitativeness , absence of reasoning , general incapacity for abstract ideas , and de - corous demeanor .

		There is also an application of the thought of the caviller who changed Pope 's well-known verse into the statement '' An honest god 's the noblest work of man . ''

		For Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	says of people 's gods : '' In their characters generally you shall see reflected
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 the race characteristics .

		In
Japan	LOCATION	the gods are
emi	ORGANIZATION	- nently Japanese .

		They are dignified , artistic , simple souls , of the most exceptional deportment .

		Their life is made up of one long chain of ornamental , if some - what conventional , moments . ''

		And , of course , the man who wrote '' The Soul of the Far East '' to prove that the Japanese , Chinese , and
Koreans	LOCATION	have no '' soul , '' no per - sonality , no individuality , finds in these relig - ious trances additional proof of that idea , and also of '' a curiously conceived impersonal kind of deity . ''

		En passant , Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	gives the following opinion of Buddhism : '' Emotionally its tenets do not at bottom satisfy us occidentals , flirt with them as we may .

		Passivity is not our passion , preach it as we are prone to do each to his neighbor .

		Scientifically , pessimism is foolishness , and impersonality a stage in development from which we are emerging , not one into which we shall ever relapse .

		As a dogma it is unfortunate , doing its devotee in the deeper sense no good , but it becomes positively faulty when it leads to practical ignoring of the mine and thine , and does other people harm . ''

		Having recently been treated to Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	's analysis of Shinto , we are delighted to have Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	give his idea of what Shinto is : '' To foreign students ... Shinto has seemed little better than the ghost of a belief , far too insubstantial a body of faith to hold a heart .

		To ticket its gods and pigeon-hole its folk-lore has appeared to be the end of a study of its cult . '' ''

		Shinto is the Japanese conception of the cosmos .

		It is a combination of the worship of nature and of their own ancestors ... To the Japanese eye , the universe itself took on the paternal look .

		Awe of their parents , which these people could comprehend , lent explanation to dread of nature , which they could not .

		Quite co - gently , to their minds , the thunder and the typhoon , the sunshine and the earthquake , were the work not only of anthropomorphic beings , but of beings ancestrally related to themselves .

		In short , Shinto ... is simply the patriarchal principle projected without perspective into the past , dilating with distance into deity . ''

		-LSB- Rather excessively alliterative ! -RSB- ''

		Shinto is thus an adoration of family wraiths , or of imputed family wraiths ; imaginaries of the first and the second order in the analysis of the universe . '' ''

		Shinto is so Japanese it will not down .

		It is the faith of these people 's birthright , not of their adoption .

		Its folk-lore is what they learned at the knee of the race-mother , not what they were taught from abroad .

		Buddhist they are by virtue of belief ; Shinto by virtue of being . ''

		In the
December	DATE	-LRB-
1894	DATE	-RRB- issue of '' The Pop - ular Science Monthly '' a scholarly Japanese gives his definition of Shinto as a religion of personal purity , of '' merry-making , '' of '' nai 've optimism . ''

		We now await with interest Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	's analyses of Shinto , Buddhism , and Confucianism , in his coming work on '' The Re - ligions of

ERNEST W. CLEMENT	PERSON	, EARLY
LONDON	LOCATION	THEATRES .

		* Mr.
T. Fairman Ordish	PERSON	's volume on '' Early London Theatres '' purports to be a '' theatrical history , '' a study of playhouses rather than plays , except where the latter are found to throw some fresh light on the evolution of the stage and the appurtenances .

		In spite of the author 's anti- quarian professions , there is a gratuitous and delightful strand of literary allusion running through the book , finally widening and expand - ing into a discussion of
Henslowe	PERSON	's Diary , dis - tinguished autographs ,
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's duel and the various appearances of his and Shake - speare 's plays , all of which is , to the average mind , more interesting than the bulk of the volume , and , indeed , is of a certain importance in establishing the topographical and archae - ological points in view . ''

		Rare old Ben '' comes in edgewise , with a frequency that needs , per - haps , no excuse when it is recalled how he bullies posterity for recognition .

		Though a tolerably good biography of him could be picked up along the way , there are other obiter dicta which are tantalizingly brief .

		Mr.
Ordish	PERSON	has a way of postponing many elusive matters till the '' end of the chapter , '' or '' the second volume '' which , we hasten to say , will treat more espe - cially of the Shakespearian theatres , Black - friars and
The Globe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The omission of these for the present is justified by the fact that the earliest playhouses were erected outside the town '' in the fields , '' owing to the '' official war '' that was waged against them as '' simi - naries of impiety . ''

		After describing the scaffolds and stages made in the streets for the representations of plays , before theatres were constructed , and ad - vancing the theory that the amphitheatres south of
London	LOCATION	and in
Cornwall	LOCATION	, where national sports and pastimes were cultivated , had more effect in determining the configuration of the early British theatre than did the arrangement of churches and their much-exploited miracle - plays and moralities , Mr.
Ordish	PERSON	considers in seven chapters The Theatre , the first
London	LOCATION	playhouse , where
Marlowe	PERSON	's '' Faustus '' and the old pre - Shakespearian `` Hamlet '' were given ; The Curtain , which had the longest existence of all the
London	LOCATION	playhouses , and was associated , probably , with the first '' Romeo '' and '' Every Man in his Humour '' ; the Sur - rey side , with its

Paris	LOCATION	Gar - den , and The Swan .

		The last chapter is a decided contribution to antiquarian research .

		As the author claims , '' the upshot is practi - cally to rescue from oblivion another of the old playhouses . ''

		The volume is replete with maps , illustrations , and reproductions of old prints ; and it is agreeably indexed .

		Abundant ac - knowledgments are made to the previous in - vestigations of Rendle and Halliwell-Phillipps .

		A glance through these chapters reveals anew how essential was the theatre to the social de - velopment of
England	LOCATION	.

		Only in the churches and in the playhouses did all sections of Eliz - abethan society meet ; and
Sunday	DATE	was the day set apart for the one as for the other , indeed , bear-baitings occurred regularly `` on the Son - dayes in the afternone after divine service . ''

		`` The people had become accustomed to the stimulus and pleasure of dramatic representa - tions ; and not the long tramp to
Finsbury Fields	ORGANIZATION	, not the roughness displayed by the groundlings nor the fact that idle and disso - lute characters inevitably haunted the play - house , nor even the real and terrible danger of the plague , could turn the Elizabethan play - goer from the pastime he loved . ''

		The city fathers little realized that the theatre was the outcome of the public sports which had been cultivated under their sanction and encourage - ment for many generations .

		Their repressive measures are less interesting to read about , be - cause less picturesque , than the diatribes of the clergy of the period .

		The offensive vituper - ation thrown off in the white heat of Puritan indignation , the inflated conviction of the pul - pit that '' the door of a play-house was equiv - alent to hell-mouth , '' is pictured in the racy sermonic extracts collated by Mr.
Ordish	PERSON	, and furnishes a convenient connecting link between Tertullian and Dr.
Herrick Johnson	PERSON	.

		The lover of theatrical gossip will here find many trivial but spicy incidents tucked away amid much learning .

		He will read , with a mod - ern zest which finally erases the gap of three hundred years , that '' apparently such a thing as a poorhouse was unknown at the first
London	LOCATION	theatre ; and assuredly the prices were pop - ular '' ; that
Nash	PERSON	's ''
Pierce Penilesse	PERSON	'' was witnessed by '' ten thousand spectators at least '' ; that The Theatre was finally taken down piece by piece and carried bodily to
Bankside	LOCATION	, where `` with the sayd timber and wood '' was erected the famous Globe .

		He will follow the ancient rivalries between The Theatre and The Curtain ,
The Globe	ORGANIZATION	and The Rose , as if he knew the several managers .

		He will finger the copper lace charged to the actors on Hens - lowe 's books .

		He will receive instructive hints as to certain scenes from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, as when he reads : '' You may be sure the wrest - ling match in ` As You Like It ' was no child 's play or stage business , but was watched with critical attention ; for it was an element brought into the play from the life of the people ... The existence of the playhouse implied a more highly organized celebration of the national plays and games . ''

		Thus the volume possesses an interest to the general reader as well as to the antiquarian .

		Its style is readable and pains - taking .

		It will doubtless be an authoritative reference-book on the subject of
London	LOCATION	play - houses '

		BOPES 'S HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR .

		* Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	has undertaken his '' Story of the Civil War '' in the spirit of the true historian .

		His plan , as stated by himself , is `` to write of the subjects treated from the standpoint of each of the contending parties . '' ''

		In my judg - ment , '' he adds , '' the war should not be so de - picted as to imply that the North and the South differed and quarreled about the same things .

		This was not the fact .

		The questions presented to the men of the North were not the same as those with which their Southern contemporaries had to deal . ''

		Whether or not we fully agree with this last statement , it is evident that this book is not written in the interest of either combatant or of any theory .

		A vast mass of material for the history of the war has been contributed in the form of personal experiences and partisan accounts .

		We are now far enough away from the passions of the time to allow both scholarly writing and unprejudiced reading about the great struggle .

		Though claiming to be simply a narrative of the military events of the war , this first volume , at least , is largely taken up with a description of the political situation in
1860	DATE	and
1861	DATE	, and the inter-relations of politics and the military plans and operations .

		THE DIAL 49 the views of the sections as to the relation of the States and
the Nation	ORGANIZATION	.

		The South claimed and believed that the
United States	LOCATION	was not a single nation , but a collection of nations , united by a treaty known as the Constitution .

		Though the question has been settled now adversely to this position , it was honestly maintained by the vast majority of the men of the South , and formed the basis of their political thought and action ; from it the right of Secession naturally fol - lowed .

		The North as honestly believed that the
United States	LOCATION	, whatever they may have been in
1789	DATE	, constituted but one nation in
1861	DATE	, and so denied the right of Secession as destructive of the nation they loved .

		These differences were irreconcilable .

		The Southern - ers were fighting for the integrity of their na - tions against ruthless Northern aggression ; the Northerners fought to preserve the integrity of the nation they loved .

		The conflict was such as to kindle the patriotic feelings of both the contending parties .

		And though the North considered the war a Rebellion , it was in fact a war between nations , a war of conquest , and was so waged .

		It was not a rising for the re - dress of grievances , with two parties corre - sponding to the Patriots and the Loyalists of the Revolution ; it was substantially a unani - mous rising in behalf of their imperilled na - tions , and as such was a patriotic war .

		This may be a rather strong putting of the actual case , yet there is enough foundation for it to free from the moral guilt of treason those who resigned from the Federal service to go with their States .

		It was their duty to go with their States , if they believed their allegiance to be - long there first ; and the treatment which the Southern leaders received , whether as prison - ers or after their defeat , corresponded with this view .

		The question of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	forts is taken up in the second chapter ; and here , as on the general question of the War , Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	de - clares that the positions of the parties were so utterly opposed that all criticism of one from the standpoint of the other is illegitimate and valueless .

		What the positions were can be readily inferred from the general theories above noted .

		But in any case the seizure was really an act of war which was thus begun before any hostile act had been committed by the na - tional government and justifiable only as a necessity in view of impending war .

		In dis - cussing the reinforcement of
Fort Sumter	LOCATION	, Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	seems to criticize rather harshly Major
Anderson	PERSON	's failure to ask for more troops , in view of the hostile preparations making against the fort by
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and especially because he used the words '' my policy '' in speaking of his disinclination to precipitate the outbreak of open hostilities .

		He gave the gov - ernment full information as to his situation ; he had been given full discretion ; if the govern - ment had wished to press matters to a conclu - sion , it was open to it to do so .

		The respon - sibility should and does rest upon the govern - ment at the centre , where broad plans were to be matured , rather than on a subordinate offi - cer immured within the narrow walls of a fort - ress .

		Besides , Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	acknowledges that the outcome was better , all responsibility for the outbreak being thrown upon the South , and in such a way as to evoke a most astonishing outburst of patriotic enthusiasm throughout the North when Sumter fell .

		One notes with interest , and with a query , the author 's statement that the men of the South had greater aptitude for war than their opponents .

		They loved it , and entered upon it with the enthusiasm that brings success .

		To the men of the North , on the other hand , war was wholly distasteful ; they went into it wholly from a sense of duty , but with a grim determination to win , and to punish those who were to blame for it .

		The several advantages and disadvantages of the respective sections are clearly described .

		The chapter on the Battle of Bull Run is perhaps the best in the book .

		Here the au - thor 's peculiar skill as a military historian and critic shows itself .

		Without loading his de - scription with detail , he has clearly presented the plans of the commanders , the disposition of the respective forces , and the movement of the battle , in a masterly way ; and his criticisms seem just .

		The defeat of the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	forces he considers a deserved punishment for the folly of the administration in forcing an ag - gressive battle with raw levies , when nothing of permanent importance was to be gained by victory .

		We pass over the discussion of plans and preparations in
East	LOCATION	and West , to note Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	's estimates of some of the prominent characters of the war .

		General
Buell	PERSON	he con - siders the ablest soldier by far that the period produced , equal to
McClellan	PERSON	as an organizer and disciplinarian , far superior '' in military sagacity , in clear and unprejudiced vision , and in decision of character . ''


Buell	PERSON	's comprehen - sive plan of operations was rejected by Lincoln and
McClellan	PERSON	on one side and
Halleck	PERSON	on the 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, other , only to be followed at last when its wis - dom had been proved by the failure of the rival plans .

		Only a part of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's melancholy career belongs to the period covered by this volume , but the great change from unbounded popularity and confidence to distrust and dis - satisfaction appears long before the campaign of
1862	DATE	is entered upon .

		Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	does not blame
McClellan	PERSON	for deferring extensive oper - ations against the enemy until
spring	DATE	, for he considers the army unready for a great aggres - sive campaign without long drill and the devel - opment of a true military spirit .

		But he does blame him for his neglect of opportunities for easily recovering the confidence of the country and improving the spirit of his troops , for his indecision and lack of enterprise , for his flat dis - obedience of orders in leaving
Washington	LOCATION	insuf - ficiently protected when he transferred his army to the
Peninsula	LOCATION	, and especially for his unfortun - ate tendency to be governed by his imagination , which was uncommonly active , rather than by common sense .

		Referring to his insistence upon
Buell	PERSON	's movement into
East Tennessee	LOCATION	against disadvantages amounting almost to im - possibilities , the author says : '' Nothing shows more clearly the imaginative side of
McClellan	PERSON	's mind , and his absolute inability to take any interest in or bestow any careful thought upon any sub - ject that did not appeal to his imagination , than this curious letter ... But it is plain that none of these things -LSB- the difficulties -RSB- even entered the mind of Gen - eral
McClellan	PERSON	.

		His head was full of his own campaign in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and nothing interested him that was not , or might not be supposed in some way to be , related to his own operations there .

		And , as a sort of justification for his decision , he had conjured up before his imagin - ation a vision of an eager and grateful population , in half of the States of the Confederacy , flocking to the
Union	LOCATION	standard as soon as it should be unfurled on the mountains of
East Tennessee	LOCATION	, and of ' immense results ' therefrom arising . ''

		And elsewhere he says : ''
McClellan	PERSON	's imagination was , in fact , always carry - ing him away from the facts before him , always induc - ing him to see things in distorted shapes and some - times , as we shall see later , impelling him to do things which he would not have done had he from the first resolutely determined never to let himself be ruled by his fancies and his prejudices . ''

		Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	's treatment of President Lincoln is unsympathetic , and , perhaps unconsciously , depreciatory . ''

		Puerile impatience , '' '' singu - lar orders , '' '' this extraordinary production , '' '' this is really ludicrous in its minimizing of the facts of the situation -LSB- of his proclamation after the fall of Fort Sumter -RSB- , '' `` Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's serious defects as an administrator , as a man of affairs , '' `` futile and useless suggestions , '' '' lack of confidence and of ordinary courtesy , '' such are the terms in which he allows him - self to speak of the President and his acts , while speaking admiringly only of his political sagacity .

		The facts he himself presents do not seem to warrant the expressions used ; while the full history of the times , as it is disclosed , only increases our admiration for him who bore the crushing burden of the government , and places him higher upon the world 's calendar of really great men .

		We have reason to be grateful to Mr.
Ropes	PERSON	for this work , and shall look for the remaining volumes with keen expectation .

		It is in the best sense popular , being clear , untechnical , free from confusing details , and at the same time based on ample research and written in a judicial spirit .

		THE DIAL 51 observation and kindly satire , in the unwonted fin - ish of its style and the delicacy of its characteriza - tion , best of all , in its persistent exaltation of cer - tain old-fashioned ideals of conduct and conceptions of life that are apt to get crowded below the hori - zon of such men of the world as Mr.
Warner	PERSON	.

		This is the eternal difficulty in fiction .

		The young writer may have the fine enthusiasms and the first literary instincts , but he is only beginning his acquaintance with life , and he can not describe it with force and discernment .

		On the other hand , the writer who knocks about in the world rarely escapes the con - tagion of its slow stain , and most often comes to know life only at the expense of the freshness of his ideals .

		It was because Mr.
Warner	PERSON	, in his first attempt at extended fiction-writing , seemed to show that it was possible to avoid impalement upon the horn of this dilemma , to prove that the mellow - ness of experience might be gained without loss of faith in the nobler human impulses , it was for these reasons that the story was notable .

		We are justi - fied in making these remarks about an old book in a review of '' Recent Fiction '' for the simple reason that they are quite as applicable to one of the new - est of novels to '' The
Golden House	ORGANIZATION	, '' which is , in fact , a continuation of the story published five years ago .

		Here is traced for us the career of
Hen	ORGANIZATION	- derson from his second marriage to his death .

		Wealthier and wealthier he grows , and with each step gained recedes farther and farther from the reach of our sympathies .

		No one recognizes better than himself the uselessness and hopelessness of the whole struggle , but he can not shape his character anew .

		The fierce excitement of the earlier stages in his career of worldly success has long since sub - sided , and he continues to amass wealth only by a sort of dull instinct , and because there is nothing else in the world for him to do .

		Finally , death strikes him unexpectedly , and he passes from the scene unmourned , save by those whose selfish inter - ests are jeopardized by his undiscounted taking-off .

		But the sympathy that we can not feel for
Hender	PERSON	- son finds among the other characters ample scope for action .

		There are the self-sacrificing workers among the slums for Mr.
Warner	PERSON	makes effective use of the contrast between the
New York	LOCATION	of fash - ion and frivolity and the
New York	LOCATION	of toil and de - gradation and there is the heroine of the story ,
Edith Delancey	PERSON	, who keeps her soul sweet and pure amidst the enervating and corrupting influences of her environment , and whose love finally prevails to save her husband 's weaker soul from ruin .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's style is at its mellowest and best in this novel .

		How good it is , and how delicately it can satirize the foibles of the society that its master has had so much practice in delineating , must be illus - trated by one short extract . ''

		Edith 's day had been as busy as
Jack	PERSON	's , notwith - standing she had put aside several things that demanded her attention .

		She denied herself the morning attend - ance on the Literature Class that was raking over the eighteenth century .

		This week Swift was to be ar - raigned .

		The last time when
Edith	PERSON	was present it was
Steele	PERSON	.

		The judgment , on the whole , had been favor - able , and there had been a little stir of tenderness among the bonnets over
Thackeray	PERSON	's comments on the Christian soldier .

		It seemed to bring him near to them . '

		Poor
Dick Steele	PERSON	, ' said the essayist .

		Edith declared afterwards that the large woman who sat next to her , Mrs.
Jerry Hollowell	PERSON	, whispered to her that she always thought his name was Bessemer ; but this was , no doubt , a pleas - antry .

		It was a beautiful essay , and so stimulating !

		And then there was bouillon , and time to look about at the toilets .

		Poor
Steele	PERSON	, it would have cheered his life to know that a century after his death so many beauti - ful women , exquisitely dressed , would have been con - cerning themselves about him .

		The function lasted two hours .

		Edith made a little calculation .

		In five min - utes she could have got from the encyclopaedia all the facts in the essay , and while her maid was doing her hair she could have read five times as much of
Steele	PERSON	as the essayist read .

		And , somehow , she was not stim - ulated , for the impression seemed to prevail that now
Steele	PERSON	was disposed of .

		And she had her doubts whether literature would , after all , prove to be a permanent so - cial distraction .

		But
Edith	PERSON	may have been too severe in her judgment .

		There was probably not a woman in the class that day who did not go away with the knowl - edge that
Steele	PERSON	was an author , and that he lived in the eighteenth century .

		The hope of the country is in the diffusion of knowledge . ''

		The name of
Thackeray	PERSON	occurs in the above extract ; let us take the hint , and say at once that
Thackeray	PERSON	himself could not have done .

		this particular thing any better than Mr.
Warner	PERSON	has done it .

		A final word must be given to Mr.
W. T. Smedley	PERSON	's illus - trations , which are conspicuously excellent , both for drawing and for sympathy .

		Writer and artist would appear to have seen the same things with the same eyes , so complete is the understanding between them .

		It is a pleasure to welcome Mr. Cable the novel - ist once more , for reasons both positive and negative .

		The positive reason is , of course , that Mr.
Cable	PERSON	is one of the half dozen best writers of fiction that
America	LOCATION	has produced ; the negative reason is that in re-welcoming the novelist we may hope to have seen the last of the doctrinaire writer upon the great Race Question of the New South .

		Let Mr.
Cable	PERSON	incorporate that question into his novels as much as he will -LRB- and he has made considerable use of it in the present instance -RRB- , but he will do well to avoid it as a subject for further serious discussion . ''


John March	PERSON	, Southerner '' is the story of a young man who was born in the late fifties , and who thus grew up to manhood during the period of reconstruction .

		We first meet him as a child at the time of Lee 's sur - render , and we part with him in early manhood , a citizen of the New South of our own days .

		This scheme enables the writer to place before our eyes a series of graphic pictures , enlivened by humor , pathos , and dramatic episode , of the typical phases in the emergence of the new regime from the old .

		There is first the blank despair of defeat , then the slowly reawakening will , then the advent of the carpet-bagger and the hideous period of negro mis - rule ; last of all , there is the acceptance of the new 52 -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, conditions , the recognition by the superior race of its responsibilities accompanied by the reassertion of its intelligence , and the effort to develope the material resources of a land lagging half a century behind the rest of civilization .

		This is the series of pictures that Mr.
Cable	PERSON	has drawn for us , and illustrated by types of character appropriate to the scene .

		It is true that the pictures are too often mere flash-light photographs , which leave us be - wildered in the endeavor to connect them in logical sequence , and that the broad general outlines of the characters are not readily decipherable ; but the book contains such a wealth of happily conceived detail , and so hurries us on from one pleasant surprise to another , that we are not disposed to criticize very harshly its failure to impress the reader as a har - monious and well - cemented whole .

		Besides , all readers of Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's other novels know that this is precisely the failure most characteristic of their author . ''

		When All the Woods Are Green '' is a sweet and wholesome story of love and adventure in the forests of
Eastern Canada	LOCATION	.

		Three weeks of camp - ing and salmon-fishing , enjoyed by a family party on the one hand , and an adventitious young man on the other , furnish the sufficient setting for this tale .

		It need hardly be added that the family of campers provides a suitable heroine , and that the young man in question becomes less and less adventitious as the story runs on .

		The element of adventure is supplied , first by an opportune bear , and later by an attempt at murder on the part of one of the natives .

		But neither the bear nor the native is per - mitted to introduce an element of tragedy into the situation , although the latter comes dangerously near doing so .

		It may be objected that too book - ish a character is often given to the conversation , and occasional verbal infelicities , such as the objec - tionable preposition '' onto '' and the equally objec - tionable adverb '' illy , '' may be pointed out .

		But these are trifling defects in a narrative which is charmingly set forth as a whole , and which displays remarkable powers of quiet incisive characterization .

		There is an even excellence about this , as about all of Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's literary work , which makes minute criticism captious , and which , combined with light - ness of touch , and sympathetic handling of the ma - terial , makes us feel that we are in good company , and wish that the acquaintance might be prolonged .

		When the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	shall have been born and we hope some day to chronicle that happy occurrence it will become interesting to trace its spiritual genesis , not merely in the mind and heart of its creator , but in the antecedent liter - ature which shall have been tending toward so great a consummation .

		Many earlier attempts , to our present purblind vision seemingly abortive , will then be seen to have contained within themselves the germ of the flower so long hoped for , to have dis - played flashes of insight into the essential nature of the problem so long unsolved .

		If , then , some student of comparative literary embryology shall chance to exhume from the mould of the year now just ended a novel called `` The Honorable
Peter Stirling	PERSON	, '' the work of Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	, we fancy that he will recognize it as having been one of the precur - sors of the final triumph , as having had some dim glimpses , at least , of the aim that the Great Amer - ican Novelist is bound to have in view .

		For that aim must be , must it not ?

		to plunge into the heart of American life , to converge upon some focal sit - uation the various streams of social energy that per - form the functions of the organism .

		It will not be easy to determine exactly what elements should con - tribute to such a synthesis , but it may be confidently asserted , at least , that the political element can not be spared .

		For good or for evil we possess as a nation the political instinct as few nations have ever possessed it .

		Now Mr.
Ford	PERSON	has seized upon this truth , and has made politics the mainspring of his book .

		His hero , who is one of the strongest and most vital characters that have appeared in our fic - tion , is first and foremost a politician .

		Plunged in the thick of
New York	LOCATION	politics , coming into close contact with all sorts of political types , even the most degraded , not shrinking from any task , how - ever disagreeable , he shows us by his example how a man may keep clean in the worst surroundings , and emphasises the lesson that it is only by tempo - rarily accepting politics as they are that we can hope eventually to make them what they should be .

		The implied rebuke to those who merely scold , sit - ting aloof in the seat of the scornful , is all the more severe because it is conveyed only by implication .

		To discern the soul of good in so evil a thing as municipal politics calls for sympathies that are not often united with a sane ethical outlook ; but
Peter Stirling	PERSON	is possessed of the one without losing his sense of the other , and it is this combination of qualities that makes of him so impressive and ad - mirable a figure .

		The book is not all politics .

		A very charming love-story relieves the harshness of the central theme .

		Numerous minor types flit in and out of the scene , and the scene itself shifts often enough to afford an agreeable variety .

		But the main interest attaches , after all , to the `` practical ideal - ist '' of the title , a figure far from prepossessing at the outset , but gaining steadily upon the affections and the esteem as the story pursues its course . ''

		The Honorable
Peter Stirling	PERSON	'' is not the Great Amer - ican Novel for several reasons .

		Its style is very faulty , for one thing , and the writer 's touch is heavy where it should be light , for another .

		But it is both a readable and an ethically helpful book , remarkable as coming from a writer without train - ing -LRB- as far as we know -RRB- in the art of fiction , and hence deserving of cordial commendation .

		Some time ago , Mr.
Herbert Ward	PERSON	wrote a story in which the President of the
United States	LOCATION	, in - veigled on board of a swift cruiser , was kidnapped and held for ransom .

		More recently , Mr. ''
Anthony Hope	PERSON	'' has told the story of a German monarch ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 53 also feloniously entrapped , whose place was taken by a man strikingly similar in appearance , the sub - jects of the prince remaining unconscious of the de - ception .

		We do not say that Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	, the au - thor of '' The Double Emperor , '' has actually taken his story from these sources , but it is a theory hardly to be avoided by anyone who has read the two tales in question .

		In this case , the Emperor of Lusatia -LRB- read
Germany	LOCATION	-RRB- is the victim of the kidnappers , who are enterprising Americans , and who carry out their nefarious scheme through the innocent offices of one
Esek Hoodlum	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, who was once a fellow-student with the Emperor , who has his confi - dence , and who writes articles about him f or ''
Scrarp	PERSON	- ner 's Magazine . ''

		It was really a little unkind to rechristen Mr.
Poultney Bigelow	PERSON	with so very ob - jectionable a name , to say nothing of representing him as so extremely gullible as he here appears .

		But this is merely parenthetical .

		The Emperor 's double is a young cavalry officer , who has been trained to personate his master , and thereby relieve the latter from attendance upon all sorts of Lusatian cere - monials .

		The abduction of the real Emperor , con - sequently , fails to produce the intended effect , for no one discovers that he has been abducted until after his escape , return , and proclamation of the fact .

		This outline of a wildly improbable but fairly interesting story gives the main facts , but no idea of how ingeniously the details are worked out .

		It is purely a story of incident and adventure , with nothing that bears the remotest resemblance to de - lineation of character .

		Indeed , so wooden a collec - tion of puppets are not often worked by a novelist .

		Of course , it all ends happily , and the villainous
Colonel Snaggs	PERSON	, the arch-plotter , meets with a just retribution for his crimes .

		The irruption of the Scotsman into literature is one of the most noteworthy of present-day move - ments .

		We do not now refer to
Stevenson	PERSON	and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, who long ago became cosmopolitans , but to such writers as Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	, ''
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	, '' and Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	, all of whom remain intensely local , at least in their most characteristic produc - tions .

		It is to the latter of the three , the chronicler of
Galloway	PERSON	, that our attention is just now directed by `` The Lilac Sunbonnet , '' a novel that seems to us distinctly superior to anything yet done by the annalist of Thrums .

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	very frankly calls this book '' a love-story , '' and a love-story it is , charming and unabashed .

		It has , moreover , the setting of Scotch landscape and the background of a narrow and disputatious theology that have been turned to effective account by many a love-story teller before , from the author of `` The Heart of Mid -
Lothian	LOCATION	'' to the author of `` A Daughter of
Heth	PERSON	. ''

		The account of that remnant of the faithful , the `` true
Kirk	PERSON	of God in
Scotland	LOCATION	; commonly called the Marrow
Kirk	PERSON	, '' is as delightful a piece of the - ological characterization as we have often met with , although it verges upon the burlesque when the two men who constitute the entire ministry of the com - munion are made solemnly to depose one another from office , thus leaving '' the
Kirk o	PERSON	' the Marrow , precious and witnessing , '' without any head at all .

		But our main concern is , after all , with the two young people whose love-story goes on in spite of the dangers impending over the kirk , and who are , in fact , unwittingly the cause of so close an approach to so disastrous an extinction .

		It is a story told in prose by one who is a poet at heart ; who permits his pen to rhapsodize when ordinary prose would be inadequate , but who never goes too far in exu - berant expression , and rounds up every sentimental passage with some sly or shrewdly satirical observa - tion that leaves one in doubt whether to laugh or to weep .

		`` It is a fallacy common among girls that young men desire them as sisters '' Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	's satire has no shafts more keenly-pointed than this .

		Even the dialect talk which he uses is so manifestly accurate , so brimming over with life and humor , that we can not find a harsh name for it , albeit there is no slight difficulty in its comprehension , and it represents a prevalent literary tendency that ought to be frowned upon .

		After writing something like a score of novels , the most fertile of inventions is likely to flag ; and we are not surprised to find in '' The People of the Mist '' a rearrangement of the materials already exploited in '' She , '' ''
King Solomon	PERSON	's Mines , '' and ''
Montezuma	ORGANIZATION	's Daughter . ''

		From the first two of these ingenious productions Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	has bor - rowed the mysterious African people isolated from the rest of the world , the rock excavations , and the colossal statue carved from the mountain-side ; from the latter he has taken the whole framework of the new romance .

		In fact , so obvious a reproduction of one 's former self passes the bounds of the permis - sible .

		And yet , such is the instinctive craving of the normally-constituted mind for adventure and romantic happenings generally , thousands of read - ers will become absorbed in the fortunes of Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	's newest heroes , while recognizing almost every incident as hackneyed , and while realizing the slipshod style of the narrative , or rather its total lack of anything that is properly to be called style .

		Even the cheap device of astonishing an untutored people by the display of firearms is once more pressed into service , while the old trick of posing for gods with a barbarous tribe is the mainspring of the action .

		It is all very familiar , but it is also very thrilling , and boys of most ages will welcome the story in spite of its many imperfections .

		A story of even greater improbability than that just described is the work of Mr.
Edward T. Bouve	PERSON	' , and is entitled '' Centuries Apart . ''

		Since , in the case of `` The Double Emperor , '' we have ventured to construct a possible line of literary descent , a sim - ilar suggestion may by allowed in the present in - stance .

		The elements of '' Centuries Apart '' might have been derived from three books : Mr.
Marriott	PERSON	-
Watson	PERSON	's '' Marahuna , '' Mr.
Murray	PERSON	's '' Gobi or
Shamo	PERSON	, '' and Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	's `` A Yankee at the 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, .

		Court of King
Arthur	PERSON	. ''

		The first of these novels supplies the idea of mysterious lands beyond the Antarctic ice-barrier , the second that of an old civ - ilization preserved by being cut off from the 1 rest of the world , and the third that of bringing an enter - prising American into contact with the life of me - diaeval
England	LOCATION	.

		To show how these incongruous ideas have been combined , a sketch of Mr.
Bouv	PERSON	^ 's plot is necessary .

		An American squadron , des - patched during our Civil War to a
Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	station by way of
Cape Horn	LOCATION	, is driven southward by a fierce storm , and finds its way through a hith - erto unknown passage into an open Antarctic sea .

		Here a continent is discovered , and found to be peo - pled by fifteenth-century Englishmen , who , a few years after the Tudor victory of
Bosworth Field	ORGANIZATION	, had sought a home in the new world just discovered by one
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	, and who had , like their followers of the nineteenth century , been driven by storms to the land of Mr.
Bouves	PERSON	extremely ro - mantic tale .

		By these ingenious inventions , two civilizations of four '' centuries apart '' are brought together by the author .

		We will leave the details of this meeting to be gathered from the book itself , adding only that the plot is developed with much skill , that it includes many thrilling happenings , and that it is set forth with no slight degree of literary art .

		Indeed , it is a tale distinctly out of the com - mon , and its materials , while not absolutely fresh in fiction , are at least not of the overworked sort that we recognize in ninety - nine novels out of every hundred .

		The writer who nowadays achieves a popular suc - cess is pretty sure to make hay while the sun shines , but such assiduity in the field as has recently been displayed by the author of '' The Prisoner of Zenda '' is to say the least uncommon , even in these days of swift and easy composition .

		Besides many contribu - tions to the magazines , this most industrious of hay - makers promptly put forth '' A Change of
Air	ORGANIZATION	, '' which we reviewed some weeks ago , and '' The
Dolly Dialogues	PERSON	, '' a clever production that must at least be mentioned .

		Besides these things , we note the simultaneous appearance of two new novels , '' The God in the Car '' and '' The Indiscretion of the Duchess . ''

		The former of these books derives its odd title from the Car of Juggernaut , as that vehicle exists in popular fancy , moving resistlessly forward , and crushing all who come in its way .

		The '' God '' who presides over this destruction is an Englishman of the type exemplified by Mr.
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, who is engaged in the promotion of a great African Company , and whose resolute will shrinks from nothing in the accomplishment of its purpose .

		The story is almost wholly one of conversation , is fairly rapid in its movement , and contrives to in - terest us in a dozen people without making us feel that any one of them is a real or even a possible character . ''

		The Indiscretion of the Duchess '' may be de - scribed in much the same terms as the above , al - though it has an added element of romantic adven - ture , and displays a piquant ingenuity of invention .

		It is all very impossible and very fascinating ; its secret seems to lie in the fact that the reader is kept constantly alert for new developments , which are never quite what is anticipated .

		Like all the rest of the author 's books , it provides capital entertain - ment and is not in the least fatiguing . ''

		Amygdala : A Tale of the Greek Revolution '' is a pretty story by Mrs.
Edmonds	PERSON	, a writer already well-known for other studies of the interesting pe - riod of modern history with which this tale is con - cerned .

		We read in these pages of an Englishman who , following
Byron	PERSON	's noble example , devotes his fortune and his life to the Greek cause , and who , happier than the poet , lives to see
Greece	LOCATION	freed from the Turk .

		Bound up with the patriotic motive is the motive of love , for the Englishman becomes enamored of the daughter of a village pappas , and finds in her affection an additional reason for activ - ity in behalf of the Greek cause .

		The outcome of the story is tragic , although the tragedy is chastened and purified by the sacrifice of the heroine .

		The '' Sibylla '' of Sir
H. S. Cunningham	PERSON	evinces some training in the art of fiction , and the capacity to produce a conventional , well-bred , and fairly readable novel of English society .

		The taste and style of the writer are good enough to bear the weight of material which is exceedingly hackneyed , consisting , for the most part , of the career of an English gentleman in politics , diversified by a secret stain upon the family honor , which casts a tempo - rary cloud over his domestic happiness .

		The lead - ing character is of a type far from sympathetic , but it doubtless exists , and its present portrayal is not devoid of interest .

		The pun so obviously suggested by the title of
M. Zola	PERSON	's latest novel is amply justified by the mat - ters with which the document deals .

		The events of five days are told in as many hundreds of pages , and nothing is spared us of detail .

		We start from
Paris	LOCATION	to
Lourdes	LOCATION	in the first chapter , and with the closing pages we return .

		On the way to the famous resort , nearly every conceivable variety of loath - some disease is exhibited with brutal realism .

		When we reach
Lourdes	LOCATION	, the various types that throng the place are passed in review one by one , and we are invited to contemplate , in strange juxtaposition , the various aspects of scepticism and credulity , of sor - did commercialism and of mystical fervor .

		It must be admitted that to read the book is almost equiv - alent to making the journey .

		One can no more forget the one than the other .

		There are also de - tached scenes of great power and scattered passages of a beauty so marked that even the English trans - lation can not miss it .

		M. Zola is particularly happy , here as in '' Le Reve , '' as an interpreter of the mys - tical quality of religious faith .

		But there is little to be said for the novel as a work of constructive art .

		The two characters who are intended to supply the nucleus of the interest are conceived with force 1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL and sympathy , but their lives are mixed up with , yet not logically related to , so bewildering a mass of episode that they do not emerge as they ought to .

		It is the old story ;
M. Zola	PERSON	gives us most of the elements of art ; he fails to give us the synthetic structure .

		His pages teem with life actual , vis - ible , palpitating - but the one step beyond is not taken , and the one supreme effect not attained .

		The name of the foremost Hungarian novelist has become increasingly familiar to our public dur - ing the last two or three years , a fact more largely due to the recent celebration of the writer 's jubilee than to any wide introduction of his works to our readers .

		It must be said , in fact , that
Jdkai	PERSON	has not yet been translated sufficiently to enable us to judge of the value of his achievement .

		Of his hundred and fifty odd pieces of fiction , but a very few have been put into English garb , and it must be admitted that those few do not account for his great reputa - tion .

		That reputation , when duly sifted , will doubt - less be found to contain elements of many sorts , and to the patriotic rather than to the strictly literary elements we shall be forced to look to understand the main strength of his position among his coun - trymen .

		The mere bulk of his work is imposing , and Hungarians must take much pride in the pos - session of so prolific a writer ; and besides this , his activity as a citizen has been associated with those political movements of the past half-century which have appealed most forcibly to the Magyar heart .

		The latter proposition is illustrated by the novel pub - lished in
1890	DATE	, crowned by the Hungarian Academy as the best novel of that year , and now translated into English by Mr.
R. Nisbet Bain	PERSON	.

		In '' Eyes Like the Sea '' there is quite as much of autobiography as of fiction .

		The author refers to himself by name , tells of his patriotic activities during the great rev - olutionary year , of his wooing and his married life .

		But with this personal narrative there is twined an obviously fictitious thread , upon which hang the fortunes of an extraordinary young woman named Bessy the possessor of the eyes of sea-like hue and depth who takes to herself five successive hus - bands , and who dies in prison under a life sentence for the murder of the last .

		There is something fas - cinating about the story of this erratic young woman , in spite of the gross improbability of most of the things done by her , and the author 's pictures of the struggle of
1848	DATE	are extremely vivid .

		These are the merits of what is otherwise a harum-scarum story , which is not , we must add , translated into even acceptable English .

		A new translation of
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's novels is a thing to be welcomed , but enthusiasm is at least tempered by the discovery that ''
SynnOve Solbak	PERSON	- ken , '' the first volume issued , is but an old transla - tion revamped , and by the further fact that the announcement makes no promise of
Herr Bjiirn	PERSON	- son 's two most important novels , '' Det
Flager	PERSON	i Byen og paa Havnen '' and '' Paa
Gud	ORGANIZATION	's Veje . ''

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	is to edit the series , and sup - plies this first volume with a rambling essay of some seventy-five pages , in which we find a sketch of
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's life and literary production , and some attempt to correlate his activities with those of his home and foreign contemporaries .

		We do not expect accuracy from Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, and hence are not surprised to read that '' SynnOve Solbakken '' was first turned into English in
1870	DATE	.

		In point of fact , it was translated -LRB- or rather paraphrased -RRB- by
Mary Howitt	PERSON	in
1858	DATE	. ''

		Norsk Folkebled '' and '' Tourganieff '' are probably printer 's errors , but we are not so sure of '' Frakerk '' for '' Frakark , '' and ''
Sigurd	PERSON	the Bastard '' is not admissible for ''
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	. ''

		Moreover , we are told that this great work is a poem , although it is about nine - tenths prose .

		But we may even forgive these things in view of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's recognition of the rank of ''
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	'' among the works of its author .

		He says : '' In all the various repertory of
Bjorn	PERSON	- son , there is perhaps no single work in which so high a level of technical excellence is aimed at , and at the same time so harmonious and dignified a result obtained .

		Looking over the twenty-five or thirty volumes which
Bjornson	PERSON	has presented to the public , there is probably not one from which , in
Landor	LOCATION	's phrase , there is less for criticism ` to pare away ' than from '
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	. ' ''

		This is strictly true . ''

		Sigurd Slembe '' is the greatest of
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's works , and , with the possible exception of '' Brand , '' the greatest work in all Norwegian literature .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	makes a number of com - parisons between
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	and Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, , some of which are intelligible and some not .

		To this second category belongs the statement , made after some remarks about the cold and self-restrained manner of the latter poet , that ``
Bjornson	PERSON	would die in such an atmosphere , like an eagle in a
Leyden	PERSON	jar '' The italics are ours .

		One more perplexing statement deserves attention .

		Speaking of ''
Kon	PERSON	- gen , '' Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	says : '' Few even of
Bjornson	PERSON	's admirers appreciated it at first . ''

		Then comes the following foot-note : '' The present writer was among them , and published certain remarks for which -LRB- be - ing grown older and wiser -RRB- he would now do pen - ance , in a white sheet . ''

		This is all clear enough ^ but we can not reconcile it with Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's final estimate of the work in question , when he says that , '' as one reads ' The
King	PERSON	' to-day , it is difficult to realize how so brilliant an intellectual extravaganza , so daring a political dream , should have failed to fascinate us from the first . ''

		If Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	hopea ever to be taken seriously as a critic or as a scholar , he must reform his slipshod methods , in
Hamlet	LOCATION	's phrase , '' altogether . ''

		56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		some sound and B ?

		ks of sound and readable musical readable musical criticism are rare , and we commend criticism .

		Mr w F Apthorp 's nine essays , collectively called '' Musicians and Music-Lovers '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , as one of the best books of its class .

		The musicians to whom these essays give individual treatment are
Bach	ORGANIZATION	,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	,
Meyerbeer	ORGANIZATION	,
Offenbach	ORGANIZATION	,
Franz	LOCATION	,
Dresel	PERSON	, and
John Sullivan Dwight	PERSON	, a strangely-assorted gathering .

		The essays of a more general character are , besides that which gives the collection its title , '' Some Thoughts on Musical Criticism '' and '' Music and Science . ''

		In one of his earliest pages , Mr.
Apthorp	PERSON	remarks that '' mu - sic is a subject on which all logic is wasted '' ; but we are inclined to think that he refutes his own dic - tum on more occasions than one , for if these essays illustrate anything besides their special subjects it is the fact that an appeal to the reason may be made on behalf of music quite as well as on behalf of any other art .

		The author appeals throughout to the intelligence , and eschews altogether the rhapsodizing that passes for criticism with many writers .

		Yet he by no means countenances the common notion that '' the musician is capable only of a merely in - tellectual enjoyment of music . ''

		On this point he even uses strong language , and goes so far as to say that '' of all the wrong notions that have ever be - muddled the human mind , this is the most utterly idiotic . ''

		But to feel the beauty of music is one thing , and to put the feeling into words is quite an - other .

		To attempt the latter is simply to attempt the impossible ; and Mr.
Apthorp	PERSON	confines himself to the things that really can be said by one rational being to another .

		With the motive that sends the majority of listeners to concert-room or opera-hall the desire to hear someone sing or play , rather than the desire to hear the performance of some work the author has no great patience . ''

		For what , think you , does the average music-lover look first , when he reads the advertisement of a concert in the newspapers ?

		In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred he looks first to see who is to be the solo performer ; what the programme is to be interests him only secondarily .

		Show me the man who looks first to see what is to be played or sang , and I will hold him in my very heart of heart as a music - lover who deserves to be a musician ! ''

		These are golden words ; and let no one fancy himself a lover of music in the true sense unless he can put the ques - tion to himself , and honestly answer it in the right way .

		Sensible , well-put things abound in these es - says , and a touch of humor is not lacking . ''

		I have heard many people complain that fugues are dry ; you might say , with equal reason , that demijohns are dry some are and some are not , it all de - pends upon what is in them . ''

		Fugues naturally remind us of
Bach	PERSON	, and lead us to say that the es - say on that composer is one of the best apprecia - tions of his genius with which we are acquainted . ''

		The English Novel '' and the Delight in that colossal genius is another of the tests of true musical feeling , quite as good a test as the one already given .

		And , strange to say , the test is one that , more than most others , is likely to evoke an honest answer .

		Or , as Mr.
Apthorp	PERSON	puts it : '' Many people who have to keep up a reputation for musical taste will bear the infliction of a Schumann quartette or a Brahms symphony quite smilingly ; they will grin and bear it , and try to think they like it .

		But
Bach	PERSON	marks the point where the worm will turn ; he is the last straw that breaks the back of musical endurance , and people admit quite frankly that they find him intolerable . ''

		Most of us who have been curious to know whether our friends really cared for music have had that experience more than once .

		A longer review than the present would be needed to do justice to the acuteness , the insight , and the genuine musicianly feeling of Mr.
Apthorp	PERSON	's volume .

		Our only regret is that he should not have polished his style a little more , avoiding , for example , such a solecism as '' neither ... were , '' and that he should countenance the common mis - spelling of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's name .

		How wide our forefathers would have opened their eyes if they could have `` Study of Fiction . ''

		f oreseen tnat novel-reading would become a serious study in the closing years of the century , and be urged as an important element in general education !

		Here and there an old-fashioned objector still raises a protesting voice ; but the Zeit - geist is against him , and it is now impossible for the student to ignore what has come to be -LRB- with the pos - sible exception of poetry -RRB- the most typical and gen - erally cultivated of the literary arts .

		Even the pul - pit that last bulwark of conservative prejudice has taken kindly to the novel , and many a sermon is preached upon some popular fiction of the day .

		The
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	people , in their effort to provide pabulum of sufficient tenuity to be easily assimilable by delicate digestions , have with pecu - liar avidity seized upon fiction as providing instruc - tion and entertainment in suitable proportions , and it is wholly natural that we should have at last a
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	manual upon '' The English Novel '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		This little book , which is a his - torical and critical sketch of the subject from the earliest times down to '' Waverley , '' is the work of Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, an experienced English teacher .

		It is rather dry in manner , but presents a well-arranged conspectus of fact .

		We are half through the book before we reach what most peo - ple suppose to have been the first English novelists ; but undoubtedly something must be said in such a history of the '' Morte Darthur '' and `` Euphues , '' of ``
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' and the '' Spectator , '' and even of less direct precursors of the modern novelist .

		Prof.
W. E. Simonds	PERSON	, who at the same time has published '' An Introduction to the Study of Fiction '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is even more inclusive , for he begins with u Beo - wulf '' and '' King Horn . ''

		His book consists of a few pleasant chapters on the more marked his -

		THE DIAL 57 torical phases of the subject , followed by a dozen rather lengthy extracts , ranging from the pagan epic of our Saxon forebears to Fielding and
Sterne	PERSON	. ''

		A bare introduction to the study , '' and no more , is what the author has sought to offer his readers .

		There are some useful chronological tables , and a list of a hundred novels , English and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	, `` which , for one reason or another , are quite worth reading . ''

		Our only quarrel with the list is that it strangely omits the name of Tourgue ` nieff , although
Gogol	PERSON	,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, and
Dostoieffski	PERSON	appear .

		This is much like leaving
Scott	PERSON	out of a list of English nov - elists , or Shakespeare out of a selection of
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan dramatists . ''

		J .

		\ . '

		J Mr.
J. Logic Robertson	PERSON	, is a text - book of the old-fashioned sort , admirable as a com - pact presentation of accurate fact , but calculated to encourage cramming , and to substitute memoriter work for that acquisition of power which should be the real aim of every student .

		The subject is neatly divided up into periods and groups , cut-and - dried critical opinions are provided , and a conspec - tus of the facts of political history served as an ac - companiment .

		Beyond the general misconception of the purpose of a text-book , the work is not open to much technical criticism .

		There is an occasional comment which strikes one as curiously platitudin - ous , such as the following : '' The religious novel is a remarkable feature of current fiction , and prob - ably owes its origin to the skepticism of the age . ''

		No treatment of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, even the briefest , should ignore , as Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's does , the periods in the poet 's development .

		A serious lack of per - spective is often noticeable , particularly when Scotch writers are concerned .

		On these occasions only does the writer display a touch of enthusiasm ; and one can not refrain from thinking that he considers the work of mere Englishmen poor stuff .

		The at - tempt is made to provide extracts as well as history , which can not be done to any satisfaction at all in a book of this size .

		American writers are supposed to come within the author 's plan , but the few par - agraphs they get are grudging and inadequate .

		We can not , on the whole , accord the book any other than an extremely qualified commendation .

		The military The `` Great Commanders Series '' career of -LRB- Appleton -RRB- rightly includes the story General
Hancock	PERSON	.

		of the m jli tar y career o f General
Hancock	PERSON	, one of the most splendid soldiers that the Civil War produced , though he never held an inde - pendent command .

		It has been written by General
Francis A. Walker	PERSON	, who was a member of
Hancock	PERSON	's staff , out of the full knowledge gained through his personal knowledge of his hero , personal participa - tion in many of the stirring scenes with which the book abounds , and several years of labor spent upon his '' History of the
Second Army Corps	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The book also shows the literary skill of a trained writer .

		This knowledge and skill , combined with the bril - liant career set forth in the book , make it one of absorbing interest , perhaps the best in the series .

		Unlike most military biographies , it is free from painful personal controversies .

Hancock	PERSON	was of generous and loyal spirit , obeying heartily even when acting under orders that he knew were bad .

		He had the power of infusing his own sol - dierly spirit and enthusiasm into his men , and so of bringing his brigade or division or corps into action to the best advantage , and of leading it through the most trying marches without loss of spirit .

		Not till the very end of the campaign of
1864	DATE	, after the awful experiences and losses of that terrible
summer	DATE	, were `` his lines broken , his men driven from the ground , guns and colors taken un - der his eye ... Never before had he seen his men fail to respond to the utmost when he called upon them personally for a supreme effort . ''

		It was a blow from which he never recovered , though all acknowledged that he had done all that could be done under the circumstances .

		General
Walker	PERSON	's book is more than a sketch of
Hancock	PERSON	's career : it contains spirited descriptions of nearly all the battles in which the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac was en - gaged , from the Peninsular campaign through
1864	DATE	.

		The best of these descriptions are those of
Gettys	LOCATION	- burg , where
Hancock	PERSON	won his greatest glory , and the capture of the Salient at
Spottsylvania	LOCATION	.

		The successive commanders of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, especially
Burnside	PERSON	,
Hooker	PERSON	, and
Grant	PERSON	, are freely criticised by General
Walker	PERSON	; yet the criticism is not bitter , but eminently fair .

		Another of the stories of the triumph
Josiah Wedgwood	PERSON	Q f brains and will and character over and his work .

		11-1 poverty and physical weakness is given us by the veteran biographer
Samuel Smiles	PERSON	in his '' Life of Josiah Wedgwood '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The world never tires of these splendid triumphs , and they supply a healthy stimulus to ambition .

		Of greater interest , however , because less familiar , is the history of the development of artistic pottery , and of a great industry out of the humble making of butter-pots and porringers that occupied the meagre population of Burslem till his time .

		Young Wedgwood began life with twenty pounds and a frail body , ever tormented with pain and often un - able to leave his bed .

		His inquisitive mind was not content with the poor processes that had contented his fathers and forefathers .

		His eagerness for ex - periments caused his brothers to set him adrift from the family business .

		But his keen business ability and insight soon brought him success .

		A new ware was discovered and put upon the market as soon as the preceding was no longer popular .

		The queen allowed her name to be attached to one of the standard wares , a vast foreign trade was built up , and fortune and national reputation came to him .

		To this day he ranks as one of the great men of the eighteenth century in
England	LOCATION	.

		This success was won by his ceaseless costly experiments with 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, materials gathered from every part of the world , and by the application of true art to even the humbler products of his potteries .

		He developed the manu - facture of artistic vases , cameos , portraits , and other pieces of high excellence which nobility and royalty were eager to purchase .

		Among the interesting incidents of the book are the account of the making of the great table-service of nearly a thousand pieces for the Empress of
Russia	LOCATION	, the preparation of which occupied about eight years ; that of his relations with the sculptor
Flaxman	PERSON	, who long furnished de - signs for his products ; and the copying of the Bar - berini , or
Portland Vase	LOCATION	, and other works of an - tiquity .

		The book is written in the well-known commonplace style of the author , with numerous repetitions , yet clearly , and with full knowledge of the subject and his work .

		Closing volume of The ninth and closin g V lume f Professor Huxley 's Professor Huxley 's collected essays collected essays .

		ig entitled '' Evolution and Ethics and Other Essays '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It includes the Romanes Lecture of the title -LRB- provided with some fifty pages of prolegomena for the confutation of captious critics -RRB- ; a paper , dated
1886	DATE	, on '' Science and Morals '' ; another , dated
1890	DATE	, entitled '' Cap - ital the Mother of Labour '' ; and the contents of the pamphlet of
1891	DATE	on `` Social Diseases and Worse Remedies . ''

		Now that the man against whose pretensions and activities that pamphlet was directed has been received with open arms by so many of our fellow-countrymen , Professor Huxley 's objec - tions to '' corybantic Christianity '' are given a re - newed timeliness .

		Professor Huxley , in his preface , remarks that , '' Mr.
Booth	PERSON	's standing army remains afoot , retaining all the capacities for mischief which are inherent in its constitution .

		I am desirous that this fact should be kept steadily in view ; and that the moderation of the clamour of the drums and trumpets should not lead us to forget the existence of a force which , in bad hands , may , at any time , be used for bad purposes . ''

		It is extremely satis - factory to note the completion of this series of Pro- fessor
Huxley	LOCATION	's miscellaneous writings .

		However their timeliness may become impaired , their useful - ness for other purposes as examples of clear-cut cogent argument , and of a popularization which de - tracts nothing from the dignity of science will out - live more than the present generation .

		The author has , all his life long , fought sturdily against the ba - tallions of ignorance and prejudice , and his reward is assured in the thankfulness of the thousands whom he has helped to think clearly , and to whose lives he has supplied an effective ethical impulse .

		A satisfactory life of
Cicero	LOCATION	.

		Cicero 's life was the very storm - centre of the decline and fall of the Roman Republic .

		To treat the one satisfactorily , it is necessary to treat the other fully .

		Mr.
Strachan-Davidson	PERSON	does it charmingly in his volume on ''
Cicero	PERSON	and the Fall of the Roman Re - public '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		There is not a dry spot in the book , which is preeminently a candid and compre - hensive treatment of the greatest of orators , and a philosophic discussion of the turbulent times which made his life so tragic .

		It is refreshing to find this work unstained by hero-worship , the blot on the pages of
Froude	PERSON	and many others , who have at - tempted sketches of Roman statesmen .

		Especially commendable is the scientific spirit of treatment which forms the background of the work .

		We might call it a laboratory study , in recognition of the fact that it is studiously compiled , for the most part , from original sources of information , chiefly from the incomparable letters of
Cicero	LOCATION	himself , letters still in their primeval purity , unimpaired by the red - pencil marks of the editor .

		Mr.
Strachan-David	PERSON	- son appropriates these letters with a lavish hand , supplementing them with just enough of his own narrative to keep the chain of facts intact .

		Any other method of writing the biography of the an - cients must necessarily draw too freely on the im - agination of the author .

		Mr.
Strachan-Davidson	PERSON	's translations are excellent for their solid expression and lack of all frothiness .

		We are struck by his clear statement of the positions of the
Nobles	PERSON	and the Knights , and his unclouded treatment of the relations which existed at various stages between
Cicero	PERSON	and his contemporaries ,
Caesar	PERSON	,
Pompey	LOCATION	, and
Anthony	PERSON	.

		Never were they made plainer .

		We are impressed also by the occasional paragraphs on Roman politics , which , in point of `` favoritism , '' `` log-rolling , '' and corruption by wealth , seems not to have differed greatly from our own .

		This book , though written two thousand years after the birth of
Cicero	LOCATION	, is opportune .

		During this great lapse of time the lustre of
Cicero	PERSON	's name has not been dimmed .

		Mr.
Strachan-Davidson	PERSON	's excellent biography will be found to give in the best form what modern stu - dents demand .

		Abundant foot-notes testify to the faithful work which the production of the book has cost its author .

		Another of the pretty books that are A `` Prelude printed in
London	LOCATION	by the Messrs. to Poetry . ''

		J .

		Dent , and sold in this country by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	, is called `` The Prelude to Poetry , '' and is edited by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	.

		It is designed as the first volume of a series called '' The Lyrical Poets , '' and the volumes to follow will be made up of selections from the lyric treas - ures of our speech .

		This '' prelude , '' however , con - tains , instead of poetry , the best things that have been said about poetry in the prose of our English poets , from Chaucer to Landor .

		Sidney 's '' Apol - ogie for Poetry '' and
Shelley	PERSON	's '' Defence of Poesy , '' are the chief courses in this critical banquet ; but the releves , pastries , and other adjuncts of a well - appointed repast , are not missing .

		We have ex - tracts from
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Campion	PERSON	, and
Daniel	PERSON	, from
Jonson	PERSON	's '' Discoveries , '' from
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	, and Pope , from Gray ,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and
Burns	PERSON	, from
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	.

		And this choice collection of weighty matters is properly introduced
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL by the editor , whose pleasant opening essay pre - pares the mind for what is to follow . ''

		What we find in these contributions , '' he says , '' is a set of testimonies not at all scientific , but such as they are , - making a much more delightful and eloquent com - panion to the poetic anthology than any more for - mal body of criticism could do . ''

		And we are quite prepared to endorse the further statement of Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	, that '' to those who love these poets most , who care most for their ideals , this little book ought to be the one indispensable book of devotion , the credo of the poetic faith . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
H. Graetz	PERSON	's '' History of the Jews '' -LRB-
Phil	PERSON	- adelphia : Jewish Publication Society -RRB- still pursues its voluminous course , but we are reminded by the appear - ance of the fourth volume , which covers the period from
1270	DATE	to
1618	DATE	, that the end can not be far distant .

		The former of the dates which stand as boundary-posts to the present volume is that assigned to the rise of the
Kabbala	LOCATION	and its cultivation in
Spain	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		Among the subjects that follow are the successive ex - pulsions of the Jews from
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Portugal	LOCATION	, the persecutions caused by the
Black Death	ORGANIZATION	, the progress of Jewish literature during the middle ages ,
Reuchlin	ORGANIZATION	's defense of the Jewish literature , the Jews in
Sixteenth Century Turkey	ORGANIZATION	and
Poland	LOCATION	, and the permanent settle - ment of the Marranos in
Holland	LOCATION	.

		The date of this settlement was
1618	DATE	, which marks the limit set for the present volume , but a closing chapter on '' The Dutch Jerusalem and the Thirty Years ' War '' carries on the annals to the date of the Peace of
Westphalia	LOCATION	.

		Professor
James M. Garnett	PERSON	's edition of ''
Hayne	PERSON	's Speech to which
Webster	PERSON	Replied '' -LRB-
Maynard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- takes the form of a pamphlet for school use , but it is not often that a text for this purpose is edited with so much pains .

		The editor 's part of the work consists of a careful biog - raphy of
Hayne	PERSON	, a special article on '' The Great De - bate , '' and a few notes .

		The text has been collated with the copy presented by
Hayne	PERSON	to
Madison	PERSON	, and with the copy in a volume of speeches preserved by Mrs.
Hayne	PERSON	.

		It is well to have the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	side of the argument studied in our schools , which have too often been con - tent with an examination of the famous '' Reply . ''

		It seems that we were a little premature when , in our last notice of the '' Dictionary of National Biography '' -LCB-
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- we stated that the letter M was done with .

		But who could have foreseen a whole series of
Mylnes	LOCATION	, to say nothing of two Myrddins and a Myvyr ?

		These names , with a large share of the N 's , are found in Vol - ume XL .

		of the great work just published .

		In this vol - ume the Napiers fill a large place , four of them , includ - ing
Lord Napier of Magdala	ORGANIZATION	, getting several pages each .

		The longest biography is Mr.
Glazebrook	PERSON	's Sir
Isaac Newton	PERSON	; the next longest , Professor
Laughton	PERSON	's Nelson .


Thomas Nash	PERSON	, by the editor , and
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	, by Mr.
W. S. Lilly	PERSON	, are the articles of greatest literary interest . ''

		Chambers 's Concise Gazetter of the World '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- is a volume of moderate dimensions , based chiefly upon the geographical articles of '' Chambers 's Encyclopaedia . ''

		The latest official figures have been used by the compiler , interesting etymologies are given , and brief justice is done to historical and literary asso - ciations .

		Pronunciation is also indicated as far as pos - sible .

		There are 768 double-columned pages , and the volume is substantially bound in half-leather with green cloth covers . ''

		Pelldas and Mdlisande , '' which is probably the best of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's dramatic works , has been trans - lated into English by Mr.
Erving Winslow	PERSON	, and makes a pretty book as now published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author was terribly handicapped upon his last appearance in letters by the injudicious deliverances of the French critic who hailed him as a new Shakespeare .

		But we should not let ourselves be prejudiced against a man by what his friends say of him , and there can be no doubt that the Belgian dra - matist has become a sort of literary force .

		Mr.
Wins	PERSON	- low contributes to his translation an interesting and temperate critical introduction .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
January 10 , 1895	DATE	.

		The first day of this month marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of '' The
Christian Union	ORGANIZATION	, '' now '' The Outlook . ''

		Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	and Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	, the editors , are well known in their respective fields of labor , but it is of Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	that I wish especially to speak .

		He joined the staff of `` The Outlook '' in
1879	DATE	, and became its associate editor
five years later	DATE	.

		There have been few profes - sional men of letters in this city who have accomplished more with less fuss than Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	during the ensuing period .

		Besides his engrossing editorial duties , he has found time to deliver many lectures and addresses and to take an active interest in public affairs .

		But it is as the author of the five volumes of literary and social essays just issued in a uniform edition that Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	chiefly demands our attention .

		In these books are to be found the crystallization of his life-work , so various and extensive .

		We should hardly call him a pupil of
Mitchell	PERSON	and
Curtis	PERSON	.

		Were he not so young , it would be more truthful to call him their contemporary .

		When `` The Christian Union '' was established , its editors de - clared , '' We are glad to work with any one who is will - ing to work with us to make the word better .

		We do not ask what church or party he belongs to , nor what name he bears . ''

		And this quotation , with suitable changes , would apply to Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's writings .

		They seem to me , consciously or unconsciously , to embody a complete system of literary philosophy , hidden under a fascinating array of discussions of books and life .

		So many people now feel at liberty to speak for Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, that he has been obliged to send letters to the newspapers denying various sentiments attributed to him .

		It is very amusing to find the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Tran - script '' posing as his defender against '' chance shots '' made at him in his absence by fellow men of letters at the
Stevenson	PERSON	memorial meeting .

		I am informed that a number of the vice-presidents , including Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, and others , were not expected to be pres - ent at the meeting , a geographical impossibility in many cases , but were asked to lend the weight of their names as admirers of
Stevenson	PERSON	, and that they were glad to do so .

		The idea that any of the speakers took advantage of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's absence to make unfavor - able references to him is absurd , and the suggestion to it reminds me of the days when the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Tran - THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, script '' was known as the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Teapot . ''

		A tempest in a teapot , indeed .

		In the first place , the speakers could not have known whether Mr.
Howells	PERSON	was pres - ent or not in an audience of two thousand people .

		Probably there is some feeling among the
Boston	LOCATION	illu - minati , because Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has come to
New York	LOCATION	to live , yet nothing would surprise me less than to find him established next year in Tokio or
Cairo	LOCATION	, he not be - ing a citizen of any one city .

		Mr.
James MacArthur	PERSON	, associate-editor with Prof.
H. Thurston Peck	PERSON	of the American edition of `` The Bookman , '' has just returned from
London	LOCATION	, where he has completed arrangements for the publication of that periodical .

		The first number will appear early in
February	DATE	; it will contain an article on Dr.
Robertson Nicoli	PERSON	by Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	, a new poem by Mr.
Aus	PERSON	- tin
Dobson	PERSON	, a rarity in these days , indeed , a
London	LOCATION	letter from Dr.
Nicoli	PERSON	, with
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	for its subject , and a letter on Parisian topics from Mr.
R. H. Sherard	PERSON	.

		Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	, for the same num - ber , will give a survey of German and Scandinavian literature for
1894	DATE	.

		Mr.
Noah Brooks	PERSON	will sail for
Italy	LOCATION	and the
Levant	PERSON	on the 29th of this month , returning in the early
spring	DATE	, Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	is visiting the city , and will remain in this country for the rest of the winter .

		His new novel , just completed , will bear the title , `` The Seats of the Mighty . ''

		The fund for a memorial to
George William Curtis	PERSON	is increasing steadily .

		A special com - mittee of leading citizens of
Boston	LOCATION	has been formed to raise subscriptions in that city and vicinity .

		It has been suggested that a similar committee might be formed in
Chicago	LOCATION	to aid in perpetuating the memory of the late occupant of the '' Easy Chair . ''

		ARTHUR
STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		LITERARY NOTES .

		The text of Dr.
Skeats	PERSON	's Chaucer , reprinted in a single volume , will appear at once from the press of
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over a hundred letters written by
Scott	PERSON	to Mr.
Craig	PERSON	, the banker , have been found in the archives of the old
Leith Bank	ORGANIZATION	, at
Galashiels	LOCATION	.

		The fourth volume of
Craik	PERSON	's '' English Prose Selec - tions '' deals with the eighteenth century and will be ready for publication early in
January	DATE	.

		Mr.
David Christie Murray	PERSON	is to be the guest of the
Twentieth Century Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	on the eighteenth of this month . ''

		A Poet 's Note-Book '' is announced as the subject of his address .

		We learn with regret that Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	has decided not to accompany her husband upon his visit to this country .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	is expected to arrive about the close of
January	DATE	. ''

		Little Eyolf , '' Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's new play , reviewed from the original in the last issue of THE DIAL , has since been published by
Messrs. Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	in Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	's English translation .

		It is not easy to believe the statement made by '' The Athenaeum '' that
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	once offered to write a monograph on
Hazlitt	PERSON	for the '' English Men of Letters , '' and that the offer was declined by the ed - itor of the series .

		A '' History of Higher Education in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
W. H. Tolman	PERSON	, has just been issued from the
Government	ORGANIZATION	printing office at
Washington	LOCATION	, in the series of monographs upon the educational history of the several states .

		More than half of the contents are de - voted to
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The limited edition of the little volume containing an account of the
Bryant	PERSON	celebration at
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	, in
November	DATE	, having been practically disposed of , a cheaper edition will be issued , from the same type , but bound in paper .

		Copies may be had by addressing Mr.
Ernest Elmo Calkins	PERSON	.


Galesburg	LOCATION	, 111 .

		`` Le Modele '' -LRB-
H. Laurens	PERSON	, 6 Rue de
Tournon	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- signalizes the completion of its first year by the publication of four studies in aquarelle , in place of the regular black - and - white plates .

		This closing num - ber of the year also contains a title-page and index , together with several pages of text descriptive of the ninety-six plates that constitute the first volume .

		Art - students should find this periodical helpful and sugges - tive .

		The ninth Quarterly Convocation of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	was held at the Auditorium on the
evening	TIME	of
January 2	DATE	.

		President Low of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	was the orator of the occasion , and spoke sensibly and forcibly of the relation of universities toward political and social problems .

		President
Harper	PERSON	reviewed the work of the
last quarter	DATE	, stated that exactly 1,000 students had been enrolled , and announced the organization of a new department that of pedagogy .

		He also announced several gifts to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, the most important of which was one of
$ 175,000	MONEY	, from Mr.
John D. Rocke	PERSON	- feller , to be applied upon the current expenses for the year .

		A club of twelve book-lovers calling themselves '' The Duodecimos '' has just done an act of piety to the mem - ory of Benjamin Franklin by reproducing in facsimile `` Poor
Richard	PERSON	's Almanac for
1733	DATE	, '' from the only known copy of the original , in the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	His - torical Society 's collection at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The fac - simile is printed on a hand-press made in
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia before
1800	DATE	, ink-balls being used in the primitive way ; the paper is genuine eighteenth-century handmade such as
Franklin	PERSON	may have used , but with a little of that '' wilful waste '' of margin which the philosopher believed made '' wof ul want . ''

		An introduction by the Hon.
John Bigelow	PERSON	in which is reprinted for the first time the diverting correspondence between
Franklin	PERSON	and his chief competitor in the almanac business , one
Titan Leeds	ORGANIZATION	is printed in a modern type cast expressly for the purpose , on a handmade paper bearing the club 's water-marked devices .

		The frontispiece is a portrait of Franklin etched by
Thomas Johnson	PERSON	from the Du - plessis pastel in Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's possession ; and inter - spersed with the text are thirteen other portraits of
Franklin	LOCATION	, apocryphal and otherwise , with notes thereon , reproduced in artotype by the
Bierstadt	PERSON	process .

		One hundred and forty-four copies only are printed , twelve on vellum for the members , and one hundred and thirty - two on paper , which have been sold to subscribers .

		To insure absolute fidelity , all quotations have been veri - fied by comparison with the original issues complete files of which , dating from
1733	DATE	to
1758	DATE	-LRB- Franklin 's period -RRB- , have been located , with the exception of the issue for
1735	DATE	, which is nowhere to be found .

		No pains or expense has been spared by the club -LRB- which is not a money-making enterprise -RRB- to make their first venture a success , and the
DeVinne Press	ORGANIZATION	has produced a book which for typographical excellence and good taste re - flects credit upon itself and upon `` The Duodecimos . ''

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL '' Prseco Latinus '' is a Latin monthly paper of eight pages , published by Mr.
Arcade Mogyorossy	PERSON	, of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		The contents include brief editorials , criti - cism of schoolbooks , educational notes , and other mat - ters .

		The editor is very scornful upon the subject of existing methods in the teaching of the classics and the popular text-books , and indulges in many '' prave ords , '' indicative of the reforms he hopes to accom - plish .

		He occasionally lapses into English , to such effect as this : '' The purifying waters of reform will gradually soak under the financial foundations of the Olympian citadels ... Before long you will hear the rumble of a land-slide , when inflated idols and methods will crumble and sink into the surging waves . ''

		We com - mend '' Prseco Latiuus '' as a very amusing little sheet , however unsound may be the theories of its editor .

		Professor
Morse Stephens	PERSON	,
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	's new professor of European history from
Oxford	LOCATION	, has made some inter - esting comparisons between English and American col - lege students .

		He concludes that the average Ameri - can undergraduate takes a more comprehensive view of history , has a better grasp of its essential facts , and surpasses his English cousin of corresponding grade in power of generalization ; but the American student is lamentably deficient in his knowledge of details and also writes very poor English .

		Professor
Stephens	PERSON	thought the essays written by his undergraduate stu - dents at
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	were on the whole better than similar essays written by English students at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, al - though he sharply criticized the spelling , grammar , and generally careless style of the Americans .

		When , how - ever , he set his American students an examination of twenty questions concerning dates and places , he was overwhelmed by the lack of knowledge of facts dis - played in the answers .

		More than half the class failed to pass the examination , the average percentage being about 40 , and as a rule the students who wrote the best essays handed in the poorest examination papers .

		The intelligent public has been not a little amused by the ignorant onslaught recently made by some of the
Chicago	LOCATION	newspapers upon the improved methods of teaching recently introduced into the public schools of the city , but it was left for a casual contributor to one of those newspapers to cap the climax of absurdity .

		The following is the essential part of his complaint : `` In all the discussion abovit nature studies , of which I have been a careful reader , I do not believe attention has been called to the injudicious character of a song which 1 found in a little book used by the primary teachers in the
Chicago	LOCATION	schools .

		Here is a verse of it : ' How does the little crocodile Improve his shining tail , And pour the water of the Nile On every golden scale . '

		How cheerfully he seems to grin , How neatly spreads his claws , And welcomes little fishes in With gently smiling jaws . '

		`` My recollection of the habits of the crocodile is that he does n't live on fish at all , although he is said to catch birds in the way described .

		That a little child 's atten - tion should be called to either fact , however , in a civil - ized school-room seems incredible .

		I was very indig - nant when I saw it , as I have two boys in the primary grade .

		I determined that I would not have a boy of mine taught such stuff ; and to give it a humorous turn , as the author of these lines seems to have tried to do , is simply monstrous . ''

		This is almost too funny for belief .

		Imagine the poems of ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' subjected , one after another , to the searching criticism of science !

		Some one ought to unearth this indignant parent , and present him with a copy of the nursery classic which has strangely been left out of his education .

		The following are extracts from two letters written by Mr.
Lloyd Osbourne	PERSON	, the one to a friend in
San Fran	LOCATION	- cisco , the other to Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	: '' Our dear
Louis	PERSON	died the night of
December	DATE	3d in the full tide of work and life .

		He passed away without pain or conscious - ness , finding the death he had always prayed for .

		The doctors said that nothing could have been done for him ; he had simply come to the end of his power of living .

		The extraordinary love and kindness we have received from our Samoans has passed all knowledge .

		If any - thing could have comforted us , it was the unforgetta - ble devotion that they displayed .

		There was none of the professional horrors that make death so terrible .

		Not a strange hand touched him ; his own people dug his grave on the high mountain ridge , where it was al - ways his wish to lie . ''

		... '' My previous letter was in - terrupted by the arrival of several of our truest
Sam	PERSON	- oan chiefs with their last presents for
Louis	LOCATION	, the fine mats that the body of a great man must be wrapped in .

		All night they sat around his body , in company with every one of our people , in stolid silence .

		It was in vain that I attempted to get them away . '

		This is the Samoan way , ' they said , and that ended the matter .

		They kissed his hand one by one as they came in .

		It was a most touching sight .

		You can not realize what giving these mats means .

		They are the Samoans ' for - tune .

		It takes a woman a year to make one , and these people of ours were of the poorest . ''

		93 THE USE AND ABUSE OF DIALECT .

		There are indications not very marked as yet , but still indications that the day of the dialect versifier and story-teller is waning .

		The literary epidemic for which he is responsible has raged with unabated virulence in this coun - try for the past ten years or more .

		It has had almost complete possession of the bric-a-brac popular magazine .

		Its contagion has even ex - tended to those periodicals which we too fondly fancied to stand for the dignities , as opposed to the freaks , of literature .

		At the other ex - treme , it has been disseminated and vulgarized by the newspaper and the popular reciter .

		A few of the men and women whom we count as real forces in American letters have been num - bered among its victims .

		But all epidemics exhaust themselves in time , and we are encour - aged to believe that this one is nearly spent .

		A tabulation of the contents of our popular magazines would now , we think , show a smaller proportion of pages unreadable for their bad spelling than would have been disclosed by a similar investigation made two years ago .

		The journalist , having for a time done his best to spread the fashion of dialect , is now aiming at it the shafts of his dull yet not ineffective sat - ire .

		Many a literary worker is beginning to suspect that to misspell as many words as pos - sible is not exactly the noblest of ambitions .

		Best of all , the whole fabric of realism that is , of the crude photographic realism so noisily trumpeted by its defenders is crumbling away , to make room in due time , we trust , for the true realism of the masters ; and with this fabric there falls whatever theoretical defence of the dialect poem or novel may heretofore have seemed plausible .

		We by no means anticipate the complete dis - appearance of the dialect element from our im - aginative literature , nor would such a reaction be desirable .

		But we do expect the time to come when dialect shall occupy its proper place in composition , and be treated as a means rather than as an end .

		There is an important dis - tinction between the story written for the sake of dialect and the use of dialect for the sake of the story ; the latter practice is as excusable or even praiseworthy as the former is repre - 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, hensible .

		The question is one between a writer and his own conscience .

		Let the story-teller ask himself this question : Is it my purpose to produce a faithful yet idealized transcript of life , with its joys and its sorrows , with its ten - der human relationships and its grim struggle for the mastery of adverse conditions , the use of dialect being one of the elements necessary to the representation of essential truth ; or am I merely taking advantage of a current fashion that tends to degrade the literary art , and , making of a grotesque orthography the raison d'etre of my work , adding just enough of de - scription and fancy and pathos to give my work the verisimilitude needed for it to pass muster at all ?

		Most writers have sufficient conscience to answer this question truthfully , if squarely put ; if they shirk the answer for themselves , they may be sure that the public , sooner or later , will find it for them .

		And the ultimate verdict of the only public worth writing for will never be favorable to the workman who fails to recog - nize the imperative obligation of this higher sort of conscientiousness .

		When used with discrimination and artistic restraint , dialect is , of course , an admissible element in both poetry and fiction .

		English literature would be far the poorer without the treasures of Scotch dialect preserved in the poems of
Burns	PERSON	and the novels of the author of '' Waverley . ''

		Likewise , we could ill spare the work of the Proven9al poets from the lit - erature of
France	LOCATION	, of
Goldoni	ORGANIZATION	's Venetian com - edies from that of
Italy	LOCATION	, or of Renter 's
Platt	PERSON	- deutsch tales from that of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In all these cases , the work simply could not have been done at all without the employment of dialect ; yet no one would venture to assert that the exploitation of a dialect was the prime motive that led to the composition of '' Tarn O'Shanter '' or '' The Antiquary , '' of '' Mireio '' or '' II
Carnovale	PERSON	di Venezia '' or '' Ut Mine Stromtid . ''

		These are all instances of a richly endowed artistic nature finding expression in the medium most natural for his purpose .

		Even in our own country , a similar plea may be made for the language of
Hosea Biglow	PERSON	, or of Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's Creoles , or of Miss
Murfree	ORGANIZATION	's
Tennes	PERSON	- see mountaineers .

		But the swarm of common - place and uninspired scribblers of dialect that have descended upon our periodical press dur - ing the past decade need not hope to find a safe refuge in the shadow of such really significant names as have been cited ; their pretensions are too utterly without warrant and their pro- ductions too entirely without justification .

		Not
Lowell	PERSON	, but ''
Josh Billings	PERSON	, '' is their model and
Great Example	ORGANIZATION	.

		No discussion of the abuse of dialect that should omit the educational view would be ade - quate .

		The corrupting influence that may hardly be escaped by adult readers is tenfold more serious in its effect upon the growing mind .

		The prevalence of dialect in the papers and magazines that provide young people with most of their reading puts a new and formid - able difficulty in the way of teachers and par - ents .

		Even the books put into our schools as models for the guidance of the young the school '' readers '' themselves often contain examples of perverted diction that can not fail to exert an evil influence upon the impression - able years of childhood .

		Upon this aspect of our subject , we can not do better than quote some pointed observations from a paper by Professor
Willis Boughton	PERSON	, of
Ohio University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Boughton	PERSON	says : `` For the past decade some of our most popular periodicals have been furnishing their readers with a weekly or monthly diet of dialect stories .

		A handful of editors have declared that the people want such litera - ture , and it is produced .

		Instead of romances in cul - tivated language , we are introduced to most ordinary characters who use most ordinary folk lore .

		The Christmas story , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	asserts , is written in the ` Yankee dialect and its Western modifications . '

		Even our verse is corrupted .

		Notice a stanza reproduced from a leading magazine : ' I 'm been a visitin ' ` bout a week To ray little cousin 's at
Nameless Creek	LOCATION	, An ' I 'm got the hives an ' a new straw hat An ' I 'm come back home where my beau lives at . '

		What literature !

		If the magazine , one of the greatest educational factors in our country , will tolerate such language ; if you and I read it , and smile at it , and quote it , the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	teacher may be pardoned for the use of language that shocked Dr.
Rice	PERSON	.

		To preserve the speech of a vanishing people , dialect literature may be justified ; but to propagate such language is vicious .

		At school , the teacher may dwell at length upon the linguistic beauties of the ` Village Blacksmith ' ; but on
Friday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	some urchin declaims : ` The Gobble-uns ' ` ill git you Ef you do n't watch out , ' and soon all the children in the district are repeating his words .

		Why the offspring of even polite society are prone to use bad English need be no longer a matter of wonder . '' ''

		To propagate such language is vicious . ''

		The words are none too strong , and we thank Mr.
Boughton	PERSON	for them , hoping that the protest he raises will be echoed by educators everywhere .

		These are some of the abuses of dialect ; what , then , are its uses ?

		To what fruitful end may we divert the effort now worse than wasted by the dialect-mongers of our periodical liter - ature ?

		By substituting a scientific for an ar - tistic purpose , by making a serious study of
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 dialect instead of playing ' with it .

		The facts of dialect speech , as distinguished from the in - ventions of the newspaper humorist , are of great importance to the history of language .

		No more important linguistic work remains to be done in this country than that of recording the thousands of local variations of our speech from what may be called standard English .

		To fix these colloquialisms in time and place , to trace them to their origins , to construct speech-maps embodying the salient facts of popular usage wherever it has distinctive fea - tures these are scientific aims of the worthiest .

		Work of this sort is being energetically carried on by a constantly-increasing number of ob - servers in this country ; but the ranks still call for additions , and new-comers will be heartily welcomed .

		As a coordinating agency for such scattered contributions to knowledge , the Am - erican
Dialect Society	ORGANIZATION	, founded in
1889	DATE	, is , in a quiet way , establishing important scien - tific conclusions .

		The lay observer is hardly competent to make the finer distinctions in pronunciation that come within the scope of the trained phonetician , but he can be ex - tremely useful in the collection of vocabularies .

		The Society asks him to do two things for each peculiar word or idiom that comes to his no - tice `` first , to fix the fact that it occurs in dialect usage in a sense differing from standard English , and , secondly , to fix the local limits of this usage . ''

		All such variations from the normal `` represent just the class of facts on which the scientific study of language rests .

		Many of them are survivals from older periods of the language ; many new words are formed or adopted to meet a real need arising from new conditions , and so ultimately gain a place in standard English ; and many variations in pronunciation illustrate phonetic changes which are constantly going on in language develop - ment .

		The philologist needs to know , from a more reliable source than the ordinary novel - ist furnishes , the exact locality where each word or phrase is used -LRB- implying , also , a knowledge of where it is not used -RRB- ; just what it means to those who use it , and what local variations there are , if any , in its form and meaning ; just when each new word came in or old one went out of use . ''

		If , perchance , our little sermon on the use and abuse of dialect should turn even one misguided realist from a grinder-out of dialect '' copy '' for the newspapers into an exact observer of local usage for the scientific purposes of the Society , it will not have been preached in vain .

		TRIBUTES TO MISS ROSSETTL
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	died on the 29th of
December	DATE	not , as the press despatches announced , on the 31st .

		The funeral service was held at
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	on
January 2	DATE	, and the body was interred at the
Highgate Cemetery	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the mourners were Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	, his four children -LRB-
Olivia	LOCATION	,
Mary	PERSON	,
Helen	PERSON	, and
Arthur	PERSON	-RRB- , and Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	.

		The service included '' The
Porter	PERSON	watches at the gate '' and '' Lord , grant us grace to mount by steps of grace , '' two of the poet 's most familiar hymns .

		The English literary press is strikingly unani - mous in appreciation of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	's great gifts , and in expression of its sense of the loss to English literature in her death . ''

		The Literary World '' writes as follows : '' Looking to the quality of her poetry ,
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	attained to the level , at least , of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, which means that she has been excelled by no English woman poet .

		The most exquisite sense of music in the choice and collocation of words , and an etherealised imagina - tion soaring from the sphere of the earthly to that of the spiritual , are the characteristics of her poems . ''

		This passage is from '' The Academy '' : '' In perfection of form and melody of words , her lyrics are comparable to those of Shelley : they set them - selves to mental music as they are being read .

		No poet of the time , not
Tennyson	PERSON	or Swinburne though their range may be far wider excels her in the mere matter of technique .

		None has such a pure note , such a bird-like sweetness . ''

		`` The Athenaeum , '' after grouping
Christina Ros	PERSON	- setti with
Walter Pater	PERSON	as the two greatest English writers of those who have died during the year , says of her that she '' Was not merely the greatest poet among English - women of our day , she was a writer who can be classed with all but the very greatest poets of the century .

		Her art was of that admirable kind which conceals the process of art ; never was verse so careful to seem care - less ; and she was not less remarkable for the passionate intensity of her emotion generally religious emotion than for the intense simplicity of its expression . ''

		And `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' begins its long and sympathetic editorial article with the following : '' By the death of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, literature , and not English literature alone , loses the one great modern poetess .

		There is another English poetess , indeed , who has gained a wider fame ; but the fame of Mrs.
Brown	PERSON	- ing , like that of her contemporary , and , one might al - most say , companion ,
George Sand	PERSON	, was of too immedi - ate and temporary a kind to last .

		The very feminine , very emotional , work of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, which was really , in the last or first result , only literature of the
L. E. L.	ORGANIZATION	order carried to its furthest limits , roused a sort of womanly enthusiasm , in precisely the same way as the equally feminine , equally emotional , work of
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the same way , only in a lesser de - gree , all the women who have written charming verse and how many there have been in quite recent times I have won , and deservedly , a certain reputation as poetesses among poetesses .

		In
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	we have 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, a poet among poets , and in
Miss Rossetti	LOCATION	alone .

		Con - tent to be merely a woman , wise in limiting herself within somewhat narrow bounds , she possessed , in union with a profoundly emotional nature , a power of ar - tistic self-restraint which no other woman who has writ - ten in verse has ever shown . ''

		Even more interesting than the above critical es - timates , is the personal sketch contributed by Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	to '' The Athenaeum . ''

		Speaking of Miss
Rossetti	PERSON	's physical sufferings and the forti - tude with which she met them , Mr.
Watts	PERSON	says : '' Throughout all her life she was the most notable example that our time has produced of the masterful power of man 's spiritual nature when at its highest to conquer in its warfare with earthly conditions , as her brother
Gabriel	PERSON	's life was the most notable example of the struggle of the spiritual nature with the bodily when the two are equally equipped .

		It is the conviction of one whose high privilege it was to know her in many a passage of sorrow and trial that of all the poets who have lived and died within our time ,
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	must have had the noblest soul . ''

		Of another aspect of her character , we read : '' Her intimacy with Nature of a different kind alto - gether from that of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	was of the kind that I have described on a previous occa - sion as Sufeyistic : she loved the beauty of this world , but not entirely for itself ; she loved it on account of its symbols of another world beyond .

		And yet she was no slave to the ascetic side of Christianity .

		No doubt there was mixed with her spiritualism , or perhaps un - derlying it , a rich sensuousness that under other circum - stances of life would have made itself manifest , and also a rare potentiality of deep passion .

		It is this , indeed , which makes the study of her great and noble nature so absorbing . ''

		Mr.
Watts	PERSON	singles out '' Amor Mundi '' as being per - haps
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	's masterpiece . ''

		Here we get a lesson of human life expressed , not didactically , but in a concrete form of unsurpassable strength , harmony , and concision .

		Indeed , it may be said of her work generally that her strength as an art - ist is seen not so much in mastery over the rhythm , or even over the verbal texture of poetry , as in the skill with which she expresses an allegorical intent by subtle suggestion instead of direct preachment . ''

		THE FUTURE OF THE NEGRO IN FICTION .

		For nearly fifty years the negro has occupied a place of more or less prominence in American song and story , and his future position therein can not but be a matter of interesting conjecture .

		It was
Stephen Foster	PERSON	's plantation melodies , more than anything else , perhaps , that first showed the negro in his true artistic character ; and that whole coterie of songs , ''
Uncle Ned	PERSON	, '' `` O Susanna , '' Old Folks at Home , '' `` Nelly Was a Lady , '' etc. , forms still the most unique and vital addition this country has contrib - uted to the psalmody of the world .

		Though not the work of a Southern poet , they bore the stamp of genuineness upon their face , and carried the ne - gro 's pathos and humor all over the land .

		This was before Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	furnished the spark that kindled into flame the smouldering fires of liberty ; but when ''
Uncle Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' helped to give the negro a country , it gave him at the same time a '' local habitation and a name '' in the literature of that country .

		But all was not yet done .

		It was not the suffering side of the slavery question that showed the negro in his richest artistic values , not tales of the wretchedness and misery of his condi - tion that pictured him in his greatest beauty .

		They held him fast-bound within the realm of philan - thropy , and the artist found there no high lights .

		It needed the softening touch of a calmer hand to show him in his true colors ; and this it remained for another generation to furnish .

		Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page has collected the distilled sweetness of all that is loveliest in the negro character , and held it for all time in a chalice of pure gold .

		He has given to us and to the future the old-fashioned darkey pure and simple , with his humor , his pathos , his self-sacrificing humility , his cultured politeness , his noble loyalty ; and like unto him is Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	's ''
Uncle Remus	PERSON	, '' whose name has become a household word throughout the length and breadth of the land .

		These two , more than any other writers , have struck the key-note of the negro 's artistic value , and have given him as a vital element to literature .

		They know him and they love him , and their pictures are not overdrawn or idealized .

		Messrs. Page and
Harris	PERSON	have had a host of coadjutors , each one lending a hand to give the negro a permanent place in the literature of our time , and all combining to perpetuate the memory of the sweetest and best of the race .

		But what of the future ?

		The next decade at farthest must show us the last of the old-fashioned darkey of '' bef o ' de war , '' and it is he the pitiful remnant of him that we have grown to love and revere in fiction .

		We love him all the more because we know his end is fast approaching ; and when he is gone , who will take his place ?

		The generation that is to come after him , and grow old in our midst as he grew old , is not worthy to unloose his shoe latchets , and surely can never fill the place in our hearts that he holds .

		Freedom brought the negro his God-given birth - right , but at the same time it robbed him of his greatest beauty , since it lost for him a background whereon to show the noblest elements of his char - acter .

		So long as he lives , the negro must possess , in a certain degree , artistic merit : his light-hearted Bohemian nature will keep this for him as surely as the sun shines , for it is the sun that brings it about ; but he has lost his finest motif .

		The black '' dude '' with cane and eyeglass furnishes richer material to the caricaturist and the evolutionist than to the artist , and the story-teller of the future will have no easy task to keep the negro up to his pres - ent valuation for readers of fiction .

		LAFAYETTE AND MIRABEAU .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In reply to Professor von Hoist 's communication in your last issue , taking exceptions to certain passages in my review of his '' Lectures on the History of the French Revolution , '' I wish to say that my article was not in - tended to be a complete review of the
Lowell Lectures	ORGANIZATION	.

		I preferred , as I prefer in this rejoinder , to consider mainly the characters of
Lafayette	LOCATION	and Mirabeau , which , in the Lectures , were contrasted , with what seemed un - due exaltation of the one and undue depreciation of the other ; of the one , who , says Professor von Sybel , '' lost forever the dignity which good morals and honesty give '' ; and of the other , '' of proved disinterestedness , of con - stant care for the public good , respect for others , au - thority of conscience , loyalty , good faith , of motives beautiful and pure , '' whom
Taine	PERSON	presents as a type of the cultivated and intelligent liberals of
1789	DATE	who did not submit to
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		-LRB- '' Regime Moderne , '' Vol .

		I. , p. 74 . -RRB-

		Professor von Hoist 's charge relating to the conduct of
Lafayette	LOCATION	on the 5th and
6th of October , 1789	DATE	, is supported on the authority of the light and frivolous
Camille Desmoulins	PERSON	.

		The unsubstantiated opinion of Sainte-Beuve , fairest of critics , that this charge against
Lafayette	LOCATION	has been abandoned or disproved , the author thinks is not sufficient .

		I hope there will be nothing '' surprising '' to Professor von Hoist in the opinions of the eminent historians whom I now cite in support of
Sainte-Beuve	ORGANIZATION	's opinion .

		Professor
William Smyth	PERSON	says : '' As
Lafayette	LOCATION	was one of the first movers of the Revo - lution , no proper justice is ever done to his character by those who were unfriendly to the Revolution ; it must therefore be maintained that it is quite clear , from the concurring accounts of all writers , that he made every possible exertion to prevent this fatal measure , this march upon
Versailles	LOCATION	, and that with an afflicted and foreboding heart he accompanied the populace and the soldiers to take the chance of moderating and directing , as well as he could , a dreadful mass of men whom he could no longer control or bring to reason . ''

		Count Mont - losier , a distinguished conservative leader in the
Assem	LOCATION	- bly , says in his Memoirs : '' In the midst of these dis - orders I was a witness of the grief of
Lafayette	LOCATION	, '' etc. .

		I. , p. 94 -RRB- , give full narrations of the facts concerning the 5th and 6th of
October	DATE	, confirming the opinion of Sainte-Beuve .

		Fi - nally I quote on this subject the closing sentences of an exhaustive note of
Thiers	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Vol .

		I. , pp. 375-378 -RRB- : '' No one , moreover , dared to deny , in the first moments , a devotion which was universally recognized .

		Later , party spirit , perceiving the danger of according virtues to a constitutionalist , denied the services of
Lafayette	LOCATION	; and then commenced that long calumny of which he has not ceased to be the object . ''

		Poor Camille !

		I have not consciously misstated the conclusions of the author upon subjects referred to .

		When he declares , with italics , that
Mirabeau	PERSON	was a party by himself , and knew beforehand that it would be so , and was determined that it should be so , he thinks , nevertheless , that he has somewhere stated overlooked facts which explain the meaning of what he had previously said , and that un - biased readers will see the palpable fallacies of my in - ference .

		Let the appeal , then , go to unbiased readers .

		The reminder that
Mirabeau	PERSON	did not enter public life for the first time in
1789	DATE	is unimportant .

		In his youth he served a few months in the army .

		Just before the Revolution ,
Caloune	PERSON	gave him an obscure employment at
Berlin	LOCATION	, below any grade of rank in the diplomatic body .

		-LRB- Lome * nie , Vol .

		III. , p. 648 . -RRB-

		The author could not well avoid stating damaging facts in relation to the character of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	.

		The question at issue is , whether the vices and venalities of Mirabeau explain his failure to win that confidence of colleagues which is necessary to a public man .

		I did not , and can not now , go fully into the matter .

		Readers will examine for themselves Professor von Hoist 's ex - planation in which he attempts to reduce the charge of venality to what is warranted by the facts .

		Briefly stated , they are : That , for generations , public opinion considered it a matter of course that anybody who had a chance to get money from the king should improve it ; that
Mirabeau	PERSON	was paid for work done and services ren - dered -LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 170 -RRB- ; that the `` salary '' he received was an incident , and not an end -LRB- p. 174 -RRB- ; that if the accusers of Mirabeau can not convict him in regard to '' two questions '' what were his promises , and how they were kept , it is evident that though his relations to the court were surely not altogether free from blame , his own opinion of them must in the main be correct -LRB- p. 179 -RRB- .

		And to help the reader to reach these start - ling conclusions the author states his own opinion , al - ready quoted from Vol .

		II. , pp. 180-81 .

		That opinion is further sustained by the supposition that it never en - tered into the heads of Count Mercy and Count La
Marck	PERSON	that taking money front
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		could throw the slightest reflection upon Mirabeau -LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 170 -RRB- .

		In the correspondence between
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	and La
Marck	PERSON	often quoted by Professor von Hoist , confidential letters from La
Marck	PERSON	to Mercy show the real opinion of
La Marck	ORGANIZATION	in relation to Mirabeau -LRB- Vol .

		II. , pp. 282 , 283 , 354 -RRB- .

		On the 6th of
December , 1790	DATE	, Count La
Marck	PERSON	writes to Count Mercy : '' The queen will be more and more the object of my entire attention , and I shall seize with care all occasions to be useful to her .

		It is prin - cipally in that respect that I continue my relations with
Mirabeau	PERSON	.

		What a man he is !

		Always upon the point of flying into a passion , or losing heart ; by turns impru - dent from excess of confidence , or cooled by mistrust , he is difficult to direct in things which require perse - verence and patience .

		I will fulfil my task to the end , Count , although I discover more and more all its diffi - culties . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 286 . -RRB-

		His task was to watch
Mirabeau	PERSON	and to hold him faithful to the court .

		Again he writes to Count Mercy : `` Permit me to tell you briefly my present position .

		I can not dissimilate that it becomes more and more difficult .

		On one side I have to watch every moment the impetuous character of Mir - abeau , and to bring him back when he escapes from me , or when he escapes from himself .

		Very passionate , very strong for a sudden attack or at a given moment , he is often incapable of remaining five days in the same meas - ure and direction . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 530 -RRB- .

		The real truth seems to be that nobody could fully trust
Mirabeau	PERSON	, who had '' lost forever the dignity which good morals and honesty give . ''

		Evidence of the venality of Mirabeau was found in the secret vault of
Louis XVI.	LOCATION	,
November 20 , 1792	DATE	.

		Then the judgment of
France	LOCATION	upon the conduct of
Mira	PERSON	- beau in his relations to the court was first expressed .

		By unanimous vote of the
Constitutional Convention	ORGANIZATION	, all 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, honors previously bestowed in perpetuation of his mem - ory were withdrawn , on the ground that no man can be esteemed great without virtue .


D. L. SHOREY	PERSON	.


Chicago	LOCATION	,
January	DATE	SO ,
1895	DATE	.

		A MURDEROUS TRANSLATOR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It was an honor which the culture of
America	LOCATION	duly appreciated , when , in
1893	DATE	, one of the most famous of contemporary French writers came to our shores and visited us in our native haunts .

		It is a privilege to read a description of ourselves as seen by unprejudiced , but not unfriendly , eyes .


M. Bourget	PERSON	is a decided advance over ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	'' as an accurate and penetrating ob - server or , at least , as a describer of what is observed .

		Eminently psychological and analytical , he does not , like the latter , deliberately sacrifice truth for effect , and whether we think his descriptions just or not , we are bound to admit that they are sincere .

		But whether we think
M. Bourget	PERSON	just to us , or not , no one , I believe , wishes to see injustice done to him .

		And if ever a writer suffered at the hands of his trans - lator , it is
M. Bourget	PERSON	at the hands of the newspaper syndicate that is giving his `` Outre-Mer '' to the Amer - ican public through the medium of the newspaper press .

		Traduttore , traditore , say the Italians .

		But the trans - lator of '' Outre-Mer '' is more than a traitor he is a murderer .

		No comparison with the original , nor even a knowledge of French , is necessary to discover the ex - ecrableness of his work .

		The style , as it comes to us in the newspaper , is awkward , dull , and tiresome , and these are faults of which
M. Bourget	ORGANIZATION	is never guilty .

		A comparison with the Original , which is now running in '' Le Figaro , '' discloses blunders which ought to put to shame any college freshman .

		Scarcely a dozen con - secutive lines can be selected in which mistranslations -LRB- some of them the most puerile -RRB- , unwarranted liberties with the text , and monstrous atrocities committed upon the English language , do not occur .

		In its best parts it is scarcely more than a verbatim transliteration , in which the graceful and forceful French idiom , transferred bodily to the English , becomes utterly emasculated and meaningless .

		A few illustrations , selected at random , will abund - antly show what wrong is being done to a great French writer and critic .

		In speaking of the American young lady , he says : '' Je crois plus sage de reconnaitre que la coquetterie n'est pas plus que le reste , chez 1 ' Ame ` ricaine , une affaire d'entrainement . ''

		This is how the inspired translator got it : `` I think it safer to recognize that in coquetry , no more than in the rest , the American girls allow themselves to be carried away . ''

		Every paragraph is teeming with such meaningless drivel as this , and the unthinking reader goes away with the impression that it is
M. Bourget	PERSON	who writes it .

		An average fresh - man , with one semester 's training in French , ought to know that faire une experience means '' to make an ex - periment , '' not '' to undertake an experience '' ; that a complet omnibus is not a `` complete omnibus '' ; and that when

		The fact is that this translation as a whole is heavy , lumbering , and unreadable .

		And it is especially to be deplored , as this charming writer has only too rarely been brought within the reach of the non-French-read - ing American public .

		`` NONSENSE VERSES '' IN THE SCHOOLROOM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I be permitted to place myself in the publicity of your columns on the side of the
Chicago	LOCATION	parent whose views in your issue of
January 16	DATE	you class as the '' cli - max of absurdity '' ?

		It is of course greatly to be regretted that a
Chica	LOCATION	- goan or anybody else of man or woman 's estate should remain in ignorance of the delicious nonsense that ``
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' has written ; but are not many of his whimsicalities for '' grown up '' folks rather than for children 's powers of understanding and appreciation ?

		Their inimitable foolery is calculated , at least in some instances , to give sensitive children an erroneous im - pression of several facts in natural history , and a hurt - ful idea of the principles that make for ethics , long be - fore the little folks are old enough to sift out and enjoy the fun of the verses .

		This in itself should be a good argument for keeping the nonsense out of school-books , and permitting each parent for himself to judge what he shall set before and what keep from his little ones .

		The fact that many men and women of exquisite sym - pathies were '' brought up '' on '' Mother Goose '' does not prove anything in favor of the more bloodthirsty or more untruthful of those jingles .

		Loving and wise counter-influences made the crooked teachings straight , or supplanted them altogether .

		The people whose in - fant feelings were not cruelly lacerated by the '' Babes in the Wood '' tale , for instance , are to be congratulated , not held up as examples in favor of treating other little folks to the same harrowing yarn .

		It is a good deal like breaking a butterfly upon a wheel to argue against the dear old nursery twaddle , and the new nursery twaddle of the inimitable `` Carroll '' order ; and nobody wishes to argue against it for anybody old enough to under - stand its fun and pay no attention to its distortions .

		But much of it is pernicious for babies in the kinder - garten and primary stages .

		Infant impressions , those of very young childhood , are among the most lasting we ever receive ; is it not , then , not only the better part of discretion but the whole of valor , and , what is more to the point , the whole of tender-hearted parenthood , to see to it that , however attenuated the truth may be that is taught children , it shall still be truth , or ideality on truth lines ?

		FROL ` DE 'S
ERASMUS	LOCATION	.

		* Whether a new life of Erasmus was espe - cially needed or not ; whether Mr.
Drummond	PERSON	's pleasant volumes of a few years since did not suf - ficiently cover the ground for the present gen - eration ; whether Mr.
Froude	PERSON	has given us any fresh light on a somewhat difficult and evasive personality , these are questions which might be discussed at length without perhaps reach - ing a very definite conclusion .

		Severe critics might complain that when an Oxford Profes - sor , occupying the chair just vacated by a mi - nute and exact scholar like
Freeman	PERSON	, chooses to turn over old and familiar materials and handle a well-known and interesting character , we may fairly expect some novelty of exposition , some side-lights from contemporary history , and the unearthing of a new fact or two .

		It looks rather as if Mr.
Froude	PERSON	, recognizing that his strength lay in other directions , had frankly chosen to disappoint all such expectations , and content himself with an easier task , the exer - cise once more of his marvellous power of vivid presentation , and be satisfied , not with col - lecting new matter , but simply with setting be - fore us the old in a striking arrangement , and telling a familiar story as only such accom - plished tellers of stories can .

		It is not light from any new quarter that he offers us , it is only stronger and more effective light , with vivid dramatic contrasts and perhaps a little over-emphasis of shadows .

		This is Mr.
Froude	PERSON	's weakness as a historian : over-emphasis of light and shade .

		His pictures are brilliant , not with diffused daylight , but with the whites and blacks of a sketch in charcoal touched with chalk , with the dazzle and gloom of electric light and shadow on the stage .

		His method , however , is vivid , and the immediate effect is striking .

		He compels attention .

		He makes
Erasmus	PERSON	live again , as modern and intelligible as
Principal Tulloch of St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	or Profes - sor
Jowett of Balliol	ORGANIZATION	.

		There may have been more penetrative and interpretative lives of Eras - mus written , but there will hardly be one more readable .

		This is Erasmus as the ordinary reader will know him for many a year to come .

		It is impossible not to notice , in this attract - ive volume , that tendency to bear on hard upon special defects of his hero which so vexed a * THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF

		friendly public in Mr.
Froude	PERSON	's treatment of Mr. and Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	.

		A biographer may give nothing but the truth , yet present that truth distorted by disproportion .

		Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	seems to be always fighting '' bugs '' and guarding her highly-strung husband against crowing cocks and cackling hens ; but probably these were smaller facts in her life than they appear in the biography .

		And Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	's later years were doubtless saddened by a recognition of how imperfectly he had valued the wife whom he had lost ; yet he had perhaps been less neg - lectful than he is pictured for us , and less re - morseful than his reiterated wail of penitence would lead us to suppose .

		Probably they lived like other married couples of genius , with fre - quent jars , yet substantial harmony ; and a wise biographer had been careful not to heighten the coloring of two such masters of vigorous expression as
Thomas	PERSON	and
Jane Carlyle	PERSON	.

		Dis - proportion becomes distortion .

		And so with
Erasmus	PERSON	.

		It is not a pleasant trait in the great scholar that is revealed to us in his imperative demands and somewhat shame - less entreaties for money .

		You see the excuses for him .

		You see that scholars who give them - selves up to unremunerative labor must some - how live , and live at the expense of somebody ; that their choice is between the `` patron and the jail , '' and that the ugly necessity sometimes is forced upon them of pushing their claims rather clamorously , of displaying too evidently the emptiness of their purses and the insistent crav - ings of their stomachs and backs .

		And it is all well enough to give us a letter or two to show this not altogether delightful side of the social conditions of the time in which
Erasmus	ORGANIZATION	lived , and the readiness of Erasmus to submit to them .

		But a letter or two would suffice .

		Mr.
Froude	PERSON	certainly errs in over-pressing the pain - ful fact of the beggary of mediaeval scholarship .

		He makes Erasmus so modern , by the vivid - ness of his presentation , that he appears as shanteless as if he were a sturdy tramp or beg - ging letter - writer of our very different day .

		The effect of such reiteration is as if you should paint a portrait deep red whose subject blushed easily and frequently ; or should describe a cli - mate by recording a succession of thunder - storms .

		They doubtless occurred , and were perhaps characteristic ; but there was a good deal of pleasant weather unmentioned besides .

		Certainly Mr.
Froude	PERSON	is a delightful trans - lator .

		The letters of Erasmus in his version are like original letters of a master of pithy English .

		They are indeed cleverer in Mr. 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	,
Froude	PERSON	's rendering than in the original , for the frank compression and condensation which he has given them .

		The epigrams are clearer-cut for the omission of redundancies , and they come closer together .

		` Mr.
Froude	PERSON	's treatment is something better than justice : it is enrichment and benefaction .

		Nothing could have more perfectly the air of well-bred ease and happy familiarity than Mr.
Froude	PERSON	's lectures .

		He has gained by not taking his task too seriously .

		Where Free - man had worried you with conscientious , pains - taking , and scrupulous repetition , Mr.
Froude	PERSON	touches lightly here and there , and glides on with a graceful rapidity .

		He is not a pro- fessor over a class of plodding students , rather he is an artist conducting a party of friends through a great gallery , and now by a word and now by a nod or a gesture calling their attention to a masterpiece or casually in - dicating a failure .

		We feel in good company all the while company not too much in earn - est , not taking life too seriously , but highly cul - tured and disposed to lavish its pleasantness generously .

		Was it with a foreboding that the walk through the historic gallery was for the last time ?

		So much for Mr.
Froude	PERSON	's part in the vol - ume .

		What now of the greater part furnished by Erasmus ?

		Certainly there are few more brilliant letters in literature than those which supply the ample material for this life .

		Eras - mus had the eye of an eagle , and the talon of an eagle also .

		His pen was like an etching - needle ; his humor and wit the biting acid that made the swift sketch permanent upon the plate .

		He saw things as they were , and what he saw became alive upon the page .

		Those were not the days of hasty correspondence , of notes tossed off in a moment and mailed with the ink hardly dry , to escape the waste-basket but one day more .

		A letter then was as well worth elaboration as a sonnet or triolet now .

		But if you have sense , wit , humor , and knowl - edge of the world , you can elaborate verse or prose into a playful perfection that is delicate art , but seems careless nature and unconscious ease .

		It is good to have these picturesque and lively letters of Erasmus once more brought to the surface to illuminate the ever-interesting and not yet exhausted scene of the Renaissance and the Reformation .

		As a man of letters ,
Erasmus	PERSON	must ever hold a foremost place with
Lucian	PERSON	and Clarendon and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and Lamb and
Thackeray	PERSON	, for rare painting of character .

		But it is impossible to treat
Erasmus	PERSON	as a mere man of letters .

		He was a power and au - thority at the time when the great overturn of
Christendom	LOCATION	took place .

		He was preem - inently the scholar and writer of his age , when scholarship and literature were just emerging from the pedantry of the schoolmen .

		He lived in the day of
Leo	PERSON	and of Luther .

		He saw his time with most penetrative insight .

		He under - stood men as few of his contemporaries under - stood them , as scholars rarely understand them .

		He detected the flaws in Luther 's method , and the shames in the old order into which he and Luther alike had been born .

		There was no corruption of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	which he had not scourged with a whip of small cords .

		He was seventeen years older than Luther .

		Why did he not take the lead and do the work of Luther more wisely and not less thoroughly ?

		As we see the divisions and distractions which have followed upon the Reformation , we are disposed sometimes to ask angrily and impatiently , Might not
Erasmus	PERSON	have made Luther unnec - essary ?

		Might he not have led a reform in the Church which should not have precipitated a schism ?

		Were it not good to-day if Christen - dom had never been rent as by an earthquake ; if a process of gradual enlightenment and piece - meal reform had been begun with
Erasmus	PERSON	at its head ?

		Men have the defects of their qualities , our French friends say .

		The judicial temperament is not what you want in an advocate .

		The president of a peace association is not the precise stuff for a commander-in-chief .

		Ever since the days of the Reformation , men have complained of Erasmus for not being Luther .

		As well complain of an electric light , with its fine fibre all a-tingle and a-quiver within its film of glass , for not being a roaring fire on the hearth .

		Erasmus had his office ; Luther his .

		Erasmus was a search-light , flinging its pierc - ing ray into all the dark corners of Christen - dom and pitilessly revealing every sin and shame .

		Come down , O electrician , from your secret tower , and build us a blaze that shall consume these foulnesses which soar above us and make the air noisome for honest men to breathe .

		I can not come down , is the answer .

		My business is to give light and direct its rays where they are needed .

		I am busy devising methods for shedding clearer and fuller light .

		And I have grown to feel that with light enough on the lives and the things they will shrivel of themselves .

		Anybody will fetch you a firebrand and set the foul heaps in a blaze .

		And I must see to it also that the hasty fires
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 do not consume these endless precious things which my search-light reveals to me under and behind the rubbish heaps .

		After all , if Luther gave the world his doc - trine of justification , if he brought St.
Paul	PERSON	once more to the front and gave us the free - dom of faith , the fearlessness of
Christ	LOCATION	, Eras - mus restored to the world the New Testament ; gave access not to
Paul	PERSON	only , but to
John	PERSON	and Jesus ; he gave us an example of the unbiassed spirit that sees the soul of good in things which are evil ; he gave us the suggestion of critical research ; he was that rare broad churchman who can tolerate high churchmen and value low churchmen , while impatient of the corrup - tion and superstitions of the one and the reck - lessness and cant of the other .

		Conservative in action , he was radical in thought .

		Because dreading revolution , he was earnest for reform .

		He loved the unity of
Christendom	LOCATION	too well to lightly cut himself loose from the ancient Church of his Fathers .

		The iconoclastic zeal of Luther was foreign to his taste , his temper , and his conscience .

		In many particulars I sus - pect what Luther called '' dirt ''
Erasmus	PERSON	called '' color . ''

		He was too clear-sighted to suppose that the
Church	ORGANIZATION	could be tumbled about the ears of
Christendom	LOCATION	without doleful damage to truth and soberness , to love and purity .

		He would use a broom and scrubbing brush where Luther would use a torch or a battle-axe .

		Cut it down , why cumbereth it the ground ?

		said Luther .

		Let it alone this year also , said Eras - mus : those were the words of Jesus , it must be confessed .

		And yet the world is profoundly Luther 's debtor , and beside his heroic form that of Eras - mus seems but pinched and small .

		The reformer of
Rotterdam	LOCATION	was clear light without heat , keen intelligence without moral intensity .

		Never man saw more clearly , but he lacked not man - hood , he was brave as a lion ; a more timid spirit had chosen his side and stepped behind the earthworks of one party or the other ; Eras - mus stayed out in the open and took blows on either hand , but he lacked wrath and fierce in - dignation .

		His humor qualified and tempered and half put out his fire .

		He discerned the evil and was not angry , but petulant and half - amused with the wicked every day .

		He was a good scorner , not a good hater .

		He was the scout not the warrior , the detective not the ex - ecutioner .

		To see the evil and expose the evil , and delight himself a little in the clearness of his vision and the keenness of his dissection , and then to feel that his work was done , and that it was for others to cart away the rubbish and clear up the room , that was
Erasmus	PERSON	.

		Intelligence without character may at times be invaluable because unprejudiced and judicial , but it imperfectly serves its age .

		It stands back in the shadow , or lies out in the offing , when the struggle and the storm begin .

		It would like to hate and love more intensely , but these things are beyond its power .

		But it has been worth while also only to have seen and said the

		THE MOUNTAINS OF
CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	.

		* A noble book on a noble subject is Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	's '' Mountains of
California	LOCATION	. ''

		A certain purity and nobility of expression is found therein ; a distinct fitness of style , as if the words were evoked and ranged in dignified order by the influence of the grandeur of the mountains and the beauty and wildness of the mountain denizens portrayed .

		No one in whose veins runs a drop of patriotic blood could read this story of the mountains without burning with pride at the pictures of the natural beau - ties of our native land .

		And the book has elements to attract the attention of the lovers of each and every form of natural beauty and interest .

		The subjects of the chapters partly display the varied aspects shown of mountain life : The
Sierra Nevada	LOCATION	; The Glaciers ; The Snow ; A New View of the High Sierra ; The Passes ; The Glacier Lakes ; The Glacier Meadows ; The Forests ; The
Douglas Squir	PERSON	- rel ; A Wind Storm in the Forests ; The River Floods ; Sierra Thunderstorms ; The Water -
Ouzel	LOCATION	; The Wild Sheep ; In the
Sierra Foot Hills	LOCATION	; The
Bee Pastures	LOCATION	.

		But the titles alone give no hint of the varied wealth of informa - tion conveyed .

		Take the simplest chapter - heading '' The Snow '' of the shortest chap - ter .

		Many of us think we know much of snow ; some of us , that we know all about snow ; a few , that we know of mountain snow ; but to all of us the chapter gives new knowledge .

		It opens with a description of the early mountain snows and the preparation of the wild mountaineers , deer , birds , bears , marmots , and wood rats , for the winter .

		Then we learn , in beautiful crisp words , of the wonderful action of snow in the forests .

Feb. 1	DATE	, and small lakes , of the snow bridges and the tunnels .

		Then is given a word-picture of the rare and beautiful Snow-banners , part of which I quote : '' The most magnificent storm phenomenon I ever saw , surpassing in showy grandeur the most imposing effects of clouds , floods , or avalanches , was the peaks of the
High Sierra	ORGANIZATION	, back of the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	, decorated with snow-banners .

		Many of the starry snow flowers , out of which these banners are made , fall before they are ripe , while most of those that do attain perfect de - velopment as six-rayed crystals glint and chafe against one another in their fall through the frosty air and are broken into fragments .

		This dry fragmentary snow is still further prepared for the formation of banners by the action of the wind .

		For , instead of finding rest at once , like the snow which falls into the tranquil depths of the forests , it is rolled over and over , beaten against rock ridges , and swirled in pits and hollows like boulders , pebbles , and sand in the potholes of a river , until finally the delicate angles are worn off and the whole mass reduced to dust .

		And whenever storm winds find this prepared snow dust on exposed slopes where there is a free upward sweep to leeward , it is tossed back into the sky and borne onward from peak to peak in the form of banners ... After being driven into the sky again and again it is at length locked fast in bossy drifts , or in the womb of glaciers , some of it to remain silent and rigid for centuries before it is finally melted and sent surging down the mountain sides to the sea ... '' Yet the occurrence of well-formed banners is rare .

		I have seen but one display that seemed perfect .

		This was in
1873	DATE	when the summits were swept with a wild Norther ... When making my way from the valley to an overlooking ledge the peaks of the Merced group came in sight over the
South Dome	LOCATION	, each waving a re - splendent banner against the blue sky as regular in form and as firm in texture as if woven of fine silk .

		In four hours I gained the top of a ridge above the valley , 8000 feet high , and there in bold relief like a clear painting appeared the imposing scene .

		Innumerable peaks , black and sharp , rose grandly into the dark blue sky , their bases set in solid white , their sides streaked and splashed with snow , like ocean rocks with foam ; and from every summit , all free and imconfused , was streaming a beau - tiful silky , silvery banner from half a mile to a mile in length ; slender at the point of attachment , then widen - ing gradually as it extended from the peak , till it was a thousand to fifteen hundred feet in breadth ; each peak with its own refulgent banner , waving with a clearly visible motion in the sunglow , and not a single cloud in the sky to mar their simple grandeur . ''

		In the foreground of your picture rises a majestic forest of Silver Fir blooming in eternal freshness , the foliage yellow-green , and the snow beneath the trees strewn with their beautiful plumes , plucked by the wind ... Mark how grandly the banners wave as the wind is deflected against their sides ; how trimly each is attached to the very summit of its peak , like a streamer at a masthead ; how smooth and silky they are in texture , and how finely their fading fringes are penciled on the azure sky .

		See how dense and opaque they are at the point of attachment , and how filmy and translucent toward the end , so that the peaks back of them are seen dimly , as though looking through ground glass .

		Ob - serve how the banners belonging to the loftiest summits stream free across intervening notches and passes .

		And consider how every particle of this wondrous cloth of snow is flashing out jets of light . ''

		The main causes of the beauty of this dis - play of snow banners were , first , the favorable direction of the wind no south wind ever flaunts a perfect snow banner ; second , the great abundance at that time of unconfined snow dust ; third , the peculiar conformation of the slopes of the peaks .

		In general , the south sides are convex , while the north sides are con - cave , and the wind ascending those concave curves converges toward the summit , carrying the snow up with it , from whence it floats out in horizontal banners .

		The difference in form between the north and south slopes was pro- duced by the difference in glaciation to which they were subjected .

		The north sides were hollowed by residual shadow-glaciers that never existed on southern sun-beaten slopes .

		Thus do shadows determine the forms of these lofty mountains , and also of the snow banners which the wild winds hang on them .

		There is no doubt that the average reader for pleasure , or even for information , unless of scientific bent , looks somewhat askance at a chapter on glaciers ; but no one will skip Mr.
Muir	PERSON	's fascinating chapters on glaciers , glacier lakes , and glacier meadows .

		Previous to
1871	DATE	the
California	LOCATION	glaciers were unknown .

		That year Mr.
Muir	PERSON	discovered the
Black Mountain Glacier	ORGANIZATION	of the
Sierra	ORGANIZATION	, and since then many others .

		The charming glacier lakes are many in number over fifteen hundred .

		There are traces of many more that now are vanished with the glaciers that gave them birth .

		The largest is
Lake Tahoe	LOCATION	, twenty-two miles long by ten miles wide .

		The story of their birth and growth reads like a prose poem .

		They contain 110 fish , but plenty of frogs and larvae of in - sects and beetles .

		Humming wings glance over them , robins and grosbeaks feed on the berries of their borders , ouzels sing love-songs over them ; beautiful fringes of flowers nod over these little byworlds of lives for the na - turalist .

		A special beauty , which Mr.
Muir	PERSON	notes , of the glacier meadows , is the smooth , silky lawn of their surface , enamelled with flowers , never ragged or unkempt , but per - fectly kept and adjusted .

		He says it produces in the beholder such a deep
summer	DATE	joy that the mind is fertilized and stimulated by the sight , just like a sun-fed plant .

		Mr.
Muir	PERSON	gives one chapter to the
Douglas	PERSON	squirrel .

		We are thus made acquainted with him : '' He threads the tasseled branches of the pines , stir -

		THE DIAL 77 ring their needles like a rustling breeze ; now shooting across openings in arrowy lines , now launching in curves , glinting deftly from side to side in siidden zigzags , and swirling in giddy loops and spirals round the knotty trunks ; getting into what seems to be the most impos - sible situations without sense of danger ; now on his haunches , now on his head ; yet ' punctuating his most irrepressible outbursts of energy with little dots and dashes of perfect repose .

		He is , without exception , the wildest animal I ever saw a fiery , sputtering little bolt of life , luxuriating in quick oxygen and the woods ' best juices .

		One can hardly think of such a creature being dependent , like the rest of us , on climate and food .

		But after all , it requires no long acquaintance to learn he is human , for he works for a living .

		His busiest time is in the Indian Summer .

		Then he gathers burs and hazel-nuts like a plodding farmer , working con - tinuously every day for hours ; saying not a word ; cut - ting off the ripe cones at the top of his speed , as if employed by the job , and examining every branch in regular order , as if careful that not one should escape him ; then , descending , he stores them away beneath logs and stumps , in anticipation of the pinching hunger - days of winter .

		He seems himself a kind of coniferous fruit , both fruit and flower .

		The resin essences of the pine pervade every pore of his body , and eating his flesh is like chewing pine gum . ''

		The water-ouzel , most fascinating singer and interesting actor , also has a chapter full of interest and beautiful description .

		Perhaps the most marked characteristic of the book is the intense love shown by the au - thor for all forms and aspects of nature .

		The trees are his brothers ; he knows their forms , their voices , the different sounds of their rust - ling leaves , he reads their soul ; the birds and beasts are his friends , how he delineates their features !

		the flowers are his sweethearts ; he can never cease telling their endearing traits .

		Of the mountains he speaks his love with no uncertain voice : '' To the timid traveler fresh from the sedimentary levels of the lowlands , they seem terribly forbidding ; but though hard to travel , none are safer .

		For they lead to regions that lie far above the ordinary haunts of the devil , of the pestilence that walks in the darkness .

		Accidents in the mountains are less common than in the lowlands , and these mountain mansions are decent , de - lightful , even divine places to die in , compared with the doleful chambers of civilization .

		Fear not to try the mountain passes .

		They will kill care , save you from deadly apathy , set you free , call forth every faculty into vigorous enthusiastic action . ''

		The book is wholly self-forgetful , in that respect a keen contrast to the self-conscious nature-studies of
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		It is almost man - forgetful , though occasional bits of descrip - tion appear , like this humorous account of the furred Mono Indians : '' Suddenly , as I was gazing eagerly about me , a drove of gray hairy beings came in sight , lumbering toward me with a kind of boneless , wallowing motion like bears .

		Suppressing my fears , I soon discovered that , although as hairy as bears , and as crooked as summit pines , the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species .

		They proved to be nothing more than Mono Indians dressed in the skin of sage rabbits .

		They were mostly ugly , and some of them altogether hideous .

		The dirt on their faces was fairly stratified , and seemed so ancient and so undisturbed it might almost possess a geological significance .

		The older faces were , more - over , strangely blurred and divided into sections by fur - rows that looked like the cleavage - joints of rocks , suggesting exposure on the mountains in a cast-away condition for ages . ''

		The picture of the old miners in their exag - gerated dotage , and the collections which they had gathered like wood-rats , shows deep human interest and pathos .

		I do not like to end the reviewing of this book , any more than I like to close its pages , over which I linger , longing to quote the fine thoughts , the fair and symmetrical sentences I ever find ; to give the noble expression of the sublimity and power of the winds , told in that fairly passionate chapter , '' A Wind Storm in the Forest '' ; to tell the revealed meaning of the gestures of the trees ; to recount the wonder - ful , almost incredible , story of the beautiful , brave wild sheep , the analytical study and his - tory of the giant sequoias , the picture of the hanging gardens with larkspurs eight feet high , and that final revel in sweetness , the chapter on bee pastures , those flowery wildernesses whose gladsome praise in melodious phrase makes a picture sweeter than that of honied
Hybla	LOCATION	, rosier than that of heathery Hymettus .

Gustav Freytag	PERSON	's '' Technik des Dramas '' has long been a standard work in

		Freytag is eminently qualified to speak with authority on the subject here treated .

		The author has avoided all subjective theorizing .

		He offers no treatise on aesthetics , no original ideas on the philosophy of art .

		Feeling , as he says , that such treatises usually leave the young author in the lurch just where his real difficulties begin , he has here given , for the guidance of his successors , the results of his own experience , the lessons taught by long years of authorship , with the usual alternation of failure and success .

		The book is primarily addressed to young authors with dramatic aspirations , intended to point out to them the best path to the temple of fame , and to warn them against the many pitfalls along the way .

		But it appeals also to another and far wider circle of readers .

		The discussion of the rules of dramatic composition is so sane and judicious , the analyses of dra - matic masterpieces , both ancient and modern , are so skilful , the criticism is so straightfor - ward , that the book can not fail to be interesting and valuable to any student of the drama .

		In a book written for a German public , it is natural that a large part of the illustrations should be chosen from the works of

Germany	LOCATION	that he is almost looked upon as a German classic , re - ceives perhaps more attention than any other author ; and a considerable place is given also to the Greek drama , especially to Sophokles .

		The body of the '' Technique '' is divided into four chapters , dealing respectively with
Dramatic Action	ORGANIZATION	, the Structure of the Drama , the Structure of the Scenes , and the Characters .

		In the opening chapter the author discusses first the development of the '' dramatic idea '' from the raw material offered by history , litera - ture , or contemporary event .

		To the question , '' What is dramatic ? ''

		the answer is , '' Neither an act per se , nor an emotion per se , but only passion that leads to action , and events as they influence the human soul . ''

		The discussion of the difference between a '' dramatic person '' and the flesh-and-blood reality is interesting , and may be recommended especially to the at - tention of the '' Veritist . ''

		After an excellent exposition of the law of Unity , the author dis - cusses in turn the necessity of probability and importance in the action , dramatic movement and climax , and the nature of the tragic .

		In the second chapter the author considers , in its various aspects , the structure of the drama as a whole ; thus , he discusses '' action '' and '' reaction , '' the rise , climax , and fall of the action , the division into five acts , with the in - fluences that produced this division , and its technical justification .

		The larger part of this chapter , however , is devoted to a thorough analysis of the origin and structure of the Greek drama , as exemplified in the works of Sophokles , followed by a similar study of the Germanic drama , with illustrations from Shake - speare .

		The third chapter continues the sub - ject of structure , with a discussion of the scene , as the practical unit of action , determined by the technical demands of the stage , and demand - ing of the author a skilful arrangement of mo - tifs within the limits of each such unit .

		In the exhaustive discussion of the charac - ters of the drama ,
Freytag	PERSON	points out their de - pendence on national characteristics and on the personality of the author , as well as on the ac - tion in which they are involved .

		The various sources of the action are fully treated , and the attitude of the dramatist toward his subject - matter is defined ; a number of practical rules follow , on the unity of the characters , their comparative importance and mutual relations , the perspicuity of the action , and miscellaneous topics of importance to the playwright .

		Two brief chapters follow , dealing with externals ; the fifth is devoted to a discussion of dramatic style and of the relative merits of prose and of various metrical forms as the vehicle of dra - matic expression ; the sixth , entitled '' The Au - thor and his Work , '' contains a number of prac - tical hints of value to the dramatic writer in his workshop , and not without interest even to the general reader .

		In view of the excellence and importance of
Freytag	PERSON	's work , it is unfortunate that the English translation should fall so far short , as it does , of offering a satisfactory reproduction .

		Translation is no easy task at best , and the translator is pretty sure to find himself beset by many difficulties , whether he adopt the literal or the idiomatic method .

		And yet it is possi - ble , by either method , to reproduce with toler - able accuracy at least the ideas of the original .

		The present translation , however , seems to com - bine all the disadvantages of both methods , without exhibiting any of their redeeming merits .

		The style of the translation , as En - glish , is execrable ; and at the same time hardly a page is free from more or less atrocious mis - translations , so that often the sense of the origi - nal is garbled beyond recognition .

		Let the reader judge for himself from a few typical ex - amples : `` Alas , poetics has come down to us incomplete '' -LRB- p. 5 -RRB- .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 '' Next after the struggles of the leading characters , the judgment of contemporaries , as a rule , or at least that of the immediately following time , prizes the sig - nificance of a piece '' -LRB- p. 27 -RRB- . ''

		This internal consistency is produced by represent - ing an event which follows another , as an effect of which that other is the evident cause .

		Let that which occa - sions , be the logical cause of occurrences , and the new scenes and events will be conceived as probable , and generally understood results of previous actions .

		Or let that which is to produce an effect , be a generally comprehensible peculiarity of a character already made known '' -LRB- p. 29 -RRB- .

		`` For when young Protestantism had laid the se - verest struggles in men 's consciences , and when the thoughts and the most passionate moods of the excited soul had been already more carefully and critically ob - served by individuals , the mode of conception natural to the middle ages , had not , for that reason , yet disap - peared '' -LRB- p. 59 -RRB- .

		Such nonsense as this -LRB- and similar passages could be quoted ad infinitum -RRB- is hardly calcu - lated to inspire the reader with admiration for the author 's mental or literary equipment .

		But in each of these cases , what
Freytag	PERSON	really says is perfectly sane , and correctly expressed as well .

		Often the mistranslations of shorter passages are so grotesque that they become comical .

		Thus , we have the amusing statement that Shakespeare '' created the drama of the earlier Teutons , '' where the original merely says that he was the first great dramatist of the Ger - manic race ; the reference to '' laws of crea - tion , '' instead of laws of dramatic composition ; the reference to the '' deepening of mind and spirit produced through the
sixteenth century	DATE	, not only among the Germans , but also among the Romans , '' where the original of course re - fers to the Germanic and Romance nations .

		Enough has been said to show that the trans - lation is inadequate and often misleading , and that the reader will need to be constantly on his guard in using it .

		Even in this form , the book will be useful , for it supplies a need for which there seems to be no other provision in the English language ; but it is deplorable in - deed that its usefulness should be seriously im - paired by the worse than indifferent quality of the translation .

		The publishers have done their part admirably ; they have produced a hand - some volume , with irreproachable typography , and few misprints .

		MODERN THEORIES OF ELECTRIC ACTIOX .

		* A full account of the experimental investi - gations which made the late Professor
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	the best known among the younger German physicists is given in his interesting volume en - titled , '' Electric Waves , '' which well merits the English translation recently published .

		When the papers of
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	first appeared they created a profound sensation among the most advanced physicists .

		No work in physics in many years has attracted the attention of scientific men to such a degree .

		His apparatus was so simple , his methods so easily followed , and the results so striking , that all recognized the appearance of a star of the first magnitude .

		Though the modern theory of electricity , as originated by
Faraday	PERSON	, had been expanded and reduced to a mathematical system by the la - mented
Maxwell	PERSON	, yet twenty-five years had elapsed before
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	, by his famous experi - ments '' On the
Propagation of Electric Action	ORGANIZATION	with
Finite Velocity Through Space	ORGANIZATION	, '' con - vinced the scientific world of the superiority of
Maxwell	ORGANIZATION	's theory over the older views .

		All of his researches are of recent date ; the first was made in
1886	DATE	, and the others followed in quick succession .

		The interest excited caused a great number of applications to be made for the papers in which the researches were published .

		Since it was impossible to comply with all these requests ,
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	decided to have them reprinted without change , but to add as an introduction a summary of his work , giving the history of his experiments , and stating his final theoreti - cal views on the subject .

		He moreover added supplementary notes , because some of the opin - ions expressed in the account of his earlier in - vestigations had changed .

		These notes contain , in addition , an account of results arrived at by other investigators who undertook similar ex - periments later .

		The series of papers in the present volume consists of fourteen numbers , of which the third is an extract from a paper by von Bezold , who as early as
1870	DATE	observed electric waves and their interference .

		His results are practically the same as those arrived at by
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	in his earlier investigations .

		The first part of the book contains a description of
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	's exciter , by which very rapid electric oscillations or waves are produced ; and of his receiver , or * ELECTRIC WAVES .

		Being Researches on the
Propagation of Electric Action	ORGANIZATION	with
Finite Velocity Through Space	ORGANIZATION	.

Heinrich Hertz	PERSON	.

		80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, secondary coil , by means of which he investi - gated their action .

		He follows these waves along conductors , studies the interference of direct and reflected waves , determines their ve - locity of propagation , etc. .

		Perhaps the most interesting number of the series is the eleventh , originally published in
1888	DATE	, '' On Electric Radiation . ''


Hertz	ORGANIZATION	pro- duces rays of electricity , and proves that they are propagated in straight lines ; he polarizes these rays , reflects them by appropriate mir - rors , shows that they can be refracted , deter - mines the index of refraction for the refracting medium , in short , performs all the experi - ments with which we are familiar in the study of light .

		Hence electric waves belong to the same category of ether vibrations as light and heat waves ; or , as he himself says , '' we might designate the rays of electric force as rays of light of very great wave length . ''

		The volume closes with two papers containing a mathemati - cal treatment of the phenomena .

		The English title of '' Electric Waves '' was suggested by
Lord Kelvin	PERSON	-LRB- Sir
William Thomson	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He also wrote the preface to the English edition , giving a short outline of the development of modern theories of electric action .

		It is interesting at this time to note that
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	began his studies , which led to such re - markable results , on account of a problem pro- posed to him some fourteen years since by Pro- fessor
von Helmholtz	PERSON	, who has so recently died .

		The writer well remembers
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	about that time as the second assistant in von
Helmholtz	PERSON	's laboratory .


Hertz	ORGANIZATION	's work has recalled atten - tion to the remarkable researches of our own
Joseph Henry	PERSON	, which , as Lord
Kelvin	PERSON	has truly said , '' came more nearly to an experimental demonstration of electro-magnetic waves than anything that had been done previously . ''

		We now have , as a result of
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	's work , one ether for heat , light , electricity , and mag - netism ; and this volume , containing
Hertz	ORGANIZATION	's electrical papers , will be a permanent record of the splendid consummation now realized .

		THE PHILOSOPHIC RENASCENCE IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* The nine books lying before me are an interest - ing sign of the times .

		Drifting together from va - rious quarters , and finally tied up in one packet and calling for notice in one review , they present at once an extraordinary diversity and an extraordin - ary unity .

		The diversity is in the various methods of approach to philosophy which they represent in contemporary thought ; the unity is in a certain un - derlying trend and aim which , disguised by differ - ences in terminology and of school attachment , is none the less real and assured even though some of the authors represented might horroresce at the thought of kinship with some of the others .

		It ac - cordingly seems better worth while for the nonce to take this casual collection of books as an index of the present direction of thought , than to subject each severally to an exhaustive analysis .

		At the outset the collection is characteristic in this : it has within it five books by American writers , including one by a thinker of German birth , but now at home in
America	LOCATION	and conducting two of its most thoughtful periodicals ; it has within it two translations from the German , and one from the French , and one book by a German acclimated in
England	LOCATION	rather than in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It does not take a very long look backward to realize the significance of the possibility of any such collection .

		It marks at once the extent to which English and American thought is breaking loose from its long - time local prepossessions and insulation , and is en - deavoring to assimilate the thought of continental
Europe	LOCATION	; and it marks also the vigor of the philo - sophic renascence for such we may fairly term it in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Add to this that one of the books -LRB- Professor Miiller 's -RRB- deals expressly with an old philosophy of
India	LOCATION	, while another -LRB- Dr.
Deus	PERSON	- sen 's -RRB- is pretty well saturated with the same Ve - dantic lore , though attempting to adjust it -LRB- via * THE ELEMENTS OF METAPHYSICS .

		THE DIAL 81
Schopenhauer	PERSON	-RRB- more closely to modern thought , and we see that the existing ferment of thought is cos - mopolitan .

		An equal variety meets us if we attempt to class - ify the books from the standpoint of their subject matter .

		The collection is not fairly representative on the ethical side , but apart from that it contains four books which deal expressly with constructive philosophical work , three with psychological in - quiry , while Professor Miiller and Dr.
Deussen	PERSON	again stand for that craving for something beyond either the rationally philosophical or the experi - mentally demonstrable which is so marked a feature of the present ; for though we may conven - tionally ignore the matter , yet occultism and
Orien	PERSON	- talism in one form or another are most emphasized traits of the existing popular consciousness .

		Of the translations , not much need be said .

		The Bibot has so long been familiar to students of psy - chology that it is only necessary to welcome its appearance in English , and express thanks to the translator for his satisfactory work ; indeed , all of the translations issuing from the `` Open Court '' press reach a satisfactory standard of workmanship .

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	has been known for years by his trans - lation of
Hegel	PERSON	's '' Logic , '' and his attempt with the '' Philosophic des Geistes '' is equally successful , while it will introduce
Hegel	PERSON	to many in a new as - pect as among other things a psychologist , and , according to his lights and the state of knowledge when he wrote , a physiological psychologist .

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	's introductory essays are suggestive , in - genious , and literary ; they represent that phase of the Oxford philosophical tradition which delights in philosophy for its culture value -LRB- to use the current cant phrase -RRB- , and sits very easily to its severer and more scientific sides the tradition which found its culmination in
Jowett	PERSON	's introductions to the Platonic dialogues .

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	is more serious and thor - ough-going in his methods than
Jowett	PERSON	was ; but there is the same occasional complete inconsequence , the same occasional sacrifice of ideas to the needs of clever statement , and the same undercurrent of feel - ing that it is hardly worthy of an English gentleman and scholar to be too anxious about definiteness and precision in thought .

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	has probably carried the art of translating
Hegel	PERSON	as far as it can be carried upon present methods .

		It is quite pos - sible that a translator may sometime arise who will give up the attempt to find technical terminology to correspond to .

		Hegel 's philosophical dialect , and set about doing in English what
Hegel	PERSON	himself did in German -LRB- as
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	had done before him in Greek -RRB- hunting up pregnant words of idiomatic speech , and squeezing the philosophic meaning out of them .

		As for Dr.
Deussen	PERSON	's work , what shall we say ?

		The translation is well done ; but was the original worth translating ?

		The form is largely a quasi geometrical method ; definitions abound , which , like all philosophic definitions that precede , instead of summing up discussion , beg the question ; disjunc - tions , which ingeniously conceal the problem while appearing to simplify it , are numerous .

		And through it all is the gospel of the
Vedanta	LOCATION	, with
Schopenhauer	PERSON	as its prophet and expounder .

		Those who already know their Spinoza and
Kant	PERSON	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	will hardly get much out of the book ; those who want a philosophy not for philosophic but for aesthetic and emotional purposes may easily turn from , say , theosophy to Dr.
Deussen	PERSON	's con - structions of the universe .

		Speaking of the Indian philosophy brings me to Professor
Miiller	PERSON	's book , which , like all his recent work , is pedantically pop - ular in style , written largely , if not ad captandum , at least ad audiendum , and yet manages to convey in a wonderfully easy way a large amount of useful information to him who can separate that informa - tion from its graceful entwinings with Mr.
Miiller	PERSON	's own opinions and feelings about a great variety of subjects .

		Mr.
Van Norden	PERSON	's title , '' The Psychic Factor , '' covers an attempt to state the more elementary facts of psychology with especial reference to many of the more recent biological investigations , and with some emphasis on the phenomena of dreams , hyp - notism , etc. .

		Mr.
Van Norden	PERSON	is a long way from being a systematic thinker , but he has a keen eye for salient facts , and a power of lucid expression .

		His book may serve as a popular summary of many of the points of chief interest in current psychology .

		Mr.
Nichols	PERSON	gives the method and results of the application of experimental psychology to the prob - lems of number and space .

		The work is really a laboratory monograph , and will appeal to the spe - cialist .

		It is symptomatic of the courage and energy of the modern psychologist , that he completely ig - nores the attempt of the metaphysician to shut off a little inclosure of concepts , like number and space , warning all experimental methods to keep off .

		Mr.
Nichols	PERSON	's treatise on '' Notions of Number and Space '' shows that experimental methods may be applied with some hope of fruit to the '' metaphys - ical '' categories , but strikes me as suggestive rather than as conclusive .

		The book in form has a way irritating to me of stating on one side a high general and vague conclusion , and then one hundred and nine very specific conclusions , but with none of the media axiomata which are most helpful to other workers .

		There are left for consideration three attempts to deal constructively with philosophy .

		Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	, in his '' Basal Concepts in Philosophy , '' attempts the deepest flight .

		He takes up seriously and earnestly the problem of the relation of God to the finite world , and hopes to add something to its solution by a reconstruction of the triad of Hegelian cate - gories of Being , Non-Being , and Becoming , through a conception of Non-Being as that which the Abso - lute Being or Spirit continually wars against and suppresses , but which never , as it does in
Hegel	LOCATION	- ianism , becomes a moment of Being .

		It is obvi - ously out of the question to discuss Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	's 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, argument in a brief review , but I can not refrain from pointing out two things .

		One is that , to many , Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	's entire problem will seem self-made , factitious .

		This problem is , how an absolute can give rise to a finite , the perfect to an imperfect .

		There will be many who will want to know whence Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	gets his definition of an absolute , and his standard of perfection ; who will inquire , what is the ground of the assumption that the absolute is absolute apart from what he terms the '' finite , '' and how Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	is so certain of the nature of perfection as to assume , without discussion , that '' perfection '' can get along without having as fac - tors of itself those things which Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	labels imperfection .

		There are some who prefer a world with night as well as day , of pain as well as pleas - ure , of temptation as well as of a goodness which to them would seem tedious without the struggle of conquest .

		This may be very poor taste on their part , but it represents a standpoint which is not so much rejected as ignored by Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	.

		My other remark is that to many Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	's solu - tion of the problem of evil will appear in unstable equilibrium between what he would term , I suppose , a pantheistic optimism or monism , and the old-fash - ioned orthodox dualism of personal God and per - sonal Devil .

		The mind can formally follow the idea of an Absolute Being which in thinking itself has to exclude all taint of Non-Being , and so keeps up at once the thought of Non-Being , and the war - fare to exclude it .

		But the mind will have a feeling that a genuine Absolute would not have to spend time in contending with what , after all , is but its own shadow .

		I do not wish to seem to deal flip - pantly with a serious effort to think out a funda - mental problem , but one can hardly escape the conclusion that Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	's Absolute is engaged in setting up a man of straw , and then never quite knocking the straw man down , because in that case it would lose this negative exercise of exclusion through which it maintains its own positive identity .

		Mr.
Ormond	PERSON	does not appear to realize how essen - tially one his position is with that of Fichte .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's '' Genetic Philosophy '' deals amiably and readably with a large number of questions of genesis and evolution , bringing to bear upon prob - lems of the origin of life , feeling , consciousness , art , morality , etc. , a considerable range of reading , and an easy style .

		Unfortunately , the book is marred by a certain pretentiousness , manifest even in its title .

		The work is in no sense itself a philosophy of genesis , or genetic in the sense of using a thorough - going evolutionary method .

		It simply discusses lucidly and with considerable discrimination certain specific genetic questions .

		The claim is even more emphatic and offensive in the introduction , where the book is offered as affording a way out of exist - ing philosophic confusion .

		Mr.
Carus	PERSON	in his `` Primer of Philosophy '' has put before us in a thoughtful , yet easily grasped form , an attempt to combine the data and methods of modern science with certain metaphysical concepts , resulting , as he says , in a reconciliation of philo - sophies of the types of Mill 's empiricism and
Kant	PERSON	's apriorism .

		This spirit of synthesis and media - tion is prominent throughout the book , which is thoroughly worth reading and study .

		It is doubt - ful , however , if it will fulfil the pious wish of the author and set the stranded ship of philosophy afloat again ; indeed , were the ship of philosophy stranded , I doubt the ability of the united efforts of the whole race to get it afloat .

		It is wiser to think of the ship of philosophy as always afloat , but al - ways needing , not , indeed , the impetus of any in - dividual thinker , but the added sense of direction which the individual can give by some further , how - ever slight , interpretation of the world about .

		JOHN DEWEY .

		RECENT AMERICAN POETRY .

		* There comes to the life of most poets a period when poetic inspiration flags , when the thought no longer finds free and almost spontaneous expression in rhythmical numbers , but needs rather to be jogged by a striking incident or the flow of emo - tion about some theme forcibly brought into contem - plation .

		Under such stimulus , the old poetic energy revives , and even produces a fair counterfeit of the fluent expression of earlier days .

		But '' the sound is forced , the notes are few , '' and we must accept the finer artistic sense that comes with years , and the poetic self-consciousness more completely real - ized , as the only possible compensations for the les - sened volume and momentum of the stream of in - spiration .

		Some such reflections as these must come to readers of the new volume of verse which bears the name of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	upon its title-page ; al - though the lesson is not so apparent in the case of one who has been more or less consciously an artist * UNGUARDED GATES , and Other Poems .

		THE DIAL 83 throughout his career as it might be in another 's .

		The fine heroics upon our national '' Unguarded Gates '' offer a striking illustration of the power possessed by a noble theme to quicken into renewed flame the failing embers of the poetic fire . ''

		Liberty , white Goddess !

		is it well To leave the gates unguarded ?

		On thy breast Fold Sorrow 's children , soothe the hurts of fate , Lift the down-trodden , but with hand of steel Stay those who to thy sacred portals come To waste the gifts of freedom .

		Have a care Lest from thy brow the clustered stars be torn And trampled in the dust .

		For so of old The thronging Goth and Vandal trampled
Rome	LOCATION	, And where the temples of the Ctesars stood The lean wolf unmolested made her lair . ''

		The considerable proportion of personal and occa - sional poems in the present collection helps to illus - trate our introductory thesis .

		And here again , the inspiration being given , we have verses that Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	has never surpassed , personal tributes of the most heartfelt gratitude conveyed in the most polished verse .

		In a previous review we quoted from a volume by Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	his tribute to Ten - nyson .

		Let us upon this occasion quote another , written before the Laureate 's death , and appropri - ately linking his name with that of the greatest among his contemporaries . ''

		When from the tense chords of that mighty lyre The Master 's hand , relaxing , falls away , And those rich strings are silent for all time , Then shall Love pine , and Passion lack her fire , And Faith seem voiceless .

		Man to man shall say , ' Dead is the last of
England	LOCATION	's Lords of Rhyme . ' ''

		Yet stay !

		there 's one , a later laureled brow , With purple blood of poets in his veins ; Him has the
Muse	ORGANIZATION	claimed ; him might
Marlowe	PERSON	own ;
Greek Sappho	ORGANIZATION	's son !

		men 's praises seek him now .

		Happy the realm where one such voice remains !

		His the dropt wreath and the unenvied throne . ''

		The wreath the world gives , not the mimic wreath That chance might make the gift of king or queen .

		finder of undreamed-of harmonies !

		Since
Shelley	PERSON	's lips were hushed by cruel death , What lyric voice so sweet as this has been Borne to us on the winds from over seas ? ''

		The poems inscribed to
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, and
Grant	ORGANIZATION	should also be mentioned as among the best of the volume .

		In one of his sonnets Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	says : '' I must have known Life otherwhere in epochs long since fled ; For in my veins some Orient blood is red , And through my thought are lotus blossoms blown , '' and the statement is illustrated by two of those Eastern apologues which have been so noteworthy a feature of his preceding volumes .

		And then there are sonnets and lyrics and delicate cameo-like quat - rains in the new volume , and we may well give thanks that a poet is left among us who can do all or any of these things as artistically as they are done here .

		Ten years ago , writing over the signature of ''
Paul Hermes	PERSON	, '' Mr.
William Roscoe Thayer	PERSON	pub - lished a volume of verse entitled '' The Confessions of
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Poems . ''

		He has now gath - ered into a volume of '' Poems New and Old '' the best of the earlier pieces , and a much larger num - ber of later ones , among the latter being several upon Oriental themes .

June , 1885	DATE	-RSB- we gave credit to the earnest purpose of the writer , but were com - pelled to comment somewhat severely upon the tech - nical shortcomings of his verse .

		In spite of a per - ceptible advance in his technique , Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's verse is still deficient in the true rhythmical quality , and is still weighted with prosaic turns and phrases .

		In fact , the very things that we have marked as among the best in the new volume turn out to have been already published in the older one .

		Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	is at his best in such a poem as the sea-shore '' Rev - erie , '' from which we now quote : '' Sweet is it over shelving sands to stroll When the victorious tide begins to lose , And watch the stubborn-yielding billows roll , Or look upon the mid-sea 's scudding hues , Sweet is it then to loiter and to muse . ''

		To the mental vision of such a loiterer scenes like these appear : '' Here rise the saucy , unobsequious waves To wet the sandals of the Danish King ; Here spectral pirates crawl from nameless graves And count again their booty , quarreling ; And here
Pizarro	PERSON	draws the fatal ring . ''

		Columbus kneels exultant , and unfurls The cognizance of Christ and
Ferdinand	LOCATION	; Here weeping mothers and bewilder 'd girls Cry out ' God speed ye ! '

		to the
Mayflower	ORGANIZATION	band , Long after sails are hidden from the land . ''

		And
Bonaparte	PERSON	here reconstructs his doom ,
Reversing Waterloo	LOCATION	, or peers afar Till Breton cliffs along the horizon loom In bitter-sweet mirage ; this sodden spar Bore
Nelson	PERSON	's duty-sign at Trafalgar . ''

		Such verse as this , fed by culture and the historical consciousness , is always acceptable , although not poetry in any high sense . ''

		In Sunshine Land '' is a collection of verses ostensibly for children , but they have a serious poetic value , and must be classed with such books as
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Sing-Song , ''
Marston	PERSON	's `` Garden Secrets , '' and
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' A Child 's Garden of Verses , '' all three of which works they at times sug - gest .

		Miss
Thomas	PERSON	has exhibited in this volume a surprising daintiness of touch and delicacy of feel - ing ; a surprising insight , also , into the workings of the child mind .

		Nothing could be lovelier in its way than ''
Sylvia	PERSON	and the Birds , '' with which the volume opens .

		But no extract could do justice to this glorified prattle .

		We will rather take the close of '' The Ancient History of the Flowers '' : '' The red Lobelia lit a fire , and flung The embers all around a shady dell ; The Daisy had a gypsy 's crafty tongue , And youthful fortunes glibly would she tell ! ''

		The Asters were a shower of stars that fell Amid the dimness of an
autumn night	TIME	, Witch-hazel woke , and cheerily cried , ' All 's well ! '

		And met with smiles the dull
November	DATE	light . ''

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, `` The Young Geologist , '' more nearly in the sober philosophic vein of the author than most of these pieces , may also be quoted : '' Comes one with searching look To read the great Stone Book ; With youthful brows perplexed , He scans the rugged text . ''

		The knuckled rock he taps , And ancient thunders lapse , With deep imagined thud , On beaches of the flood . ''

		Old summers bud and bloom , And sink into a tomb : He sees them bloom again Upon the hearths of men . ''

		Life went with striding pace , He hunts upon its trace : A track a rib a tooth What birds and beasts uncouth ! ''

		Youth bends with baffled look , Above the great Stone Book ; The title-page is dim , The
Finis	PERSON	not for him . ''

		Possibly a very young geologist may not see all these things , but the poem is very lovely for all that .

		Miss Hazard 's '' Narragansett Ballads '' versify a number of incidents of colonial times , including the Great Swamp Fight of
1675	DATE	, and jog along in some such fashion as this : ''
Connecticut	LOCATION	had sent her men With Major Robert Treat ;
Each Colony	ORGANIZATION	in its degree Sent in its quota meet . ''

		The verse is not exactly inspired , and we can hardly say more for the '' Songs and Lyrics '' of the
second half of the volume	DATE	, although there are at the close some rather pretty pieces upon Californian themes .

		The '' Songs from Vagabondia , '' which Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	and Mr.
Richard Hovey	PERSON	have put forth to - gether , are of very unequal quality .

		Interspersed among verses as irregular and reckless as the vaga - bond life they celebrate , we find here and there so noble a poem as `` The Mendicant , '' or the stanzas called `` Contemporaries . ''

		We quote from the former '' O foolish ones , put by your care !

		Where wants are many , joys are few ; And at the wilding springs of peace , God keeps an open house for you . ''

		But that some Fortunatus ' gift Is lying there within his hand , More costly than a pot of pearls His dulness does not understand . ''

		And so his creature heart is filled ; His shrunken self goes starved away .

		Let him wear brand-new garments still , Who has a threadbare soul , I say . ''

		But there be others , happier few , The vagabondish sons of God , Who know the by-ways and the flowers , And care not how the world may plod . ''

		They idle down the traffic lands , And loiter through the woods with
spring	DATE	, To them the glory of the earth Is but to hear a bluebird sing . ''

		They too receive each one his Day ; But their wise heart knows many things Beyond the sating of Desire , Above the dignity of Kings . ''

		This poem , at least , we do not hesitate to ascribe to the lyrist of Grand Pre '' , however we may doubt the authorship of many among the others .

		And , in general , the contents of this volume offer a group - ing that a sensitive ear can hardly miss .

		There are poems which are rollicking , and poems which are not .

		And the poems which are not are those which are the most pleasing and the most artistic .

		`` May one who fought in honor for the South Uncovered stand and sing by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's grave ? ''

		asks Mr.
Maurice Thompson	PERSON	, at the opening of his Phi Beta Kappa poem , read at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	a year ago .

		The apologetic question , we should say , needs no answer other than the poem itself , which is dig - nified , worthy of the subject and occasion , and soars to a higher flight than any of which we had thought the writer capable .

		One stanza of the thirty-six must suffice to illustrate both the form and the spirit of this poem .

		`` His was the tireless strength of native truth , The might of rugged , untaught earnestness ; Deep-freezing poverty made brave his youth , And toned his manhood with its winter stress Up to the temper of heroic worth , And wrought him to a crystal clear and pure , To mark how Nature in her highest mood Scorns at our pride of birth , And ever plants the life that must endure In the strong soil of wintry solitude . ''

		Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	has now published five volumes of poems , yet the promise of the first volume is but imperfectly fulfilled by the last .

		Some measure of restraint has been imposed upon his native exuber - ance , but still more is needed ; some approach has been made to definiteness of thought , but the inane yet remains too largely his element .

		Nor do we find the improvement in finish that so much practice ought surely to have brought about .

		In the long title poem , for example , we come upon so unpardon - able a solecism as this : '' Idea , God of Plato !

		one With beauty , justice , truth , and love : Who , type by type , the world begun From an ideal world above ! ' '

		He might as well have written `` Who , type by type , creation done Shape from the ideal world above . ''

		Vague yearnings and nebulous imaginings form the stuff of too many of these pieces .

		Now and then , however , we come upon a pure and simple strain , as in these verses from `` The Argonauts '' : '' Behold !

		he sails no earthly barque , And on no earthly sea ; Adown the years he sails the dark Deeps of futurity . ' '

		Ideals are the ships of
Greece	LOCATION	His purpose steers afar ; The skies , his seas ; the Golden Fleece He seeks , the farthest star . ''

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 Of course it is not fair to criticise a lyrical
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	for preferring cloudland to earth , but it may be sug - gested that Pirene \ vas , after all , an earthly
spring	DATE	, and that from its waters the fabled steed took re - newed strength for flight .

		A new-comer in the ranks , Mr.
Robert Cameron Rogers	PERSON	, has taken poetic inspiration from much the same sort of themes as Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	from the mys - teries of nature and the beauties of classic legend but has made of it a more human use .

		Indeed , our prosaic comment upon the importance of keep - ing touch with earth might be richly illustrated by '' The Wind in the Clearing , '' Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	's title - poem ; or , better still , replaced by these verses called '' Theory , '' having for their text the
Virgil	PERSON	- ian '' Sunt geminae somni portse . '' ''

		She was so beautiful I could but follow ; Her words seemed truth itself , I could not doubt , And so she led me out beyond the hollow Half-hearted living of the world about . ''

		Steep though the upward path , without misgiving I followed as she led , and more and more She grew to seem the guide to that true living That I had set my life to looking for . ''

		Footsore I grew and faint , through never nearing The goal , yet hopeful ever of the prize , When suddenly , athwart my path appearing , I saw a distant gleaming barrier rise ; '' A sheer white wall , pierced by a single gateway , Guarding twin doors of ivory finely cut , Twin doors that as I neared them opened straightway , And passed my leader through and swiftly shut .

		. ''

		But when I came and stood beside them knocking , And strove to move the strong-joined silent beams , Forth came a voice in sadness half , half mocking , ' Thou fool , go back , this is the gate of dreams . ' ''

		Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	has written some spirited lyrics , some good classical idyls , some tender memorial pieces , and a few fine sonnets .

		From one of the latter called '' I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills '' we reproduce the sestet : '' Sweet is the valley music , sweet the hum Of bees , but on beyond the upland mist Which sets false barriers to feeble wills , Are triumph tones , sonorous chords , that come , As from the touch of some strong organist Hidden amid the transepts of the hills . ''

		Mr.
Harrison S. Morris	PERSON	also is a new-comer among our American poets , and not often do we witness so successful a debut . ''

		Madonna and Other Poems '' comprises over a hundred pieces , nearly every one of which bears the marks of careful workmanship , and no small number of which strike a note of ex - ceptional delicacy and purity .

		The predominant trait of the collection is a feeling for nature at once so sympathetic and so just as to recall the masters .

		It is true that Mr.
Morris	PERSON	employs the conventional imagery , but the lightness of touch and the dainti - ness of his work make acceptable this new use of the old material .

		Imbued with the romantic spirit , and having a distinctive dash of sensuousness -LRB- in the good Miltonic signification -RRB- , these poems derive rather from
Keats	PERSON	than from
Wordsworth	LOCATION	to name the two poets of whom we first think as the high priests of the cult of nature .

		We reproduce as a typical example the sonnet styled `` A Touch of Frost . '' ''

		But yesterday the leaves , the tepid rills , The muddy furrows , wore a
summer	DATE	haze ; The cattle rested from the yellow rays , Bough-cool and careless of the piping bills .

		No breath , no omen of the far-off ills Shuddered the air .

		To-day the hardened ways Lie drifted with the dead of
summer	DATE	days ; The year lies sheaved upon the autumn hills . ''

		There in the sunburnt stacks the beauty sleeps Of beam and shower , dawn , and silver dew , Whisper of woody dusk , and upward deeps Of moonlight when the air is crystal blue .

		The bending farmer gathers into heaps A harvest with the
summer	DATE	woven through . ''

		Most of Mr.
Morris	PERSON	's pieces are in lyrical form , or the allied form of the sonnet ; the most noteworthy exceptions are '' Love 's Revenge , '' a long Italian romance in six-line stanza , and '' Amymone , '' a blank-verse idyl which might be printed among Landor 's '' Hellenics '' without being detected as an interpolation by more than one reader out of ten .

		Every poet nowadays has to write a `` sonnet - sequence , '' and so Mr.
Francis Howard Williams	PERSON	has accepted the inevitable .

		His sequence consists of a sonnet for every hour of the twenty-four , begin - ning with one o'clock in the morning , an hour when most people are oblivious of sonnets and all other vanities .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's work deserves considerable praise for its finish and wholesome sentiment .

		We quote the last of the series , the rhyme of the mid - night hour : '' Oh !

		tender benison of darkness , cast Upon the throbbing bosom of the earth , Dropt as a mantle over all the mirth And madness of the day , thou ever hast A sweet compassion for us .

		and at last A poppied peace .

		I gaze upon the girth Of heaven , heavy with the rare new birth Of beauty crescent through the spaces vast , '' The while the unruffled forehead of the night Lifts royally its diadem of stars ; Then , as a sleeper fares adown his way ` Mid dreamy meadows , lying still and white , I thread the moonlit lane , pass through the bare , And close the record of an idle day . ''

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	is not only a sonneteer , but a writer of lyrics , odes , and dramatic pieces , as well .

		His ''
Ave America	LOCATION	'' is a patriotic outburst which echoes the passion of
Lowell	LOCATION	, and is not unworthy of its model or its theme .

		There are some pretty pieces in lighter vein at the close of the collection , includ - ing a certain '' Ballad to a Bookman '' which readers of THE DIAL will probably remember .

		On the whole , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	seems to have won his spurs , and the ranks of our minor poets must open to ad - mit this new singer of very creditable song .

		Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's '' Patch of Pansies '' is a collection of verse , mostly trifling , that has been contributed to newspapers and other periodicals .

		It calls for no particular comment , but a brief example may be given : 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, '' ' Unwept , unhonored , and unsung ' Were not the worst of Fortune 's bringing ; Dread , rather , thine own eyes and tongue Unweeping and unsinging .

		Unweeping for thy brother , bound But struggling in the sombre
Night	TIME	, Unsinging from thy vantage-ground The happy tidings of the Light . ''

		This is a clear-cut thought , well expressed , but it is hardly poetry .

		A curious feature of Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's volume is that one dedication does not suffice ; the pieces are grouped , and for each group a distinct patron is invoked . ''

		Penrhyn 's Pilgrimage '' is a series of versified impressions of travel in the
East Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		A couple of the stanzas to '' Mount Fuji '' will illustrate the form of the narrative and something better than the average of its inspiration . ''

		O matchless mount , the centuries die And , moldering , form the forgotten past ; But still thy wooded base stands fast , Still thy white dome salutes the sky ! ''

		At night I see thy snowy stair Ascending through the circling storm ; At morn behold thy graceful form
Spring	DATE	, like a flower , into the air . ''

		Whatever the ambition of our verse-addicted trav - eller , he should have refrained from seeking to bend
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	's metrical bow .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox XEW BOOKS .

		The second volume of Mr.
Edgar Stanton Maclay	PERSON	's `` History of the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- falls no whit behind its fellow in interest and graphic quality , though the incidents seem at times a little crowded .

		Over-compression , however , is a fault on the right side .

		Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	is distinctly the narrator not the historical generalizer or the critic of naval evolutions and armaments , like Captain
Mahan	PERSON	.

		He tells a mainly unglossed story of the achievements of the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	; and when he warms to his work as in the accounts of the romantic sea-duels of
1812	DATE	, where individual pluck and real seamanship counted , and before the gallant frigates of the Decaturs and
Barneys	ORGANIZATION	gave way to the ignominious tanks and `` tea-ket - tles '' of modern marine he tells it in a style not unworthy of
Cooper	PERSON	and
Smollett	PERSON	.

		The volume opens with the events of the latter half of the war of
1812	DATE	, thence passes on to the '' Minor Wars and Expeditions '' from
1815	DATE	to
1861	DATE	-LRB- including the war with
Algiers	LOCATION	,
Perry	PERSON	's
Japan	LOCATION	Expedition , etc. -RRB- , and closes with a detailed account of the naval opera - tions of the Civil War .

		The text is liberally illus - trated with wood-cuts , full-page and vignette , and there are plenty of maps and charts .

		The follow - ing extract from the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' of Decem - ber 30 ,
1814	DATE	, touching the issue of the war of
1812	DATE	, is interesting as showing how Englishmen of the two English poets .

		time regarded that event , which later writers have tried to explain away : `` We have retired from the combat with the stripes yet bleeding on our backs .

		... To say that it -LSB- the national maritime reputa - tion -RSB- has not hitherto suffered in the estimation of all
Europe	LOCATION	, and , what is worse , of
America	LOCATION	herself , is to belie common sense and universal experience .

		... Scarcely is there an American ship of war which has not to boast a victory over the British flag ; scarcely one British ship in thirty or forty that has beaten an American .

		With the bravest sea - men and the most powerful navy in the world , we retire from the contest when the balance of defeat is so heavy against us . ''

		This was written , be it added , before the news had reached
England	LOCATION	of the capture of the `` Cyane '' and the ''
Levant	PERSON	'' by the `` Constitution , '' the disabling of the `` Endy - mion '' by the '' President , '' or the brilliant victory of the `` Hornet '' over the `` Penguin . ''

		The story of our
navy	ORGANIZATION	is a brilliant chapter in American his - tory ; and Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	, writing con amore and with a good knowledge of his theme , has told it acceptably .

		The lover of literature will be satis - fie -LRB- j to nave upon fa s sne lves nothing less than the complete works ot the great poets , and we deprecate the practice of mak - ing `` selections '' from such men as
Shelley	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, as much as we applaud the enterprise that has given us the entire poetic product of these men , as well as of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, and others -LRB- to say nothing of the `` Globe '' Shake - speare , the new Chaucer , and the new Dante -RRB- in single compact and carefully-edited volumes .

		But when it comes to poets not of the first rank , '' selec - tions '' are as helpful as they are in the other case harmful .

		In fact , the really competent student and critic of poetry can hardly find a more praiseworthy task than that of carefully gleaning from the total product of some estimable but unmistakably minor poet the best parts of his work .

		The lease of life of such a poet is really renewed by this process ; it gives him , as a rule , his one chance of impressing the generation that succeeds his own .

		Two books of the sort described are now before us : Professor
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	's volume of '' Selections from the Poems of Aubrey De Vere '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	's similar selection from the poems of
Arthur O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	-LRB-
Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Each of the books has a portrait and an introductory essay .

		The essay on Mr.
De Vere	PERSON	is one of those pieces of serious critical workman - ship that Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	so well knows how to pro- duce .

		The characteristics of the poet are seized upon with unerring discernment .

		Mr.
De Vere	PERSON	's poems are memorable for their '' praise of the life of the lowly , in the old Christian sense , '' for their '' praise of devotion , that loyal surrender to a man or a cause , which is one of the ideal passions of Love , '' and for their unfailing purity and faith .

		`` In all this poetry , however its phases may be successively turned to the eye , or itself be inwardly
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 87 searched , there is one light and one breath the light of the Spirit and the breath thereof . ''

		These are noble ideals , and Mr.
De Vere	PERSON	has steadfastly lived up to them throughout his long and active career .

		The storehouse of Irish legend has been put by him to such poetic uses as few if any others have achieved , and poems upon these national themes necessarily make up the greater part of those included in Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's selection .

		Yet it seems to us that the poet has done his best work in the briefer forms of the lyric and the sonnet , and these also are well represented .

		We Americans owe Mr.
De Vere	PERSON	a peculiar debt of gratitude for his sym - pathy with our national cause during the years of civil dissension , a sympathy that found expression in many ways , and not least in the noble sonnets '' On the Centenary of American Liberty '' and '' The American Struggle . ''

		Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	, whose intimate associations with the group of writers to which
O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	belonged peculiarly qualified her for the task of editing a volume of his poems , has done her work admirably .

		The best things have been chosen from the poet 's four volumes , and the sketch of
O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	's life is tastefully and tactfully written .

		His was an uncompleted exist - ence , and his last -LRB- posthumous -RRB- volume seemed to be '' the tentative work of a poet in a transition state . ''

		`` He had taken to himself a larger harp , but he had not yet completely strung it . ''

		Had he lived , the editor goes on to say , `` he would have learned how to clothe his passion for humanity with the same tender grace with which in earlier days he sang the love of woman . ''

		As it is , no lover of poetry can afford to remain entirely unacquainted with his work , and Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's volume will help to keep green his memory .

		The interest in folk-song and folk - lore is not only spreading but deep - ening ; it surely does not deserve to be stigmatized as a fad .

		Neither the romantic en - thusiasts , the Percys and Scotts of a century ago , nor the scientific investigators , the
Childs	PERSON	and
Grundt	PERSON	- vigs of our own time , have been mere antiquaries and collectors ; the human interest of what they found , collated , and elucidated , is too great , and has been from the first too generally acknowledged .

		The interest in ballads to-day is simply the genuine thing we may always expect , '' When that which drew from out the boundless deep Turns again home . ''

		But the '' merry art is dead , '' the merry art of bal - lad-making .

		So we , robbed of the merry pastime of `` lything and listening , '' must content ourselves with a ballad-book ; and we may well content our - selves with such an one as Professor
Gummere	PERSON	's `` Old English Ballads '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , which gives us in three hundred pages the text of fifty odd ballads , and in nearly two hundred more an introduction , notes , a glossary , and appendixes on the ballads of
Europe	LOCATION	, on metre , style , and form , and on minstrels , and the authorship of ballads .

		Meeting the various Old English Ballads .

		demands of what a ballad-book should be , this is the best edition for practical purposes .

		The text is open to criticism , especially of the subjective kind ; but it is in the main sound , adhering to the traditions as preserved by Professor Child .

		Occasional emenda - tions are made but always from another text in Child ; in the case of some ballads the text is com - posite ; none of the letters peculiar to mediaeval
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		have been retained .

		In the full introduction , originally a series of five lectures delivered at
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Gummere	PERSON	etches with a caustic pen the progress of ballad criticism from
Herder	ORGANIZATION	down .

		For his own part he insists upon the distinction between popular -LRB- '' communal '' -RRB- poetry and the poetry of the schools , which may attain pop - ularity , be for the people , but is not in any sense poetry of the people .

		Full and minute references to a host of critics , scholars , and philologians , make this introduction , supplemented by the appendixes , a veritable introduction to the study of ballad liter - ature .

		The notes and glossary are less full , leaving much desirable information to be obtained from sources notably Professor Child 's monumental collection to which , after all , only the few have access .

		The printing of the ballad title , rather than the title of the book , at the top of the page , would have made reference easier and occasional brows - ing more satisfactory ; it is a more serious mistake that there are in the notes no references to pages , nor any indication of the order in which the ballads are printed .

		But the real excellences of the work are of a rarer kind and are great .

		The forty-second volume of Putnam 's '' Story of the Nations '' series is given to
Venice	LOCATION	, and is written by Mrs.
Alethea Wiel	PERSON	.

		As the author modestly con - fesses in her preface , the complete and definitive account of Venetian history , whether in Italian or English , has yet to be produced .

		Meanwhile this work will serve presumably an honest purpose , as faithfully tracing the fortunes of that Republic , from her mysterious origin to the noble spectacle of her supremacy , and thence her moral degrada - tion and final cession to
Austria	LOCATION	in
1798	DATE	.

		A post - script of eight pages attempts to sketch the last cen - tury of her existence .

		The volume is furnished with a list of the Doges , a generous index , and numerous soft-toned prints of photographs and paintings .

		One misses here the style of a Symonds or an
Oliphant	PERSON	; nay , he half suspects , after reading several chapters , that the authoress is an inveterate Freemanite , and thanks God she has '' no style , '' which is tenfold the affront to opalescent , silver-tongued
Venice	LOCATION	it could be to
Sicily	LOCATION	, perhaps .

		It is very easy to mis - take the materials of history for history itself , espe - cially when one has access to the Venetian archives , so full of the most detailed narrative '' a hundred piping voices '' ; yet accuracy of investigation is a strongly redeeming virtue when there have been so many picturesque dabs into the story , never sacri - ficing it for the sake of truth . ''

		An author , '' said The Story of
Venice	LOCATION	.

		88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	,
Lowell	PERSON	, '' shrfuld consider how largely the art of writing consists in knowing what to leave in the ink-stand . ''

		Many of Mrs.
Wiel	PERSON	's sentences are weighed down with a surplusage of nouns or adjec - tives at the cost of their effectiveness .

		At the very beginning of the first chapter , for instance , we are informed that '' it may he well to consider for a mo - ment the manner in which the dwellings and habi - tations which formed the town took shape and be - ing , and also what measures were adopted to secure the ground whereon these homes and houses were about to be established . ''

		This rhetorical trick of using in pairs words of nearly the same meaning amounts to a mannerism with the writer , or it were endurable , like the occasional sight of Siamese twins .

		But '' entirety and completeness , '' '' exaction and de - mand , '' '' advantage and gain , '' '' marks and indi - cations , '' `` slaughter and carnage , '' `` attic or gar - ret , '' '' haughty and overbearing '' in Mr.
Bagehot	PERSON	's words relative to
Demosthenes	PERSON	' use of pebbles , we can not dwell on it ; it is too much .

		The style of the historian of
Venice	LOCATION	need not be over-ornate , but it should be picturesque and accurate .

		Five critical studies of impressionist S5S18S !?

		type , haying for their respective sub - jects
Heine	LOCATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Marston	PERSON	,
Rob	PERSON	- ertson of
Brighton	LOCATION	, and Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moul	PERSON	- ton , are grouped by Mr.
Coulson Kernahan	PERSON	into a pretty volume called `` Sorrow and Song '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- .

		This title is not happily chosen * for two reasons : it was preempted twenty years ago for a similar purpose by Mr.
Henry Curwen	PERSON	, and it is not applicable to all of the contents of the volume , since
Robertson	PERSON	was not a singer , and since Mrs.
Moul	PERSON	- ton 's life has not been , as far as we know , typically sorrowful , however pervasive may be the minor strain of her song .

		The style of these essays is somewhat pretentious , but is often marked by a grave beauty , and they contain much penetrating criticism inspired by a close sympathy with their subjects .

		A passage from the
Rossetti	PERSON	paper has a well-deserved fling at the moralists who insist that art shall always be didactic : '' The folk who can call nothing good unless it carry , dog-like , at its tail a tin can of noisy and rattling morality , and the critics who forgetting that the very over-weight - ing of individuality , genius , as we call it , which gives a man such power on one side and in one direction , necessitates , by natural and inevitable law , a corresponding under-balance on the other can not award their grudging meed of praise for honest work done , without complaining that some - thing else has been left undone , are a thankless set . ''

		The sentiment of this passage , by the way , is much better than the form .

		The study of
Robertson	ORGANIZATION	gives due praise to that rare and noble character , and emphasizes the absolute sincerity that was his strength .

		It is the frequent lack of such sincerity in the profession which he adorned that makes the writer question '' whether there is any educated class whose testimony carries less weight with the out -
Nineteen American Authors	ORGANIZATION	, side world to-day than that which follows religion as a profession . ''

		We fear that thei * e is only too much truth in this suggestion .

		Mr.
Kernahan	PERSON	's tribute to Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	is finely appreciative , and hardly claims too much for a singer of whom we have great reason to be proud .

		If three or four of the women among us who are , or have been , poets are likely to live , Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	is surely one of the number .

		`` American Writers of To-Day '' -LRB- Sil - ver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Henry C. Vedder	PERSON	, is a series of nineteen brief essays upon as many American authors , all of whom but Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	are still living .

		Nearly all of our best known men and women of letters are included .

		Since each of these essays is limited to about a score of pages , one must not look for any very exhaustive treatment ; nor has the author aimed at such .

		His critical remai ` ks are interspersed with a few biographical details , although anything like a real biographical sketch is not attempted .

		As for the author 's criticism , it is mostly of the obvious current sort , and hardly rises above the common - place .

		A generous impulse to set each subject in the best light is everywhere observable .

		A few minor points seem to call for comment .

		The open - ing statement that ''
America	LOCATION	has as yet produced no poet who was poet and nothing else '' is , of course , strictly true ; but the implied contrast with
England	LOCATION	would nearly disappear upon scrutiny .

		The parenthetical observation upon
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Timbuctoo '' is too disparaging .

		The '' Library of American Literature '' is in eleven volumes , not ten .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's '' One Villain '' is not named
Bradley Hubbard	PERSON	.

		To call '' Huckleberry Finn '' trash , while praising , for example , '' A
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	at the Court of
King Arthur	PERSON	, '' is to upset criticism altogether .

		To say '' We have aesthetes in plenty , like
Wilde	PERSON	and Pater , '' is something like saying '' We have poets in plenty , like
Tupper	PERSON	and
Tenny	PERSON	- son . ''

		Finally , the remark that '' American society is not quite guiltless of
Becky Sharps	PERSON	'' tempts us to ask why in the name of Heaven somebody does not discover one of them and thereby become the
Great American Novelist	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a rich and inspiring life that is ApMianthropurs portraye d in the '' Life and Letters hfe and letters .

		r > .

		of
Charles Lormg Brace	PERSON	-LRB- Scribner -RRB- , which has been given us by his daughter .

		Mr.
Brace	PERSON	is known to the world as the father of one of the greatest of modern philanthropic movements , and for forty years its moving force .

		The
Chil	ORGANIZATION	- dren 's Aid Society has acted directly upon five hun - dred thousand boys and girls ; while the indirect benefits to society , in draining off from
New York	LOCATION	a vast number who would have developed into crim - inals , and in working out a scheme of beneficence that has been widely copied on both sides of the sea , can not be estimated .

		The spirit , methods , and principles of this great charity are clearly brought out in this book , making it of special value to the
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 student of philanthropy .

		But its chief interest lies in the personality of the remarkable man who was himself more than his achievements .

		His clear in - sight into the needs of the wretched classes , and into the principles of true charity , is shown by the fact that the preliminary circular of the society , though far in advance of the thinking of the time , contained in the germ the whole vast and varied work which the society has since undertaken .

		This insight was united with a sober and critical judg - ment that made Mr.
Brace	PERSON	a safe leader , and won for him the full confidence of the influential men of his city , and later of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Enthusiasm for humanity , high spiritual and moral ideals , ardent patriotism , keen intellectual curiosity , great power in winning and keeping friends , and the success of his philanthropic work , all combined to make him a benefactor of his country and one of the foremost men of his time .

		The charm of this biography is due largely to the good taste and the sense of proportion of the author .

		The paragraph in English The first doctor 's dissertation that has come to us from the English De - par tment of the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago testifies to the solidity and scientific thorough - ness of the graduate work done in that institution .

		It is a monograph on '' The History of the English Paragraph , '' by Mr.
Edwin Herbert Lewis	PERSON	, a work of two hundred pages and of infinite industry .

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	has read a considerable portion of English literature for the express purpose of determining the characteristics of the paragraph , from the ninth to the nineteenth century , from
Alfred	LOCATION	to
Holmes	PERSON	.

		He has counted the words and sentences in many thousands of paragraphs , and tabulated the results , leading to the somewhat barren conclusion that the length of the paragraph has not decreased with the sentence-length .

		He also discusses the mechanical signs and rhetorical theories of the paragraph , and some of the latest investigations into the struc - ture of English prose .

		In short , no labor seems to have been spared in bringing together or calcu - lating all the facts of any conceivable interest bear - ing upon the subject of this monograph .

		But we must confess , while paying admiring tribute to the industry and scientific spirit of a study like this , that it is not exactly our ideal of the work to be aimed at by a great school of literary study .

		And the author 's results and tabulations are probably of less value to him than the intimate acquaintance with our literature that must have been acquired during the prosecution of the investigation .

		A pungent collection of essays .

		A very pungent collection of essays is Mr.
Walter Blackburn Harte	PERSON	's '' Meditations in Motley '' -LRB- The
Arena Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has an ample stock of convictions -LRB- sometimes a little crotchetty , perhaps -RRB- and he states them with refreshing point and candor .

		Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's titles are : '' On Certain Satisfactions of Prejudice '' ; `` Jacobitism in
Boston	LOCATION	'' ; `` About Critics and Crit - icism '' ; '' Some Masks and Faces of Literature '' ; and '' A Rhapsody on Music . '' ''

		Essays '' is hardly the best descriptive term for the papers Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's hand being neither light nor his temper easy .

		Your true essayist is mostly a bit of a posem , a minter of nice phrases , something of a literary Turveydrop , in fact , who is much more concerned about his '' deportment '' than his matter .

		Style , or neatness of style , is scarcely Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's strong point .

		There are too many long sentences , too many parentheses , and one notes here and there ex - pressions a shade too robust for the occasion , or for any occasion .

		What Mr.
Harte	PERSON	lacks in urbanity he makes up in earnestness , his book being full of honest hammer - strokes of the plain truth that '' shames the devil '' and a good many besides .

		A notable paper is the one called '' Some Masks and Faces of Literature . ''

		Here the author draws a most stinging indictment of sensational and mer - cenary journalism that is doubly effective in that he is himself a journalist speaking '' out of the bit - terness of a full knowledge . ''

		The most tragical thing , Mr.
Harte	PERSON	thinks , '' about this horrible busi - ness of news-mongering , as we see it in this country , in its most degraded and impudent form , is not so much that it panders to the lowest elements of so - ciety , but that its huge vortex swallows up and de - bases and strangles so many fine , generous , noble natures , who might perhaps have made the world better for their having been in it .

		... -LRB- The dyer 's hand is subdued to what it works in . ' ''

		The volume justifies the growing literary vogue of its author .

		The thirteenth annual report of the ^ ante Society , just published -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , gives the customary list of accessions to the Dante collection in the
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	library , and Mr.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	's index of proper names in the prose works and canzoniere of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		This index is an abridgment of that just prepared by Mr.
Toynbee	PERSON	for Dr.
Moore	PERSON	's edition of the whole text of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and it is something more , for it gives not only references but catch-words and phrases as well .

		The secretary , Mr.
A. R. Marsh	PERSON	, announces the subjects for the
Dante	ORGANIZATION	prize of one hundred dollars , to be competed for this year .

		He also ap - peals to Dantophilists everywhere to associate them - selves with the work of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	, and thus make possible the publication of some important projected works .

		The annual fee is only
five dollars	MONEY	, and certainly there ought to be found in this country many more students of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	than the sixty now reported as members .

		The society has nearly pre - pared the materials for a concordance to the lesser Italian works , similar in plan to Dr.
Fay	PERSON	's con - cordance to the `` Commedia . ''

		A concordance to the Latin works is also projected .

		Other sugges - tions are : '' The systematic publication , with En - glish translations , of the vision - literature of the Middle Ages ; the publication of extracts from the works of the Schoolmen and of the Chroniclers ; and a revision of Blanc 's ` Vocabolario Dantesco . ' ''

		90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, Child-life in Art .

		An extremely pretty and well-con - ceived little volume , that unfortu - nately came too late for inclusion in our Holiday notices , is Miss
Estelle M. Kuril	PERSON	's `` Child-Life in Art '' -LRB- Knight -RRB- .

		It has as its picto - rial feature twenty-five full-page plates -LRB- one or two of which are slightly marred in the printing -RRB- after some twenty artists , ranging from
Raphael	PERSON	to Mr.
J. G. Brown	PERSON	which is certainly a pretty far cry .

		Among the best plates are `` The Sistine Madonna , ''
Reynolds	PERSON	's '' The Strawberry Girl , '' Van Dyck 's ''
Mary Stuart	PERSON	and
William III.	PERSON	, ''
Gainsborough	PERSON	's `` Rustic Children , '' a `` Child 's Head '' by Bou - guereau ,
Greuze	PERSON	's `` La Cruche Casse'e , '' and `` The Meeting '' by
Marie Bashkirtseff	PERSON	.

		Velasquez , Bel - lini ,
Murillo	PERSON	,
Lippo Lippi	PERSON	, and others , are also rep - resented .

		The text is intelligently and pleasantly written , the author showing some knowledge of and much feeling for her theme .

		We venture to say that this daintily-bound and well-printed little work , though late in appearing , did not fail to find favor as a Christmas book ; and it is by no means one of the ephemeral sort .

		The Dean of
Rochester	LOCATION	, being called JSSSSL u p n at .

		the same time for more '' Memories '' and for a series of pub - lic lectures in the
United States	LOCATION	, concluded that he might kill two birds with a single stone , and so pre - pared a series of reminiscential chapters to be spoken and printed at the same time .

		For some weeks past he has been charming audiences in our large cities with his presence , while those unable to hear him may still read what he has to say in the newly pub - lished `` More Memories '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , `` being thoughts about
England	LOCATION	spoken in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Dean Hole is as richly anecdotal in this volume as in its predecessor of two years since , and the pages have the same unpretentious and genial charm .

		They are upon all sorts of subjects : bores , preachers , roses , the drama ,
Sunday	DATE	observance , working-men , and English sports .

		These are but a few of the many themes touched upon .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
Herbert Weir Smyth	PERSON	's monumental work on '' The Sounds and Inflections of the Greek Dialects '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , published by the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	, takes up the task set aside by
Ahrens	PERSON	half a century ago , and now does for the Ionic dialect even more than was done for the Doric and Aiolic dialects by the earlier scholar .

		We understand that the present volume , itself the fruit of many years ' labor , is but the first instal - ment of a work destined eventually to embrace the other Greek dialects also , and to supplement
Ahrens	PERSON	in his own field by means of the added results of nineteenth - century investigation .

		A Collection of Wild Flowers of
California	LOCATION	'' is pub - lished -LRB- if we may use the word in this connection -RRB- by the Popular Bookstore of
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Miss
E. C. Alexander	ORGANIZATION	has pressed and mounted the flowers , which include eight species , and which have kept their color better than is usual with herbarian specimens .

		A num - ber of sonnets and other verses have been written for the collection by
Miss Ina D. Coolbrith	ORGANIZATION	and
Miss Grace Hibbard	ORGANIZATION	, so that we may really call it a book , after all , and a very pretty book at that .

		Mr.
Joseph Knight	PERSON	is both compiler and publisher of an anthology that no user of tobacco , if he have literary tastes at all , will want to do without .

		It is called '' Pipe and Pouch , '' and its contents are so happily selected as to justify its further title of '' The Smoker 's Own Book of Poetry . ''

		All the good things , anonymous or acknowl - edged , are here preserved for us , Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's '' La - takia '' and
Lowell	PERSON	's numerous poems on the subject , Lamb 's '' Farewell '' and
Calverley	PERSON	's '' Ode . ''

		The vol - ume is very prettily printed and bound .

		Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's two-volume work on '' The Victorian Age of English Literature '' -LRB-
Lovell , Coryell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- appears in a new edition , with a series of not very judi - ciously selected portraits .

		It is of course in no sense a critical or an authoritative treatment of the subject , nor is it likely to be taken for such .

		A careful examina - tion would doubtless reveal an appalling number of in - accuracies , and the most casual reader will come upon judgments so inept as to call forth a smile .

		But , if we do not take the book too seriously , it will be found read - able , and even helpful as a means of passing under rapid survey the various groups of Victorian writers .

		Professor
Henry Craik	PERSON	's '' Life of Jonathan Swift '' was published nearly twelve years ago in a single large volume , and became at once the standard authority upon its subject .

		It now reappears in much more convenient shape , forming two volumes of the charming '' Eversley '' edition -LRB-
Macmillau	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and adorned with two portraits .

		The text is practically the same as before , the author having seen no reason to alter his opinions on the life of Swift , or his conception of the character and work of the great satirist .

		Bound up with the twelfth '' General Catalogue of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- there is a facsimile reproduction of the first .

		It was a single broadside sheet of modest dimensions , printed in
1774	DATE	, and giv - ing the names of all graduates for the sixteen years that the institution had then been in existence .

		The cata - logue now published is a volume of 620 pages , and is devoted solely to giving the names , dates , and ad - dresses -LRB- for those still living -RRB- of all the persons that have ever been connected with
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, either as officers or students . ''

		Great oaks from little acorns grow '' is a homely proverb that does not often have a better illustration than this stout volume .

		The com - pilation has been made by Professor
J. H. Van Am	PERSON	- ringe and Mr.
John B. Pine	PERSON	.

		Its most distinctive fea - ture as contrasted with earlier issues is a `` Locality Index , '' which groups the living graduates by states and cities , and ought to promote the establishment of many new alumni organizations .

		Two new parts of the '' New English Dictionary '' -LRB-

		THE DIAL 91 YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
January 26 , 1895	DATE	.

		The continuation of the
American Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	as a permanent organization for the maintenance and improvement of the law enacted in
1891	DATE	has been abund - antly justified by recent events .

		It was thought by some members that with the passage of the bill estab - lishing international copyright the
League	ORGANIZATION	's usefulness was at an end .

		The League has remained quiescent for four years , and has discouraged many well-meant move - ments to improve the law , in order that the latter might be thoroughly tested and that the principle of interna - tional copyright might be firmly established in the minds of the people .

		The so-called
Hicks	PERSON	bill , by which it was proposed to remove copyright protection from en - gravings and etchings unless made in this country , re - quired immediate attention , however ; and the power of the
League	ORGANIZATION	and its affiliated societies has been shown by the promptness with which the bill has been de - feated by the active efforts of the
League	ORGANIZATION	, under the able leadership of Mr.
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	, its secretary .

		By the same token , the new Covert bill , to prevent excessive damages in cases where newspapers have infringed the copyright law , has very properly re - ceived the support of the
League	ORGANIZATION	, and will no doubt be passed .

		Instead of a separate fine for each issue of a journal containing the pirated matter , the penalty is limited to double the market value of the copyright in - fringed upon .

		In deference to the wishes of the
League	ORGANIZATION	, the Amer - ican Authors ' Guild has postponed the recommendation of certain changes in the copyright law until a more propitious season .

		The Guild will perform a real ser - vice to all who earn their living by writing , if it is suc - cessful in its efforts to have authors ' manuscripts rated as printed matter by the postmaster-general .

		Mr.
Bis	PERSON	- sell has practically promised that this shall be done .

		The first of the '' Atlantic Monthly '' series of articles on '' New Figures in Literature and Art '' is from the pen of Mr.
Royal Cortissoz	PERSON	, art-critic of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' and has for its subject the work of
Daniel Chester French	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	has also prepared for the
March	DATE	''
Harper	PERSON	's '' a paper which is a plea for '' An American Academy at
Rome	LOCATION	, '' in which he will ques - tion the final authority of
France	LOCATION	in art , and will advo - cate the training of painters of all schools amid Italian traditions .

		Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	is without question the most promising of our younger writers on art , having devoted himself almost exclusively to its study .

		His latest pa - per is probably the outcome of a pilgrimage made
last summer	DATE	through the principal art-centres of
Europe	LOCATION	, one of several that he has made .

		His criticisms of the decorations and art exhibits of the
Columbian Exposi	ORGANIZATION	- tion are remembered here as among the most thorough and incisive which appeared .

		The preface of Professor
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	's '' Three Men of Letters '' would seem to indicate that with the completion of his '' Literary History of the American Revolution , '' soon to be sent to the press , his labors as an historian of American literature will be at an end .

		The present volume contains monographs upon Bishop
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Timothy	PERSON	D wight , and
Joel Barlow	PERSON	.

		The first of these , the author says , '' was an incidental pro- duct of the researches I made some years ago when working upon my ' History of American Literature During the Colonial Time , ' but could not properly be included in that work . ''

		`` The last two monographs were prepared for ` The Literary History of the Amer - ican Revolution , ' '' Professor
Tyler	PERSON	continues , `` but as the chief activity of the two writers thus dealt with belongs to the period immediately after the Revolu - tion , I have deemed it best to exclude them from that work . ''

		It is thus clear that the literature of the Republic will not be taken up by this author .

		His his - tories of Colonial and Revolutionary literature are not likely to be superseded , and , with Professor
Richard	PERSON	- son 's '' History of American Literature , '' form a com - plete and satisfactory survey of our literary past .

		Mr.
George Haven Pntnam	PERSON	, whose firm publishes all of these works , and who has himself turned author , has been lecturing the past week at
Bowdoin College	ORGANIZATION	on the his - tory of publishing during the Middle Ages .

		Among the announcements of Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons for the present year are new editions of '' Mr.
Midshipman Easy	PERSON	, '' by
Marryat	ORGANIZATION	, illustrated by representative Am - erican artists ; '' At Odds , '' by
Baroness Tautphoeus	PERSON	; and '' Richelieu '' and '' Agincourt , '' by
G. P. R. James	PERSON	, in their '' Famous Novel Series . ''

		Mr.
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	, the veteran editor and author , is busily engaged upon the current volume of Apple - tons ' '' Annual Cyclopaedia , '' which has been rightly called '' a history of the world for one year . ''

		A more than usually large number of distinguished people passed away in
1894	DATE	, and special effort has been made to secure capable biographers .

		The biography of
Rob	PERSON	- ert
Louis Stevenson	PERSON	will be written by Mr.
Edward L. Burlingame	PERSON	, editor of '' Scribner 's Magazine , '' a close personal friend of the dead romancer .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has also been occupied for some time in seeing through the press his '' Camp-fire and Battle-field , an Illustrated History of the Great Civil War , '' which will be pub - lished next week by Messrs.
Bryan	PERSON	,
Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of this city .

		The work will contain special contributions by eminent participants on both sides , with more than a thousand illustrations , many of them from photo - graphs belonging to the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	, now engraved for the first time .

		The advance sale of this work , by subscription , has been unexpectedly large .

		The fourth volume of Professor
John Bach McMas	PERSON	- ter 's '' History of the People of the United States '' will soon be issued by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	.

		It takes up the story of the second war for independence , and the succeeding period .

		The volume has much to do with the economic history of our country at that time , and deals with the business depression and hard times which were the causes of the enormous exodus of seaboard residents to the Valley of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		An interest - ing chapter is devoted to early American magazines and periodicals .

		Still another author has passed through the English Bankruptcy Court under discreditable circumstances , and , judging by recent experiences , it would not be sur - prising were he to come here and deliver literary lec - tures , which seems to be the last resort in such cases .

		The advent of a French writer of salacious stories was loudly heralded not long since ; but a stinging editorial by Mr.
Arthur Brisbane	PERSON	, in one of our daily newspapers , calling upon all good people to shun him and his lec - tures , has had the effect of keeping him away , for it is now announced that '' M. is not coming , and never intended to come , to
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Of quite another sort is the witty , whole-souled French - man , ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	, '' now lecturing through the
West	LOCATION	.

		I have just heard that ''
Mark Twain	PERSON	's '' article on '' What
Paul Bourget	PERSON	Thinks of Us , '' in the
January 92	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, '' North American Review , '' will be answered by ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	'' in the
March number	DATE	.

		So I suppose there will be great fun , and the fur will fly .

		The Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	have made a mystery of the new historical romance , '' Personal Recollections of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , '' which will begin in the
April	DATE	number of their magazine .

		Judging by the title alone , the story should be by ''
Mark Twain	PERSON	, '' and I give the guess for what it is worth .

		Apropos of ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	, '' the
Cassell Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	has purchased the American rights of his last book , ''
John Bull & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' and the firm now publishes all of this author 's works in this country .

		I understand that the American Pub - lishing Company , of
Hartford	LOCATION	, will hereafter publish all of ''
Mark Twain	PERSON	's '' works , and that these books will be sold by subscription hereafter , as was formerly the case .

		A good deal of curiosity has been excited by a pointed reference in one of
Whittier	LOCATION	's letters , given in the re - cently published '' Life and Letters , '' to '' the best and ablest literary paper in the country . ''

		The apprehensive or incredulous editor of the Letters , Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	, ap - pears to have felt called upon to suppress the name of the journal thus strongly characterized by Mr.
Whit	PERSON	- tier , although his opinion on such a subject could hardly fail to be a matter of legitimate literary interest .

		How - ever , chance has thrown the original letter in my way , and the missing words may now be supplied : `` THE DIAL . ''

		But I give the letter entire , having carefully copied it from Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	's familiar handwriting :
Hampton Falls	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	,
Aug. 19	DATE	,
' 92	DATE	.

		My dear Friend : I don ' t believe that half of the nice things the papers are saying of thy little book reach thee .

		Here is a clipping from the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Dial , '' the best and ablest lit - erary paper in the country .

		With loving remembrance , from thy friend ,
JOHN G. WHITTIER	PERSON	.

		Thus it is seen that '' the truth will out , '' in spite of hyper-cautious editors like Mr.
Pickard	PERSON	.

Henry Morley	PERSON	.


Moritz Carriere	PERSON	, author of '' Die Kunst , '' and other works of philosophy and aesthetics , died at

		Professor
Augustus Chapman Merriam	PERSON	of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	died at
Athens	LOCATION	on the
19th of January	DATE	, at the age of fifty-one .

		He had been a member of the Co - lumbia faculty for more than a quarter of a century , and was , at the time of his death , away on leave of ab - sence for a year .

		The
New York	LOCATION	'' Critic '' for
January 10	DATE	is made peculiarly interesting by its account of the
Stevenson	PERSON	memorial meeting , as well as by other matter relating to the dead novelist .

		It also contains a noteworthy ar - ticle upon the second
Congress of American Philolo	ORGANIZATION	- gists , held at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	during the holidays .

		With the appearance of the sixth and final volume of Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's
Library Edition of Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, the publishers ,
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, announce that a Supplement - ary Volume is in course of preparation by Professor Skeat , to be issued during the present year , containing the '' Testament of Love '' -LRB- in prose -RRB- , and the chief poems which have at various times been attributed to
Chaucer	PERSON	and published with his genuine works in old editions .

		The volume will be complete in itself , with an introduction , notes , and glossary ; and will be uni - form with the
Library Edition of Chaucer 's Complete Works	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
David Christie Murray	PERSON	's talk at the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	, on the
evening	TIME	of
January 18	DATE	, was re - ceived with much interest by the members of
the Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Taking for his subject '' The Poet 's Note-Book , '' Mr.
Murray	PERSON	discoursed for about an hour and a half upon the essentials of poetic diction , with such tribute of en - thusiasm to
Burns	PERSON	and other Scotsmen as their fellow - countrymen may always be counted upon to pay .

		The most serious literary loss of the month came on the eleventh , with the death of Dr.
Thomas Gordon Hake	PERSON	, in his eighty-sixth year .

		He was one of the men of
1809	DATE	, was educated at
Christ 's Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, studied medicine , travelled a good deal on the Continent , and finally settled down to practice in
East Anglia	LOCATION	.

		He was the intimate friend of Borrow and
Rossetti	PERSON	, and published several volumes of poems '' Valdarno , '' ''
Madeline	PERSON	, '' '' New Symbols , '' '' Parables and Plays , '' '' Legends of To-morrow , '' '' Maiden Ecstasy , '' and '' The New Day . ''

		His Memoirs of Eighty Years '' appeared in
1892	DATE	, and a Civil List pension was granted him in
1893	DATE	.

		Professor
William Rufus Perkins	PERSON	, who died at Erie ,
Pa.	LOCATION	, on the 27th of
January	DATE	, was a man of rare char - acter and abilities , whose higher qualities were perhaps too little appreciated by the most of those who knew him .

		For some years before his death , he held the chair of History at the
State University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	, hav - ing gone there from
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, where he was an assistant professor .

		He was the author of some val - uable historical papers , including an almost unique mon - ograph on the
Iowa Trappists	LOCATION	, based upon an exhaust - ive study of that singular and interesting community .

		He was also a reviewer of historical works for THE DIAL and other journals .

		But Professor
Perkins	PERSON	's best work was as a poet .

		A shy and reticent man , it was known to but few of his friends that poetry was to him much more than the diversion of an idle hour that to it he gave his best powers and sought to express in it his real self .

		His poem of '' Eleusis '' has already been char - acterized in THE DIAL as one of the most remarkable and meritorious of the longer poems that have appeared in
America	LOCATION	in many years .

		The volume containing it -LRB- '' Eleusis , and Lesser Poems '' -RRB- was issued in
1892	DATE	; it is not known that he is the author of any other books of verse .

		Professor
Perkins	PERSON	was about forty-five years of age , and unmarried .

		Messrs.
Ward	PERSON	, Lock ,
& Bowden	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, are the agents in this country for '' The
Windsor Magazine	ORGANIZATION	, '' a new English monthly of the popular sort .

		It is more like '' The Strand Magazine '' than any other of its competitors , and sells at
twenty cents	MONEY	a copy We note with grat - ification the re-appearance of '' The Southern Magazine , '' whose untimely demise was chronicled a few weeks ago .

		It begins again with the
January	DATE	issue , under a new management .

		Of great importance also is the resump - tion of that very valuable weekly , '' Science , '' under the auspices of an editorial committee comprising the most distinguished specialists in the country .

		The paper has gone back to the typographical features of the earlier volumes , and once more presents an exceedingly attract - ive appearance A most creditable addition to the sci - entific periodicals issued by the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	is '' The Astrophysical Journal , '' which succeeds the old

		From
Los Angeles	LOCATION	,
Cal.	LOCATION	, comes '' The Land of Sunshine , '' an illus - trated monthly whose bright and winning appearance does not belie its name .

		Its literary quality too is good .

		Under the editorial guidance of Mr.

		126 READING AND EDUCATION .

		In these days of multiplied universities and degree -RRB- !

		, when a young man or woman of earnest purpose is rarely so handicapped by adverse environment as to be quite unable to get the higher education in the academic sense of that term , it is possible that we attach too much importance to the culture that is based purely upon scholastic titles .

		Historical ex - amples without end prove to us that culture of the finest type has been attainable out - side the walls of any institution of learning , and there is no reason to doubt that the pro- cess which has produced self-educated men in the past is equally available and effective at the present time .

		Indeed , it may be urged that the man intellectually self-made , if his achieve - ment show him to be really educated , has an advantage over the man who has found the ways of learning smoothed for him , the rough places levelled , and the natural impediments to progress cleared away by other hands than his own .

		It is he who best knows the value of what has been so hardly acquired ; his attain - ment has a substance and a solidity that the most brilliant of university careers may fail to give .

		After all , the test of culture , outside of narrow academic circles , is not based upon such external things as degrees and fellowships , but upon capacity , upon evidence of the finer issues of thought and feeling , and the power to quicken other spirits to those issues .

		Perhaps the most important of educational institutions is that which everyone may have at his door , or even within arm 's reach a well filled set of book-shelves .

		Having this , we have , however socially isolated , the '' means of get - ting to know , on all matters which most con - cern us , the best which has been thought and said in the world . ''

		One is almost ashamed to make so hackneyed a phrase do duty once more , but
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	seized the root of the mat - ter , and if the thing needs to be repeated at all , it can hardly be done otherwise than in his words .

		Reading is a very serious affair , one of the most serious that there are , yet how few realize both in thought and act its educational possibilities .

		A man 's library , assuming it to be for use and not for display , is a better index to his character than the most detailed of ex - 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, ternal biographies .

		Show us the man at work in his library , and we view him in his essence , not in his seeming .

		There is no greater edu - cational problem than that of persuading men and women everywhere not merely the few favored by training and predisposition to surround themselves with books of the right sort , and to make the right use of them .

		Our popular educational movements , our C ^ autau - qua circles and
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	courses , are all working in this direction , although rather aimlessly and with much misdirection of energy ; what we need is more persistent and systematic endeavor effort duly elastic and individual in adaptation while still system - atic on the part of all who are occupied with the diverse phases of the educational movement .

		Every teacher , every librarian , every popular lecturer , every writer for magazine or newspa - per , can do something for the common cause by way of influence ; every private individual , in his own circle of acquaintances , can at least do something by way of example .

		The average adult , whose intellectual en - vironment seems to be a matter of choice , is really subjected to influences that are not easy to resist .

		The modern newspaper , with its bad writing and its vulgar ideals , the popular mag - azine , with its ephemeral or sensational pro- gramme , the cheap book , even cheaper in its contents than in its mechanical execution these are the temptations that beset his '' every spare hour , and deprive him of communion with the great spirits who stand ready to tell him '' the best which has been thought and said in the world . '' ''

		Will you go and gossip with your housemaid or your stable-boy , when you may talk with queens and kings ; or flatter yourself that it is with any worthy conscious - ness of your own claims to respect that you jostle with the hungry and common crowd for entree here , and audience there , while all the while this eternal court is open to you , with its society , wide as the world , multi - tudinous as its days , the chosen and the mighty of every place and time ? ''

		None of us can altogether escape the distracting influ - ence of the commonplace writing that on every hand insinuates itself into our acquaintance ; yet if we content ourselves with such work , if we do not resolutely reject its impudent preten - sion of sufficiency , we miss the most effective means for the realization of our better selves .

		Every reader ought now and then to fortify himself against temptation by reading some such essay as Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's on '' Kings ' Treas - uries , '' or Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's on '' The Study of Lit - erature , '' or Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's on '' The Choice of Books '' - not for their commendation of par - ticular lines of reading , or to blindly acquiesce in their individual dicta , but for their lofty standpoint , their liberal outlook , and their tonic effect .

		The foundations of the reading habit are , of course , laid in childhood ; and the responsi - bility for these foundations is one of the great - est that the professional educator has to bear .

		The child should be as carefully guided in the choice of his reading as the adult should be free to determine what is best for his own spiritual needs .

		How precious are the years from six to sixteen , with their eager receptivity and their retentive grasp , seems to be but im - perfectly understood by the directors of our schools .

		It is hardly less than criminal to pro- vide children of such an age with the namby - pamby artificial reading that is now manufac - tured for their use .

		A child 's reading should be confined to the very best literature that he is capable of understanding and it is aston - ishing what he will understand if given a chance .

		Nor should he be kept upon short ra - tions for the purpose of drill in vocal expression .

		Fresh matter is always better than old for dis - cipline , and the most vitalizing pages lose their power for good if too frequently conned .

		The childish desire for new worlds to conquer is very strong , and is sure to find vent in the wrong direction if not freely indulged in the right one .

		The high school and college period of edu - cation is essentially that in which the student is trained to shift for himself .

		It is the period when restrictions upon reading must be relaxed , and freedom of choice watchfully encouraged .

		Somewhere within this period of intellectual adolescence there comes a transitional stage which tests all the training of the previous year .

		The duty of those who are responsible for the student during this critical period is rather to stimulate than to direct his reading ; to encourage him in looking beyond the horizon of his text-books , to make it easy and pleasant for him to read in helpful lines ; to throw all sorts of unobtrusive obstacles in his path , if he exhibits any tendency toward intellectual dissi - pation .

		The school or college library is , next to the wise instructor , an essential factor in this problem , and the studies of history and literature , of the ancient and modern languages , are those upon which reliance must mainly be placed in this task of making of formal educa - \ V U
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL tion a real preparation for life .

		We have of late years witnessed a remarkable expansion in the scientific departments of school and col - lege , and a greatly increased expenditure for their adjuncts of laboratory and museum .

		The expansion was needed , and no educator can intelligently begrudge it .

		But the group of studies which find in the library both museum and laboratory the studies which we right - fully call humanities and for which we thereby claim the place - of first importance and of clos - est relationship to our deepest spiritual needs may fairly demand as much attention and as large an expenditure as the sciences of nature .

		It is not too much to ask that every dollar set apart for scientific apparatus shall be matched by another dollar set apart for literary appa - ratus .

		The student of history or of literature ought to have the use of his own set of books , just as the student of chemistry has the use of his own set of reagents .

		When the humanities come again into their own , this necessity will be recognized as fully as the necessity of labora - tory teaching in chemistry is now recognized .

		Given the right guidance in childhood , and the right influences during adolescence , the reading habit may be counted upon to remain a genuine educational influence through life .

		The importance of such guidance and such in - fluences can hardly be over-estimated .

		But for those who have missed them , for those who in the future will miss them , there is still the con - soling truth that serious aims coupled with earnest endeavor can nearly always find the path to a very complete culture . ''

		The best which has been thought and said in the world , '' like the sunlight , shines freely for all , and to it the veriest mole may , if he will , grope his way . ''

		Eeading maketh a full man , '' and more than that no scheme of formal education , however extensive , may accomplish .

		COLLEGE STANDING IN
IOWA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The college teachers of
Iowa	LOCATION	have been engaged in a discussion , since
1891	DATE	, regarding `` College Standing , '' which discussion , it seems to me , from the nature of some of the points involved has more than a local inter - est. .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	has within its borders an unusually large number of '' colleges '' and '' universities , '' even for a
Western State	ORGANIZATION	, perhaps two score or more .

		At its session in
1891	DATE	, the
College Department of the State Teachers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	determined to do what no other
State	ORGANIZATION	had attempted namely , to define practically the term '' College , '' and to exclude from membership those institutions not meeting the terms of the defini Consequently it was resolved that after
1893	DATE	no college should be eligible to membership '' which should not require for admission to the freshman class three full years of work above the grammar grade , and four addi - tional years of collegiate work for the baccalaureate degree . ''

		A committee was appointed in
1892	DATE	, to col - lect statistics on the following points : The number and variety of degrees conferred ; the requirements for the baccalaureate degrees ; and , finally , data indicating the equipment of
Iowa	LOCATION	Colleges for doing the work required .

		The first report of this committee was made in
1893	DATE	, and revealed a rather surprising state of affairs .

		Many institutions were doing preparatory work in the fresh - man year ; the line of demarcation was in some cases not clearly drawn between the academy , which is usu - ally found in connection with the Western college , and the collegiate department proper ; some were requiring their teachers to do both college and academy work ; and some had less than six teachers to do the entire work of the institution .

		The committee assumed in their consideration of the case that the term '' college '' had something like a definite value , and that it should not be applied to all institutions indiscriminately , with - out protest .

		To determine what the standard should be , was a part of the work of the committee .

		This is interesting , as it is perhaps the first attempt made in this country , under similar circumstances , to determine what the term '' college '' should mean .

		The following are the tests applied : First , satisfactory and complete conditions of admission to freshman standing ; second , correct organization of courses with sufficient force of instruction to create a college atmosphere ; third , fac - ulty of instruction , consisting of at least eight chairs , as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Psychology and Ethics -LRB- including in - struction in Philosophy and Logic -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- Ancient Lan - guages , -LRB- 3 -RRB- Mathematics and Astronomy , -LRB- 4 -RRB- English Language and Literature , -LRB- 5 -RRB- Physics and Chemistry , -LRB- 6 -RRB- Modern Language , -LRB- 7 -RRB- History and Political Sci - ence , -LRB- 8 -RRB- The Biological Sciences .

		Judged by these criteria , there were three institutions in the
State	ORGANIZATION	entitled to college standing .

		It was deemed undesirable , however , to exclude from the list some colleges doing work of a highly creditable character .

		Consequently there was recommended a '' provisional minimum '' of six chairs .

		In this provisional minimum , -LRB- 4 -RRB- and -LRB- 7 -RRB- of the foregoing list were classed together as '' English and History , '' and in like manner -LRB- 5 -RRB- and -LRB- 8 -RRB- were united under the term '' Natural Sciences . ''

		In this way the total number of colleges was increased to eight .

		The report was read , but action was post - poned for one year in order that corrections and additions might be made .

		At a recent meeting of the
College Department of the State Teachers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
December 27	DATE	-RRB- the report was taken up for final action .

		During the year every effort had been made to settle disputed points , and opportunity given to every institution to put itself in accord with the criteria proposed .

		Two institutions did this without trouble , making the total number ten .

		It was recommended that this number should be grouped together as '' Class A , '' while those failing in the tests should be included in '' Class B. '' The technical schools -LRB- which had not been considered at all by the committee -RRB- and the smaller colleges opposed the motion to adopt the report , with so much success that another postpone - ment for one year was secured .

		This postponement 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb.	DATE	.

		seems to be chiefly in the interest of the technical schools , since coupled with the motion to postpone was the rec - ommendation to '' reconsider the basis of classification . ''

		It is not likely that a vote on the report will ever be taken .

		The arbitrary settlement of a disputed point of this sort would be sure to meet with disfavor .

		The discussion , however , that has already been aroused has been of great value to the interests of higher education in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The stronger institutions have become somewhat more conscious of their deficiencies , while the weaker ones are making more earnest efforts than ever to reach a higher level .

		A POET TOO LITTLE KNOWN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your notice of the death of Professor
William Ruf us Perkins	PERSON	, author of '' Eleusis '' and other remarkable poems , inspires me to add a word of tribute to a poet too little known , and likely to receive a wider appreciation , as often happens , after death . ''

		Eleusis '' is a not un - worthy sequel to
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' In Memoriam , '' the mod - ern philosophical companion of the '' Rubaiyat '' of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	.

		One may find in it many quatrains equal to the following terse description of that subtle enchant - ment which
Rome	LOCATION	still weaves about the souls of scholar - pilgrims : '' I lay upon the
Palatine	LOCATION	When evening lit her changeless dome , And felt the mighty hand of
Rome Enfold	ORGANIZATION	and clasp itself in mine . '' ''

		Bellerophon '' is another remarkable poem a new interpretation of the old Greek myth , not surpassed by any of Miss
Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	's classical studies , such as '' Lityerses and the Reapers '' and '' Atys . ''

		Here is a little description which has the same effect upon the mind as Mr.
Elihu Vedder	PERSON	's lonely landscapes : '' Behind me lies the broad Aleian plain , The loneliest plain that faces to the sky , Across which , groping with increasing pain , I course forever , for I can not die .

		O heartless plain , and earless to my cry !

		A thousand thousand are the paths I wear On thy broad back ; and
Night	ORGANIZATION	, who does defy For most the spear of sorrow and of care , For me may bring no rest , but doubles up despair . ''

		Professor
Perkins	PERSON	once wrote me : `` I made up my mind when a boy that if I ever published anything in poetry , I would wait until I had made it perfect artistic - ally , '' and that saying is the keynote to his whole poet - ical work .

		A few brief details of the poet 's life , sent by him at my request , and intended for use in another periodical , may be quoted here : '' I was born in the year
1847	DATE	, in Erie ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		I graduated in
1868	DATE	at
Western Reserve College	ORGANIZATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, and was tutor in my
Alma Mater	PERSON	for three years after graduation ; then devoted myself to the reading of his - tory and law .

		In
1879	DATE	I was called to
Cornell Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity as Assistant Professor ; after six years at Cornell I went to
Europe	LOCATION	, where I remained a year , attending the Universities of
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Bonn	LOCATION	, and travelling .

		Upon my return I was called to this chair -LSB- History ,
State University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- .

		In the
spring of 1888	DATE	, I was elected a delegate to the
8th Centenary of Bologna University	ORGANIZATION	in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Going again to
Europe	LOCATION	, I attended this superb fete , and afterwards travelled in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, returning to the
University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	in the autumn .

		A first edition of ' Eleusis ' was issued in
1890	DATE	without the ' Lesser Poems , ' and was published anony - mously in accordance with the advice of several prom - inent men ; but in
1892	DATE	it was published by
Messrs. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in its present form . ''

		Professor
Perkins	PERSON	had planned a second volume of poems , and upon my asking him to make the pieces less threnodic in tone than those first published , he re - sponded , '' No , I shall never publish anything quite so threnodic again if I can help it . ''

		In
March last	DATE	, un - der the gathering shadows of ill health , he wrote me : '' As to the future volume , nothing can be said at pres - ent . ''

		His favorite poets were
Schiller	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, although
Thackeray	PERSON	's and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works were often found in his hands .

		He disliked athletic exercise and detested walking , but enjoyed sea - voyages intensely .

		Books and rare old china attracted him , but he had no particular passion as a collector .

		Until his health failed , he was by no means of so melancholy a temperament as his poems might seem to indicate .

		His poetical range was limited ; but what he achieved was full of promise for his future , and '' Eleusis , '' ''
Bellerophon	PERSON	, '' and `` Had - rian 's Lament Over Antinous '' are poems which the world ought not to let die .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In THE DIAL and elsewhere I frequently see the names of
Bjornson	PERSON	and other Norwegian authors with the title ''
Herr	PERSON	'' prefixed .

		This practice , which is common in
America	LOCATION	, is doubtless supposed to be in imitation of what is customary in the old country .

		As a rule , how - ever , the title '' flerr '' -LRB- nearly always written '' Hr . '' -RRB-

		is not used in
Norway	LOCATION	before the names of distinguished men .

		Bjornson ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, Lie ,
Kielland	LOCATION	, and the rest , are called so , or by their full names ,
Bjornstjerne Bjornson	PERSON	,
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	,
Jonas Lie	PERSON	, etc. , but hardly ever Hr .


Bjornson	PERSON	, etc. , except of course when addressed or spoken of in their hearing .

		Why should we in speak - ing of Norwegian authors adopt a form of title almost unknown in their native country ?

		-LSB- The titles by which gentlemen usually refer to one another are not given by THE DIAL to living writers '' in imitation '' of any actual or suppositi - tious practice in `` the old country , '' but because of what we believe to be the requirements of good lit - erary manners .

		Among the many vulgarities fos - tered by our newspapers none is , in our opinion , more detestable than the habit of constantly refer - ring to people as
Smith	PERSON	and
Jones	PERSON	and
Robinson	PERSON	, without the simple courtesy of a prefix .

		If the Scandinavian or other European practice derogates from this not very exacting standard , we must re - gret the fact without yielding the point .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The study of dialects in
America	LOCATION	, carrying with it an enumeration of the many interesting survivals in folk - speech , is still in its infancy , though much excellent work has already been done through the medium of the Dia - lect Society , and by Professors
Kittredge	PERSON	and
Sheldon	PERSON	of
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 105

H. A. Shands	PERSON	of
Texas	LOCATION	, Dr.
William Rice Sims	PERSON	of the
State University of Mississippi	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		The negro dialect , as spoken on the plantations in the South , is rich in survivals ; and that a number of these are still found in
England	LOCATION	, is shown by some examples taken from ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' a well of English unde - filed .

		Note the following : axe for ask ; spunky meaning spirited or brave , used also by whites in the South ; liefer as comparative of lief , meaning rather ; gwain for going ; peart , meaning well -LRB- as '' How is your old ` oman ? '' ''

		She 's right peart '' -RRB- ; clomb , preterite of climb -LRB- the negroes use more generally another form , clum -RRB- .

		These words and expressions are all in common use among the negroes , and must have come to them from old
England	LOCATION	.

		They were jotted down while read - ing rapidly ; a careful study of the book named would doubtless reveal many more .

		A friend , born in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, tells me that his grandmother always spoke of a village of a hundred housen , holding to the old form of the plural -LRB- compare oxen , hosen , etc. -RRB- .

		In ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' eyen is used as the plural of eye .

		Though the causative meaning of drench is recog - nized in the '' Century '' and '' International '' dictionaries , and still occurs in
England	LOCATION	-LRB- witness , '' Dosed him with torture as you drench a horse ''
Browning	PERSON	's '' Ring and Book , '' II. , 75 -RRB- , upon the testimony of several careful students of language it is no longer used in this sense in
New England	LOCATION	.

		In the South the verb is used very generally in the causative sense ; a horse is drenched for colic i. e. , his head is held up and he is caused forcibly to drink .

		The use of right -LRB- meaning very -RRB- and mighty , as ad - verbs , is general throughout the South , and the words are constantly in the mouths of those '' to the manner born . ''

		The use of '' mighty , '' characterized as colloquial in the great dictionaries , is met with in the
North and West	LOCATION	as well .

		In folk-speech we meet with the variants , to get shut , shet , or shed of , all meaning to get rid of , to relieve one 's self of .

		An
Ohio	LOCATION	man tells me that he is only fa - miliar with `` to get shut of '' ; and so says one from
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		A
North Carolinian	LOCATION	has heard both shed and shut ; while a
South Carolinian	LOCATION	whom I questioned was familiar only with shet .

		-LRB- See also Octave Thanet , ''
Peterson	PERSON	's Magazine , ''
January , 1893	DATE	-RRB- .

		I have heard all three forms .


Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, in '' A Pair of Blue Eyes , '' uses still another form , '' to get shot of . ''

		A shop-boy in ''
Neal	PERSON	's Sketches '' says : `` I want to get shut of you because I am going to shet the door . ''

		These two examples would indicate that this expression , too , came across the seas .

		The primitive idea seems to be riddance by means of shutting one out , for the forms shet and shot are used regularly by the negroes and are of common occurrence in the folk-speech of a large portion of this country , as '' Shet that door . '' ''

		The door is shot . ''

		The form shed , it seems , is probably a variation from shet ; whereas if the other forms were not three to one we might conclude that the original idea was that of riddance by taking off , as a garment .

		A well-known
Southern	ORGANIZATION	writer has a man of educa - tion a priest , in fact use unthoughtedly for thought - lessly ; and though in this case the writer nodded , she was unconsciously revealing her knowledge of folk - speech .

		The great dictionaries are innocent of this word , but its use is widespread in the
South	LOCATION	, and it has a position by tolerance in the vocabulary of some read - ing people .

		AN ENGLISH DIALECT DICTIONARY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Lexicography on the grand scale is the order of the day .

		Another thesaurus , this time in the form of an
English Dialect Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, is shortly to begin publica - tion .

		The materials which have been gradually collect - ing since the formation of the
English Dialect Society	ORGANIZATION	in
1873	DATE	have now reached such dimensions , and made such reasonable approach toward completeness , that the work of preparing for publication the million and more slips now on hand has actually been commenced , under the editorial supervision of Dr.
Joseph Wright	PERSON	, the Honorary Secretary of the society , assisted by Professor
W. W. Skeat	PERSON	.

		In response to Dr.
Wright	PERSON	's call for volunteers to cooperate in the work of completing the collections , some six hundred persons are now engaged in different parts of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in the organized work of excerpting from books and reducing dialectal glos - saries to the form of slips .

		It is the purpose of the editor to include in the dictionary all dialectal words or dialectal uses of words to be found within the entire do - main of the English speech of the eighteenth and nine - teenth centuries , i. e. , all words or uses of words not recognized in the standard English of this period .

		The dictionary will give in every case its authority , and , if possible , will cite , after the manner of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	's En - glish Dictionary , one or more passages illustrating the word and its use .

		Careful attention will also be paid to denning the habitat of the word ; and so far as pos - sible its history or etymology will also be determined .

		As it has been decided to include American English within the scope of the work , it becomes of great im - portance to the editors to secure immediate cooperation on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	in the collection of material .

		As yet , the only reliance is the very uncertain and con - fused material of our various dictionaries of ''
Ameri	PERSON	- canisms , '' and the excellent though rather hap-hazard word-lists which have appeared in the different num - bers of the '' Dialect Notes '' published since
1890	DATE	by the
American Dialect Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is evident how im - portant this new undertaking must prove for the study of American English ; it is , indeed , only through this clearing-house of a universal English dialect dictionary that we can hope to reach a test for the genuineness of '' Americanisms . ''

		All who may have material to con - tribute , or who may be willing to undertake assign - ment of books for reading , are requested to correspond with the editor , address , Professor
Joseph Wright	PERSON	, 6 Norham-road ,
Oxford	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	; or with
Professor Eu	ORGANIZATION	- gene
H. Babbitt	PERSON	,
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	,
New York City	LOCATION	, who will cooperate with the editor in securing and ar - ranging the American material .

		It is expected that a prospectus of the work , accompanied by specimen pages , will shortly be issued , and subscriptions will be solic - ited .

		The work will be furnished to subscribers at the rate of two numbers a year , with an annual subscription fee of 1 .

		For non-subscribers the price of each num - ber will be 15s .

		Concerning the length of time likely to be absorbed in publication , and the consequent extent of the work , the editors give no assurance ; this , we are to presume , the material will dictate .

		106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Ejje THE CONFESSIONS OF A JOURNALIST .

		* Tradition has it that when Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	heard that
James Boswell	PERSON	intended writing his life , he promptly proposed to prevent it by taking
Boswell	PERSON	's .

		It does not seem to have occurred to the Doctor , in the alarm and flurry of the mo - ment , that , without resorting to manslaughter , he could forestall the impending Life and ren - der it comparatively stingless by writing one himself .

		This milder preventive against unde - sirable biographers has latterly grown much in favor .

		Every man his own
Boswell	PERSON	, may fairly be called the biographical order of the day ; and the rule is not altogether a bad one .

		Every man is at least theoretically sure to deduct noth - ing from the tale of his own virtues ; and as experience shows that the list of his failings may safely be left to his friends -LRB- to say noth - ing of the press -RRB- , the public is tolerably sure in the end of a complete picture with the due chiaroscuro effect .

		Now and then there emerges from the rank and file of autobiographers one candid enough to relieve his friends of their melancholy office ; and such a one , emphatic - ally , is Mr.
George Augustus Sala	PERSON	.

		We have read Mr.
Sala	PERSON	's '' Life and Adventures '' with the liveliest interest .

		Here at last is an auto - biographer who is not only frank , but who even appears at times , in the exuberance of his candor , to bear himself a grudge .

		It may be meanly urged that Mr.
Sala	PERSON	, as an Old Jour - nalistic Hand , is unable from long habit to ab - stain from `` racy '' personalities and revelations , even at his own expense ; and that his frankness as to the follies and escapades of his youth rings more of an unrepentant Master Shallow than of a broken and a contrite heart .

		But the great fact of frankness remains ; and with it goes hand-in-hand the twin autobiographical virtue of modesty , for Mr.
Sala	PERSON	, so far from being with monotonous regularity the hero of his own `` Adventures , '' not seldom emerges con - spicuously at '' the smaller end of the horn . ''

		When , for instance , he engages in a '' row '' in a disreputable quarter of
London	LOCATION	, it is he , and not the enemy , who `` takes the floor '' and is carried away for repairs .

		When he sets out -LRB- as he does twice -RRB- for Aix-la-Chapelle or
Hom	PERSON	- burg with the cheerful intention of `` breaking the bank , '' he returns , not laden with thalers * THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF

Friederichs	PERSON	d'Or , but minus his valuables and plus sundry unpleasant tokens of their de - tention by
Herr Israel Hirsch	PERSON	,
Herr Salomon Fuchs	PERSON	,
Herr Benjamin Isaacstein	PERSON	, and other av - uncular friends of the
Gentile	LOCATION	in need .

		When , in
1884	DATE	, with his literary and journalistic hon - ors thick upon him , he re-visits
America	LOCATION	and is presented in state to General
Benjamin F. Butler	PERSON	, he is received by that hero , not with '' distinguished courtesy , '' but with the stag - gering avowal , '' If you had been in New Or - leans in
1864	DATE	I should most certainly have hanged you ; yes , sir ! ''

		and , adds Mr.
Sala	PERSON	, thoughtfully , '' I thoroughly believe the Gen - eral would have been as good as his word . ''

		Not to multiply examples , we shall only add that Mr.
Sala	PERSON	, after heaping on himself such actionable epithets as '' slovenly , careless , ne'er - do-weel , '' '' dissolute young loafer , '' '' outra - geous Mohock , '' etc. , caps the climax of self - immolation by pronouncing his own novel , '' The Baddington Peerage , '' '' almost the worst one ever perpetrated . ''

		In this instance , at least , he does not grossly exaggerate .

		Mr.
Sala	PERSON	was born in
1828	DATE	, at
London	LOCATION	, where his mother , widowed shortly after his birth , was a teacher of singing , and , later , an actress .

		Madam Sala had a distinguished clientele , and played at the leading theatres ; but , with five young children on her hands , she had no little trouble bringing the proverbial ends together .

		Twice a year , to eke out her income , she gave special concerts , one at
London	LOCATION	and the other at
Brighton	LOCATION	.

		For one of these occasions she had the temerity to engage , at great expense , not only Mme.
Malibran	PERSON	, but Paganini the poor lady cherishing the hope that in the end one or perhaps both artistes would generously waive their pecuniary claims .

		The concert was a brilliant success ; and then came the ordeal of paying the bills .

		The lesser performers , as usual , smilingly refused to accept a shilling for their services .

		Not so the great
Malibran	PERSON	.

		Says our author : '' The renowned singer smiled , chucked me under the chin , patted me on the head , told me to be a good boy , and very calmly took the thirty-one pounds ten shill - ings which with trembling hands my mother placed upon the table . ''

		Thus depleted in purse and hopes ,
Madam Sala	ORGANIZATION	sought out
Paganini	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of this celebrity , our author says : '' I can see him now a lean , wan , gaunt man in black , with bushy hair something like
Henri Rochefort	PERSON	, and more like
Henry Irving	PERSON	.

		He looked at me long and earn - estly ; and somehow , although he was about as weird a looking creature as could well be imagined , I did not feel
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 107 afraid of him .

		In a few broken words my mother ex - plained her mission , and put down the fifty guineas on the table .

		When I say that he washed his hands in the gold that he scrabbled at it , as
David	PERSON	of old did at the gate and grasped it and built it into little heaps , panting the while , I am not in any way exaggerating .

		He bun - dled it up at last in a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief with white spots and darted from the room .

		And we my poor mother convulsively clasping my hand went out on the landing and were about descending the stairs when the mighty violinist bolted again from the bed - room door . '

		Take that , little boy , ' he said , ' take that , ' and he thrust a piece of paper , rolled up into a ball , into my hand .

		It was a bank-note for fifty pounds ! ''

		Mr.
Sala	PERSON	is not a university man , or even a public-school man .

		With a large fund of gen - eral knowledge , he has -LRB- like a greater man be - fore him -RRB- little Latin and less Greek judged by Porsonian standards ; nor has his lack of scholastic finish escaped the jibes of brother writers of double his learning and half his abil - ity .

		His formal schooling was meagre , com - prising a season at
Paris	LOCATION	and a twelvemonth at ''
Bolton House	ORGANIZATION	, ''
Turnham Green	PERSON	, the latter a '' Pestalozzian '' establishment where the mak - ing of sapphics and alcaics was coupled with instruction in carpentry , joinery , gardening , and other practical branches , to the no small scandal of academic Dr.
Blimbers	PERSON	.

		Among Mr.
Sala	PERSON	's
Paris	LOCATION	school-fellows was the younger
Dumas	PERSON	, then a shapely youth of sixteen , with '' very light blue-grey eyes , and an abundance of very light auburn hair , which curled in a frizzled mass . ''

		Of
Dumas	PERSON	, one story is pre - served : '' Among the articles the use of which was for some absurd reason or other forbidden to us pensionnaires , was an opera-glass ; and young
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	, who was once at the back of the pit , and who was naturally short-sighted , coolly produced such a forbidden object , and began to scan
Frederick the Great	PERSON	and his page be - hind the foot-lights .

		The mutinous act was at once perceived and resented by the Prefect of Studies .

		A bas le lorgnon ,
M. Dumas	PERSON	!

		a has le lorgnon ! '

		he ex - claimed in wrathful tones .

		Unprophetical prefect !

		Little could the pedant , unendowed with foresight , know that the lad who had violated the school regula - tions by using a lorgnon was destined to be the author of ' Le Demi-Monde ' and ' La Dame aux Came ` lias . ' ''

		At fifteen , Mr.
Sala	PERSON	found himself under the necessity of '' facing the world , '' with little or nothing in the way of capital or marketable knowledge to forward the enterprise .

		After a short term with a miniature-painter , he tried in turn law-copying , scene-painting , translating , illustrating Penny Dreadfuls -LRB- '' there must be more blood , Mr.
Sala	PERSON	much more blood ! ''

		was the great editorial requirement of this branch -RRB- , engraving , scribbling , and what not , leading a rather '' loaferish '' life the while , and decidedly not one lying along the shores of a Pactolus .

		Dire at times were Mr.
Sala	PERSON	's fiscal straits , and manifold his shifts to relieve them .

		We find him at one stage reduced to the hu - miliating point of smoking , and even dining , vicariously of walking behind smokers of fra - grant Havanas to catch an occasional whiff , and of staring in at club-windows , where stout gentlemen of stall-fed and port-winey aspect plied their knives and forks and glowered at the dinnerless outsider .

		At one of these sea - sons of gloom he tried to cobble his fortunes by pushing those of '' The Shaking
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	's Her - bal Pill , '' designing and engraving the hand - bills , etc. , and even '' taking several boxes of Shaking Quakers '' himself to reassure a tim - orous public .

		Mr.
Sala	PERSON	's formal entry into journalism was not auspicious .

		About 1850 he became editor and co-proprietor of '' Chat , '' a half-penny weekly , in the theoretical '' profits '' of which he was kindly allowed to participate .

		But there were , in practice , no profits ; and , the chief owner of '' Chat '' judiciously absconding , Mr.
Sala	PERSON	and his associates found themselves '' un - der the unpleasant necessity of fighting for the small change in the till . ''

		Mr.
Sala	PERSON	's lane , like all others , had its turn - ing .

		The decisive turn came with the close of the Crimean War , when he was commissioned by
Dickens	PERSON	to go to
Russia	LOCATION	in order to write a series of descriptive articles for '' Household Words . ''

		His forte soon became apparent .

		From that date on , Mr.
Sala	PERSON	's autobiography lapses largely into a perhaps unavoidably jum - bled record of his adventures in one country or another as a press correspondent the reader of it being whisked about geographically in a way suggesting that at times the writer must have been , like the Irishman 's bird , `` in two places at once . ''

		From
1856	DATE	downwards , wher - ever matters of an exciting nature were stir - ring wars or rumors of wars , coronations , po - litical murders , revolutions , exhibitions , and the like journalistically exploitable doings there was Mr.
Sala	PERSON	in the thick of it with his pencil and notebook .

		He was in
America	LOCATION	in ' 634 and again in '84 ; with
Garibaldi	PERSON	in the
Tyrol	LOCATION	in '65 ; at
Paris	LOCATION	in '67 and in '70 ; in
Turkey	LOCATION	in '67 ; in
Russia	LOCATION	again in '76 ; in
Spain	LOCATION	in '75 ; in
Australia	LOCATION	in '84 ; and so on .

		He saw
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	's triumphal entry into
Venice	LOCATION	, and , later , into
Rome	LOCATION	; he saw the obsequies of the murdered Tsar Alexander II. , and the coro - nation of his successor ; he passed through the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	, and an after-dinner speech by 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Mr.
Chauncey Depew	PERSON	and we regret to add here that , like most Englishmen , he declines to indorse Mr.
Depew	PERSON	's post-prandial wit .

		Says Mr.
Sala	PERSON	, with that singular insensibility to the fine point of our national humor , so often noted by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, Professor
Matthews	PERSON	, and others : '' Mr.
Chauncey Depew	PERSON	made a great point in his speech by saying that I was going to
Australia	LOCATION	by way of
Portland	LOCATION	, in the
State of Maine	LOCATION	: a city which I never had the pleasure of visiting ; but he repeated the asser - tion over and over again , and every time he reiterated it the company laughed uproariously : a circumstance which strengthened a long-existing conviction in my mind that in after-dinner speaking and ' stage-gagging ' you have only to continually repeat something ' What 's o'clock ? '

		or That 's the idea ! '

		or < How do you feel now ? '

		or ' Still I am not happy ! '

		to excite the hilarity of your hearers . ''

		From Mr.
Sala	PERSON	's anecdotes of
Garibaldi	LOCATION	we select a characteristic one , touching the final disposal of that hero 's
General	ORGANIZATION	's uniform , a gorgeous affair , much despised by its owner , which contrasted queerly enough with the his - toric red woollen shirt of campaigning days .

		The General wore the uniform but twice , on great state occasions , and that under protest . ''

		When he returned to his island home at
Caprera	LOCATION	, it is a comical fact that he presented his General 's much - gold-laced panoply to his cowherd , who gravely drove cattle about the fields of Caprera in this gorgeous mar - tial array .

		Exposure to wind and rain and a scorching
summer	DATE	sun very soon reduced the stately garb to a lamentable state of seediness ; and the cowherd , who preferred freedom of action to being tightly buttoned up , always wore the coat open , so as to display a coarse canvas shirt , with a red woollen sash round the waist .

		It was the delight of
Garibaldi	PERSON	and his friends , when they met the cowherd , gravely to salute him in military fashion , and hail him as ' mio Generale . ' ''

		We shall end our poachings on Mr.
Sala	PERSON	's well-stocked , if somewhat ill-ordered , preserves with the story of his encounter with a late no - torious character who , by an oversight prob - ably , missed inclusion in Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	's recent book on '' Eminent Scoundrels . ''

		In
February , 1889	DATE	, Mr.
Sala	PERSON	received a note written in hot haste by Mr.
Henry Labouchere	PERSON	, which ran thus : '' Can you leave everything , and come here at once ?

		Most important business .

		H. L. '' In a quarter of an hour he was seated in Mr.
La	PERSON	- bouchere 's library .

		The member for
Northamp	PERSON	- ton was not alone . ''

		Ensconced in a roomy fauteuil a few paces from Mr.
Labouchere	PERSON	's desk there was a somewhat burly in - dividual of middle stature and of more than middle age .

		He looked fully sixty ; but his elderly aspect was en - hanced by his baldness , which revealed a large amount of oval os frontis fringed by grey locks .

		He had an eye-glass screwed into one eye , and was using this op - tical aid most assiduously , for he was poring over a copy of that morning 's issue of the ' Times , ' going right down one column and apparently up it again ; then taking column after column in succession ; then harking back as though he had omitted some choice paragraph ; and then resuming the sequence of his lecture , ever and anon tapping that ovoid frontal bone of his , as though to evoke memories of the past , with a little silver pen - cil case .

		I noticed his somewhat shabby-genteel attire ; and in particular I observed that the hand which held the copy of the ' Times ' never ceased to shake .

		Mr.
La	PERSON	- bouchere , in his most courteous manner and his blandest tone said , Allow me to introduce you to a gentleman of whom you must have heard a great deal , Mr. ' I replied , ' There is not the slightest necessity for nam - ing him .

		I know him well enough .

		That 's Mr.
Pigott	PERSON	. '

		... Mr.
Labouchere	PERSON	continued : ` The fact is that Mr.
Pigott	PERSON	has come here quite unsolicited , to make a full confession .

		I told him that I would listen to nothing save in the presence of a witness , and remembering that you lived close by , I thought you would not mind coming here and listening to what Mr.
Pigott	PERSON	has to confess , which will be taken down , word by word , from his dictation in writing . ' ''

		The veracious
Pigott	PERSON	, ostensibly studying the '' Times , '' had clearly been trying to screw his faltering courage up to the sticking-point of his now famous confession .

		At length he rose , and stood beside Mr.
Labouchere	PERSON	's desk .

		He did not change color , says Mr.
Sala	PERSON	; he did not blench ; but , at first in a half-musing tone , then louder and more fluently , he told his shameful story , coolly confessing that he alone had forged the letters alleged to have been writ - ten by Mr.

		Says Mr.
Sala	PERSON	: `` No pressure was put upon him ; no leading ques - tions were asked him ; and he went on quietly and con - tinuously to the end of a story which I should have thought amazing had I not had occasion to hear many more tales even more astounding .

		He was not voluble , but he was collected , clear , and coherent ; nor , although he repeatedly confessed to forgery , fraud , deception , and misrepresentation , did he seem overcome with any - thing approaching active shame . ''

		Commenting on the

Sala	PERSON	concludes : '' Whether the man with the bald head and the eye - glass in the library at

		THE DIAL 109 LITERATURE AS A UNIVERSITY STUDY .

		* When I was a student in
Germany	LOCATION	, I went one morning to my lecture ; and Professor
Sievers	PERSON	, instead of beginning at once , in the rather abrupt professorial manner , on the sub - ject of the day , spoke for some minutes on the character and the work of Professor Zarncke of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, who had just died .

		Professor
Siev	PERSON	- ers had himself been one of Zarncke 's students , and he wished to make his own students un - derstand and feel what the work of his master had been to German philology .

		Later in the morning I went to hear a certain privat-docent , and he too began his lecture with feeling words on the character and scholarship of Zarncke , with whom he too had studied , many years after Professor
Sievers	PERSON	.

		I was much struck by this tribute to the power of the teacher ; it had something in it more impressive than the Ju - bilaum or the Festschrift .

		A science that has such professors is fortunate ; it is thus that its best traditions are kept up , that its real life is continued .

		We have to-day very , very few teachers of English literature who have exercised any such influence over their students as Zarncke exer - cised for many years over some of the best scholars of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But of these few there can be no doubt that Professor
Corson	PERSON	is one .

		I do not know who among the younger teach - ers of English have ever studied with him ; but they know themselves , which is the im - portant matter , and their students reap the benefit of it .

		Among all the teachers in Amer - ica , I suppose Professor
Corson	PERSON	is one of the few who are really men of genius .

		With all his eccentricities and mistakes -LRB- I speak with too much earnestness to have regard to conven - tionality -RRB- , Professor
Corson	PERSON	has a keenness of insight into the living meaning of things that I can compare only with the power of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, or possibly of Professor
Dowden	PERSON	, among those now living who have given thought and study to the interpretation of literature .

		It is only of recent years that this power has come to expression in books .

		And these books , remarkable contributions to criticism as they are , do not adequately convey Profes - sor
Corson	ORGANIZATION	's influence .

		It is therefore an ex - cellent thing that he has now endeavored to condense the spirit of his teaching into an essay called '' The Aims of Literary Study . ''

		It will readily be inferred that I consider the * THE AIMS OF LITERARY STUDY .

		By
Hiram Corson	PERSON	, LL.D .


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		book of extreme value to all interested in the subject .

		It has the great merit of conveying successfully just what it attempts to convey .

		I do not think anyone could mistake it .

		A stu - dent of Professor
Corson	PERSON	's who reads it feels at once a revival of the old fire that was kindled when he first went into that stuffy lecture-room in
White Hall	LOCATION	.

		On others , the effect will per - haps hardly be so striking ; but still the book will say what it is meant to say .

		The purport of the book will be best given by some extracts ; it would lose by the attempt to paraphrase .

		It is very easy to misrepresent by means of extracts , but I hope the following will give an idea of the direction in which Pro- fessor
Corson	PERSON	's power has been felt by his students . ''

		Literature is not a mere knowledge subject , as the word knowledge is usually understood , namely , that with which the discursive , formulating intellect has to do .

		But it is a knowledge subject -LRB- only that and nothing more -RRB- if that higher form of knowledge be meant , which is quite outside of the domain of the intellect a knowledge which is a matter of spiritual consciousness and which the intellect can not translate into a judgment .

		It is nevertheless , at the same time , the most distinct and vital kind of knowledge '' -LRB- p. 25 -RRB- . ''

		The human spirit is a complexly organized , individ - ualized divine force , which in most men is cabined , crib - bed , confined ; and in consequence , more or less qui - escent ; only in a very few does it attain to an abnormal quickening such a quickening as leads to a more or less direct perception of truth , which is a characteristic of genius .

		But there have always been men , in all times and places and in all conditions of life , whose spiritual sen - sitiveness has been exceptional men who have served as beacons to their fellows .

		It is the spiritual sensitive - ness of the few which has moved the mass of mankind forward ... The intellect plays a secondary part '' -LRB- p. 39 -RRB- . ''

		Being is teaching , the highest , the only quickening mode of teaching ; the only mode which secures that un - conscious following of a superior spirit by an inferior spirit of a kindled soul by an unkindled soul . '

		Surely , ' says
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, ' Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice , him or her I shall follow , As the water follows the moon , silently , with fluid steps any - where around the globe . '

		And so , to get at the being of a great author , to come into relationship with his absolute personality , is the highest result of the study of his works '' -LRB- p. 57 -RRB- . ''

		The condition under which our souls silently shape themselves to whatever is , spiritually speaking , most shapely , outside of ourselves , is that we attain to what
Wordsworth	PERSON	calls a wise passiveness . '

		It is a thing to be attained to , and a very difficult thing to be attained to , especially in these days of stress and strain in temporal matters .

		A wise passiveness .

		The epithet ' wise ' means wise in heart ; and a wise passiveness I understand to be quite synonymous with the Christian idea of humility that is , not a self-depreciation , but , rather , a spontan - eous and even unconscious fealty , an unswerving loyalty , to what is spiritually above us '' -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- . ''

		How is the best response to the essential life of a 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, poem to be secured by the teacher from the student ?

		I answer , by the fullest interpretative vocal rendering of it .

		And by < fullest ' I mean that the vocal render - ing must exhibit not only the definite intellectual artic - ulation or framework of a poem , through emphasis , grouping , etc. , but must , through intonation , varied qual - ity of voice , and other means , exhibit that which is in - definite to the intellect .

		The latter is the main object of vocal rendering .

		A product of the insulated intellect does not need a vocal rendering '' -LRB- p. 99 -RRB- .

		It is impossible to give the full purport of a book in half a dozen extracts , yet these quota - tions will , I hope , give an approximate notion of what Professor
Corson	PERSON	would have the teach - ing of English literature .

		He would have it a force which should form and strengthen the spiritual nature of the student .

		With his in - tellect , in and for itself , it would have nothing to do .

		Spiritual and intellectual , we know well enough what the words mean , though it is hard to define the precise difference .

		Now any - one can see the value of such suggestions ; the difficulty comes in carrying them out .

		I believe there will be many a zealous and practical teacher of literature who , having read the book thoughtfully , and considered what it implies in university teaching nowadays , will lay it down with a '' This will never do . ''

		Such is , in fact , my own feeling , to be quite honest .

		It will not do , for university teaching .

		Professor Cor - son 's answer will be , '' So much the worse for the universities and those who are taught there . ''

		And to see how good is to come out of the deadlock requires a wiser head than mine .

		But there are one or two things which should be held in mind .

		Universities and colleges at present con - cern themselves almost entirely with one only of the several elements which should make a part of everybody 's education .

		Surroundings , conduct , art , religion , these are elements of vast importance in education ; but with these the university does not particularly concern itself .

		Whether this confinement of its sphere be for good or ill , may be an open question ; but , on the whole , it will be allowed that as a matter of fact the university does very largely confine itself to science .

		Some universities are devoted to science for its own sake , and not as an educational agent .

		But our American uni - versities deal chiefly with science for its edu - cational effect .

		Now the educational effect of science is two-fold : it is special , as when a man who intends to be a chemist studies chem - istry , or as when a man who desires to have any sort of information or training pursues the particular study that will give him the informa - tion and training he desires ; and it is also gen - eral , as when we consider the strengthening and formative effect of university study as a whole .

		In these two directions tends almost all university study .

		It educates a man in partic - ular branches of knowledge , and it gives him also the discipline of scientific thinking .

		Those things which can not be brought under one or another head do not , as a rule , have any place in university curricula .

		Many excellent edu - cational forces have no place in university curri - cula .

		Conduct , surroundings , art , religion , have no formal representation there except as dealt with by science .


Cardinal Newman	PERSON	, in speaking of a certain theory or philosophy , once said : '' Where it prevails , it is as unreasonable to demand for religion a chair in a university , as to demand one for fine feeling , sense of hon - our , patriotism , gratitude , maternal affection , or good companionship , proposals which would be simply unmeaning . ''

		The university , in other words , is commonly regarded as the train - ing-school for the intellect .

		And in no scheme for intellectual training alone does Professor
Corson	PERSON	's literary study find any place ; he would be the first to say so .

		Whether it should be so , is another matter .

		That it is so , is fully understood by Professor
Corson	PERSON	, as we see by his treatment of that essential feature of the present university system , the examination .

		The university concerns itself with intellectual training ; its whole system , and method , and discipline is designed for intellectual training .

		Other educational forces it deals with only in - cidentally ; they must look out for themselves .

		So the matter stands at present .

		Literature is , in a manner , out of place in the universities .

		Every good teacher of literature has felt it a hundred times .

		The study of language is one thing ; but the study of literature as one of the fine arts , save as a branch of history or psychology , is not a university discipline .

		Ef - forts to make it such result to the detriment of literature as an art .

		And that gives the re - lation of Professor
Corson	PERSON	's book to present university teaching .

		One thing further : In spite of much that may be said , it does not seem to me that the present is a time in which the intellect is ac - corded too high a place of honor .

		I should say , on the other hand , that comparatively few people nowadays have had the advantage of an education which has enabled them to use their intellects to full advantage .

		The time is not overburdened with thought ; or if it is , the trouble lies with those who would like to think .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL ill The schools may be full of ridiculous analytic method in the name of thought , but the world is full of ridiculous mental processes of no name at all .

		One may be heartily in sympathy with Professor
Corson	PERSON	's enthusiasm for spiritual ed - ucation , and yet not acknowledge that we have too much intellectual education .

		Or we may have too much of it , but it is n't of the right sort .

		The question is not one of substitution .

		We must keep on doing one thing -LRB- do it better if only we could -RRB- , and not leave the other un - done .

		I have tried to show clearly the place of this book of Professor
Corson	PERSON	's in our thinking about education .

		It is a very small book in fact , it is an 18mo .

		I wish it were larger , for it ought to hold a place of dignity on the book-shelf alongside of works of greater size but less excellence .

		In its present shape , however , it will be easier to bind it upon the tablet of the heart which is rather more to the purpose .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		AN UNSUCCESSFUL , HISTORY .

		* President
Andrews	PERSON	, of
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, has written a history of the
United States	LOCATION	, in two volumes .

		It begins with pre-historic Amer - ica and ends with the
Congress of 1894	ORGANIZATION	.

		A book of this scope , written in good style , giv - ing cleverly an outline of facts for the four centuries in which
America	LOCATION	has been known , has long been needed .

		We have school texts , and long scholarly histories ; but practically nothing of moderate compass , at once accurate and readable .

		The series of three little vol - umes edited by Professor
Hart	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	are scholarly , truthful , and in every way admira - ble ; but it may be that the form and the method will not make them attractive to the general reader .

		President
Andrews	PERSON	has en - deavored to satisfy the need of such a work .

		The disagreeable task of recording his failure is thrust upon the reviewer .

		The author gives seven reasons for the ap - pearance of these volumes .

		Among them are these : This history is believed to utilize , `` more than any of its predecessors , the many valuable researches of recent years into the rich ar - chives of this and other nations '' ; he has sought to make prominent not only the political evo - lution , but the social habits and life of the peo - * HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES .

		pie ; '' the work strives to observe scrupulous proportion in treating the different phases of our national career '' ; '' no pains has been spared to secure perfect accuracy in all refer - ences to dates , persons , and places , so that the volume may be used with confidence as a work of reference . ''

		These are laudable endeavors ; but candor compels us to say that they have never blossomed into actuality , and that the failure of the book is noteworthy in these very particulars .

		Whether or not scrupulous proportions have been observed is of course a matter of judg - ment , and there must be differences of opinion .

		But it seems to me that , in spite of the import - ance of the Civil War , a seventh of the whole work is too much to devote to its considera - tion .

		There is no space for a discussion of the
Hutchinson	PERSON	controversy in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, whereas there is a page given to '' Wigs '' in the chapter on '' Social Culture . ''

		The chapter on '' American Manhood in the Revolution '' is well written , but space might have been found for the statement that all of the Americans were not Whigs , for we are loth to attribute to any reason save want of space the fact that the Loyalists are not mentioned .

		Of course this leaves the impression that the American Revolution was a vast national uprising , in which everyone entered heart and soul .

		Space , it seems , might also have been given , if only a line or two , to an admission that we did not always whip the British frigates and schooners in the war of
1812	DATE	.

		Common fairness demands this , much as we love to lay the flattering unc - tion to our souls that our Yankee sailors in many a hard-fought battle proved to the arro - gant English tar that he had not acquired a monopoly of the ocean .

		The difference be - tween a well and an ill proportioned book may be seen by comparing Professor
Hart	PERSON	's '' Form - ation of the Union '' with President
Andrews	PERSON	's treatment of the same period .

		That the author has not succeeded in his en - deavor to bring out the '' political evolution '' of the country , is as striking as anything else .

		His treatment of the formation and develop - ment of the Republican party , for example , leaves almost everything to be desired .

		A chap - ter on the Whig party , which is introduced im - mediately after the war of
1812	DATE	, will leave the average reader hopelessly at sea .

		The word Whig was not used until after
1830	DATE	.

		It is dis - tressing to find
Webster	PERSON	's defence of the com - promise of
1850	DATE	treated of before the
Missouri	LOCATION	compromise .

		Some regard for chronology is 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, desirable in a popular work .

		Federalism and anti - federalism are neither adequately nor clearly treated .

		The difference between strict and loose constructions is thus given : '' In matters relating to the powers of the general government , ought any unclear utterance of the Constitution to be so explained as to enlarge those powers , or so as to confine them to the narrowest possible sphere ? ''

		Surely a consider - ation of
Hamilton	PERSON	's famous defence of the
Bank Bill	ORGANIZATION	, and of
Jefferson	PERSON	's attack upon it , might have begotten a more distinct and schol - arly statement than this .

		But in this , as in nearly everything else , the book betokens haste .

		The author has not taken the time either to turn to the opinions of the men in this famous controversy , or to formulate for himself a clear and thoughtful definition of the doctrine of implied powers .

		The effort to have this volume strictly accu - rate '' in all references to dates , persons , and places '' has not been successful .

		Complete and absolute accuracy is perhaps not a possibility for anyone ; but the author of this book might have achieved greater success in his attempt to reach the unattainable had he been careful and slow .

		Space will not be taken to give a list of all the mistakes .

		The following examples will suf - fice : Of the five maps , three have gross errors and a fourth is misleading .

		The worst is per - haps the map purporting to show the '' United Colonies at the beginning of the Revolution . ''

		There never was such a country thus divided .

		The map bears on its face marks of its own absurdity .

		The
Northwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	, for ex - ample , organized in
1787	DATE	, is found on this map .

		The
Southwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	is there as well .

		And yet
Tennessee	LOCATION	had been admitted by the time the Territory of
Mississippi	LOCATION	was formed , although this also finds its place here .

		Other mistakes in the map need not be mentioned .

		On the map showing the progressive acquisition of territory ,
West Florida	LOCATION	is given as part of
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		It is true , we claimed it as part of our purchase from
France	LOCATION	; but modern re - search has shown that our claim and our seizure were unjustified by any sound title .

		The map introduced to illustrate the `` United States af - ter the admission of
Arkansas	LOCATION	'' is misleading .

		The author may have had the right idea , but the purpose of a map is graphically to show facts .

		What is here called the `` Northwest Territory not yet admitted , '' was
Michigan Territory	ORGANIZATION	.


Florida	LOCATION	was not yet a State in the
Union	LOCATION	, as it here appears to be .

		It may be worth while to point out a few other inaccuracies .

		It is not a pleasant task to make a review chiefly a list of blunders , but only a recital of some of these can serve to sub - stantiate a final judgment on the book .


Colum	PERSON	- bus did not die in
1505	DATE	; nor is it by any means certain that the ''
Columbus	LOCATION	remains till re - cently at
Havana	LOCATION	'' are `` those of his son Diego . ''

		The following statement concerning the found - ing of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	is , to say the least , inaccu - rate : ''
Boston	LOCATION	was made the capital .

		Soon em - igrants came , and
Charlestown	LOCATION	was founded . ''

		As a matter of fact , the founders passed from
Charlestown	LOCATION	to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The year
1638	DATE	is not generally accepted as the date of the founding of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	.

		McHenry was not '' sec - ond Secretary of War . ''

		The first
Congress	ORGANIZATION	did not establish the mint .

		It is flattery to say that
Jefferson	PERSON	was '' ardent for the Constitu - tion '' while it was before the people for adop - tion .


France	LOCATION	gained possession of
Louisiana	LOCATION	in
1800	DATE	, not
1801	DATE	.

		The author gives the price which we paid for this accession to our terri - tories as eighty millions of francs , '' we to as - sume in addition the French spoliation claims of our citizens . ''

		As a matter of fact , the price was sixty millions of francs , to be taken by
France	LOCATION	in the form of
United States	LOCATION	bonds for
$ 11,250,000	MONEY	.

		We were also to pay the debts which
France	LOCATION	owed to American citizens ; these were estimated at
$ 3,750,000	MONEY	, or twenty mil - lions of francs , the whole sum being
$ 15,000	MONEY	, - 000 , or eighty millions of francs .

		Again , a glance at a trustworthy map would have pre - cluded the author from saying that
Harrison	PERSON	pursued Proctor '' up the
River Thames	LOCATION	to a point beyond Sandwich . ''

		Sandwich is not on the Thames , but several miles south of the mouth of that river .

		At
St. Glair	ORGANIZATION	's defeat the Indians were not '' under the redoutable
Jos	PERSON	- eph Brant . ''

		There is some evidence that
Brant	PERSON	was there and gave some advice to the head chieftain , but the Indians were under
Little Turtle	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not just accurate to say that the fort on the
Maumee	LOCATION	Rapids was '' still held , fifty miles within our lines . ''

		The fort was not built till
1794	DATE	.

		It is difficult to determine what the author could have had in mind when he says : '' By
1840	DATE	nearly all the land of the
United States	LOCATION	this side the
Mississippi	LOCATION	had been taken up by settlers . ''

		There is a very evident misprint , such as might escape anyone , on page 361 of Volume
I. Marshall	PERSON	was not one of the signers of the
Treaty of Ghent	ORGANIZATION	.

		Genet was not succeeded by Adet ; Fauchet intervened .

		The tables of population of the Colonies are misleading .

		It is absolutely impossible to give
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 exact figures , and it is perhaps not too much to ask that the author give some indication that his statements are only estimates .

		The words about the famous Ordinance of
1787	DATE	are so wrong and misleading that they are worth quoting : ``
July 13 , 1787	DATE	,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	adopted for the govern - ment of the Territory the famous Ordinance of
1787	DATE	.

		It provided for a governor , council , and judges , to be appointed by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and a house of representatives elected by the people .

		Its shining excellence was a series of compacts between the States and the
Terri	ORGANIZATION	- tories , which guaranteed religious liberty , made grants of land and other liberal provisions for schools and col - leges , and forever prohibited slavery in the Territory or the States which should be made out of it . ''

		A comparison between these statements and the words of the famous Ordinance would be interesting .

		There are good things to be said about these volumes .

		The language is at times terse and to the point .

		Whenever the author has taken the time to look up his materials and to arrange them , he has shown power in narration and great vigor in description .

		In spite of the roughness of the style , one is often hurried along with a sense of genuine pleasure , and is at times aroused to real enthusiasm .

		This power has its dangers ; for the writer of a popular narrative is always tempted to make sweeping assertions , and to declare in broad phrases a mixture of truth and fiction which is more characteristic of the historical novel than of history .

		One would like to be able to say that , in spite of occasional errors in fact , the generali - zations and final judgments of these volumes are sound and trustworthy , and that the nar - rative is so arranged that the reader is led to a judicious and sensible comprehension of the drift and scope of our history .

		But it is im - possible to reach that decision .

		The book has been written in the utmost haste , at a reckless rate of speed , and the indications are apparent on almost every page .

		Careful and thorough revision may do something to correct blunders , modify paradoxical judgments , and give se - quence and clearness to the narration .

		SOME RECENT BOOKS ON EDUCATION .

		* The first four books in our present list had , in a general sense , the same origin .

		This is described in the common preface that introduces them to the reader .

		This preface , which is signed by Mr.
R. D. Roberts	PERSON	, recites that the
Gilchrist Trustees	PERSON	, for whom he is Secretary , decided , in the early part of
1893	DATE	, to send five women teachers to the
United States	LOCATION	, for the purpose of studying and reporting upon sec - ondary schools for girls , and training colleges for women , in different parts of the country ; being moved thereto by the growing interest in secondary education in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	and the import - ant problems there awaiting solution .

		The Trustees made their intention widely known , and invited the governing bodies of the various women 's colleges and associations of teachers to submit to them names of persons specially qualified to undertake such a mission .

		From the list of names thus furnished , after careful consideration of the qualifications of the candidates , the Trustees elected the five ladies whose names appear on the title-pages of these books , and awarded to each of them 100 to enable them to spend two months in the
United States	LOCATION	in prose - cuting their inquiries .

		The five scholars made their visits as proposed , and on their return home sub - mitted carefully prepared reports of what they had seen .

		The Trustees have aided also in the publi - cation of the reports , believing that a knowledge of educational systems and experiments that have been tried in
America	LOCATION	can not fail to be of interest and value to teachers in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		These facts we have stated , not merely because they serve to * METHODS OF EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES .

		114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, explain the appearance at the same time , from the same publishing houses , of four works on such closely related subjects , but more especially because they suggest the remark that holders of educational trusts , and other persons interested in education , in this country , could render the cause they have at heart a service by emulating the example of the
Gilchrist Trustees	ORGANIZATION	.

		While the practice is by no means an un - known one in our educational annals , it is still one that might be extended with much advantage .

		Before the embassy left
England	LOCATION	, it was found advisable , in view of the magnitude of the task , somewhat to divide the responsibility ; three of its members undertook to visit and report upon insti - tutions offering the means of general education , while the other two occupied themselves exclusively with investigating the provision made in the
United States	LOCATION	for the training of teachers .

		The four , or rather five , reports are such in the strict sense of the term ; they are primarily books of facts , statistics , information , rather than argu - ment and criticism .

		Page on page is filled with lit - eral transcriptions of courses of study , programmes , time-tables .

		The writers seek to inform their coun - trymen in respect to matters that , they think , should interest them , and not to correct the shortcomings of American teachers and educationalists .

		We see no trace of that self-consciousness which listens for an American reflection .

		While we meet with many errors of detail in all the reports , as is natural , we can not doubt the desire of their writers to get at the exact truth .

		When they overlap , they do not always agree in facts or conclusions , owing partly , but not wholly , to the fact that their observations in some measure lay in different fields .

		Miss Page , for instance , observes : `` Speaking generally , the impression that I received was not only that origin - ality and individuality were allowed full play -LSB- in the schools -RSB- where they were good , but that the course of study , followed up as it is with frequent supervision , proved a great corrective of the mis - takes which so often take place in the hands of a weak teacher . ''

		Miss
Zimmern	PERSON	, on the other hand , thought too little liberty was left to teachers . ''

		It is believed that careful supervision and superin - tendence may do much toward obtaining good work from a merely average teacher ; and as the great majority of the American teachers are untrained , and may have had no teaching beyond that of the High School , and not always that , some such sys - tem is absolutely necessary to keep up the standard of work .

		It appears , on the whole , to work well and economically , though it is impossible that it should not sometimes be galling for a really capable , teacher to have to follow such minute directions as are laid down in many of the courses of study . ''

		We need hardly say which of these writers saw farther into the general conditions actually existing .

		It must not be supposed , however , that the re - ports contain no criticism .

		The two or three stronger ones contain plentiful discussion , put often in the form of comparisons of selected points in English and American educational practice .

		As a result , the American reader who is not already informed upon the subject will find in them much useful in - formation in respect to English schools , teachers , and methods .

		Still , the great point of interest for such reader will , no doubt , be the impression which our systems made on the minds of the five culti - vated English ladies , all practical teachers , and all intent on discovering what they could that might prove advantageous to themselves and their co - workers in the good cause .

		All the ladies seem to have been deeply impressed by the depth of enthusiasm for education that they met with everywhere .

		Miss Burstall thinks the causes are these : The democratic constitution of the country ; the estimate put upon the public school as a means of assimilating the vast foreign emigra - tion and as a pledge of national homogeneity ; and education as a means of preserving the ideal and spiritual elements of human life in the midst of a material civilization .

		We have been particularly interested in the re - marks made by several of the writers about the teaching of English and English literature as they saw it in our schools .

		Miss
Zimmern	PERSON	thought the general standing of English language teaching low , but was especially impressed by the excellence of the literature .

		We venture to quote one of her most interesting and suggestive pages . ''

		The teaching of English literature in
America	LOCATION	pos - sesses peculiar interest for the English visitor .

		If it is true that to understand
Old England	LOCATION	, we ought to see
New England	LOCATION	, where many of our old customs are still fresh and living , it is equally true that if we want to find a real living love for our English Classics , we had better seek it in the
United States	LOCATION	than on this side of the water .

		In many of our schools there is hardly such a thing as literature teaching at all .

		There is a lesson bearing that name on most time-tables , but it is often a lesson in language , not always of a systematic character , a great part of the time being given to studying etymology of out - of-the-way words , and discussing little of unimportant details in set books .

		This deterioration in our literature teaching is due to the too successful attempt to make literature an examination subject , coupled with the dis - astrous system of prescribing set books to be read , re - read , criticised , paraphrased , patronized , and found fault with by young immature critics .

		The whole aim of lit - erature teaching to train the inind to love of the beau - tiful , is forgotten in the necessity of cramming notes for examination .

		Reverence and awe , which it should produce in young minds by the presentation of the beau - tiful , is exchanged for a desire to spy faults quickly , and thus gain marks on questions set in the examination about
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's inconsistency , anachronisms , mis - interpretations of history , etc. '' Not second in interest to any of the other volumes is the one containing the parallel reports of Miss
Bramwell	PERSON	and
Miss Hughes	PERSON	on the training of teachers .

		The two ladies travelled together , but have made separate reports , each writing in total ignorance of what the other was saying .

		All the books are written in an appreciative but
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 temperate spirit .

		There is no fulsomeness or exag - geration on the one part , or detraction on the other .

		Miss
Bramwell	PERSON	, for example , sums up her observa - tions of the training of teachers in this self-contained manner : '' 1 .

		That the
State Normal Schools	ORGANIZATION	, adhering to old traditions , and failing to insist on adequate and thor - ough scholarship as an entrance qualification , have been obliged to devote themselves , either to securing that scholarship , or to the pursuance of so-called training under conditions the most conductive to mechanical lines of work and dead forms of method .

		`` 2 .

		That the
City Training Schools	ORGANIZATION	, being entirely local institutions , supported by local funds , and only supplying teachers to the schools of the vicinity , are in danger of being cramped in their methods by seeking to win public favor .

		`` 3 .

		That the
University Departments of Pedagogy	ORGANIZATION	, especially those belonging to
State Universities	ORGANIZATION	, are capa - ble of affording the widest and best opportunities for the thorough training of primary and secondary teachers , and in supplying these opportunities , they will not only help forward the cause in which they are immediately engaged , but afford a valuable means of unifying and stimulating education generally . ''

		If one were searching for the most striking evi - dence of the great growth of interest in education in this country the last few years , he would perhaps find it in the series of volumes bearing the collec - tive title of `` The International Education Series . ''

		It must have required no little faith , on the part of editor and publishers , to undertake so extensive a scheme ; and experience has amply justified them .

		The first volume of the series appeared in
1886	DATE	; the last one is the twenty-ninth in order , and still others are to come .

		We are not , indeed , shut up to the conclusion that so extensive a series was neces - sarily contemplated , and are quite at liberty to sup - pose that , had it been less successful , but few vol - umes would have appeared ; but the editor 's origi - nal announcement shows that the whole plan lay in his mind as clear in
1886	DATE	as it does to-day .

		He is to be congratulated , and his publishers also , on the success of the enterprise .

		Quite the most notable of the three latest contri - butions to the series is that on '' The Education of the Greek People , and Its Influence on Civiliza - tion . ''

		Some time ago , Professor
Davidson	PERSON	, in his admirable work entitled ''
Aristotle	PERSON	and the Ancient Educational Ideals , '' as he says , '' set forth the facts of Greek education in historical order '' ; while his present purpose is to '' show how the Greek people were gradually educated up to that stage of culture which made them the teachers of the whole world , and what the effect of that teaching has been . ''

		The one book gives a more objective or external view , the other a more subjective or internal one .

		The two , therefore , supplement each other ; and it is unfortunate that they could not have appeared in the same series .

		While we find it quite impossible to give to the present volume the space that it richly deserves , we can not refrain from calling particular attention to the Introduction , which is one of the clearest and most satisfactory pieces of educational writing that we have recently seen .

		For a long time there has been an infinite amount of talking and writing about `` nature '' and `` the natural '' in education , much the larger part of which has been done by men who either had no clear ideas of the terms they used , or who failed to express them .

		With these ideas , this Introduction deals in the most lucid and convincing manner .

		The writer begins with telling us that , as applied to living things , the word `` nature '' is used in two senses .

		`` In one sense , it is the character or type with which a thing starts on its separate career , and which , without any effort on the part of that thing , but solely with the aid of natural forces , determines that career . ''

		The acorn , bean , chick , and whelp , are given as exam - ples . ''

		In the other sense , ' nature ' means that high - est possible reality which a living thing , through a series of voluntary acts , originating within or with - out it , may be made to attain . ''

		Thus the rose , the orange , the dog , may be brought to such ideal or `` natural '' perfection through the acts of man ; while man himself , partly through the acts of others , and partly through his own self-activity , attains his own perfection .

		These natures may be called , the one `` original '' and the other `` ideal '' ; and it is in the line of the second one that the work of edu - cation lies .

		`` The aim of education is to develop man 's ideal nature , which may be , and very often is , so different from his original nature that , in or - der to make way for the former , the latter may have to be crossed , defied , and even to a large ex - tent suppressed . ''

		This is going to the root of the matter .

		The very important distinction between education and erudition is drawn , and then followed up by these wise words : '' It is the failure to draw this necessary distinction between education and erudition that is misleading our universities into the error of allowing students to ' elect ' specialties before they have completed the cycle of ed - ucation ; the result of which is that we have few men of thorough education or of broad and comprehensive views .

		If this evil is ever to be remedied , our univer - sities will be obliged , either to abandon this practice , or else to give up all attempt to impart education , and de - vote themselves solely to erudition , leaving the other to academies , gymnasia , or the like . ''

		In narrating '' The Evolution of the
Massachu	PERSON	- setts Public School System , '' Mr.
Martin	PERSON	unlike Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	has given us , not a book of thoughts , but a book of facts and comments .

		And very in - teresting and important facts and comments they are .

		They give us a clear and just view of the evolution of the public school system of
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts , which , when all is told , is the most complete system that we have to offer to the attention of the world .

		The writer shows conscientious industry in collecting facts , skill in narration , and also a con - siderable facility in literary illustration , whereby he renders interesting a subject that could easily be made tedious and repellant .

		His book , no doubt , grew out of a pitched battle over public-school pio - 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, neering , which Mr.
Martin	PERSON	and President
Draper	PERSON	waged a year or more ago in the pages of '' The Educational Review '' ; but the book is thoroughly good in tone , and is in no sense keyed to the con - troversial note .

		There is much need of similar books devoted to other States , and particularly
the State of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	.

		The State Monographs pub - lished by the
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, while good in their way , still leave much to be desired in complete - ness of treatment .

		No competent judge will claim that the efforts that have been made in the last ten or twenty years to give efficient science-teaching in the schools have been as successful or satisfactory as could be de - sired .

		Possibly science-teaching has some intrinsic difficulties ; certainly school managers have not been able to obtain , even when they desired to do so , the services of competent science teachers , in adequate numbers .

		It takes time to introduce a great sub - ject , and still more a great group of subjects , into the schools in such a way as to obtain from it the best educational results .

		Of the several manuals look - ing to the proper preparation of science teachers that we have seen , Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's '' Systematic Sci - ence Teaching '' is the most complete .

		It shows the marks of large experience and great labor on the part of its author .

		While only an expert , or a competent teacher who has thoroughly tried the book , can pass authoritatively on its merits , any - one who has a good general knowledge of the work of schools and teaching can see at a glance that even the common teacher has here a whole maga - zine of hints and suggestions that he can reduce to immediate practice , even if he never becomes able to use the whole apparatus of method which the author has provided .

		SKEAT 'S GREAT EDITION OF CHAUCER .

		* Since
Chalmers	PERSON	published , in
1810	DATE	, his edition of
Chaucer 's Complete Works	ORGANIZATION	, in prose and verse , with the addition of a good deal of spurious matter , no scholar has till now dared to edit a complete Chaucer .

		And it was well that they waited ; because it is only by the tremendous preliminary work of Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	that a new and worthy edition of Chaucer has been made possible .

		Perhaps Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	was not the first to recognize the fact that complete possession of all the authoritative manuscripts of Chaucer was es - sential before a new edition could be undertaken ; but certainly to his unparalleled energy was due the foundation of the
Chaucer Society	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- in
1868	DATE	-RRB- , which made possible the magnificent Six-text edition of `` The Canterbury Tales '' -LRB- 1877 -RRB- , the faithful ed - ition of the
Harleian MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- 1885 -RRB- , the parallel texts of the `` Minor Poems '' -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , the editions of `` Troilus '' -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , of `` Boece '' -LRB- 1886 -RRB- , etc. .

		* THE , COMPLETE WORKS OF
GEOFFREY CHAUCER	PERSON	.

		Ed - ited from numeroiw Manuscripts , by the Rev.
Walter W. Skeat	PERSON	, Litt.D. , LL.D. , etc. .

		In six volumes .

		Oxford :
The Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the basis of this work of Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	rests Professor
Skeat	PERSON	's new and great edition of Chaucer .

		The just reputation of Professor Skeat as a thor - ough and admirable scholar in
Early English	LOCATION	, as one of the best annotators of Early English texts , his previous editions of
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, of
Barbour	PERSON	, of Chaucer 's '' Minor Poems '' and '' Legend of Good Women , '' of several of the '' Canterbury Tales , '' his '' Etymological Dictionary , '' and the learning displayed in these and other works , justified high expectations upon the announcement of this new complete edition of Chaucer .

		And now , that the six volumes have been published , we can justly say that they form the best edition extant , and the best edition ever published ; that they represent an edition for which not only every '' general reader '' of a high order , but also every scholar , must be grateful .

		I wish to lay additional stress on this preliminary statement , because some of the follow - ing detailed remarks , which represent the dark side of the picture only , might seem to clash somewhat with this favorable judgment .

		The first volume consists of some introductory matter , a short biography , a list of Chaucer 's works , and contains besides the text of the '' Romaunt of the Rose '' and of the minor poems , with introduc - tions .

		In the annalistic biography I do not miss anything ; but when , under
1373	DATE	, Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	says of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's first visit to
Italy	LOCATION	, '' All that is known of this mission is that he visited
Florence	LOCATION	as well as
Genoa	LOCATION	, and that he returned before
Nov. 22 , 1373	DATE	, on which day he received his pension in per - son , '' he does not lay sufficient stress on the fact , brought to light by Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	in
1873	DATE	, and men - tioned by Skeat only in a note , that
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's ac - counts of this journey run for the period between
Dec. 1 , 1372	DATE	, to
May 23 , 1373	DATE	.

		It would be strange indeed if these accounts had stopped in the midst of his journey .

		The more natural interpretation seems to be , that
Chaucer	PERSON	's journey did not last more than six months ; and so this document would corroborate what Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	expressed , for the first time I think , in the introduction to his edition of the '' Parliament of Foules '' that Chau - cer had no time to learn Italian in
Italy	LOCATION	, but was sent there just because of his knowledge of the Italian language .

		Besides , the document seems to show that Chaucer returned months before
the 22d of November	DATE	, there being no evidence that he stayed longer than
May 23	DATE	.

		The burden of proof , then , rests upon those who assume the later date .

		When Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	-LRB- p. liii . -RRB- ''

		confidently '' dates the coarser passages of '' The Canterbury Tales '' after
1387	DATE	, the date of the death of Chaucer 's wife , because his wife , Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	seems to suppose , kept him at the apron-strings of prudery , I can not sup - press a mischievous counter-conjecture that possibly Mrs.
Chaucer	PERSON	, like many other worthy ladies of her time , would by no means have objected to the pro- logue of the '' Wife of Bath , '' and many another passage which would not do in a '' coeducational '' Chaucer class .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 The paragraph headed '' Personal Allusions , '' in which Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	includes matters relating to the person of the poet , seems to me far from complete .

		I miss a mention of
Ballerstedt	ORGANIZATION	's careful essay on
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's descriptions of nature , an essay which contains matter that Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	might have made use of to advantage .

		Moreover , some observations on
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's humor , on his theory of life , more satis - factory references to his religious views , etc. , would have been desirable .

		Among the '' Historical Allu - sions , '' no mention is made of
Harry Bailey	PERSON	, the record of whose parliamentary career was first made public -LRB- as far as I know -RRB- by Rendle and
Norman	PERSON	in their charming book on '' The Inns of Old South - wark . ''

		A quotation from this book on the '' Ta - bard Inn '' would have formed a welcome addition to this chapter .

		I am sorry , too , that Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	, in his paragraph on the portraits of Chaucer , does not aim at greater completeness ; and that in his paragraph on `` Allusions to Chaucer , '' he does not give a fuller list of
Lydgate	PERSON	's references to his ''
Maister	PERSON	. ''

		This would belong , of course , more to the long-expected volume to be called '' Chaucer 's Praise '' ; but in the mean time fuller information on this subject would have been very welcome .

		The chronological `` List of Chaucer 's Works , '' -LRB- p. Ixii . -RRB-

		is too meagre ; and Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's words , that the list is '' arranged as nearly as -LSB- he -RSB- can conjec - ture , '' are misleading .

		Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	is not the first to make conjectures about the chronology of Chaucer 's writings ; and the best conjectures , even of a Pro- fessor Skeat , would not go a long way if they were not based on or supplemented by the serious work of other scholars .

		As in the third volume , in the introduction to the '' Legend of Good Women , '' we find Ten Brink 's chronology quoted , we may ask , why did Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	not save space by combining the two lists ?

		and why did he not heighten the value of this list by adding a full account of the work of his predecessors in this line ?

		If he had given a synopsis of conjectural dates , references to the sources and to his own reasons , he would have done an instructive , a highly interesting , and a necessary piece of work .

		A careful study of the question would also have disclosed to him the fact , which , as far as I know , has not yet been recognized , that a French period of Chaucer 's work -LRB- but no Italian period -RRB- had been suggested long ago by
Pauli	ORGANIZATION	, years before Ten Brink 's epoch-making book .

		Inasmuch as , accord - ing to Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's own confession , Ten Brink 's Skeat till
1887	DATE	-LRB- although Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	had pub - '' Studien '' -LRB- 1870 -RRB- remained unknown to Professor lished a translation of the results of
Ten Brink	ORGANIZATION	's Chaucer-chronology in
1871	DATE	-RRB- , we fully believe that Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	arrived at his conclusions independently ; but it is in the nature of scientific investigation that a man can not do everything alone , that he must have the same great principle as our friend the clerk of
Oxenford	LOCATION	, who '' gladly wolde lerne and gladly teche . ''

		The work of a man like Ten Brink , who was not even an '' inevitable German , '' but a Dutch - man by birth , can be neglected , or slighted , or pushed aside , only at the peril of the scholar who is guilty of such disregard .

		Professor
Skeat	PERSON	's atti - tude in this instance bears an unfortunate resem - blance to that of Mr. Sweet in his remarks upon supposed followers and in his silence with respect to his own predecessors .

		* The introduction to the '' Minor Poems '' is , as far as I can see , a reprint of the introduction to Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's former edition ; but what was very good for the old edition may be in some respects insufficient for a new one , and out of place in it .

		So , I think , Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's paragraphs on '' Early Editions of Chau - cer 's Works , '' his old description of
Stowe	PERSON	's edition , his remarks on
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's editions , do not belong to this place in a complete edition , but to another part of the work altogether .

		Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's list of the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- p. 49 -RRB- would have gained greatly in value if he had seen fit to add approximate dates to each and every one of the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		which he describes , not merely to a few .

		Here again he might have reproduced more fully , or considered critically -LRB- with reasons added -RRB- , what had been brought to light by the labor of Bond ,
Thompson	PERSON	,
Furnivall	PERSON	, and others .

		To give only a few instances , Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's description of Ms.
Gg 4	PERSON	, 27 , does not in - clude any date at all ; from Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	's auto - types -LRB- of leaves 433 , 395 , 416 , 432 , etc. -RRB- we learn the approximate date 1430-40 ; from the autotype of leaf 332 we learn 1420-30 ; from his `` Tempo - rary Preface '' -LRB- 51 -RRB- we get the date 1430-40 ; and the same valuable publication gives us even Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	's view of the dialect of the MS. -LRB- p. 59 -RRB- .

		Why does Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	not quote this ?

		Thie auto - type of one leaf of Add .

		MS. 10340 informs us that the date is about '' the first third of the 15th Century '' ; why does Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	not quote this ?

		The
Tanner	PERSON	MS. 346 Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	calls '' a fair MS. of the
15th Century	DATE	, '' a very safe , but too vague conclusion ; from
Schick	PERSON	's '' Temple of Glass '' I see that some authorities on whom
Schick	PERSON	, a care - ful scholar , relies , date it between 1400-1420 .

		Fairfax
MS. 16	DATE	, Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	dates as '' of the 15th Century '' ; in
Schick	LOCATION	I find it dated `` about
1440	DATE	-
1450	DATE	'' ; now if Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	could not accept this date , if he regarded it as given on insufficient authority , it would have been his duty to state this ; he would greatly have obliged many a scholar not living within the reach of the English libraries .

		The introductions to the separate '' Minor Poems '' contain the old material , and the same seems to be the case with regard to the notes .

		As in the old edition , a good deal of information given in the in - troductions is repeated in the notes ; so the explana - tion of the '' Herines '' given on page 62 is repeated on p. 461 .

		Likewise at p. 64 we read , '' The whole * I am here referring to a remark in the preface to Sweet 's new edition of the Anglo-Saxon Reader : '' It will be found that my successors follow me pretty closely .

		Thus ,
Kluge	PERSON	shows his approval of the way in which I have accomplished the difficult task of making a selection from the Laws by re - printing my extracts bodily . ''

		Unfortunately `` The Laws of Ine '' are to be found in ''
Leo	PERSON	's Reader , '' published in
1838	DATE	.

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, poem -LRB- the ' Complaint of Mars ' -RRB- is supposed to be sung by a bird and upon St.
Valentine	PERSON	's day '' ; and on p. 495 , '' The whole of this poem is supposed to be uttered by a bird on the
14th of Febr	DATE	. ''

		; and similar repetitions are to be found in the introductions and the corresponding notes to almost all the poems -LRB- pp. 80 and 542 ; 82 and 550 ; 85 and 556 ; 86 and 562 ; 559 ; 88 and 563 , etc. -RRB- .

		The introduction to the '' Romaunt of the Rose '' contains a short history of the question of its au - thorship , a sketch which , oddly enough , begins with Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's own little essay on the subject pub - lished in
1880	DATE	, and mentions neither Ten Brink 's observations made in
1870	DATE	and
1871	DATE	-LRB- of which Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	has known since
1887	DATE	-RRB- nor Professor Child 's doubts and ingenious conjectures made in
1870	DATE	.

		Did Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	not realize that in these ob - servations of
Ten Brink and Child	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- as
Kaluza	PERSON	also observes -RRB- the theory by which Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	and others happen to swear now was virtually stated ?

		For Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	, the whole question seems to end with
Kaluza	PERSON	's essay , which he apparently regards as final .

		Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	does not even mention Ten Brink 's first view , nor Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's views , which might be supported by other reasons than those attacked in
Kittredge	ORGANIZATION	's study .

		The bare pos - sibility of any hypothesis different from the one which he advocates seems never to have dawned upon the mind of Professor Skeat .

		The authorship of the '' Romaunt of the Rose '' seems to be a sub - ject on which the views of scholars will change from decade to decade .

		But nevertheless , opinions will be pronounced with the utmost confidence and with passionate denunciation of opposite views , while a modest '' if '' and '' perhaps '' will be for - gotten for the time being by both parties .

		Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	, in a paragraph on the French '' Ro - man de la Rose , '' quotes
Henry Morley	PERSON	, who is no authority on the subject , and fails to mention Lan - glois ' painstaking and splendid work on the sources of the Roman ; the oversight of Soltoft-Jensen 's essay on Alanus and the Roman -LRB- '' Nordisk Tids - krift for Filologi , '' 10 , 3 -RRB- is more pardonable .

		In the introduction to the '' Parliament of Foules , '' no mention is made -LRB- as far as I can see -RRB- of Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's excellent edition ; and when Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	refers to
Koch	PERSON	's actual discovery of the historical background of the poem in these words , '' See on this subject Dr.
Koch	PERSON	's discussion of the question in Essays on Chaucer , '' I think that the English lan - guage might have expressed the plain fact more clearly .

		Koch '' discussed '' the question indeed , but he is the discoverer of the whole matter , and Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	merely the copyist .

		Before speaking of the text of the '' Minor Poems , '' we should give Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	's statement from the '' General Introduction '' : '' In each case the best copy has been selected as the basis of the text , and has only been departed from where other copies af - forded a better reading .

		All such variations , as regards the wording of the text , are invariably re - corded in the footnotes at the bottom of the page ... but I have purposely abstained from record - ing variations of reading that are certainly inferior to the reading in the text . ''

		These words first ap - peared in the prospectus , and I confess to an uneasy feeling upon the first reading of them .

		A great edi - tion , utilizing the vast results of the labors of the
Chaucer Society	ORGANIZATION	, ought to utilize them in such a manner that the personal element , the personal in - terference of the editor , would be reduced to a min - imum .

		What seems an '' inferior '' reading to me may be in the eyes of another the better reading ; another may shed a new and clearer light on it ; and this new light may bring out a hitherto hidden su - periority .

		De gustibus , etc. , too , should be a warning against being too positive .

		How many great schol - ars in Shakespeare philology , and elsewhere , have shown lamentable lack of taste !

		Should we prefer
Bentley	ORGANIZATION	's
Milton	LOCATION	to the old text ?

		Not even for
Bentley	ORGANIZATION	's sake !

		With these principles in mind , I have made an examination of Professor
Skeat	PERSON	's text of the poem '' Truth , '' and give now part of the result .

		Of the eighteen texts -LRB- seventeen manuscripts and
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's print -RRB- which have been re-published by the
Chaucer Society	ORGANIZATION	, seven are enumerated by Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	, the other ten -LRB- or eleven -RRB- are sweepingly re - ferred to by the simple word u others . ''

		Being my - self interested in a certain kind of statistics al - though not in that kind which has become part of philology nowadays , I require greater accuracy .

		These seven MSS. , Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	, like
Koch	PERSON	before him -LRB- Anglia
1881	DATE	, 4 , 105 ; edition of Minor Poems ,
1883	DATE	, p. 24 -RRB- divides into two groups , one group -LRB- I suppose -RRB- being regarded as '' superior , '' the other as '' inferior . ''

		But taking the test-lines , 2 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 19 , 20 , as a basis , I have come to the conclusion that we have to distinguish at least three , probably four , different groups .

		Taking the
Ellesmere MS.	LOCATION	as a basis , which for '' Truth '' seems not quite as good as the Additional and scarcely better than the
Phillipps MS.	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	's text has in line 2 the harsh and not at all '' simple '' reading : '' Suffice unto thy good . ''

		The reading of the
Fairfax	LOCATION	MS. -LRB- '' Suffice the thy good '' -RRB- is given in the note and called `` capital , '' but the equally good reading of the Phillipps MS. -LRB- '' Suffise the thyne owne '' -RRB- is ignored , as well as the equally good reading of the Add .

		MS. , '' Suffise thin owen thing . ''

		Although Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	says of the decidedly bad reading of the
Ellesmere	LOCATION	and other MSS. , '' The sense is simply -LSB- ! -RSB-

		Be content with thy property , though it be small , '' he does not really explain it , nor does he support it by a sufficient parallel quotation .

		Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	does not mention the reading `` with fastnes '' -LRB- of the second
Fairfax	LOCATION	copy -RRB- ; nor does he quote the reading '' lyuynge '' -LRB- of an Add .

		MS. -RRB- in the foot-note ; nor does he register the reading of two MSS. , yf -LRB- yef -RRB- , for `` though '' in the same first line ; and when he says , p. 551 .

		The perusal of this list will be no more interest - ing to the reader of these lines , I am sure , than the careful comparison was to me ; but it helped me to form an opinion on the value of the text , and of Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	's views about the inferiority and superi - ority of a reading in general .

		Should it turn out to be a fact , as I sincerely hope it will not , that Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	's text of all the other poems is as inac - curate as his text of '' Truth , '' we should be forced to the conclusion that the text , very readable as it is , and perhaps sufficient for ordinary purposes , is certainly not a final one , and certainly lacks the first requirement of a good text a full considera - tion and a patient registration of all the MS. ma - terial .

		On page 510 , Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	ought to have inserted , instead of the old Dante quotation for the inscrip - tion over the gates in the '' Parlament of Foules , '' the real original which is to be found in
Boccaccio	LOCATION	, as
Koeppel	PERSON	has shown -LRB- Anglia 14,233 -RRB- .

		The second volume contains the texts of '' Boece '' and of '' Troilus , '' with introductions and notes .

		In the printing of '' Boethius , '' Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	, follow - ing the ingenious suggestion of
Bradshaw	LOCATION	, has given
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's explanations in italics .

		That it was
Brad	PERSON	- shaw who first suggested this , Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	does not take the trouble to tell us ; but I learn it from a note of
Furnivall	ORGANIZATION	's in his edition of '' Boece , '' page V .

		It is a pity that Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	's introduction does not take any notice of
Hodgkin	ORGANIZATION	's great chapter on '' Boethius , '' which , as well as
Dahn	PERSON	's results , would have modified considerably the old-fashioned
Gib	ORGANIZATION	- bonesque eulogy of Boethius .

		On page xvi. , Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	quotes the antiquated remark of
Bohn	PERSON	on the Tavistock print of
Walton	PERSON	's '' Boethius , '' not knowing that a copy of it is in
Magdalen College Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		He does not mention the ex - tracts given from Bracegirdle 's '' Boethius '' in An - glia XV .

		That Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	did not use
Peiper	PERSON	's edi - tion of the original is also a pity .

		The introduction to '' Troilus '' contains some good things , but it is far from complete ; it does not even utilize all the material gained from the sources in several separate German dissertations -LRB- better than the average -RRB- .

		Professor
Skeat	PERSON	says in this Introduction : '' This is not the place for a full con - sideration of the further question as to the sources of information whence
Boccaccio	PERSON	and Guido re - spectively drew their stories .

		Nor is it profitable to search the supposed works of Dares and Dictys for the passages to which Chaucer appears to refer ; since he merely knew these authors by name , owing to Guide 's frequent appeals to them . ''

		I wonder where '' the place for a full consideration '' of these and other questions should be , if not here ?

		Pro- fessor Skeat 's remarks do not supersede Ten Brink 's theory with regard to
Benoit	LOCATION	.

		The third volume contains the '' House of Fame , '' the `` Legend of Good Women , '' the `` Astrolabe , '' and an introductory essay on the sources of '' The Canterbury Tales . ''

		I miss , under the '' Imitations of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Fame '' -LRB- a paragraph that is , as usual , given twice first in the introduction and then in the notes , p. 243 , any reference to the careful article of
Paul Lange	PERSON	on
Gawen Douglas	ORGANIZATION	and
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is stranger still that Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	'' is not aware that anyone has ever doubted -LSB- his -RSB- result '' as to the Priority of the `` A '' Prologue of the Legend -LRB- p. xxi . -RRB-

		Here again Skeat is , un fortunately , quoting his old separate edition -LRB- p. 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, xiii . -RRB-

		, and has taken no notice of
Ten Brink	ORGANIZATION	's last essay .

		Skeat 's comparison of the two forms is in - complete -LRB- p. xxii . -RRB-

		, even overlooking the three al - lusions to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's age , duly noticed by Ten Brink .

		In the note to the '' House of Fame , '' line 1227 ,
Holthausen	PERSON	's little essay -LRB-
Anglia 16	ORGANIZATION	, 264 -RRB- would have heen useful .

		The edition of the '' Astrolabe , '' with its notes and diagrams , is excellent , as far as I can judge from a very insufficient knowledge of astrology .

		Some chapters on the '' Sources of the Canterbury Tales '' conclude the volume , in which , for the first time since
Hertzberg	PERSON	and During -LRB- whose names might have been mentioned here -RRB- , a complete survey of the field has been made .

		No mention is made of
Frankel	ORGANIZATION	's quotation from Cropacius -LRB- An - glia XVI . -RRB-

		in the note on the sources of the '' Mil - leres Tale , '' but if we consider the mass of valuable information and of careful compilation , any lacuna like this is of little consequence .

		The fourth volume begins with some most wel - come additions to the '' Minor Poems , '' viz. , three new poems which Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's eye was fortunate enough to discover and recognize as
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's , as in the case of the '' Rosamounde '' a few years ago .

		After these three poems follows the text of '' The
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	, '' based on the
Ellesmere	LOCATION	MS. In his introduction on the MSS. , Mr.
Skeat	PERSON	is not able to trace the
Norton MS.	PERSON	, and therefore I beg leave to refer him to Mr.
Quaritch	PERSON	, in whose hands the MS. now is .

		The MS. is valued at
$ 1500	MONEY	, and we hope that some rich American may bring it westward .

		The fifth volume begins with some introductory matter on the ''
Canon	ORGANIZATION	of Chaucer 's Works , '' which might more appropriately have been placed in the first volume .

		Concerning the so-called Tyrwhitt edition , first published by
Moxon	PERSON	in
1845	DATE	, there are some very just remarks , which are not , however , detailed enough to exhibit the exact relation which the text of
Moxon	PERSON	's '' Essay , Discourse , Notes , and Glossary '' bears to its prototype .

		Next follow some far from exhaustive remarks upon the text of the ''
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Then there are some `` Rules for Reading , '' practical hints for the modern reader who takes Chaucer in hand without previous study of his language .

		The volume is mainly de - voted , however , to the Notes to the
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	.

		In these , as was to be expected , Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	appears at his very best .

		This is the most complete commentary on the Tales ; and even if Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	had never written anything but this commentary , it would have been sufficient to ensure the honora - ble association of his name with that of his author and to win for him the lasting gratitude of Chau - cer students .

		The sixth and concluding volume , which comes just in time for a brief mention , contains , in a gen - eral Introduction , an account of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's pronun - ciation and versification ; a short Chaucer grammar ; a glossarial Index on the genuine works , and one each for the Gamelyn and the B. C. Fragments of the '' Romaunt of the Rose . ''

		The most interesting addition to these is the Index of Proper Names , and an Index of Authors quoted or referred to .

		I conclude this notice by recurring to my opinion , expressed at the outset , that , notwithstanding all its shortcomings , few finer editions of an old English classic have ever been published , and that Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's edition of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	is by far the best extant .

		BBIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Translation of a popular life of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons issue , in a neatly made volume of 140 pages , the '' Napoleon '' of
Alexandre Du	PERSON	- mas , translated by Mr.
J. B. Lamer	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Larner	PERSON	's seems to be , oddly enough , the first English version , though the original is popular and has a continuous sale in
France	LOCATION	.

		The book is essentially a very con - cise review of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's public , and more especially his military , career political crises being briefly touched , while of domestic history and criticism of personal character there is next to nothing .

		About thirty pages are given to
Waterloo	LOCATION	, and half that number to
Marengo	LOCATION	; of the divorce from
Josephine	PERSON	we find only an indirect mention of five words .

		The volume opens with a brief sketch of
Napoleon	PERSON	's school-days and youth , and closes with a touching chapter on his five years of torment at
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	under the wardenship of that excessively small crea - ture , Sir
Hudson Lowe	PERSON	who remains to this day , to the continental mind , the type of a singularly re - pellant , and not unfamiliar , class of his countrymen . ''

		For five years , '' says
Dumas	PERSON	, forcibly and justly , though with a certain hint of bathos , `` the modern Prometheus remained chained to the rock where
Hudson Lowe	PERSON	preyed upon his heart . ''

		A caged tiger teased and fretted , from outside the bars , by a spiteful , grimacing monkey , were perhaps a truer figure .

		Dumas saw the Emperor twice the first time as he drove by on his way to
Ligny	LOCATION	, amid the acclamations of the populace ; the second time on his return from
Waterloo	LOCATION	, in a frozen and ominous silence .

		`` Each time he was seated in the same car - riage , on the same seat , dressed in the same coat .

		Each time it was the same vague and unoccupied look .

		Each time it was the same face , calm and impassable , only his head was a little more inclined upon his chest in returning than in going . ''

		Mr.
Larner	PERSON	has tried to make his translation as literal as possible ; and while the general result is satisfactory , there are occasional nawe renderings which smack a little of the humors of the class-room .

		For in - stance , we find General
Paoli	PERSON	pronouncing Bona - parte `` a young man of old-fashioned shape '' ; and we are told that the besiegers of
Toulon	LOCATION	, '' whose eyes darted into the city and upon the road , saw the conflagration , '' etc. .

		Without comparing them with the original , we venture to say that these and sev - eral other like phrases could be polished a little with - out sacrificing literalness .

		THE DIAL 121 Biography os In j '' s studv of '' The
Empress Eu	ORGANIZATION	- the Empress ge `` nie '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
M. Eugenie	PERSON	.

		Pierre de
Lano	PERSON	appears to have taken his heroine 's not very imposing mental and moral measure pretty correctly .

		M. de
Lano	PERSON	is by no means friendly to the Empress , but he writes mostly without bitterness ; and while finding
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ge `` nie fickle , frivolous , cold , and of narrow aims and ambitions , he admits some good qualities , and acquits her of grosser accusations which her more venomous enemies have not scrupled to make .

		Eu - ge ` nie 's shortcomings , however , whatever they may have been , pale into trivialities beside the damn - ing charge that she instigated the war of
1870	DATE	.

		History now admits that the Emperor opposed the war ; as to the degree of his wife 's culpability in the matter , there seems to be some question .

		M. de
Lano	PERSON	has no doubt whatever on this point ; and his views may be gathered from the following story , which he quotes with approval and considers trust - worthy though it appears suspiciously melodra - matic .

		It seems that when the debate over the pro- posed declaration of war had reached ^ ts height , the Emperor refused to sign the fatal paper .

		As the ministers insisted , `` he became angry , he the gen - tle , obstinate one , as his mother called him became violent , and seizing the decree , tore it in pieces , and scattered the fragments on the floor ... The Em - press , on hearing of the scene which had taken place , and of the determination of the Emperor , was much annoyed .

		She was most indignant .

		She now became angry , and having compelled the min - isters to restore the manuscript , she took possession of the new document , and went with it to the Em - peror , who signed it , as it were , in a dream . ''

		With - out putting too much faith in this anecdote , one may add that the seeming stability of the republic gives good hope that the long list of mischiefs wrought or furthered in
France	LOCATION	by the ignorant political meddlings of royal wives and royal mistresses ended with Sedan .

		The germ of
M. de Lano	PERSON	's book is a series of articles published in
1890	DATE	in the '' Figaro . ''

		These provoked at the time a bitter attack on the author in the `` Gaulois '' ; and he now answers his critics , and presents a fuller exposition of his case .

		The
Empress	ORGANIZATION	's life from the time of her marriage to the death of the Prince Imperial is freely dealt with ; and while
M. de Lano	PERSON	is certainly more than a bit of a gossip , he appears to have tried to get at the truth .


France	LOCATION	and the European revolution . ''

		The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Era '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the initial vol - ume of a promising historical series , the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	, '' which aims to sketch the history of modern
Europe	LOCATION	and its colonies from the close of the fifteenth century down to the present time .

		The editor is Dr.
G. W. Prothero	PERSON	, Prefessor of History in
Edinburgh University	LOCATION	; and the author of the opening volume is Mr.
J. H. Rose	PERSON	,
University Ex	ORGANIZATION	- tension Lecturer in
Modern History	ORGANIZATION	, late scholar of
Christ 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		To the French Revo - lution proper , its intricate party strifes and dra - matic episodes , Mr.
Rose	PERSON	has given relatively little space -LRB- 95 out of the 370 pages -RRB- , his chief aim be - ing to make clear the relation of that movement to the general European revolution , of which it was an earlier and acuter manifestation , and its consequent bearing upon existing political boundaries and con - ditions .

		The military dictatorship of
Bonaparte	LOCATION	, born of domestic anarchy and foreign warj curbed the revolution in
France	LOCATION	while extending it over the Continent . ''

		The conflict with monarchical
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , '' says Mr.
Rose	PERSON	, `` is therefore the central fact of the revolution , determining not only the trend of events in
France	LOCATION	, but also the extension of French influence over
Europe	LOCATION	, and the formation of the chief
Continental States	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		While Mr.
Rose	PERSON	is a good narrator , as his admirable account of Water - loo attests , his attention is mainly given to showing the political and economic bearing of his facts ; hence his book is one for the serious reader .

		The volume is well printed , and contains a half-dozen excellent maps .

		Too much chit-chat , and too much Historical gossip i mpor t a nce attached to trifles , is what of modern
England	LOCATION	.

		r must be generally predicated ot Mrs.
Elizabeth Wormeley Latimer	PERSON	's otherwise respect - able compilation , ''
England	LOCATION	in the Nineteenth Cen - tury '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The author says in the preface that she intended at first to call her book '' His - torical Gossip '' ; and we see no good reason why the change of title was made .

		It is possible that Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	has injected the over-liberal element of small-talk into her work as a concession to the '' gen - eral reader '' ; and if so , we think she has in many cases largely overrated the supposed mental infirm - ity and taste for twaddle of that abused individual .

		We can , for instance , fancy no reader '' general '' enough to like his history diluted with such infor - mation as this : '' After the breakfast was over , bride and bridegroom changed their dresses the Prince for a dark travelling suit , the Queen for a white satin pelisse , trimmed with swan 's - down , with a white satin bonnet and feather , '' etc. .

		We would not imply , however , that Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	's book is barren of instruction , for parts of it are good enough to make us wonder the more at the frequency of passages like the one quoted ; and in styling it a compilation it is fair to add that the text is not with - out occasional signs of an underlying logical process .

		That the author is not strong in economics is amus - ingly indicated by her naive ascription of the forced separation of husband and wife in the
Union	LOCATION	work - houses , not to Mr.
Malthus	PERSON	and common sense gen - erally , but to a wish on the part of the hard-hearted framers of the Poor Law of
1834	DATE	'' to inspire an intense horror of the workhouse . ''

		England was pretty nearly ruined by unwisely relaxing the strin - gency of the Elizabethan Poor Law ; and what the effect would have been of going further in the same direction , and maintaining at the public cost in every half-dozen or so parishes a huge establishment for 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the breeding and rearing of hereditary paupers , Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	does not stop to consider .

		Beginning with the year
1822	DATE	, the author rapidly sketches the lead - ing events and personages of the reigns of the last two
Georges	LOCATION	,
William IV	PERSON	.

		and Victoria the last reign taking up three-fourths of the book .

		There is a fairly full account of the Reform movement , the East Indian administrations and mutiny , and the governments of Disraeli and
Gladstone	PERSON	.

		The vol - ume is well printed , and contains twenty-seven nota - bly good portraits after photographs .

		New handbooks of English literature .

		A_new series of '' Handbooks of En - glish Literature , '' edited by Professor j w
Hales	PERSON	, is announced , and the first volume , '' The Age of Pope , '' by Mr.
John Dennis	PERSON	, already published -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is pro- posed in this series '' to deal with the chief epochs of English literature in separate volumes of mod - erate length , but in such a manner that , taken to - gether , they will ultimately form a consecutive his - tory . ''

		The plan of the series is to adopt for each volume some one great writer , such as
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	, or
Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' as the representative man of his period and the expo - nent of its leading tendencies and movements . ''

		Pro- fessor
Hales	PERSON	himself will undertake some of the vol - umes , and others are promised by such scholars as Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	and Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	.

		This is a promising programme , and we must add that Mr.
Dennis	PERSON	has dealt with '' The Age of Pope '' in so scholarly and at the same time so interesting a way that much is to be hoped of the series thus auspiciously inaugurated .

		The period covered is the
first half of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		Some idea of the spirit in which Mr.
Dennis	PERSON	has done his work may be got from the following sentences : '' The first object of a guide is to give accurate in - formation ; his second and larger object is to direct the reader 's steps through a country exhaustless in variety and interest . ''

		`` There is perhaps no dan - ger more carefully to be shunned by the student of literature than the habit of resting satisfied with opinions at second-hand .

		Better a wrong estimate formed after due reading and thought , than a right estimate gleaned from critics , without any thought at all . ''

		Introduction to English literature . ''

		This work is an attempt to solve the problem of teaching English lit - erature . ''

		Such are the opening words of Professor
F. V. N. Painter	PERSON	's preface to his `` Introduction to English Literature '' -LRB-
Leach	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Well , we can hardly admit that the problem has been solved , although the author has taken a step in the right direction .

		Briefly , he has divided the history into seven periods , and for each period has written a general characterization , followed by a careful study of from one to four authors , and an - notated examples of their work .

		Entire works are selected in most cases , although extracts are now and then resorted to .

		The merit of Professor Painter 's book is that it spares the student the weari - some burden of detail forced upon him by most of the compilers of such books .

		Only writers of great importance are mentioned at all , and only fifteen authors altogether are taken up for careful study .

		But we do not believe that the problem will ever be solved by putting history and texts into a single volume .

		What is needed is a history in one rather small volume , and a great many annotated texts in a very big volume the latter being a book to delve in rather than a book to be studied from beginning to end .

		As an alternative for the single big vol - ume , we suggest a series of smaller ones , containing different sets of texts , the teacher being free to choose the volume or volumes that he can best use , and to vary the selection from year to year .

		The simple fact is that no student can hope to get any satisfaction out of the study of English literature unless he is prepared to spend a few dollars upon books .

		The volume on
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	by fe Mr '
Noah Brooks	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which has been added to the '' Heroes of the Nations '' series , is a new edition of a book first published six years ago .

		The author was in inti - mate relations with Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	after
1856	DATE	, and wrote with full knowledge of the man and the times .

		His avowed purpose was to impress the image of his hero upon the '' heart of that ' common people ' whom he loved so well , and of which he was the noblest representative . ''

		The book is not at all critical in its treatment of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life .

		All un - pleasant features and events are glossed over after the manner of the hero-worshipper .

		Though it can - not compare with other volumes in the series such as
Hodgkin	ORGANIZATION	's Theodoric and
Strachan-Davidson	ORGANIZATION	's Cicero in weight and strength , it will do good as a popular life of one whom the people can not know too well or honor too highly .

		Commemorative Five '' Commemorative Addresses '' addresses by by Mr.
Parke Godwin	PERSON	are issued in Mr.
Godwin	PERSON	.

		attractive shape by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The papers , one and all , are much more comprehensive and readable than the collect - ive title leads one to expect an occasional address being in general a pretty trite and perfunctory per - formance .

		Mr.
Godwin	PERSON	's subjects are :
George William Curtis	PERSON	,
Edwin Booth	PERSON	,
Louis Kossuth	LOCATION	,
John James Audubon	PERSON	, and
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	.

		No - tably good is the paper on Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	really one of the best biographical sketches of the Montaigne of the `` Easy Chair '' that we remember to have seen .

		Necessarily a shade declamatory and eulo - gistic in tone , the addresses are nevertheless quieter and more critical than most compositions of their kind ; and their graphic and anecdotal quality makes them pleasant reading .

		Apropos of Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's '' Brook Farm '' experiences , briefly narrated by our author , it is instructive to learn that he was chiefly remembered by his associates in that venture '' for

		The volume presents a chatty picture of Colonial home and social life , liberally sprin - kled with extracts from letters , journals , etc. , of the period .

		It is pretty plain that
Miss Wharton	LOCATION	has written with a certain sense of personal in - terest in her theme ; and our budding American noblesse who `` trace back '' genealogically to Colo - nial and Revolutionary days should find her pages by no means `` thin sown with profit and delight . ''

Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		de Amicis , '' Fortezzo '' and '' Un
Gran Giorno	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
T. E. Comba	PERSON	, make a pamphlet number of the series of '' Novelle Italiane . ''

		Last of all , there are two Spanish texts : '' El Final de
Norma	PERSON	, '' by
Seiior Alarcdn	PERSON	, opening a series of ''
Novelas Escogidas	PERSON	, '' and ''
El Pa	ORGANIZATION	- jaro Verde , '' by
Senor Valera	ORGANIZATION	, opening a series of '' Cuentos Selectos . ''

		The former is edited by Mr.
de La Cortina	PERSON	, and the latter by Mr.
Julio Rojas	PERSON	.

		The multiplication of French texts for school use goes merrily on .

		From
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we now have editions of '' Hernani '' and '' Ruy Bias , '' the for - mer edited by Dr.
George M. Harper	PERSON	, the latter by Dr.
Samuel Garner	PERSON	.

		A portrait of Hugo prefaces the one , a map of
Madrid	LOCATION	the other .

		Introductions and notes are excellent in both .

		The same publishers send us M. HaleVy 's '' L'Abbe '' Constantin , '' edited by Dr.
Thomas Logie	PERSON	; and
M. Pailleron	PERSON	's '' Le Monde ou 1 ` On S'Ennuie , '' edited by Mr.
A. C. Pendleton	PERSON	.

		From
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have two useful texts `` A Scientific French Reader , '' edited by Mr.
Alexander W. Herdler	PERSON	; and '' Difficult Modern French , '' edited by
M. Albert Leune	PERSON	.

		The former includes short articles with illus - trative woodcuts , the latter selections from such men as '' Stendhal , ''
Gautier	PERSON	,
Leconte	PERSON	de
Lisle	LOCATION	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, and many of the moderns .

		The selections are in both prose and poetry .

		Finally , the
Christopher Sower Co.	ORGANIZATION	pub - lish `` Jean Mornas '' and '' Tuyet , '' two stories by
M. Jules Claretie	PERSON	, edited in a single volume by Mr.
Edward H. Magill	PERSON	.

		In the new and revised edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of Dr.
Oskar Seyffert	PERSON	's '' Dictionary of Classical Antiquities '' English readers are offered what is probably the most useful single-volume work upon the subject to be had .

		The present edition , which is the third , has been edited by Dr.
J. E. Sandys	PERSON	, and brought sufficiently to date to include the latest discoveries and theories .

		The articles
Comitia	LOCATION	, Music , and Theatre , are examples of this incor - poration of new matter .

		There are over seven hundred two-columned pages of clear type , nearly five hundred illustrations , and full indexes .

		Mr.
G. Steel	PERSON	's '' An English Grammar and Analysis '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- hardly satisfies the author 's claim of being an `` improvement in the methods usually followed '' in language study .

		In fact , several works could readily be called to mind that are distinctly superior to it for class-room work .

		The main fault of the book is the at - tempt to bring grammar , etymology , rhetoric and com - position within the limits of 300 pages .

		Mr.
Thomas Atkinson Jenkins	PERSON	, a candidate for the doctorate at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, has just published his dissertation , which has for its subject '' L'Espurgatoire Seint Patriz '' of
Marie de France	ORGANIZATION	.

		This important twelth-century poem is presented in a critical text , with a careful study of the language , and intro - ductory chapters upon the author , her work , and the dialect in which she wrote .

		Concerning the latter sub - ject Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	concludes that her dialect was
Franco	PERSON	-
Norman	PERSON	, thus controverting the opinion of Professor
Suchier	PERSON	, who declares for a specifically French dialect .

		Mr.
Jenkins	PERSON	has produced a solid and valuable piece of philological work .

		Three new volumes in '' The Student 's Series of En - glish Classics '' -LRB-
Leach	PERSON	-RRB- include
Goldsmith	PERSON	's '' Traveller '' and '' Deserted Village , '' edited by Mr.
Warren F. Gregory ; Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Elaine , '' edited by Miss
Fannie M. McCauley	PERSON	; and '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' edited by Professor
Katharine Lee Bates	PERSON	.

		The latter volume , in particular , is an admirable piece of editorial work , having notes that deal largely with parallel passages from other poets a sort of help too often neglected by commentators .

		We may also give mention in this paragraph to Mr.
George P. Baker	PERSON	's edition of Lyly 's `` Endymion '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , which has few notes , but , on the other hand , an elaborate biographical and critical intro - duction , which shows workmanship of a high order .

		Once in a year or so the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	issues a pamphlet volume of '' University Studies . ''

		The latest of these issues , dated
July , 1894	DATE	, is at hand , and contains three papers of solid value .

		Mr.
E. H. Barbour	PERSON	has some '' Additional Notes on the New Fos - sil , Daimonelit , '' twelve plates richly illustrating the paper . ''

		The Decrease of Predication and of Sentence Weight in English Prose '' is the subject of a study by Mr.
G. W. Gerwig	PERSON	.

		It represents much careful work done in continuation of Professor
Sherman	PERSON	's chapters upon the subject in his '' Analytics of Literature . ''

		The third paper is by Mr.
Fred M. Fling	PERSON	, and considers
Mirabeau	PERSON	as an opponent of absolutism , a subject in - teresting in connection with Professor von Hoist 's re - cent lectures on the great French statesman .

		124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, YORK ^ TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
February 11 , 1895	DATE	.

		The '' Trilby '' living pictures foreshadowed in a previous letter have materialized in an elaborate char - ity entertainment given
last Saturday	DATE	in the ball-room of a fashionable caterer 's in this city . ''

		Scenes and Songs from Trilby '' consisted of tableaux of the princi - pal illustrations in the volume , with renderings of the songs mentioned therein .

		The proceeds are to go to the
New York Kindergarten Association	ORGANIZATION	, in which Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	and Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	are deeply interested .

		A copy of `` Trilby , '' with autograph inscriptions by Mr.
du Maurier	PERSON	and
Henry James	PERSON	, and a manuscript copy of Dr. English 's song , ''
Ben Bolt	PERSON	, '' was auctioned off by Mrs.
Wiggin	PERSON	during the intermission for a hundred dol - lars , a surprisingly small price considering the packed house and the Trilby-mania now rampant .

		The list of lady patronesses included the wives of several literary men , as well as a number of society women , some of them belonging in a sense to both classes .

		In fact , books are a fad in the outskirts of '' society '' at present , and I have even seen within a week a letter from one of the late Mr.
McAllister	PERSON	's '' Four Hundred '' requesting the autograph of a well-known
New York	LOCATION	novelist .

		The chilling thought occurs , however , that she may have wanted it for a church fair , and that her interest was merely fictitious .

		After all , this would be quite proper in the case of a writer of fiction . ''

		Trilby '' enthusiasm has reached the art circles also , and various idealized portraits of the '' dear Trilby '' have been painted .

		The best piece of work of this sort which I have seen was in the studio of Mr.
C. Y. Turner	PERSON	, who has made a lovely ideal painting of '' Sweet Alice , '' immortalized in ''
Ben Bolt	PERSON	. ''

		The dress of the damsel is copied from his mother 's wedding-gown , of even date with '' Trilby '' and '' Sweet Alice . ''

		`` And so no more of '' Trilby .

		Far removed from this hysteric , hypnotic patroniza - tion of literature and art was the lecture given , on the morning of the same day , by Mr.
William Crary Brown	PERSON	- ell , on the life and genius of
Auguste Rodin	PERSON	.

		It was delivered at the Metropolitan Museum , in the course given under the auspices of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, having already been repeated privately before the
Sculpture Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		An intelligent and interested audience listened to Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's keen characterizations and brilliant epigrams .

		He made very plain the distinction between
Rodin	PERSON	's art and the academic art of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	sculp - tors , and illustrated his points with some fifty stereop - ticon views of
Rodin	PERSON	's work , including details of the Dante portal for the new Museum of Decorative Arts at
Paris	LOCATION	, studies of which were shown in a private room at the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, '' St.
John the Baptist	PERSON	, '' `` The Kiss , '' `` The
Calais Bourgeois	PERSON	, '' `` A Danaide , '' and portrait statues and busts of Bastien-Lepage , Hugo ,
Laurens	PERSON	,
Henly	ORGANIZATION	,
Legros	PERSON	, and Mme.
Morla	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	will be succeeded in these
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	lectures by Mr.
T. Humphry Ward	PERSON	, who will give a course on '' The History of English Art , with especial reference to
Reynolds	PERSON	,
Gainsborough	PERSON	, and Romney . ''

		The first lecture , on
February 16	DATE	, treats of art in
England	LOCATION	under the first two
Georges	PERSON	.

		The remaining three are devoted separately to the above-mentioned artists .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	arrived from
England	LOCATION
last Saturday	DATE	, after a most tem - pestuous voyage .

		It is never safe to '' holler '' until you are out of the woods .

		It seems that Mr.
Robert Underwood John	PERSON	- son and the
Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	, on examining the Cov - ert bill for the limitation of newspaper liability , found a very large snake in the grass in the shape of possible nominal damages for infringement of copyright .

		In spite of Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's efforts , seconded by Mr.
Covert	PERSON	, to have definite sums -LRB-
$ 250	MONEY	to
$ 5000	MONEY	-RRB- named , the bill passed the
Committee on Patents	ORGANIZATION	in its objectionable form ; and the fight must be carried on in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	itself .

		Another correction concerns my reference to Mr.
Pick	PERSON	- ard and '' The Life and Letters of
Whittier	LOCATION	, '' the con - densation of which seemed to make me reflect on his editing of that work .

		This was quite apart from fey intention .

		In regard to copyright , an important though not final decision has been rendered in the famous Rider
Haggard	PERSON	case , which Mr.
Daniel G. Thompson	PERSON	has been conducting for Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The chief point at issue was not the constitutionality of the International Copyright Law , but the claim that books published in the
United States	LOCATION	are not protected by copyright unless the American notice is printed in all foreign editions as well .

		This claim has been set aside in favor of Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	and his publishers , al - though leave is given the defendant firm to plead again in answer . ''

		The Personal Recollections of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , '' to ap - pear serially in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly , '' will show
Joan	PERSON	, it is announced , as a daughter of the people ; the scenes and incidents of her girlhood among her rustic playmates ; her childish superstitions ; her distressful solicitudes for her country ; the heavenly voices and visions that nour - ished the hope of deliverance that should surely come through her ; her conquest of a corrupt court ; her mar - tial triumphs , and her betrayal and martyrdom .

		The author 's name is not disclosed , although he is described as one of the most successful among American writers of fiction .

		He is disguised as '' the
Sieur Louis de Conte	PERSON	, ''
Joan	PERSON	's '' Page and Secretary . ''

		This nom de plume almost makes me think that Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	is the hidden author ; but on the whole I stick to `` Mark Twain '' for the present .

		I trust this work will turn out to be an American rival of '' Trilby '' et al. .

		At the same time it should be borne in mind that Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's books are reaching large editions , and Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	is an American , I believe .

		The appointment of Mr.
Herbert Putnam	PERSON	, brother of the publishers , as librarian of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, meets with solid approval here and in that city .

		Inci - dentally , it leads the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript '' to another needless outburst of parochialism to the effect that Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's being '' a New Yorker by birth shall not be treasured up against him in
Boston	LOCATION	, since he has lived there but little since his Harvard days and his gradua - tion in the class of
1883	DATE	. ''

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	is a classmate of Professor
Edward E. Hale , Jr.	PERSON	, and of Assistant Sec - retary
Charles Sumner Hamlin	PERSON	.

		He organized the new Public Library of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, and President
Eliot	PERSON	has said that in doing this he proved himself one of the three best librarians in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	has been practicing law in
Boston	LOCATION	for some three years , but had decided to leave that city for
New York	LOCATION	, so the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Herald '' says , when the appointment came .

		The traditions of his family and his own personal abil - ity promise large results .

		As for the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, the long hiatus in its management has turned out for its benefit .

		May Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	's inaction as to the Tilden trust prove equally beneficial , is the prayer of many here ; for
New York	LOCATION	has no public library .

		Two new books of importance , to be published shortly by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , as yet unannounced ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 125 are '' The Mogul Emperors of Hindustan , '' by Dr.
Ed	PERSON	- ward
S. Holden	PERSON	, and '' Letters of a Baritone , '' by Fran - cis
Walker	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons announce '' The Arthurian Epic , '' a comparative study of the Cambrian ,
Breton	ORGANIZATION	, and Anglo-Norman versions of the story , and
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Idylls of the King , '' by S. Hum - phreys Gurteen .

		Mr.
Gurteen	PERSON	is a graduate of Cam - bridge
University	ORGANIZATION	, and has become popularly known as the originator of charity organization in
England	LOCATION	.

		This excursion into the field of comparative criticism deals with the rise , growth , and later developments of the legends relating to
King Arthur	PERSON	, from the first mention of his name in
Welsh	LOCATION	song to the epic cyclus perfected under the clever romancers of the twelfth century , and compares the original tales with
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's versions .

		Many interesting facts in regard to
Tennyson	LOCATION	's varia - tions from the legends are given , as yet generally un - known .

		Mr.
Gurteen	PERSON	has gone back to the original sources in each case .

		He is now occupied with a com - panion volume to the above , to be entitled '' The Epic of the Fall of Man . ''

		This work will be a comparative study of the epics of Cffidmon ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	PERSON	, with critical comparisons of their masterpieces .

		There is room for only a mere mention of the success of
Verdi	ORGANIZATION	's '' Falstaff '' at the
Metropolitan Opera House	ORGANIZATION	last week .

		The sale of the
Foote	ORGANIZATION	collection of books proved suc - cessful beyond the expectations of the owner , and was an event in the world of letters .

		Next
Thursday	DATE	the
Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	will hold its first meeting in the rooms devoted to it in the new Carnegie annex , first described in this correspondence .

		A notable love-feast is expected .

		ARTHUR
STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		IiITEKARY NOTES .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce a translation of the great '' Lehrbuch der Botanik , '' the joint work of Drs.
Strasburger	PERSON	,
Noll	PERSON	,
Schenck	PERSON	, and
Schimper	PERSON	.

		Mr.
W. J. Courthope	PERSON	has long been engaged upon a '' History of English Poetry , '' and the first of the four volumes projected is now ready for publication . ''

		The Publisher 's Weekly '' records 4484 books issued in this country during
1894	DATE	, a decrease of 650 from the total for
1893	DATE	.

		The falling-off was mainly in fiction and theology .

		Many departments , on the other hand , exhibit a slight increase .

		A uniform library edition of the more popular prose works of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	will soon be issued by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The set will number sixteen volumes , comprising romances , short stories , and essays , and will be published at a reasonable price to meet a popular demand .


New York	LOCATION	has had its
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	for several years , and now
Chicago	LOCATION	has its similar organization the Cax - ton
Club	ORGANIZATION	, of which Mr.
J. W. Ellsworth	PERSON	is president .

		The Club will soon begin a series of publications , and is meanwhile engaged in superintending an exhibition of bookbindings to be held at an early date at the Art Institute .

		Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	, of
Portland	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, has just issued the first number of a monthly magazine called '' The Bibelot , '' and containing selections from the prose and poetical works of authors whose produc - tions are hard to get or out of print .

		The first number is devoted to
William Blake	PERSON	.

		Another will include translations of the poems of Villon .

		The
School of Applied Ethics	ORGANIZATION	, which has already held three
summer	DATE	sessions at
Plymouth	LOCATION	, has added the win - ter session to its programme , and began its meetings at
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. , on the thirteenth of this month .

		This winter session will continue for seven weeks , with two or three lectures a week .

		Professors
Felix Adler	PERSON	,
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	, and
Henry C. Adams	PERSON	are the prin - cipal lecturers .

		Three educational conferences ,
March 19	DATE	, 20 , and 21 , are included in the programme .

		Mr.
Karl Karoly	PERSON	, whose beautiful ''
Raphael	PERSON	's Ma - donnas and Other Great Pictures '' was one of the most successful of recent holiday gift-books , has in press a. full account of all '' The Paintings of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' which will be published in a few weeks by
Messrs. Bell & Sons	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		The book will be handsomely illustrated with photographic reproductions of some of the celebrated Venetian pic - tures , and will be out before the Art Exposition begins in
Venice	LOCATION	in
April	DATE	.

		The following notes taken from the editorial depart - ment of the
February	DATE	'' Educational Review '' are a sound in doctrine as their praise is well-deserved : '' The last annual report of Superintendent Lane of
Chicago	LOCATION	contains conclusive evidence that , notwithstanding the ravings and revilings of certain newspapers specially prepared , as Mr.
Charles A. Dana	PERSON	would say , to be read by fools , the public schools of that city are making sub - stantial progress .

		More than any other city superin - tendent in the country , Superintendent Lane has been called upon to resist the civium prava jubentium ardor .

		He has stood nobly for the right .

		He deserves the thanks of progressive teachers throughout the land . ''

		Sir
John Robert Seeley	PERSON	,
K. C. M. G.	PERSON	, author of Ecce
Homo	PERSON	, '' The Life and Times of
Stein	PERSON	, '' The Expan - sion of
England	LOCATION	, '' and small books upon
Napoleon	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, died at
Cambridge	LOCATION	on the thirteenth of Jan - uary .

		A historian of the scientific school , his work was - without the qualities that attract a large audience -LRB- al - ways excepting the `` Ecce Homo '' -RRB- , but those that found their way to it got from it such instruction and discipline as has been afforded by few of the historical writers of our time .

		We learn from the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Review '' that Professor
Seeley	PERSON	's great work on the for - eign policy of
England	LOCATION	in the seventeenth century was nearly completed before the long illness that preceded his death .

		The
Grolier Club of New New	ORGANIZATION	, the parent biblio - maniac club of the country , has been giving an inter - esting exhibition of historic book-bindings at its club building in that city .

		The books displayed are from the libraries of famous collectors , and from the collec - tions of various kings of
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	and their consorts , and are loaned by members of the club .

		The libraries of Mr.
Samuel P. Avery	PERSON	and Mr.
Robert Hoe	PERSON	have been especially drawn upon .

		It was something of a surprise , our correspondent writes us , to see fifteen or twenty handsome volumes from
Grolier	ORGANIZATION	's library , with their distinctive bindings and motto .

		Books from the collections of de
Thon	PERSON	,
Mazarin	PERSON	, and a host of similar amateurs of book-binding , are shown ; but the interest centres in an extensive exhibit of volumes emblazoned with the arms and insignia of certain fair ladies and their royal lovers .

		Diana of
Poitiers	LOCATION	and
Henry II.	PERSON	, the
Marquise de Maintenon	ORGANIZATION	and
Louis XIV.	PERSON	, the
Comtesse du Barry	ORGANIZATION	and
Louis XV.	PERSON	, are so represented ; as well as
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Margaret of Valois	ORGANIZATION	, and
Charles I.	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	and
Henrietta Maria	PERSON	.

		A rare quarto from the 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, library of
Henry III	ORGANIZATION	.

		of
France	LOCATION	bears an inlaid full - length portrait of the king worked ont in different colored leathers .

		The exhibition could scarcely be du - plicated in this country outside of four or five of the
New York	LOCATION	collectors ' libraries .

		Charles
Etienne Arthur Gayarre	PERSON	' , the Historian of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, died at his home in
New Orleans	LOCATION	, early in the morning of
February 11	DATE	.

		On the 9th of
January	DATE	he celebrated his ninety-first birthday .

		He was a na - tive of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and descended from persons em - inent in the French colonial history of
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		After graduating at the
College of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	, he studied law in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and was there admitted to practice in
1829	DATE	.

		Returning to
Louisiana	LOCATION	the following year he en - tered upon a political career , and was successively State Senator , Attorney General , and
Presiding Judge of the City Court of New Orleans	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1835	DATE	he was elected to the
U. S. Senate	ORGANIZATION	, but ill health prevented his entering upon the duties of this office .

		He went abroad and spent eight years in
Paris	LOCATION	and
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		Upon his return he was again elected to the
State Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, and in
1846	DATE	was appointed
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	of
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		This office he held for seven years .

		He was defeated for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
1853	DATE	, and unsuccessful in his attempts to se - cure the nomination in
1868	DATE	.

		For several years he was Reporter for
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of his native state .

		Judge
Gayarre	PERSON	`` s literary life began during his college days and continued until within the
last decade	DATE	.

		His more serious work began with the publication of '' His - toire de la Louisiane , '' two volumes , in
1847	DATE	.

		Historical works followed in quick succession ,
viz.	LOCATION	, '' Romance of the History of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, ''
1848	DATE	; ''

1851	DATE	; ``
Louisiana	LOCATION	, its History as a
French Colony	ORGANIZATION	, '' two vols. , 1851-2 ; '' History of the Spanish Domination in
Louisiana	LOCATION	from
1769	DATE	to
Decem	LOCATION	- ber
1803	DATE	, ''
1854	DATE	; `` History of

1861	DATE	, three vols. ,
1866	DATE	; ''
Philip II	PERSON	.

		of

1866	DATE	.

		Some of these comprised courses of lectures delivered about 1847-48 .

		He was the author of two works of fiction , '' Fernando de Le - mos '' -LRB- 1872 -RRB- and its sequel , '' Aubert Dubayet '' -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , and of two comedies , `` The School for Politics `` and '' Dr. Bluff , '' besides numerous pamphlets , addresses , lectures , and magazine articles .

		The author retained his mental vigor to the last .

		His later years have been spent in a modest cottage in the eastern portion of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, not precisely in the old '' French Quarter , '' but east of Esplanade street , and in a neighborhood where the French element dominates .

		Of late years it has been the custom among his friends to celebrate his birth - day in a more or less public manner .

		Judge
Gayarre	PERSON	* married many years ago , but was childless .

		His wife survives him .

		150 POE THY AS CRITICISM OF LITERATURE .

		We have heard much -LRB- something too much , indeed -RRB- of poetry as a criticism of life , since the time when
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, in his essay on
Wordsworth	PERSON	, started that famous phrase on its career .

		Its inadequacy has been pointed out by many critics since , and it is now , we should say , definitely relegated to the limbo of half - truths that fascinate for a time by virtue of their novelty , but that speedily become discred - ited .

		Probably the most convincing of the many protests it evoked was that of the writer who urged that , so far from being a mere criti - cism upon life , the greatest poetry is life itself , in direct transcription .

		But , while we must regard as whimsical the notion that poetry is nothing more than criticism , even glorified criticism , we may freely admit that there is to be found in poetical literature a large element critical of life and of many other things as well .

		Among those other things , literature itself is of considerable importance ; and we here wish to say a few words about the treas - ures of literary criticism that are among the precious gifts brought us by the poet .

		In this age of the multiplication of antholo - gies , it has for many years been to us a matter of surprise that some one did not prepare a volume of '' Poems of Poets , '' to go with the '' Poems of Places , '' the '' Poems of Books , '' the '' Poems of Nature , '' and the many other special collections .

		Within the last year or so , the want has been supplied , after a fashion , by two independent collections ; and the lover of poets , as well as the owner of dogs and the smoker of tobacco , is now provided with his own anthology of favorite pieces .

		There is still room for a better collection than has yet been made , but the needs of a deserving class of readers have at least received recognition .

		It has often been urged that the critic of any art should be at the same time an adept in the practice thereof .

		This view doubtless rests upon a misconception , being analogous to the view that no one can intelligently read a for - eign language without speaking it as well .

		In the case of the language , as is sufficiently obvious , the process by which one acquires its 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, use for reading is essentially unlike the pro- cess by which one learns to speak it .

		To speak psychologically , the nexus of associative tracks worn by much reading of French or Latin is one thing , and the nexus worn by much speak - ing of a foreign tongue quite another .

		To be more exact , we should perhaps say that the as - sociative stimulus , while going over the same nerve-track in any particular case , takes one direction in the case of reading , and the re - verse direction in the case of speech .

		Because the passage from word - symbol to concept is easily made , it by no means follows that the pas - sage from concept to word-symbol will present no difficulty .

		A similar situation , although a far more complicated one , is presented when we compare the practice of literary composi - tion with its criticism .

		But it is nevertheless true that the reader of a foreign tongue is better prepared to get its full significance if his asso - ciations have been trained to work freely in both directions ; and it is likewise true that the critic of literature who has made literature himself is , ipso facto , in some respects better equipped to understand just what has been accomplished by his fellow workers .

		Only we must not go so far as to say that creative power brings with it the critical faculty ; the former may indeed add something to the effectiveness of the lat - ter , but the intuitional character of the one is still permanently differentiated from the re - flective character of the other .

		That the poets are capable of writing good prose criticism of their art , it needs no argu - ment to show .

		We think at once of
Lessing	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and Hugo , of
Shelley and Coleridge	PERSON	, and of fifty others .

		We are now concerned to call attention to the fact that some of the most acute and sympathetic criti - cism of the poets that we have is to be found in poetry itself .

		Since English literature best illustrates this fact , although other literatures might profitably be adduced in further support of it , we shall be content with English ex - amples alone .

		The good work of poetical criti - cism was begun by
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, who labored un - der the disadvantage of having no fellow-poets of his own speech to sing about , and who was thus compelled to find subjects for his `` House of Fame '' and other critical ventures in the great names of classical antiquity or of con - temporary
Italy	LOCATION	.

		From Chaucer 's time to the present , the work has gone merrily on , and the last of our great poets has written more good poetry about his fellow-singers than we owe to any of his predecessors .

		The contemporaries and immediate followers of Chaucer had at least one English poet to panegyrize ; and so
Gower	PERSON	, and Occleve , and
Lydgate	PERSON	, to the best of their mean powers , paid tribute to their master .

		Even to-day , do we not feel some thrill of sympathy when we read Occleve ? ''

		O maister dere and fader reverent , My maister
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, flowre of eloquence , Mirrour of fructuous entendement O universal fader in science , Alias !

		that thou thyne excellent prudence In thy bedde mortel myghtest not bequethe What eyled dethe , alias !

		why wolde he sle thee ? ''

		When we come down to the
Elizabethans	LOCATION	, we find the poets rioting in versified criticism of one another .

		Shakespeare is a notable excep - tion to this rule , and in the one case in which he displayed enthusiasm for a contemporary , and spoke of '' the proud full sail of his great verse , '' he forgot to tell us whom he meant .

		There is a good deal of log-rolling , and no lit - tle malice , in all this personal poetry -LRB- such things have been known in later times , even in our own -RRB- , but many of these tributes strike a note of sincerity , and display an insight , for which we must ever cherish them .

		How true , for example , is
Drayton	LOCATION	's familiar description of Marlowe : '' His raptures were all air and fire '' ; and
Barnfield	ORGANIZATION	's of Spenser : '' Whose deep con - ceit is such , as passing all conceit , needs no defense '' ; and
Jonson	PERSON	's of Shakespeare : '' He was not for an age but for all time . ''

		It is curious to note , as we work down the centuries , how the taste of each age is reflected in these appreciations of poets by poets .

		In the
seventeenth century	DATE	,
Milton	PERSON	and
Dryden	PERSON	, indeed , as we might naturally expect of the two greatest men of their age , showed an un - derstanding of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's supremacy that leaves nothing to be desired ; but the lesser men of the time clearly preferred the lesser Elizabethans , or the decadent artificers among their own contemporaries .

		The poets of our so-called Augustan age usually referred to the great English classics in a perfunctory sort of way , and gave them but a grudging recogni - tion .

		It is very amusing to find
Addison	PERSON	, with all the airs of the Superior Person , saying of Chaucer that '' In vain he jests in his unpol - ished strain , '' and of Spenser , that he '' In an - cient tales amused a barbarous age , '' writing on the other hand of '' Great
Cowley	PERSON	then , a mighty genius , '' and going into rhapsodies over that '' harmonious bard , '' the '' courtly Wai ler . ''

		Equally amusing contrasted citations might be made from Pope .

		It was only in the
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 135 later eighteenth century , with
Collins	PERSON	and Gray , that poetry acquired a saner outlook upon itself , and began to grope back toward the old truth that art is better than artifice .

		The nineteenth century is so rich in the homage of poet to fellow-poet , that an essay , rather than a paragraph , would be needed to do it justice .

		And we would call particular attention to the fine critical quality of the mass of work which these poems so imper - fectly represent .

		Their writers have good rea - sons for the faith that is in them ; they do not merely eulogize , they illuminate as well .

		If this were not so , the present article would have no excuse for existence .

		We do not know where in prose to find better criticism than
Wordsworth	PERSON	's of Milton : '' Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea ; Pure as the naked heavens , majestic , free , '' or Landor 's of Browning : '' Since Chaucer was alive and hale No man has walk 'd along our roads with step So active , so inquiring eye , or tongue So varied in discourse , '' or

		Or Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's of Dante mourning over a country recreant to its mission and dead in spirit : '' The steepness of strange stairs had tired his feet , And his lips yet seemed sick of that salt bread Wherewith the lips of banishment are fed ; But nothing was there in the world so sweet As the most bitter love , like God 's own grace , Wherewith he gazed on that fair buried face . ''

		We hope that some one will undertake the preparation of an enchiridion of poetical crit - icism more comprehensive than has yet been attempted , a collection of the best things that have been said in the poetry of half a dozen modern literatures about the best poets of the whole world .

		Such a collection would be of the greatest value to the student of literary criticism , and would deserve to stand on the shelf beside the `` Poetics '' of Aristotle , the treatise of

		THE HUMANITIES AND COLLEGE EDUCATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The plea for the humanities as essential to genuine culture , in the editorial article of your last issue , is greatly needed in these present days , when the philis - tinism of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	is too rapidly making its way in the faculties of not a few of our Western colleges .

		You put it too mildly , however , when you say that the humanities '' may fairly demand as much attention and as large an expenditure as the sciences of nature . ''

		Should they not in the curricula of our secondary schools and colleges demand more ?

		The naturalists are not modest in their claims .

		Accepting , as many do , whether consciously or unconsciously , the view that man is merely the product of his material environment , they quite logically exalt the study of that environment above the study of man himself .

		Moreover , in so far as they study man it is rather as naturalists than as those who recognize and feel the deeper powers and significances of human life .

		But physics , chemistry , physiology , or even physiological psychology , can not rightly and ade - quately teach us of man .

		As
Paulsen	PERSON	, who claims that in the university the sciences of nature should have equal footing with the sciences of man , yet says , '' Man lives in history , the brute in nature . ''

		Hence history , sociology , language , literature , psychology in its true sense , philosophy , and the great religious books of the 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
March	DATE	l r world , will best teach us of man , and best develop the finer elements of manhood .

		And it is to be devoutly hoped that our colleges will never wholly cease to recog - nize this .

		Some of them have yielded too much to the really arrogant claim that the natural sciences give a culture equal if not superior to the humanistic studies .

		Indeed , our educational system is at present in the midst of a process of experimentation .

		The results thus far are not , it is true , satisfactory .

		The former means and methods produced a riper and more rounded develop - ment .

		But then what may we not expect when labor - atories wholly take the place of libraries , and the things of sense absorb our contemplation rather than the things of mind ?

		Certainly we may not expect any ministry `` to our deepest spiritual needs , '' nor any of '' the finer issues of thought and feeling , and the power to quicken other spirits to those issues . ''

		Darwin , on his knees studying the products of a square foot of soil , with one whole side of his nature , as he sadly confessed , '' atro - phied , '' is the type of this sort of education .

		Plato , with his face upward , and his inward eye fixed on the more elusive but nobler realities of the soul , best rep - resents the other .

		And , however Thracian handmaid - ens may laugh at the one and extol the other , yet at the last '' Wisdom is justified of her children . ''

		Plato 's contention , '' Until kings are philosophers or philosophers kings , cities will never cease from ill , '' may with equal truth be applied to colleges and schools .

		Educators need most of all to be psychologists and phil - osophers .

		They must have a thorough and sympathetic knowledge of the human mind and its orderly develop - ment .

		When they attain to this , they will confine to the universities , as alone appropriate to them , that sys - tem which places all studies on an equal footing and allows entire freedom of choice .

		They will at the same time recognize that the peculiar function of the college is not to make learned specialists , but to educate .

		It takes young men while still in their formative age , when prin - ciples and aims of life are being consciously determined .

		Therefore the course of study which it offers , while by no means excluding the natural sciences , should yet be largely mafle up of what De Quincey calls '' the litera - ture of power '' as distinguished from '' the literature of knowledge . ''

		Indeed , it would be an excellent plan to write on the walls of every college , especially in the room where the faculty meets , the entire passage where this distinction is so finely drawn out .

		DIALECT STUDY IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your last issue , Professor
Benjamin Ide Wheeler	PERSON	requests such scholars as will contribute to the
English Dialect Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	to send their material either to the English or to the American editor .

		Permit me to sug - gest that trouble and inaccuracy may be avoided if all the material be sifted first in
America	LOCATION	.

		One obvious reason for this is furnished by the letter -LRB- published in the same number of THE DIAL -RRB- of Professor
Bondu	PERSON	- rant , whose words certainly would imply , if they were not really meant to convey the impression , that axe -LRB- for ask -RRB- , spunky , liefer , peart -LRB- in good health -RRB- , clomb -LRB- pro- nounced clum -RRB- , and right -LRB- for very -RRB- , are peculiar to the dialect of Southern negroes , although all of them may be heard on occasion on Yankee farms or in a
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	school-yard ; where , too , `` going '' -LRB- when it is without accent -RRB- is pronounced gwine , thus : hwarya gon is '' where are you going , '' but -LRB- in reply -RRB- '' going home ' * is gwine hum .

		Apropos of this , could not sentence ac - cent and syncope be noticed in rendering dialectic ex - pression ?

		We venture to doubt whether an uneducated negro ever used exactly the expression -LRB- cited by Pro- fessor
Bondurant	PERSON	-RRB- , '' How is your old ` oman ? ''

		Does not the darkey say always '' Howsya old ? ''

		In respect of shet of of shut of 'm
New England	LOCATION	, both forms are heard .

		The idiom is common ; the pronounciation of the verb depends on that of the same word when it is used in the meaning '' close , '' for the expression shut of is employed by them that would not in any circumstances say shet .

		In other words , the provincial idiom , as often happens , , survives the intrusion of the new pronunciation .

		In conclusion , may I ask Professor
Wheeler	PERSON	what collec - tors are to do in the case of words like apron ?

		The pro- nunciations ap-run , a-prun , and a-purn -LRB- a-perri -RRB- are fre - quently heard not only in the same village but even in the same family ; one of the forms being commonly the one taught by the schoolmaster -LRB- as far as I have ob - served the taught form in this instance is a-purn -RRB- , and therefore of no value .

		It seems to me that it might be well for a committee of them that are interested in the matter to formulate some general rules by which col - lectors may govern themselves ; and that all collections , whether made in accordance with these rules or not , before they are sent to
England	LOCATION	should be analyzed by a number of Americans who ought to represent differ - ent parts of the country , and so be able to control the returns .

		`` AXE '' AND `` SPUNKY '' IN DIALECT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of the 16th inst .

		is an article by
Alex	PERSON	- ander
L. Bondurant	PERSON	, in which he speaks of '' the negro dialect '' as being '' rich in survivals , '' and makes several quotations to support the fact .

		There can be no doubt as to the fact stated .

		Two of his instances , however , are of survivals by no means confined to negro or even Southern usage .

		Axe for ask is common in the
East	LOCATION	, , and I think also throughout the
North and West	LOCATION	; it is an old Anglo-Saxon variant .

		It occurs in
Lowell	LOCATION	-LRB- ''
Biglow	PERSON	Papers : The Pious Editor 's Creed '' `` I git jest wut I axes '' -RRB- ; and I have frequently heard it in various
New England States	LOCATION	.

		The other word is spunky ; and that word is used where - ever I have found any Scotch or Irish emigration and no part of our land is free from either .

		Both of these survivals are in common use by thousands who have never stood in any close connection with negroes .

		LAFAYETTE AND MIRABEAU , ONCE MORE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It would probably be presumptuous on my part to - assume that the public are sufficiently interested in my writings to warrant my soliciting a second time some space to show up Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's most peculiar critical methods .

		But I venture to hope that
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	will deem it its own interest as a leading critical journal to correct erroneous impressions , for which it has been made the vehicle by a contributor .

		Though I can well understand that Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	'' pre - fers '' to shift the controversy to another ground , I must enter my protest against his doing so .

		Whether his or
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL my opinions of Mirabeau and
Lafayette	LOCATION	are correct , is not the issue raised by me .

		Neither would THE DIAL be the proper place for such a contention , nor would I anywhere enter upon it .

		My charge was distinctly that Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	misrepresented me , partly by what he said and principally by what he did not say .

		Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	, being a lawyer , must be familiar with the maxim that suppressio veri is no less an offence than suggestio falsi .

		This charge he has not even attempted to refute .

		I now reiterate it , adding that he has aggravated the offence as to myself and extended it to von Sybel and La
Marck	PERSON	.

		He says my '' charge relating to the conduct of
Lafay	PERSON	- ette on the 5th and
6th of October , 1789	DATE	, is supported on the authority of the light and frivolous Camille Des - moulins '' intimating thereby that it is supported only on this authority .

		He keeps his readers in ignorance of the fact that I charge the General chiefly with '' sins of omission '' -LRB- II. , 58 -RRB- , as to which no particular au - thority is needed ; it is based upon the notorious facts , which have never been denied by anyone .

		He is pleased to ignore that I support my view besides by the report of the commission of the municipal council , a general reference to '' the account of La
Marck	PERSON	, who speaks as an eye-and-ear witness '' -LRB- II. , 63 -RRB- , and a `` statement of
Lafayette	LOCATION	himself '' -LRB- II. , 59 -RRB- .

		The latter is of espe - cial import as an item of the circumstantial evidence , for , as I expressly state , '' though it can not be directly proved that
Lafayette	LOCATION	rather liked to be led to Ver - sailles , circumstantial evidence renders it likely '' -LRB- II. , 61 -RRB- .

		By quoting one sentence of von Sybel , depicting in general terms
Lafayette	LOCATION	's character , Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	pro- duces the impression that the eminent German historian is arrayed against me , while he must know , if he has read von Sybel , that this authority is altogether on my side .

		Not only is von
Sybel	ORGANIZATION	's general estimate of La - fayette practically identical with mine , but also as to the 5th and 6th of
October	DATE	in particular does he make exactly the same charge , with this difference only , that he substantiates it more than I could do and that he formulates it more pointedly -LRB- I. , 95-105 , 4th ed . -RRB-

		.

		That I , too , know of noble traits in
Lafayette	LOCATION	's char - acter , the reader of Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's articles is not likely to suspect .

		He will be surely not a little astonished to learn that I have written : '' Not only his physical cour - age and his own belief in the intensity and perfect hon - esty of his lofty sentiments and aspirations are above suspicion ; as to the negative side also his moral cour - age must be acknowledged to have been of a high or - der '' -LRB- II. , 142 -RRB- .

		On the other hand , who can suspect , from what Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	has told him , that his glowing picture of the
General	ORGANIZATION	is confronted in my lectures by
Jefferson	PERSON	's charge that he had '' a canine appetite for popularity '' -LRB- II. , 140 -RRB- by the disparaging declarations of La
Marck	PERSON	-LRB- II. , 137 , 143 , 144 -RRB- , of whom he quotes in his first article only an appreciative opinion of a considerable number of damaging self-confessions of the General -LRB- II. , 126 , 127 , 135 , 136 , 137 , 138 , 139 -RRB- ?

		To an unbiased mind these things will be of greater weight than the array of historical writers , by which Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	thinks he can crush me .

		To the unprofessional reader the list will , however , be imposing enough .

		Upon the historian it will with the exception of
Taine	PERSON	make very little impression .

		The historian , though he will acknowledge
Michelet	PERSON	,
Martin	PERSON	, and
Thiers	PERSON	to be names of weight , knows why they are not conclusive authori - ties as to
Lafayette	LOCATION	, apart from the fact that their books were written a good many years ago .

		What right has Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	to declare his two quota - tions from letters to Mercy '' the real opinion of La
Marck	PERSON	in relation to Mirabeau , '' with the intimation that they contain his whole '' real opinion , '' or that what he says in his letters to Mirabeau himself is not his real opinion ?

		Such an intimation in the face of what La Mark himself has declared to be his real opinion in his long '' Introduction '' to his correspondence with
Mira	PERSON	- beau taking up more than half of the first volume is more than '' surprising . ''

		Moreover , these quotations do not contain anything as to
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's '' venality '' or even his morality in general , and Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	started to make up a case against me as to these .

		Now , as to the '' venality , '' why does he not take any notice of
Lafay	PERSON	- ette 's opinion quoted by me -LRB- II. , 179 -RRB- that , though he '' was not inaccessible to money , '' '' for no amount would he have sustained an opinion that would have destroyed liberty and dishonored his mind '' ?

		As to the morality in general was there any necessity whatever of mak - ing up a case against me ?

		Apparently the greatest , for Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	says : `` The author could not well avoid -LRB- ! -RRB-

		stating damaging facts in relation to the character of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	.

		The question at issue is -LRB- ! -RRB-

		, whether the vices and venalities of Mirabeau explain his failure to win that confidence of colleagues which is necessary to a public man . ''

		I leave it to every fair-minded person to judge whether that is or is not grossly misrepresent - ing by suppressio veri an author , who writes : '' But there is a third element indispensable in the make-up of a genuine statesman 's character .

		The motives and the ends must be essentially moral .

		Was Mirabeau pos - sessed of this requisite ?

		Could -LRB- ! -RRB-

		it be presumed that he possessed it ?

		It was this question that rendered his past an almost insurmountable barrier between him and success .

		Confidence he needed above all , and just this he found nowhere .

		It was bitter and cruel , but terribly true -LRB- ! -RRB-

		what the father had written : ' He gathers in what those reap who have failed as to the basis , the morals ... He will never obtain confidence , even if he tried to deserve it . '

		And it was by no means only the immorality of his youth that caused all to distrust him ... Immorality was so deeply ingrained into his whole being , that it would crop out at the slightest pro- vocation or temptation ... he was ever lamentably ready to make it -LRB- the maxim that ' the petty morality kills the great morality ' -RRB- a cloak for his inexcusable -LRB- ! -RRB-

		moral trippings ... The moral pollution was certainly not only skin-deep .

		The whole blood was vitiated . ''

		-LRB- II. , 236-238 . -RRB-

		As I am precluded from assuming either that Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	reckoned upon my not being able once more to gain access to the readers of THE DIAL , or that he in - tentionally wrongs me , I can find only one explanation for his proceeding : as to von Sybel ,
La Marck	PERSON	, and my - self , he has excused himself from reading our books as books and contented himself with reading sentences .

		He concludes his second paragraph with the exclama - tion , '' Poor Camille ! ''

		evidently expecting the reader to substitute for '' Camille '' von Hoist .

		With all defer - ence I submit that my humble name would not be the correct substitute .

		Whether a greater one could claim the honor with more propriety , is for the reader to de - cide .

		I herewith abandon the field to Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	for good .

		Our way of reading historical books and our methods of investigating historical questions are so dif - ferent that , in my opinion , our crossing swords can no longer be of any benefit to either ourselves or the public .

March 1	DATE	, Ejje THE RENASCENCE OF
POE	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The appearance of a handsome illustrated edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's complete works , carefully ed - ited , opening with a memoir by Professor
G. E. Woodberry	PERSON	and a special introduction to the tales by Mr.
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	, is an event of considerable importance in the history of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's fame among his countrymen .

		For
Poe	PERSON	has had the singular fortune to be praised with distinc - tion in some quarters abroad , while receiving generally but a qualified welcome at home .

		Baudelaire hastened to translate the author 's complete works , with appreciative commentary , an act typical of the popular approbation be - stowed upon
Poe	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	to-day .

		Some of the tales have been rendered into Spanish and some into German .


Ulissi Ortensi	PERSON	, finding the example of Baudelaire more potent than his warning precept , dared to turn all of the poems into musical Italian prose .

		Among English - men ,
James Hannay	PERSON	of the preceding genera - tion , and Professor
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	of the present , have been intimate and favorable critics .

		In - gram 's life of
Poe	PERSON	, though discriminating , is friendly and full .

		In illustration of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's proposition that it takes a poet to catch a poet ,
Robert Browning	PERSON	presented to Mrs.
Benzon	PERSON	a copy of the poems , dedicated , as were all the English editions , to
Miss Barrett	PERSON	, and wrote on the fly-leaf that the book was given '' partly on account of the poetry , partly on that of the dedication . ''

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, after criti - cal discussion of the more prominent makers of verse in this country , decided that , if Amer - ica has produced a great poet ,
Poe	PERSON	has the best claim to that sacred title .

		And Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, in his '' Letters to Dead Authors , '' ad - dresses the shade of
Poe	PERSON	as that of '' the great - est poet , perhaps the greatest literary genius , '' of his country .

		On the contrary , excluding the list of the poet 's personal friends , where , hitherto , could we look among his own countrymen for an es - timate of his genius in which stinted praise should not be outweighed by abundant blame ?

Poe	ORGANIZATION	's verse but nursery jingles .

		Lowell , while allowing `` three-fifths of him '' to be `` genius , '' precipitated a sharp rejoinder from his former friend by pronounc - ing the remainder fraction `` sheer fudge . ''

		Nowadays , Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	, although naming
Poe	PERSON	as one of the three distinctive American writers , condemns his work as '' fan - tastic and meretricious throughout . ''

		He is ap - proached by Mr.
Greenough White	PERSON	, with allit - erative compassion , as '' poor
Poe	PERSON	, '' '' pessim - istic
Poe	PERSON	, '' and '' The Fall of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Usher '' is preposterously discovered to be an allegory , shadowing autobiographically `` the burial of conscience , and the ruin resulting therefrom . ''

		The present edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, with its commen - taries , makes some amends for past ill-treat - ment .

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	had already shown in his '' Poets of
America	LOCATION	'' that he could appreciate
Poe	PERSON	's verse with discrimination , and without patronage or pity .

		His estimate of the tales is judicious , weighing defects candidly , and mean - ing to make full recognition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's intellec - tual genius .

		Occasionally a word seemed mis - applied , as when the sumptuous but incongruous furnishings of '' The Assignation '' are said to be '' lauded '' by the author and thus to evince his untutored taste .

		It seems gratuitous , too , to call ''
William Wilson	PERSON	'' a '' confession , '' and then urge that the author was not really so hardened in conscience as in this fiction he pre - tended to be .

		But the introduction to the tales , showing as it does a scholarly attempt to trace
Poe	PERSON	's conceptions to sources in contemporary continental writers , must be accounted the work of an experienced and just-minded critic .

		The casual descriptive phrase , '' a misfitted Amer - an , '' aptly expresses the sense of strangeness with which
Poe	PERSON	has so long been regarded in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The memoir , by Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, is excellent in its restraint .

		The story of the poet 's life is told without com - ment , and the facts are left to make their own impression .

		How many authors , one asks , have to endure the printing of such intimate and un - braced correspondence as that here given -LRB- pp .

		52 , 53 -RRB- , describing
Poe	PERSON	's arrival in
New York	LOCATION	, almost penniless , with his consumptive wife , and his search for lodgings ?

		In this case the sartial friend , who considerately edits his sub - ject 's correspondence , is absent .

		Every squalid and trivial detail is laid bare .

		The new edition is beautiful in paper and ypography , and the illustrations by Mr.
Sterner	PERSON	are a distinct addition .

		Of course in all illus -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 trations the artist 's * conception is to be expected not the writer 's ; for no draughtsman ever yet succeeded in exactly apprehending the wri - ter 's idea , except the illustrator of '' Trilby . ''

		But Mr.
Sterner	PERSON	shows great sympathy with the weirdness and beauty that give tone to the tales .

		The three volumes already published include an unfamiliar sketch , '' The Elk , '' their contents being subdivided ingeniously into ro - mances of death , old-world romance , tales of conscience , of natural beauty , of pseudo-science , of ratiocination , and of illusion .

		But perhaps the whole of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's work besides a dozen hu - morous and satirical sketches , in which the laughter is not genial but cool and sardonic may be said to fall into three groups : the im - aginative , the ratiocinative , and the critical , the first division including his verse and most of his tales .

		In his poetry
Poe	PERSON	strove for novel stauzaic and melodic effects , in the conviction that the resources of English versification in this direction were not indicated by the few traditional forms .

		Believing also that the mu - sical element in verse is of great importance , he sought for sweet sounds , and used fully the devices of alliteration and the refrain .

		The melodious quality of his poetry is generally acknowledged , although difference of opinion exists concerning the relative value of sound in poetry .

		Those who delight in music for its own sake , however , will be slow to condemn his verse as too exclusively addressed to the ear .

		A more striking divergence of view is revealed on asking whether the poems are the outcome of personal feeling .

		Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, making
Poe	PERSON	mainly a skilful artist , denies , in the '' Life , '' that he ever experienced passion .

		So Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	: '' There is a simulation of emotion in it -LSB- the poetry -RSB- , but the emotion is as imaginary as the method by which it is sought to be conveyed is artificial . ''

		But Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, one is glad to note , takes the oppo - site view .

		The anecdote is well-known of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's quivering gratitude for unwonted kindness re - ceived at the hands of Mrs.
Stanard	PERSON	, who in - spired the exquisite lyric '' To
Helen	PERSON	, '' and over whose grave the unforgetting boy used to brood by night .

		Many of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's published let - ters are written at so white a heat that the cold comma and period utterly fail to indicate the broken thought .

		He addressed his ''
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- reka '' `` to those who feel rather than to those who think , '' and this without the capacity him - self to feel !

		He declared in the preface to his poems that poetry had been with him `` not a pur - pose , but a passion , '' and some would doubtless explain this as the trick of a passionless man !

		How can one receive the mournful cadences of '' Ulalume , '' that dirge to a dead wife out of a mood rejecting the possibility of a newer love , and deny the poet 's volcanic passion ?

		Even Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	, in his memoir , bears testimony to
Poe	PERSON	's `` ardent temperament , '' calls him `` impetuous , self-willed , defiant , '' and quotes Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	concerning '' his turbu - lent and passionate youth . ''

		In the words of his youthful poem , '' Romance '' : '' And when an hour with calmer wings Its dawn upon my spirit flings That little time with lyre and rhyme To while away forbidden things !

		My heart would feel to be a crime Unless it trembled with the strings . ''

		In his tales ,
Poe	PERSON	's imagination found wider expression than in his poems .

		True , the com - pass of his imaginative writing was restricted in the main to sombre and ghastly themes .

		Sev - eral causes were at work .

		Some account must be made of his pitiful struggles for subsistence in that
America	LOCATION	where , fifty years before the successful Mr.
Howells	PERSON	gestured young men away from literature as a means of livelihood , the pen was indeed a feeble staff to lean one 's whole weight upon .

		Poe knew ''
America	LOCATION	, where , more than in any other region upon the face of the globe , to be poor is to be despised '' -LRB- memoir , p. 57 -RRB- .

		An idealist , chained to hack - work for his daily bread , must in some way manifest the intrusion of penury into his dreams .

		The drink habit is the popular ex - planation of his wild creations , and it is not uncommon to adduce a finished tale , involving arduous artistic application , as the result of a night 's debauch .

		But the principal cause of his '' unearthliness '' lay in the temperament which
Poe	PERSON	had inherited from his forefathers .

		For good or bad , he was endowed with a mind that hovered by affinity over the grave , and dared to guess what might be immediately be - yond the phenomenon men call death .

		As re - lated in '' Silence A Fable , '' he could not laugh with the Demon in the shadow of the tomb .

		But , restricted in scope as are the tales , their spell is undeniable .

		The writer has per - sonal acquaintance with at least one boy who again and again found himself caught away by these marvellous romances to a land of enchant - ment , from which the descent to earth was ab - rupt and dull .

		The boyish admiration has en - dured , now mingled with sober valuation of the consummate art that produces such results .

		The reader was not , so far as he is aware , at all morally unstrung , or even haunted with gob - 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, lin visions , by reason of what has been termed
Poe	PERSON	's morbid fiction .

		And , while not discover - ing a self-drawn portrait of the author in every murderer and maniac that crosses the page , he does find that most important ingredient of sustained literary renown the distilled essence of life .

		It has been truly said that
Poe	PERSON	's tales dis - play the conceptions of an idealist , conveyed through the method of a realist .

		Nothing could be in greater contrast with the commonplace narratives of the modern school than the gor - geous finishings , the impossible incidents , the unparalleled characters of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's dreamy ro - mances .

		Yet the calculating accumulation of detail , each particular being easily credible be - cause so exactly stated , leads the reader step by step to cross the boundary of the actual , and to tabernacle for a time in a land of shadows .

		It is only at the close , awakening from his illu - sion , that he can perceive the constructive art which admits no useless circumstance , fully pre - pares for the conclusion , yet conceals the denoue - ment until it flashes out like a lightning-stroke .

		Few men of imagination are gifted in com - mensurate degree with the power of analytical reasoning .

		Poe exemplified his dictum that to reason well one must share the nature of both poet and mathematician .

		His ratiocinative power is shown in the five tales grouped in the present edition .

		It has been objected , and by
Poe	PERSON	himself , that little credit is due for unrav - elling a web of one 's own tangling ; but the point at issue is whether the fictitious situation is illustrative of actual affairs . ''

		The Purloined Letter , '' for example , is a case under the ob - served law that the most obvious fact is fre - quently the fact perceived with the greatest difficulty .

		It will be remembered , too , that
Poe	PERSON	proved his faculty of analysis when the answer to the problem was not predetermined by himself in solving numerous difficult ciphers , in fathom - ing the mystery surrounding the murder of
Mary Rogers	PERSON	, in guessing from the first chap - ters the development of ''
Barnaby Rudge	PERSON	. ''

		Moreover ,
Poe	PERSON	possessed not merely analytical insight , but the ability to express in clear lan - guage the steps of his mental process .

		Doubt - less other spectators guessed the secret of Mael - zel 's mechanical chess-player , but nobody else gave so logical and convincing an account of his reasoning .

		One is almost ready , before the clearness of his philosophical exposition , to say with him that no thought is beyond the reach of expression in language .

		The most remarkable outcome of his com - bined imaginative and ratiocinative power is the so-called prose poem '' Eureka . ''

		Not in effect , say astronomers , what it purports to be an explanation of the material universe . ''

		Nonsense ! ''

		ejaculates the scientist , as he turns from the prefatory note : `` I offer this book of Truths , not in its character of Truth - Teller , but for the Beauty that abounds in its Truth ; constituting it true . ''

		Yet the work remains the expression of a gigantic effort to go behind the most general laws of science , to account for the attraction of gravitation , to en - ter into the thought of God at the moment of creation , to reduce to a single impulse of the Divine Will the multitudinous phenomena of created things .

		The author requests that his work be judged after his death , as a poem only ; but nobody seems willing to oblige him .

		From the purely intellectual point of view , it will be granted that this attempt to furnish a founda - tion for
Kepler	PERSON	and
Laplace	LOCATION	is at least ingen - ious and bold .

		If judged as a '' prose poem , '' it takes rank among the striking products of the creative imagination .

		To
Poe	PERSON	as critic , a few contemptuous words have commonly been thrown .

		He is said to have been unguided by principles , prejudiced , ferocious .

		It will be acknowledged that , with a fine native appreciation for good writing , he lacked the judicial temperament .

		He was liable to be swayed by his personal likes and dislikes .

		According to the editor of the once popular ''
Graham	PERSON	's Magazine , '' '' No man with more readiness would soften a harsh expression at the request of a friend . ''

		But that
Poe	PERSON	had re - flected upon the principles of composition , his several well-known essays on the subject abund - antly prove .

		His definition of poetry as the rhythmical creation of beauty , having its effect in elevating excitement of the soul , stands side by side with a score of other similar though partial statements , which must serve us while we await the perfect definition .

		Poe tested poetry by reading it aloud .

		He ascribed the varied musical effects of verse to the principle of equality .

		He opposed allegory and humor in poetry , thought the Greek drama manifestly the outgrowth of a cruder age , and the older English poetry over-praised because of its an - tiquity .

		He corrected
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's distinction between fancy and imagination , showing that neither faculty truly creates .

		Among the qual - ities that he was accustomed to praise , in crit - ical consideration of poetry , were truth or nat - uralness , imagination , rhythmic effect , melody , force , grace , abandon , and what he called keep -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 141 ing , or propriety of treatment .

		In fiction , as in verse , originality was the quality placed high - est , then constructive ability , imagination , and '' the minor merits of style , '' meaning rhetor - ical and grammatical accuracy .

		In the application of his criticism ,
Poe	PERSON	praised
Bulwer	PERSON	,
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Moore	PERSON	,
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		He placed
Longfellow	PERSON	at the head of American poets , and
Bryant	PERSON	second in rank .

		Hawthorne was warmly welcomed , long before the populace had discovered his merits .

		Lowell , before his witty characterization of
Poe	PERSON	in the `` Fable for Critics , '' was defended against an attack of Blackwood as '' one of the noblest of our poets . ''


Bayard Taylor	PERSON	,
Margaret Ful	PERSON	- ler , and Mrs.
Osgood	PERSON	are hailed as accessions to letters .

		But
Emerson	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and the tran - scendentalists generally , were beyond the ro - mancer 's sympathetic reach .

		In reading the long list of good , bad , and indifferent authors treated , one 's chief wonder is not that the critic was ferocious , as he occasionally was , but that he found so much to commend in what time has adjudged a wilderness of mediocrity .

		To the women poets of
America	LOCATION	, in particular , he was uniformly kind , not blind .

		He was so far influenced by the ''
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Review '' as to hold that the merits of a literary work might be left to speak for themselves , but that the cause of good writing would be best sustained by a rigorous exposure of defects , with little regard to the feelings of the author .

		No fair - minded man , reading the whole of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's criti - cism , can doubt that he had at heart the dig - nity and permanence of American letters .

		His defects were defects of temperament .

		The most prominent attack made by
Poe	PERSON	as critic was upon
Longfellow	LOCATION	, whom he indi - rectly accused of plagiarism .

		With his wor - ship of originality , he had a mania for expos - ing what he deemed imitation ; and it must be allowed that , although his parallels are not always convincing , he rarely makes a charge without adducing his evidence .

		In the case of
Longfellow	LOCATION	, the discussion was lengthened through a well-meant defence by one of the friends of the gentle
Cambridge	LOCATION	poet .

		Poe really admired
Longfellow	PERSON	's genius , praised his artistic skill and ideality , and ranked him , as has been said , at the head of American poets .

		In his article on the drama ,
Poe	PERSON	says : '' Throughout ' The Spanish Student , ' as well as throughout the other compositions of its au - thor , there runs a very obvious vein of imita - tion .

		We are perpetually reminded of some - thing we have seen before some old acquaint - ance in manner or matter ; and even when the similarity can not be said to amount to plagiar - ism , it is still injurious to the poet in the good opinion of him who reads . ''

		If we turn to the delicate and sympathetic estimate of Mr.
Sted	PERSON	- man , we shall find him saying , before claiming for Longfellow the credit of a distinctive tone , or manner of treatment : '' Reviewing our sum - mary of his work , I observe that each of his best known efforts has led to the mention of prose or verse by some other hand which it re - sembles .

		In view of the possible inference , we may now ask ,
Was Longfellow	LOCATION	, then , with his great reputation and indisputable hold upon our affections , not an original poet ?

		It must be acknowledged at the outset that few poets of his standing have profited more openly by examples that suited their tastes and purposes .

		The evidence of this is seen not merely in three or four , but in a great number , of his produc - tions . ''

		To quote once more from Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	: '' Originality and greatness are precisely the qualities Longfellow lacks . ''

		It appears from this collation of passages that the three critics , differing as they do in emphasis , have in mind one and the same fact .

		What are the grounds on which this unique writer , now enjoying a renascence of his fame , may rest a claim to genius ?

		We recognize with him that '' perseverence is one thing , genius quite another . ''

		But to define genius is a desperate task .

		Still , among its trusty marks may be named intensity , a junction at some point with the infinite , and permanence of power .

		These three qualities are revealed in the work of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Into his best writing he poured the whole of his life , containing springs of feebleness as well as of might , which rose from sources beyond his contriving .

		Such as it was , his inmost and hottest soul was concen - trated upon the work of his hand .

		His thought joined too with the infinite and the immortal .

		Although pausing long at the brink of the grave , and noting too carefully the repulsive details of worm and shroud , it welcomed the life that is in death the restful escape from '' the fever called ' Living . ' '

		The present publication is testimony that
Poe	PERSON	's hold upon men is unweakened .

		Wrapped within those imaginative legends lies the touch that still moves , if but to shudder .

		Here is a man whose swelling ambition strove to do infinite things upon a finite stage .

		Let us accept him as a child of genius , and enshrine him forever as an eminent figure in the literature of our nation .


D. L. MAULSBY	PERSON	.

		142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ART IN PRIMITIVE
GREECE	LOCATION	.

		* The two volumes on the Art of
Primitive Greece	LOCATION	are the beginning of the end of what must be considered the most complete and thorough history of ancient art ever written .

		Many years ago
Georges Perrot	PERSON	-LRB- aided by
Charles Chipiez	PERSON	-RRB- began the monumental task of gathering up and sifting all the material of ancient art and putting it together in sequen - tial and chronological form .

		It was in
1882	DATE	that the first volumes , treating of Egyptian art , appeared ; and since then we have followed
M. Perrot	PERSON	, trusting to his knowledge , sagacity , and judgment , through the arts of the Chal - daeans , Assyrians , Persians , and all the coast people of
Asia	LOCATION	Minor .

		At last he has brought us to
Greece	LOCATION	his objective point from the start .

		For he told us in his first book that '' beyond the obelisks and pyramids of
Egypt	LOCATION	, beyond the towers of Chaldsea and the domes of
Nineveh	LOCATION	, the lofty colonnades of
Persepolis	LOCATION	, the fortresses and rock-cut tombs of
Phrygia	LOCATION	and Lycia , beyond the huge ramparts of the cities of
Syria	LOCATION	, we shall never cease to perceive on the horizon the sacred rock of the Athenian Acropolis . ''


Greece	LOCATION	, to
M. Perrot	PERSON	, furnished the climax of all ancient art ; but it must not be inferred that the preceding volumes on Egyptian and Oriental art are merely introduc - tory to this climax .

		On the contrary , each volume is in itself a complete statement of its subject an exhaustive array of all the facts and a careful considering of all the theories .

		The series begins with the beginning in
Egypt	LOCATION	, and is designed to end with the Roman art of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	.

		The complete work is to cover fifteen or sixteen volumes .

		Twelve of them are now published , and , judging from these , the statement that they form the best history of ancient art ever written is not a rash one .

		No historian of art has ever covered so much ground in so scholarly a manner as
Georges Perrot	PERSON	.


Winckelmann	PERSON	,
Schnaase	PERSON	,
Woltmann	PERSON	and Woermann ,
Reber	PERSON	, never had adequate knowledge to start with , never had breadth of view to carry with , never had aesthetic taste to judge with .


M. Perrot	PERSON	possesses all of these qualities , and what must be somewhat hu - miliating to those who hug the idea that only
Germany	LOCATION	can produce historians he is a Frenchman .

		It seems to be thought in some quarters that however clumsy and dull a plod - * HISTORY OF ART IK PRIMITIVE

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
A. C. Armstrong & Son	ORGANIZATION	.

		der the German may be he is wonderfully thorough and accurate ; and that the easy style of the Frenchman argues a superficial view of questionable facts .

		However well-founded that idea may be as regards theology and phil - osophy , it is not well-founded as regards science , letters , archaeology , and art .

		In taste , judg - ment , accuracy , and perspicacity , the French - man is to be trusted ; and these books by
Georges Perrot	PERSON	are warrant for saying so .

		They are the most modern , but not the first , instance of French scholarship .

		We shall wait a long time before any German or Italian or English - man equals them .

		Nevertheless , the reading of these last vol - umes on Mycenian art causes a shade of dis - appointment .

		When a writer would do some - thing '' very fine , '' he is likely to overshoot the mark ; and
M. Perrot	PERSON	evidently intended his treatment of Greek art to be convincing to the last degree .

		He begins and ends with a theory , and one wonders at times whether he is not straining facts to make them square with the theory .

		In brief , notwithstanding great cau - tion and a putting of all the pros and cons ,
M. Perrot	PERSON	believes with
Schliemann	PERSON	in Troy and
Mycenae	LOCATION	, in the ancestors of the Greeks start - ing there
2000	DATE	years
B.C.	LOCATION	, in the growth of Greek art from this Mycenian art ; he believes in the time-honored and somewhat fallacious theory of evolution .

		It can not be said that his theory is impossible or even improbable .

		In - deed , it is made quite plausible ; and yet one may question whether it is the archaeologist 's or historian 's business to theorize to such an extent .

		Groping in the dark of the past , perhaps the best that one could do would be to emphasize the facts so that they may be used as guide - posts hereafter .

		These hypotheses may be only card-houses to be knocked over .

		The mound upon which Troy is supposed to have rested contains three strata , each one reflective of a different stage of civilization .

		From that we have the theory that the stone-age man of the first stratum was the lineal ancestor of the bronze-age Trojan of the third stratum .

		Let us see how it might have been .

		The city of
St. Louis	LOCATION	is destroyed by earthquake , buried , forgotten .

		Two thousand years hence it is dug up by archaeologists .

		They find three strata , showing remains of three different peoples .

		They first dig out the remains of a thirteen - story building , then a log hut , and under all they find mound-builders ' pottery .


Ergo	ORGANIZATION	, the present people of
St. Louis	LOCATION	must have evolved from their ancestors the Mound Builders !

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143
M. Perrot	PERSON	, of course , draws no such absurd conclusion ; but one feels at times as though he had not given enough weight to the possi - bilities of invading and conquering hosts , and of the Greek people being formed not from any one race but from many races mingled .

		The 2Egean swarmed with all sorts of adven - turers in Mycenian days .

		Tribes came and went ; settlements were made , conquered , and re-made ; and who were the ancestors of the Greeks , we do not yet know .

		There is no cor - roborative evidence that the buildings , orna - ments , vases , and other remains that have been found at Troy and elsewhere , are Greek , except in some passages from the epic of Homer a record itself to be proven .

		There is not a line or scratch of writing , on clay or wall or stone , to indicate a Greek people .

		The only evidence lies in the remains themselves .

		It is true , these differ from all relics we now know of as being found on the shores of the eastern
Mediterra	LOCATION	- nean ; yet they have an affinity with oriental art that suggests the possibility of their pro- duction by a now-forgotten race that was not Greek at all .

		Again , the Mycenian pottery might have been only a commercial ware hawked about the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	by traders .

		It is found elsewhere than at Troy and My - cenae ; and when the diggings in
Phoenicia	LOCATION	equal those at
Mycenae	LOCATION	, it may be found in as large quantities .

		As for
Schliemann	PERSON	and his discov - eries , he rendered great service to archaeology by his excavations , but his theory was formed before he began to dig .

		He started out to find Troy and Agamemnon 's tomb , and he found them .

		Had he been seeking
Aladdin	ORGANIZATION	's lamp he would have found it in the first junk-shop of the
Mouski	LOCATION	.

		But
M. Perrot	PERSON	is not dogmatic in his theory .

		These volumes are really an elaborate and learned discussion of the question ; and if , finally , the leaning is toward
Schliemann	PERSON	's con - clusions , it is not an arbitrary bias .

		If the value of the theory can be questioned , the manner in which it is put forth can not .

		The critical and historical spirit pervades the discussion , and the truth is sought for .

		Aside from this the - ory , there is little to question or find fault with in the work .

		The opening chapter , on the country , is a close study of geography , soil , cli - mate , and all that , by a man who knows his
Greece	LOCATION	almost as well as he does his
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Greek genius is not accounted for except by saying that it can not be accounted for , and
M. Perrot	PERSON	accepts the Aryan theory of the Greeks populating
Greece	LOCATION	by land and by sea from the
East	LOCATION	.

		At the same time he thinks that '' until proof is shown to the contrary , we are bound to recognize in the folk who fashioned them -LSB- stone implements found in
Greece	LOCATION	-RSB- the direct ancestors of the Greeks of history . ''

		In other words ,
Greece	LOCATION	had its stone age , and stumbled up through ages of bronze and iron to Periclean splendor , notwithstanding the forefathers of the race came from the
East	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps so ; but it is not yet proven .

		Once out of the land of speculation and evo - lution , and describing art-remains before him ,
M. Perrot	PERSON	becomes an archaeologist again ; and his accounts of Troy ,
Tiryns	PERSON	, and Mycena3 are as intelligent and painstaking as possible .

		He thinks the evidence is for Hissarlik being the ancient site of Troy ; and that the tombs at
Mycenae	LOCATION	are those described by
Pausanias	PERSON	.

		The domed tombs of
Attica	LOCATION	and at
Orchomenos	LOCATION	, the wall construction of the Athenian Acrop - olis , the remains found on the Greek islands , are all brought in to prove the prevalence of primitive modes of construction during the My - cenian civilization .

		The chapters on the gen - eral characteristics of Mycenian architecture , materials , gates , columns , mouldings , are ex - cellent ; and here
M. Perrot	PERSON	's collaborator ,
M. Charles Chipiez	PERSON	, comes in with restorations of the tombs and walls most ingeniously wrought out and undoubtedly correct .

		In the second volume ,
M. Perrot	PERSON	decides against
Schliemann	PERSON	's Homeric theory of tem - ples and incineration as not proven ; he does not give the origin of the architectural forms , thinks the Doric column did not come from
Egypt	LOCATION	but was evolved from the wooden struc - ture of the last Mycenian civilization , deals sen - sibly with what is left of the sculpture , paint - ing , and industrial arts including pottery , and ends with a chapter on the characteristics of the Mycenian period .

		Here at the last he returns to his theory , and finds a date for the heyday of Mycenian existence at
1500	DATE	B.C. .

		The only outside evidence that supports the date comes from
Egypt	LOCATION	a questionable record of
Egypt	LOCATION	- ian commerce with the Greeks in that early pe - riod .

		The finding of Egyptian scarabs , sherds , pastes , and glasses , on the Greek islands and the mainland , does not confirm the record , since they probably came from
Phrenicia	LOCATION	.

		The translation of this work can not be praised .

		Mr.
I. Gonino	PERSON	, who has succeeded Mr.
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	as translator of the series , has used the pruning knife '' to slightly abridge the text in those portions that are some - what tumid with padding , '' and judging from 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, his own `` tumidity '' he has not done it well .

		Moreover , though Mr.
Gonino	PERSON	may understand French he does not know how to write flexible English .

		Such sentences as these are not in - frequent : '' Nobody knows and never will know , '' '' Colored stones which pleasure the eye , '' '' We should doubtless have been justi - fied to infer , '' '' So scanty a piece of informa - tion , however , can not dispense us from devot - ing a special study , '' etc. .

		Then the pedantry of '' Hadriatic '' and '' Achylles , '' the angular - ity of '' gracility '' for slenderness , and the stu - pidity of '' When the excavator tumbled about Grecian soil , '' etc. , which might give one to understand that the excavator '' tumbled '' in - stead of the soil .

		But the book is welcome , and will live in spite of Mr.
Gonino	PERSON	's English .

		JOHN
C. VAN DYKE	ORGANIZATION	.

		HENRY OF
NAVARRE	LOCATION	.

		* On one side , biography touches the novel ; on the other , history .

		The interest may attach chiefly to the individuality of the subject and the romance of his personal development : this allies the book with fiction .

		But if the subject of the biography took strong hold of the life of his time , left his mark upon social and gov - ernmental institutions , the account of his career is naturally an intimate part of the history of his age and country .

		Henry IV .

		of
France	LOCATION	de - serves the latter method of treatment .

		His life furnishes material for more than enough cham - bering romances , it is true ; but the last twelve years of his life , filled with intense and benefi - cent activity , are more valuable to the student than all the rest , and belong to history in the best sense .

		The biographer of
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	must depend largely on the Memoirs of Sully , and it is to be regretted that Mr.
Blair	PERSON	should not have used more freely the latter part of that interesting record .

		Of his 300 pages , 204 are consumed before
Henry	PERSON	becomes King of
France	LOCATION	, 63 pages are devoted to the following nine years , and but 32 pages to the
last twelve years	DATE	of his life .

		A more detailed analysis shows 130 pages given to events and persons not essential to the understanding of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's career as here outlined ; and of the remainder , nine pages to Beam and
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's parentage and birth , twenty-one pages to his amours and * HENRY OF NAVARRE AND THE RELIGIOUS WARS .

		marital infelicities , about sixty to his military career , and sixty to miscellaneous details largely incidental or anecdotal .

		Of the last chapter , covering the most important period of the king 's career , two and one-half pages only are given to the governmental reforms for which it is fa - mous , while ten pages go to amours and details of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's second marriage , three to personal anecdotes , one to Sully , five to his '' grand de - sign , '' and three and one-half to the close of the king 's life .

		This lack of proportion is a serious defect , from whatever point of view one regards Mr.
Blair	PERSON	's work .

		Yet there is enough that is mer - itorious in it to make one wish that he had saved for a second and revised edition the typo - graphical luxury and wealth of illustration with which the publishers have equipped it .

		The style is straightforward , and in the main cor - rect , barring an occasional lapse such as '' he was said to have translated '' -LRB- p. 17 -RRB- , `` thrown in the river '' -LRB- p. 145 -RRB- , '' each -LSB-

		A few foreign barbarisms , as '' reiter '' for cavalry , '' lanz - knechts '' for lansquenets or infantry , '' ruse , '' '' croqued , '' '' gabelle , '' would have been better omitted ; and with them '' showed their hand '' and '' squabbled . ''

		Of course , like all who depend upon a few standard sources , Mr.
Blair	PERSON	often closely ap - proaches the language of one of these without using quotation-marks .

		In some instances where
Guizot	PERSON	has neglected to quote his source , Mr.
Blair	PERSON	has doubtless used the same author - ity , so that the arrangement of his matter and even the language itself resemble Guizot .

		For instance ,
Blair	PERSON	, p. 25 : ''
Montmorency	PERSON	paid the greatest attention to the discipline of his troops . ''

		Guizot , IV. , 335 : '' The same man paid the greatest attention to the discipline and good condition of his troops . ''

		Blair , p. 28 : '' The Bishop of

		Other instances are ,

Blair	PERSON	, 97 : Guizot , IV. , 392 ;
Blair	PERSON	, 103 : Guizot , IV. , 368 and 369 .

		Perhaps the free use of sources , even in the absence of quotation-marks , should be understood as a matter of course in such works as this .

		An author has a right to be judged from his own point of view .

		Mr.
Blair	PERSON	tells us that he was moved to undertake the biography of
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	by a two-years residence in Beam , together with the consideration that there was so little accessible in English on the subject , and that he has been guided only by the desire to treat impartially what has been much dis - torted by partisans .

Kitchin	PERSON	,
Baird	PERSON	's '' Rise of the Huguenots , '' etc. ; and a scholarly work sum - marizing what these and more original author - ities furnish on the life of
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		is what is really needed .

		But Mr.
Blair	PERSON	's '' Henry of
Navarre	LOCATION	'' lays no claim to scholarship .

		It cites no sources , it has not a single reference to au - thorities , it does not even make acknowledg - ment of indebtedness to the writers from whom the author has evidently drawn .

		Dates are not , indeed , an infallible mark of erudition , and we could dispense with a portion of them in many excellent works , but it is a bold innovation to omit them altogether .

		There are but three in this record of fifty years where events often lap and the narrator has occasion to reach ahead or turn back several years .

		Even in a popular work , such as this is intended to be `` a brief description of one of the most interesting char - acters and periods in French history , '' - a moderate use of at least marginal dates , and a short list of standard authorities , would have been decidedly helpful .

		Looked at as a popular narrative which pre - sumes some knowledge of the period , Mr.
Blair	PERSON	's work takes on a more favorable aspect .

		The elegant typography and the numerous illustra - tions constitute larger factors of the whole , and the tendency to piquancy is more pardonable .

		Yet here , too , there are serious defects .

		Often much is taken for granted .

		A personage ap - pears in action or reference , only to be formally introduced some pages later , or not at all .

		Per - sonages of the same name are not distinguished with enough care , and the same person is some - times referred to by different names without being identified .

		Thus
Maximilien de Bethune	PERSON	, baron de Rosny , due de Sully , first appears un - announced on page 127 : '' When Sully went to
Henry III	ORGANIZATION	.

		to conclude an alliance between him and the
King of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	'' ; while the next reference to him is 011 page 143 : '' Even grave puritans like
Rosny	PERSON	, afterwards Duke of Sully . ''

		This is not calculated to enlighten us , but the contrary ; for as he was only '' afterwards Duke of Sully , '' how could the Sully of the previous reference be the same ?

		Throughout , the great minister is called , now
Rosny	ORGANIZATION	, now Sully , now '' Rosny afterwards Duke of Sully . ''

		So also with the
Duke of Anjou	ORGANIZATION	, who is three different personages in the pages of the book , and , even when
Henry III	ORGANIZATION	.

		is meant , is not identified , especially on page 122 , where he is referred to as King of
Poland	LOCATION	, and in the next breath as
Anjou	LOCATION	, without any hint of how
Anjou	LOCATION	came to be king of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		Similar is the allusion to the '' Seize , '' p. 214 .

		Perhaps no precau - tions could prevent some confusion in the case of the numerous representatives of the Guise family ; but here , as elsewhere , a freer use of baptismal names in connection with the title would have helped matters .

		Mr.
Blair	PERSON	has been impressed with the dif - ficulty of giving an unprejudiced view of the massacre of
St. Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	, and he has an evident desire to be fair .

		His epitome of the origin of the dreadful affair as '' the accidental result of a conspiracy directed against the ad - miral , rather than an organized effort to exter - minate the Protestants '' -LRB- p. 112 -RRB- , is undoubt - edly correct of the situation preceding the first attempt on
Coligny	ORGANIZATION	's life , but after that a greater guilt was assumed by
Catherine	PERSON	and her sons .

		However little they may have fore - seen or intended the ultimate results , the bur - den of infamy remaining upon them is great enough to justify the perpetual execrations of mankind .

		It would be interesting to know where Mr.
Blair	PERSON	finds the evidence that '' Prot - estant historians have agreed to pillory her -LSB-
Catherine	PERSON	-RSB- for the benefit of posterity '' -LRB- p. 39 -RRB- .

		It may be true that a certain class of Sunday-School library books overdraw her 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	guilt ; but is there a standard historian who does not present the same view as Mr.
Blair	PERSON	?

		Guizot ,
Duruy	ORGANIZATION	,
Kitchin	PERSON	,
Baird	PERSON	,
Steven	PERSON	, as well as the contemporaries
Henry III	ORGANIZATION	.

		and Sal - viati , the papal nuncio , are in general accord with Mr.
Blair	PERSON	.

		It does not seem that his charge of a conspiracy to blacken
Catherine	PERSON	's character is justified .

		Aspersions like this , and that on page 85 , '' Protestant historians pre - tend to see in all this a deep-laid scheme to de - lude the Huguenots into a sense of security , '' ought to be supported by evidence .

		There is enough of value in Mr.
Blair	PERSON	's work to make one regret profoundly that he should not have deliberated longer , and received more criticism , before printing in such sumptuous form .

		As in the case of the text , so with the fifty or more half-tone prints and photogravures accompanying it : most readers would be grat - ified to know the source and the artist of the originals .


W. H. CARRUTH	PERSON	.

		A NEW ENGLAND The conscience of
New England	LOCATION	a half cen - tury ago demanded much of its votaries and adherents .

		The limitations which it set about human intelligence and activity were many and certain .

		Its intense assurance of its own com - pleteness and rectitude had its incommodities as well as its insights and rewards .

		To those who could acquiesce in its demands , it opened avenues to spiritual heights whence the out - look was large and superb , though the air might be somewhat thin for the health of daily life .

		At last , however , the burdens it imposed be - came too severe for a generation alive to much that was outside of its enclosed space , and the revolt began .

		It seems that valuable literatures usually be - gin with such revolts , and the stronger spirits , after considerable effort and some suffering , throw off the fetters no longer endurable , and rejoice in the larger freedom which they have won .

		There are always , however , sensitive souls who feel that they must break with the tradi - tions , but can not find themselves wholly at home in the new and strange .

		Among the lat - ter must be counted such writers as
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	, as well as the

		doubtless receive a recognition which has thus far been denied them .

		What has been done for
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	will assuredly be done for him , and the result is no more doubtful in his case than it has proved in hers .

		Miss
Dickinson	PERSON	's letters make an admirable complement to her poems .

		In her early years she was a copious correspondent , and during her school-days she had a great reputation as a writer of long , and , as we can readily surmise , singularly original compositions .

		The change in her epistolary style , with her growth in years and experience , is worthy of notice .

		The dif - fuse and minute letter - writing becomes con - densed to a remarkable degree , epigrammatic , and mystical .

		Her correspondents were many , and include such names as Dr.
Holland	PERSON	,
Sam	PERSON	- uel
Bowles	PERSON	,
Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	, and , of course , Mrs.
Todd	PERSON	, the devoted editor of these '' Letters , '' and her guide and mentor ,
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	.

		Not quite able to avail herself of the wider scope which the
New England	LOCATION	revolt was dis - closing to her , and incapable of satisfaction with the creeds and moods in which she had been brought up ,
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	retired into herself , and found solace and serenity in her vivid apprehensions of the truth , and the man - ifestations of that truth in Nature , which be - came to her a symbol easily read and trans - parent to the meaning which it contained .

		Her correspondence is replete with a gay and deli - cate humor ; the recluse was full of wit and of gentle happiness with her friends .

		Perhaps she did not take herself and her abandonment of the world with too much seriousness ; prob - ably she saw something of its humorous aspect , and would gladly enough have had the strength to share the generous life outside ; the effort , doubtless , was too great , and the sympathetic appreciation not sufficiently vigorous and in - sistent .

		The letters are free from that strain of morbidness which we sometimes find in her poems , especially in those dealing with the subject of death and its dark accompaniments .

		Here we have such exquisite passages as this : '' The bed on which he came was enclosed in a large casket , shut entirely , and covered from head to foot with the sweetest flowers .

		He went to sleep from the village church .

		Crowds came to tell him good night , choirs sang to him , pastors told how brave he was early-soldier heart .

		And the family lowered their heads , as the reeds the wind shakes . ''

		As the introspective habit grew upon her , every incident of a life simple and unvarying in the extreme became touched with an illu - mination that her thoughts and mood poured

		Here is a letter entire : '' The little package of

		Take all away from me But leave me ecstasy , And I am richer then Than all my fellow-men .

		Is it becoming me To dwell so wealthily , When at my very door Are those possessing more , In boundless poverty ? ''

		Mrs.
Todd	PERSON	says : '' It is impossible to con - ceive that any sense of personal isolation , or real loneliness of spirit , because of the absence of humanity from her daily life , could have op - pressed a nature so richly endowed . ''

		And again : ''
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	's method of living was so simple and natural an outcome of her increasingly shy nature , a development so per - fectly in the line of her whole constitution , that no far-away and dramatic explanation of her quiet life is necessary to those who are capable of apprehending her . ''

		Notwithstanding the authoritative source from which this statement comes , many readers will hold a different opin - ion .

		No doubt the adjustment of
Emily Dick	PERSON	- inson to her environment grew in difficulty , and , as often happens in such cases , the effective help was not at hand .

		The extent of her cor - respondence , and the character of much of it , indicate how deeply she felt the need and how warmly she would have welcomed the possibil - ity of closer relations with her fellows .

		The nun and the saint make a figure delicate and unique ; but the poet with something real to say to mankind deserves our larger apprecia - tion -

		STUDIES IN MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT .

		* One of the most exceedingly live '' questions of the day '' the pressing and often distressing prob - lem of municipal government is treated in some of its more salient phrases in four interesting books of recent publication .

		The city is the form which society is inceasingly assuming .

		The rural mode of life , once so controlling of all social facts , is more and more sinking to a secondary place .

		When the war of the American Revolution ended , only about three per cent of our people lived in what might be called cities ; and the metropolis ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, was a town of only some forty thousand inhabitants .

		In fact , in the modern sense
America	LOCATION	had no cities at that time .

		The great bulk of the people lived in little villages or on solitary farms .

		To-day nearly a third of the population of the
United States	LOCATION	is found in cities of over eight thousand inhabitants , and ten per cent live in the four cities of
New York	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		And the rela - tive preponderance of the cities is steadily increas - ing .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	this proportion is yet more striking - To-day about three-fourths of the people of
Scot	PERSON	- land are townspeople , as against one-fourth at the opening of the present century .

		In
England	LOCATION	one - third of the whole population is in towns of over one hundred thousand inhabitants , and nearly another third in towns of from ten thousand to one hundred thousand .

		In
France	LOCATION	, the town population is about a third ; in
Germany	LOCATION	, fully two-fifths .

		And in all these countries as well as in every other European state , the population of towns and cities is increas - ing much more rapidly than is that of the rural districts .

		These simple facts are exceedingly significant .

		They show that the modern form of life is distinc - tively urban .

		And they at once explain why it is that the important questions relating to the admin - istration of cities have only very recently emerged into the public consciousness .

		But we in the
United States	LOCATION	have suddenly found that we are confronted in the management of municipal affairs with diffi - * MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT IN GREAT

George H. Richmond & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, culties which threaten our prosperity , our comfort , our safety , and our dignity , far more than is the case with any matters of national policy .

		The pub - lic debt of the
United States	LOCATION	in
1894	DATE	was
$ 12.57	MONEY	per capita .

		The public debt of the city of
New York	LOCATION	at the same time was about
$ 70	MONEY	per capita .

		In the palmiest days of the spoils system in the civil service of the
United States	LOCATION	, the worst condition of things was purity itself in comparison with the rot - tenness of
New York	LOCATION	under Tweed or Croker .

		For these and many other reasons , it is getting to be a matter of very great importance that the various questions involved in the social problem which we call the city should be clearly understood .

		Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	has given us an exhaustive study of British municipalities .

		He sketches their devel - opment , especially in recent times , analyzes the methods and principles of the municipal code , and then exhibits the working of these methods by de - tailed accounts of typical cities
Glasgow	LOCATION	, Man - chester ,
Birmingham	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		There is a valuable closing chapter on metropolitan tasks and problems , and the appendix contains the English municipal code , with some other interesting material .

		The work is done very thoroughly , and the subject is treated with that breadth of view and fulness of knowledge which we have learned to expect from this writer .

		In studying these British cities , one is struck with two things : the number of services undertaken by the municipal authorities , and the business-like effi - ciency with which the public business is transacted .

		The former is quite socialistic , the latter is decid - edly un-American .

		It has been said that the test of the value of any system of city government is what it does for the people , how well it is done , and what it costs .

		Tried by these standards , the gov - ernment of
Glasgow	LOCATION	, for instance , shows some strik - ing contrasts with conditions sufficiently familiar here .

		That city has undertaken some services which we either leave undone or relegate to private enter - prise .

		A sanitary wash-house cleanses and disin - fects clothing , carpets , and the like , from any dwell - ing in which a case of contagious disease occurs .

		And while any such dwelling is undergoing disin - fection , a poor family may have quarters in a public lodging-house provided for that purpose .

		The city '' pest-house '' in our country is usually a loathsome place , and people are quite apt to conceal contagious cases in order to save the patient from the horrors , real or imagined , of the hospital .


Glasgow	LOCATION	, in lieu of a pest-house , has an estate of thirty acres , in which a series of pleasant cottages afford the great - est comfort for both patients and nurses .

		The ac - commodations are so pleasant , and so far beyond what could be had at home , that instead of hiding a case of contagion the friends are eager to give no - tice of it .

		And this way of doing things turns out to be good policy .

		Epidemics in
Glasgow	LOCATION	are easily kept under control .

		The city also provides com - modious public baths , which charge a nominal fee .

		The average number of bathers is fifteen hundred a day , and the results to the public health and comfort can easily be conjectured .

		Public wash-houses enable a woman for
two pence	MONEY	an hour to use the latest and most effective appliances , and within that time easily to complete a family washing .

		The gas supply and the water supply both belong to the city .

		The price of gas has been grad - ually reduced from
$ 1.14	MONEY	, the price charged prior to the transfer to the city , to the present rate of
sixty cents	MONEY	per thousand feet .

		And at the same time the works have been extended and improved , and an ample sinking-fund provided which will pay off the debt incurred in the purchase when it falls due .

		The street railways are owned and operated by the city .

		Originally , the city built the lines and leased their use to a private company for a series of years , on terms exceedingly favorable to the public .

		When the lease expired , in
1894	DATE	, the city decided there - after to operate the lines on its own account .

		It has been able , in doing this , to provide a rate of fares of
one cent	MONEY	per half-mile in the crowded part of the city , with longer runs for
two cents	MONEY	; and at the same time to reduce materially the hours of em - ployees .

		These and other public undertakings in
Glasgow	LOCATION	Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	thinks are managed with great economy and efficiency .

		The first question , perhaps , which occurs to an American is : Can not the same things be done here ?

		But the answer will suggest itself quite as promptly : No , it is utterly out of the question .

		To enlarge the services of our American municipality to take on the gas supply , to run the street-car system as the property of the city would merely mean so many more '' jobs '' for political adventurers .

		We are sufficiently familiar now with a police force which is run for the benefit of ward heelers and thugs .

		Imagine Tammany methods applied to the selection of street-car conductors !

		Imagine '' fine work '' at the primaries rewarded with a place as motorman on a grip-car !

		In short , the question whether it is or is not good policy for the commun - ity to undertake further duties for the general wel - fare , is simply not a question at all under existing conditions .

		It is a waste of time to discuss it .

		When we have learned how to get our present mu - nicipal machinery out of the hands of the corrupt gang who have so deeply disgraced the American name in every one of our leading cities , then , and not until then , will be time to think of other uses for the machinery .

		Another striking contrast which Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's pages suggest is the relative economy and efficiency of the English system as compared with the enormous waste and poor results in
America	LOCATION	.

		Is republican - ism a failure ?

		Are Americans lacking in political ability ?

		Has the greed for wealth absorbed our public spirit ?

		We shall hardly answer these ques - tions in the affirmative .

		The triumphs of the repub - lic in securing and maintaining public order have been too great for us to admit that the nation which
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 created the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, which has been made stronger by rebellion and richer in spite of the vast destruction of property caused by war and eman - cipation , is not able to grapple with almost any diffi - culties .

		Democracy , we have learned , sometimes is very sluggish at getting an idea into its head ; but when the idea once gets there it never gets out .

		We shall get the municipal idea in time .

		The form of government of British cities is rad - ically different from that to which the present ten - dency in this country is giving shape .

		In
Great Britain	LOCATION	the mayor is little more than a figure-head .

		All power is wielded by an elective council .

		Here , experience leads us to place no expei'ience whatever in a city council , but to vest enormous power , to - gether with full responsibility , in the mayor .

		Cur - iously enough , our democracy is leading to a consti - tutional Caesarism in city affairs .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	thinks that we might with profit adopt the European method .

		Perhaps so .

		But it would be squarely against the current of our political experience and our political thinking .

		We set out a hundred years ago with a buoyant belief in the entire sufficiency of a representative legislature .

		We had been able to rid ourselves of a king , and of his detestable myrmidons , the col - onial governors .

		We were free .

		And with our
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and our legislature , we expected to be happy .

		But the student of American institutions is confronted with no more obtrusive fact than the steady growth of distrust in our legislative bodies .

		Power after power has been shorn from them .

		It has been learned that they are repositories of neither wisdom nor integrity .

		And the people have learned , after all , to depend on the executive for protection .

		Accordingly the governors of our states have been more and more entrusted with checks on the legis - lative branch .

		And in like manner the common councils of our cities have had their functions in large part transferred to the mayor .

		In
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia , in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, in
New York	LOCATION	, responsibility has been centred in the executive .

		And now the same thing , already largely embodied in the general stat - ute of
Illinois	LOCATION	, is proposed to be carried to its log - ical end in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		If the bill of the
Civic Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration becomes law , the common council will be - come an innocuous body .

		The reason for this peculiar tendency in our American democracy is plain enough .

		For corrupt or incompetent action by the city council , it is im - practicable to decide whom to hold accountable .

		One might as well try to tip over a sand hill with a pistol bullet .

		But if the mayor has the power to make things right , and things are wrong , everybody knows who is at fault .

		There is another ground for considering the American plan as , on the whole , better than the English .

		City government is mainly administrative business , and for administration , a single head is much better than many heads .

		It is just as in the management of an army .

		One poor general , in - vested with the supreme command , is much more likely to succeed than several good officers with co - ordinate authority .

		Everybody 's business is no - body 's business .

		Two heads may be better than one for deliberation ; they are much worse than one for action .

		English democracy is at just about the point we had reached a hundred years ago .

		Wait until in
England	LOCATION	the slums vote and '' the machine '' becomes a power .

		Committees , councils , and om - nipotent parliaments will be less in favor then .

		Of course , municipal reform can not be secured by tink - ering with charters .

		The personal equation can never be disregarded .

		The main question must al - ways be , how to secure for the public service men of high character .

		But that is hopeless , for any length of time while the spoils system is allowed to remain , while it is possible for an irresponsible many-headed body like a city council to bestow franchises and contracts , and while membership in such a body consumes a large amount of time .

		There should be two classes of city officials ex - perts , who give their whole time to their public du - ties , who have safe tenure and are well paid ; and overseers , who are periodically elected , have no sal - ary , are not obliged to take much time from their business , who can advise and can determine only general matters of policy .

		We have but scant space left for the other books in our group .

		Mr.
Conkling	PERSON	's volume on '' City Government in the
United States	LOCATION	'' is a very con - venient manual of the structure of American city governments .

		He analyzes the functions of a mu - nicipality , and shows how our principal cities deal with them .

		For a condensed view of these methods , nothing better can be found .

		A comparison of the British and American systems can readily be made in the pages of these two books .

		Dr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	's story of the recent fight with
Tammany	ORGANIZATION	is a discouraging thing not because it is not the record of success , but because it shows too plainly how completely the people allow their affairs to fall into the hands of scoundrels .

		It is a quarter of a century since the Tweed gang was driven from
New York	LOCATION	.

		How long will it be be - fore the Parkhurst crusade will have to be re - peated ?

		Is the party `` boss '' the vital feature of our public life ?

		So Mr.
Champernowne	PERSON	, in his trenchant essay on `` The Boss , '' implies .

		The work is a satire , in the manner of
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	's `` Prince '' very crisp and droll .

		And there can be no man - ner of doubt that it is the perfect organization and ready obedience of Tammany Hall that made Tweed and Croker so potent for evil .

		But perhaps we can learn something from
Tammany	LOCATION	.

		Definite and permanent organization for honest municipal pur - poses , quite irrespective of high tariff or free silver , may do as much to secure a real reform as it has done to fill the pockets of blackmailers and swind - ling contractors .

March 1	DATE	, RECENT ENGLISH POETRY .

		* The opening piece in Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's '' Odes and Other Poems '' is a personal tribute to Mr.
R. H. Hutton	PERSON	, and ends with this stanza : '' And not uncrowned with honours ran My days , and not without a boast shall end !

		For I was
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's countryman ; And wert thou not my friend ? '' ''

		The Spectator '' has subsequently expressed its editorial opinion that Mr.
Watson	PERSON	is the greatest of English poets now living .

		This bit of log-roll - ing offers a very neat illustration of a familiar pas - sage in the Book of Koheleth -LRB- XI. , 1 -RRB- .

		If it were not for this and other similarly preposterous opin - ions of the poet 's ill-advised admirers , the critic might be spared the unpleasant task of pointing out the defects of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's verse , and be con - tent with dwelling upon its many admirable quali - ties .

		But the fact that any considerable number of persons are capable of speaking and writing with '' The Spectator 's '' utter lack of the sense of per - spective , the fact that Mr.
Watson	PERSON	has been seri - ously put forward as a possible successor to the laurel-wreath of .

		Tennyson , although such men as Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	and Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	are still alive , compels a very pointed direction of the atten - tion to his shortcomings first of all , to the intol - erable self-consciousness that pervades a large part of his verse , then to the trivial and commonplace char - acter of much of his material , to the frequent met - rical blemishes , and to the elephantine gambolling which he sometimes mistakes for playfulness .

		All of these matters are illustrated in the volume before us ; the self-consciousness in a dozen places , the triviality in almost as many , the rhythmical stum - bling in such a hexameter as `` For had I not dwelt where Nature but prattled familiar and the ungraceful capering in `` A Study in Con - trasts . ''

		Having reluctantly said this much of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's failures , we turn with the more pleasure to the pages in which he appears as his nobler and better self , to the pages in which patriotism in - spires this fine invocation to the Power that shapes the destinies of empires : '' Purge and renew this

Gosse	PERSON	is , like Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, only a minor poet , but his talent is as evident as its nurture has been delicate .

		Starting upon his poetical path as an imitator of Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne , he has gradually found a voice for himself , and the transition from `` On Viol and Flute '' to `` In Russet and Silver '' has been a passage from crudity to mellowness , from exuberance to restraint . ''

		Life , that , when youth was hot and bold , Leaped up in scarlet and in gold , Now walks , by graver hopes possessed , In russet and in silver dressed . ''

		There is a slight element of pose in the affectation of advancing years so frequently recurrent in this sheaf of songs for the author is not so very aged , after all and the mine dimittis strain does not fit very well with the abundant vitality we know him still to possess .

		But assuming , for the nonce , the standpoint which we can not help thinking to have been unduly anticipated , we must say that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	sings with exceptional grace of the moods and mem - ories of old age . ''

		In youth our fiery lips were fed With fruit in lavish waste ; We watch it now hung o'er our head , And , now , at length can taste . ''

		The boisterous pleasures of the boy Their own deep rapture steal ; I ask no longer to enjoy , But ah !

		to muse and feel . ''

		Such charming discourse de senectute might be mul - tiplied indefinitely from these pages , but we must turn to the more objective aspects of the volume .

		Sympathy for others , particularly for those '' in dis - grace with fortune and men 's eyes , '' is always a mark of the true poet , and we find it in plentiful measure here .

		How deep is this note in such a poem as '' Neurasthsenia , '' with its compassionate sense of the way in which some hapless lives are warped from the very hour of birth . ''

		Curs 'd from the cradle and awry they come , Masking their torment from a world at ease ; On eyes of dark entreaty , vague and dumb , They bear the stigma of their souls ' disease .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 151 41 Bewildered by the shadowy ban of birth , They learn that they are not as others are , Till some go mad , and some sink , prone to earth , And some push stumbling on without a star ; '' And some , of sterner mould , set hard their hearts , To act the dreadful comedy of life , And wearily grow perfect in their parts ; But all are wretched and their years are strife . ''

		The figures of the flaming torch handed on from runner to runner , and of the sacred flame kept alight by successive ministrants , have always been favorite symbols with the poets who have sought to sing of the sacredness of their art .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's `` Alere Flammam '' is the latest of a long line of lyrics upon these themes , and by no means the least beau - tiful .

		We quote the last two of the four stanzas : '' Ah !

		so , untouched by windy roar Of public issues loud and long , The Poet holds the sacred door , And guards the glowing coal of song ; Not his to grasp at praise or blame , Red gold , or crown beneath the sun , His only pride to tend the flame That Homer and that
Virgil	PERSON	won , Retain the rite , preserve the act , And pass the worship on intact . ''

		Before the shrine at last he falls ; The crowd rush in , a chattering band ; But , ere he fades in death , he calls Another priest to ward the brand ; He , with a gesture of disdain , Flings back the ringing brazen gate , Reproves , repressing , the profane , And feeds the flame in primal state ; Content to toil and fade in turn If still the sacred embers burn . ''

		The section of `` Memorial Verses '' offers some of the best recent examples of this class of work .

		`` In Poet 's Corner , '' for example , gives us this tribute to Tennyson : '' Thanks for the music that through thirty years Quicken 'd my pulse to tears , The eye that colour ' d nature , the wise hand , The brain that nobly plann 'd ; Thanks for the anguish of the perfect phrase , Tingling the blood ablaze !

		Organ of God , with multitudinous swell Of various tone , farewell ! ''

		Even more beautiful are the tributes to
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Banville	PERSON	, and
Leconte de Lisle	ORGANIZATION	.

		As for ''
Beatrice	PERSON	, '' it is a gem of purest ray serene . ''

		Thro '
Dante	PERSON	's hands , in dreamy vigil clasp 'd A pale green bud shot skyward from the sod ; He bowed and sighed ; then laid the prize he grasp 'd , A folded lily , at the feet of God . ''

		There she has slowly open 'd , age by age , And grown a star to light Man 's heart to heaven ; Her perfume his divinest heritage , Her love the noblest gift God 's self hath given . ''

		A volume of such high average excellence as this tempts to quotation , but space fails for more than has been given .

		We must , however , mention the translations from the Swedish of Rosenhare ,
Wex	PERSON	- ionius , and Stagnelius , and from the Dutch of Hooft and
Vondel	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume closes with '' The Masque of Painters , '' performed in
1885	DATE	, and richly deserving of preservation in this collection .

		Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	's `` Ballads and Songs , '' with their daring originality and their turbulent energy , present the greatest possible contrast to the finished and academic verse of .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	.

		Of the half - do/en ballads grouped together in the forefront of the volume it is impossible to give any adequate notion by means of extracts .

		They are novel in conception , and their imagery is as striking as any that even Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has conceived .

		We are not quite sure that we understand them , but of their curious and unexpected impressiveness there can be no doubt .

		We must for the present be content to represent the author by a poem more nearly con - ventional than the intensely dramatic ballads , yet a poem that bears no less the sign and seal of his marked individuality .

		It is a set of three stanzas on ''
London	LOCATION	. '' ''

		Athwart the sky a lowly sigh From west to east the sweet wind carried ; The sun stood still on Primrose Hill ; His light in all the city tarried : The clouds on viewless columns bloomed Like smouldering lilies unconsumed .

		`` Oh sweetheart , see !

		how shadowy , Of some occult magician 's rearing Or swung in space of heaven 's grace Dissolving , dimly reappearing , Afloat upon ethereal tides St.
Paul	PERSON	's above the city rides ! ''

		A rumour broke through the thin smoke Enwreathing abbey , tower , and palace , The parks , the squares , the thoroughfares , The million-peopled lanes and alleys , An ever-muttering prisoned storm , The heart of
London	LOCATION	beating warm . ''

		It would be both interesting and instructive to com - pare these verses with those upon the same theme recently given us by Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	and Mr.
W. E. Henley	PERSON	. ''

		A Book of Song , '' by Mr.
Julian Sturgis	PERSON	, in - cludes verses of many years , written rather for per - sonal satisfaction than in view of public applause .

		But their quality is so good , in spite of their unpre - tentiousness , that we are not willing to accept , with - out a word of commendation , the author 's invita - tion '' to remark that all alike are childish , and so pass on to a more worthy prey . '' ''

		Whence ? ''

		is a good example of Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	's work . ''

		Will he come to us out of the West With hair all blowing free ?

		Will he come , the last and best , Over the flowing sea , Prophet of days to be ? ''

		Aye , he will come ; the unseen choir Attend his steps with song , And on his breast a deep-toned lyre , And on his lips a word like fire To burn the ancient wrong . ''

		Bay-crowned and goodlier than a king , With voice both strong and sweet The song of ^ freedom he will sing , And I from out the crowd shall fling My rose-wreath at his feet . ''

		152 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, We wish , indeed , that Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	had heen less exclusive in selecting the pieces for this volume .

		We are sure that some of the songs from his under - graduate days , '' of a complexion sad as night , '' would have been equally acceptable with these now given , '' for in those singing days of the reed voice ` twixt man and boy the subtlest , saddest pleasure may be drawn from converse now and then with our good comrade Melancholy .

		Together we take the road , and in these mornings of our wayfaring a face once seen in the passing crowd , or the mere amorous air of fleeting
Spring	DATE	, may set us throbbing with a song of love . ''

		An unpretentious and exquisite talent , not unlike that of the author just named , is displayed by Mr.
Auberon Herbert	PERSON	in his '' Windfall and Water - drift . ''

		Here are nearly two hundred lyrics few of them exceeding eight lines all marked by refine - ment and delicate susceptibility .

		For example : '' The sea is at rest for the storms are o'er Just touched with the hand of
night	TIME	; And a line of shadow creeps to the shore , Then flashes in silver light , '' Like a note that stoops in its flight , and droops , And clings for a while to the ground , Then trembles , and wakes from its trance , and breaks Into passion and glory of sound . ''

		It is a welcome surprise to find a poet in the apos - tle of voluntary taxation .

		We will close these notes upon a six months ' sheaf of English poetry with a word for Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
Akerman	PERSON	's blank-verse tragedy , '' The Cross of Sorrow . ''

		This poem is a dramatization , after the Elizabethan model , of '' Le Mariage de Ven - geance '' in Le Sage 's ''
Gil Bias	PERSON	. ''

		The author has caught no little of the Elizabethan trick of diction , as the following passage , one of the best in the play , will show : '' There are men still live whose lives are like the light That flashes from the topmost lighthouse tower , And comes the sea of sorrow up in arms It can not shake the rock , their soul 's foundation .

		With calm eyes looking out into the
night	TIME	, Watching the world 's wild tempest whistling by , They light the lamp that hails the mariner Who , struggling on with his disabled barque Through mist and tempest findeth a new-born hope , And steers his fragile vessel home again Into a place of safety .

		Lonely the heights That make their dwelling , yet their solitude Is mightier than the state that hems about The palaces of kings and emperors ; And when the crack of doom falls out of
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, When the last tempest overtopples them , The world weeps tears of immortal sorrow For the light that shines no more ! ''

		The structure of Mr.
Akerman	PERSON	's drama was made for him , so to speak , by Le Sage , but considerable skill is displayed in the arrangement of scenes , and the work is one to read with pleasure .

		The Neo - Elizabethan drama is not a form of composition likely in our time to attract many readers , but , as the author observes , '' the fashion of to-day is not necessarily the fashion of to-morrow , '' and every poet should be more concerned to find and work in his own element than to accept the trammels of some other merely because that other element hap - pens to be in vogue .

		Miss
May Kendall	PERSON	is one of the most charming among contemporary writers of light verse ; and her new volume , while possibly not quite equal in exe - cution to her `` Dreams to Sell , '' is full of pleasing and pathetic fancies .

		`` A Fossil '' offers a good ex - ample of her delicate touch . ''

		He had his Thirty-nine Articles , And his Nicene Creed , And his Athanasian .

		Nothing else He appeared to need .

		He looked like a walking dogma , pent Neath a shovel brim ; If he never knew what the dogma meant , ' Twas small blame to him . ''

		He did not hazard a single guess , That might lead to twain , Whose answers never would coalesce In a peaceful brain !

		He seemed pure fossil : yet I protest That across the aisle I one day saw him of life possessed For a little while ! ''

		` And streams in the desert , ' sang the choir .

		What a strange surmise Just then awoke , like a smouldering fire , In his weary eyes !

		That never came from the Nicene Creed 'T was a dream , I know , Of some fair day when he lived indeed , In the long ago ! ''

		There is a suggestion of the whimsical in the piece just quoted , although the main purport is serious enough .

		And the whimsical is the element in which Miss
Kendall	PERSON	does her most characteristic work , as might be amply illustrated , had we the needed space . ''

		The Fatal Advertisements , '' for example , is as de - licious a bit of semi-scientific whimsicality as is often seen .

		And the scientific doctrine of the dissipation of energy is very neatly set forth in '' Ether Insatia - ble , '' of which poem we may reproduce two out of four stanzas : '' There is not a hushed malediction , There is not a smile or a sigh , But aids in dispersing , by friction , The cosmical heat in the sky ; And whether a star falls , or whether A heart breaks for stars and for men Their labour is all for the ether That renders back nothing again .

		`` And we , howsoever we hated And feared , or made love , or believed , For all the opinions we stated , The woes and the wars we achieved , We , too , shall lie idle together , In very uncritical case And no one will win but the ether , That fills circumambient space ! ''

		That the writer can , if she chooses , be entirely se - rious , is witnessed by the group of graceful pieces that close the volume , and one of which , '' Forgive - ness , '' shall close our selections .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 153 ' Life is not utterly amiss .

		` Twould be ungracious to despair , I fancy , on a day like this , In such a free , soft air , One ceases to climb fast .

		Ah well !

		There 's a
spring	DATE	day before , my dear I 'll show you where the asphodel Grew on the moor last year . '

		We bear no proud victorious sheaf , We have no ' Harvest Home ' to raise And yet perhaps a withered leaf May sometimes give God praise , As through its failing being run Old thrills of earth and wind and rain , Before it passes to be one With wind and earth again .

		And yet , not utterly in vain We bore the burden and the heat , We shared the sacrament of pain Altar where all men meet !

		And now awhile have peace , nor grieve , Here in the moorland 's joyous breath Until our erring souls receive The sacrament of Death ! ''

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The judicious reader of Miss Rep - Peer 's In the Dozy Hours '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton ,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will , we believe , be just a little disappointed , and that on the whole very pleasantly .

		Her latest volume of essays does not lack the cleverness and distinction which marked ' Essays in Idleness , '' for instance , but there is one thing about this book which was not so obvious in that .

		Some may , perhaps , regret that Miss Rep - plier thinks fit to give her work a practical turn .

		It would certainly be rather sad if this pleasing essayist should ever , by any chance , lose herself in the turbulent chaos of nowaday life , so far as to try to settle burning questions and timely problems , or to handle current topics or present phases of thought .

		These are good things for some people to write about , but probably Miss Repplier does well to give them a wide berth .

		Still , it is a pity to re - main entirely apart from what really interests a good many people , and it is with great pleasure , therefore , that we perceive in this book not a little good common-sense on some matters of contem - porary moment which are too often engrossed by persons somewhat lacking in that excellent quality .

		The touch is light , of course , and there is not a lit - tle humor ; but there is good sense at bottom .

		There are many worthy people at the present day who might gain great advantage from a perusal of this work .

		The essay on '' Lectures '' would be a good preface to every
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	course .

		That on '' Opinions '' should lie within easy reach of those misguided multitudes that read the newspapers for anything but news . ''

		Pastels '' might well be learned by heart -LRB- it is short -RRB- by very many members of literary societies , provided they could apply it to other matters , germane to the subject .

		We our - selves feel that `` Aut Caesar , aut Nihil '' and `` A Curious Contention '' contain many words of wis - dom ; but , being masculine , we may be prejudiced . ''

		In the
Dozy Hours	ORGANIZATION	, '' despite its misleading title , seems to indicate a real accession to the saving remnant which still maintains the good cause against the armies of folly .

		It is a pleasure to add that , beside the contributions above noted , there is much in the volume which will probably serve no good purpose whatever , except that of giving enjoyment .

		Also there are some interesting details about
Agrip	PERSON	- pina 's Kitten , whose name is Nero .

		Side glimpses of the
Colonial Cavalier	ORGANIZATION	.

		Alon g wi ^ h the current of books on the Colonial Puritan , comes a timely Qne by
Migg Mau	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- j WIlder Qoodwin on `` The Colonial Cavalier '' -LRB-
Lovell	ORGANIZATION	,
Coryell , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		More picturesque , if less exemplary , than his mortified brethren to the north of him , and an element of weight and permanence in the compo - sition of Anglo-American character , the `` Cava - lier '' deserves serious and honest portrayal ; and such , within the modest scope and space-limits of her little book , the author has tried to give him .

		She has scanned the authorities with care , and with a commendable view of digesting her gleanings therefrom into a literary product of her own ; hence her book is no mere work of scissors and paste-pot .

		Miss
Goodwin	PERSON	has not drawn her hero from his too-florid image in the glass of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	tradition as a fancied fine gentleman all lace and ruffles , powder and sword-knot , who drank , swaggered , and gambled , and comported himself generally on his James River '' estate '' and at
Williamsburg	LOCATION	much as his prototype had done at
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	and
St James 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		There was undoubtedly in the horse jock - eying , rough-riding , free-handed
Virginia	LOCATION	tobacco - farmer , or squirelet , with his fine manners and his Tory traditions , some touch of the qualities with which the imagination of his descendants has gilded him .

		His abundant leisure , procured him by the abundant toil of his sable '' retainers , '' allowed him to cultivate graces to which the rugged and labo - rious New Englander was long perforce a stranger .

		But there was a hint of pinchbeck about it all .

		Says
John Randolph	PERSON	: '' Nowhere could be found a school of more genial and simple courtesy than that which produced the great men and women of Vir - ginia , but it had its dangers and affectations ; it was often provincial and sometimes absurd . ''

		To our notion ,
Virginia	LOCATION	'' chivalry '' never shone so genuinely as in the dark days when the stress of the Civil War had stripped away its tinsel .

		Rising with his reverses , the '' Cavalier '' showed himself a true cavalier .

		Take , for example , worthy , im - poverished
Colonel Dabney	PERSON	, who , learning -LRB- from some strange source -RRB- that General
Sherman	PERSON	pro- posed to '' bring every Southern woman to the wash - tub , '' gallantly responded : `` He shall never bring my daughters to the wash-tub ; / will do the wash - ing myself ! ''

		and for two years he suited action to word , scrubbing and mangling , starching and 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ironing , to the wonder of
Fauquier County	LOCATION	.

		Clio , in celebrating the sons of the
Old Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, should not pass over
Colonel Dabney	LOCATION	.

		Miss Good - win 's book is well written , and with some humor ; and it liberally fulfils the author 's promise to '' open a side-door , through which we may , perchance , gain a sense of fire-side intimacy with ` The Colonial Cavalier . ' ''

		Conversations on Sir
Edward Strachey	PERSON	's `` Talk at a Literature and
Country House	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	, Mifflin other matters .

		& CQ -RRB- holdg rather ft p l easant p l ace among the Dialogues which are now somewhat the fashion .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	's dialogues are clever , of course , but some have found it wearisome to be always guess - ing at the topic under discussion .


Vernon Lee	PERSON	's are full of quickening thought , but the portentously long sentences are a sore trial now and then .

		Oscar Wilde 's are delightful , but one ca n't go on reading them forever , even though they be preposterous .

		The conversations between Foster and the
Squire	PERSON	make a refreshing patch of neutral tint in all this brilliancy and pyrotechnic .

		Not at all modern are these talks ; in fact , their charm lies largely in their being old-fashioned .

		An old English country house with pictures and traditions , and an old English country
Squire	PERSON	with curious and cultivated interests , and a person named Foster who asks a great many questions , out of these materials Sir
Edward Strachey	PERSON	has made his dialogues , some of which , at least , are already known to American readers through '' The Atlantic Monthly . ''

		The dialogue is a fascinating form ; it has great dangers , but it offers many op - portunities .

		Local color and character , these give an interest , an atmosphere , to the
Squire	PERSON	's little crit - ical disquisitions on widely differing subjects , from the Cuneiform Inscriptions down to English Politics , from Sa ` di and Hafiz down to
Tennyson	LOCATION	and Mau - rice ; not exciting nor yet brilliant , not up to date in some respects , but interesting in many ways , and , on the whole , very good reading .

		A little conven - tional are they , one may urge , as dialogues .

		Foster is too much like the Question in a scientific quiz - book .

		But then , that is rather the way that one talks to old gentlemen like the
Squire	LOCATION	.

		The object is to get them to talk back ; so one asks questions .

		We should most of us be lucky if our questions were always answered with as much good sense and fine taste as were
Foster 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs. Fields 's `` Shelf of Old Books . ''

		Very pleasant reading , and delight - ful to the eye withal , is the fine vol - ume by Mrs.
James T. Fields	PERSON	en - titled `` A Shelf of Old Books '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The books in point are certain notable volumes that came into the possession of Mr. Fields from time to time by gift or purchase .

		Each of these volumes , or groups of volumes , has for Mrs. Fields its special memories and associations , touching either author or giver ; and these furnish the motif and ground - work of the three papers that form the contents of her book .

		The first paper , on
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, con - tains some good talk about Hunt ,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Procter	ORGANIZATION	, and their circle ; the second , on
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, introduces
Scott	PERSON	,
Ramsay	PERSON	, '' Kit North , '' Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	, De
Quincey	PERSON	, and other cultivators of liter - ature on a little oatmeal and much glenlivat , in
Edina	LOCATION	's palmy days ; the third paper , '' From Mil - ton to
Thackeray	PERSON	, '' is a medley of literary chat and anecdote , much in the vein of
Thackeray	PERSON	's gifted daughter , Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	.

		A prime favorite with the writer was
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, whom she knew personally , , and whose library , containing some precious speci - mens , finally came into Mr.
Fields	PERSON	's possession .

		Mrs. Fields tells many pleasant stories of Hunt , which serve to offset some not pleasant ones of him afloat .

		A charming touch is that as to his love of flowers how in his prison days he papered the walls of his cell with a trellis of painted roses , and had plants set in the dismal windows like ''
Tim Linkinwa	PERSON	- ter 's '' famous mignonette .

		Among Mr.
Fields	PERSON	's treasures was a copy of '' Don Juan '' that
Byron	PERSON	himself once corrected and sent to
Murray	PERSON	to be used in reprinting the poem .

		On a fly-leaf stands the following sarcastic note to the printer , penned by his lordship : ** ... The Authour repeats -LRB- a & before -RRB- that the former impressions -LRB- from whatever cause -RRB- are full of errours .

		And he further adds that he doth kindly trust with all due deference to those superior persons the publisher and printer that they will in future less misspell misplace mistake and mis-every thing , the humbled
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		of their humble servant . ''

		This and other interest - ing notes and letters are given in fac-simile in the present volume .

		There are also a number of well - executed portraits and other illustrations , complet - ing and enriching the ensemble of a very attractive book .

		`` The Yellow Book '' always contains One year of the h var i ety O f things that it would '' Yellow Book . ''

		go hard were there not a tew or con - siderable merit among them all .

		Indeed , one can hardly look over the contents of one of these star - ing octavos , without a dim sense of wonder that the editors should have unearthed so many acceptable writers and artists hitherto unknown to the public , for familiar names are by no means the rule .

		The
October	DATE	issue , which is the third of the series , im - presses us as not quite equal to the preceding two , although there are some striking features .

		Of the art , Mr.
Philip Broughton	PERSON	's ''
Mantegna	PERSON	'' is by far the best example .

		Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	's imagination riots as before , but one quickly wearies of his gro - tesque drawings .

		The poetry is '' below par , '' the only really fine thing being '' The Ballad of a Nun , '' by Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	.

		We may say a word for Mr.
Morton Fullerton	PERSON	's strong sonnet on ''
George Meredith	PERSON	, '' without accepting that perverse novelist as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's only rival `` in our English tongue . ''

		The most conspicuous piece of prose is Mr.
Hubert Crackanthorpe	PERSON	's '' A Study in Sentimentality , '' and the best is '' The Headswoman , '' by Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	.

Henry Harland	PERSON	contributes a pa -

		THE DIAL 155 Two popular expositions of Buddhism .

		thetic story which ranks with his most finished work .

		The
January	DATE	'' Yellow Book , '' completing the first year of the periodical , also has a pretty sketch by Mr.
Grahame	PERSON	, and a story by Mr.
Harland	PERSON	. ''

		Wlad - islaw 's Advent , '' by Mrs. Me ` nie
Muriel Dowie Norman	PERSON	, is one of the more striking things in this volume .

		Two serious essays one by Mr.
James Ashcroft Noble	PERSON	on
Alexander Smith	PERSON	, and one by Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	on '' Stendhal '' claim at - tention , and deserve it .

		The poetry includes pieces by Mrs.
Tomson	PERSON	, Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	, and Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	.

		The art is not particularly artistic , and - we have been most interested in two ''
Bodley Heads	PERSON	, '' being portraits of Mr.
LeGallienne	PERSON	and Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Copeland	PERSON	& Day are the Amer - ican publishers .

		`` The Gospel of Buddha according to Old Records '' is the title of a compilation made by Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	, and issued by the
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a selection from the Buddhist scriptures , taken from the best English translations , and so arranged as to exhibit the life and teachings of Buddha in systematic and consecutive presentation .

		The ed - itor tells us that he has treated his material much as '' the author of the
Fourth Gospel	ORGANIZATION	used the ac - counts of the life of Jesus of
Nazareth	LOCATION	. ''

		In a few chapters , the editor appears as author ; but he as - sures us that these original chapters '' contain noth - ing but ideas for which prototypes can be found somewhere among the traditions of Buddhism , and have been added as elucidations of its main princi - ples . ''

		The distinctive features of this book are the way in which the material has been arranged , and the valuable '' Table of Reference , '' which refers us to the sources of the text , and also supplies us with parallelisms from the Christian Scriptures .

		Dr.
Carus	PERSON	has done in prose very much what was done by Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	in the verse of his '' Light of
Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		These popular expositions have their place and their value , and it is the part of pedantry to scorn them or to refuse them a hearing .

		We note at the same time the appearance of '' A Buddhist Cate - chism '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , '' compiled from the holy writ - ings of the Southern Buddhists , with explanatory notes for the use of Europeans . ''

		Mr.
Subadra Bhikshu	PERSON	is the author of this little book , which was first written in German , '' in the year
2438	DATE	after the Nirvana of the Tath ^ gato , '' and now appears in an English version .

		The catechetical form is employed throughout the book , and the exposition of doctrine is made both intelligible and attractive .

		Selected essays by
Mazzini	PERSON	.

		A recent volume with the familiar Dent imprint contains a selection of '' Essays by
Joseph Mazzini	PERSON	'' -LRB- Mac - rnillan -RRB- , translated by Mr.
Thomas Okey	PERSON	, and pro- vided with an introduction by Mr.
Bolton King	PERSON	.

		A photogravure portrait of
Mazzini	PERSON	faces the title-page of the book a good portrait , the saintlike charac - ter of the prophet of Italian unity reflected from the noble ascetic visage .

		Mr.
King	PERSON	's introduction is mainly biographical , and recapitulates with marked sympathy the leading facts of that devoted life .

		The essays comprise '' Interest and Principles '' -LRB- 1836 -RRB- , '' Faith and the Future '' -LRB- 1835 -RRB- , The Pa - triots and the Clergy '' -LRB- 1835 -RRB- , the Programme '' To the Italians '' and the '' Thoughts on the French Revolution of
1789	DATE	'' from `` Roma del Popolo '' -LRB- 1871 -RRB- , `` The Question of the Exiles '' from `` La Jeune Suisse '' -LRB- 1836 -RRB- , and a beautiful `` Unpub - lished Letter '' of consolation , addressed by
Mazzini	PERSON	to a father sorrowing for the loss of his only son .

		Let it not be thought that these essays are of local and temporary interest only .

		They are far more than that , as are nearly all of the writings of their author .

		As long as noble ideals of patriotism , or of conduct in the other aspects of life , shall be cher - ished among men , the message of that great soul will have both meaning and force .

		As the name of the historical
Mazzini	PERSON	recedes farther and farther into the past , his fame grows brighter and brighter .

		In the words of his most eloquent panegyrist : '' Life and the clouds are vanished : hate and fear Have had their span Of time to hurt , and are not : he is here , The sunlike man . ''

		It is with real gratitude that we welcome a volume that can not fail to widen the circle of those to whom
Mazzini	PERSON	's message makes its appeal . ''

		Blank Verse , '' by
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	-LRB- imported by
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons -RRB- , is a reprint of three essays which have been already published as an ap - pendix to a previous work .

		It is excellent to have them in a volume by themselves , for though rather slight , and by no means digested into a single treat - ise , they have in them a good deal that is very use - ful to the student of the technique of poetry .

		The first essay is general in character , the second is a review of English blank verse from
Surrey	LOCATION	to Ten - nyson , and the third is on
Milton	LOCATION	's blank verse .

		The study is chiefly of Rhythm ; and here , though we nowhere have a full and accurate statement of the principles at bottom , we do get a good deal which suggests the right idea the necessity of sub - ordinating the mere prosody to a consideration of the meaning which Professor
Corson	PERSON	worked out so successfully in the treatment of blank verse in his '' Primer of English Verse . ''

		Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	's re - marks on Quantity and Rhythm -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- , and on Quantity in
Latin	LOCATION	and English -LRB- p. 4 -RRB- , are good .

		When he says of '' Hyperion '' that the decasyllabic beat maintains an uninterrupted undercurrent of regu - lar pulsation '' -LRB- p. 64 -RRB- , he gets closest to the basis of future studies in blank verse .

		The present stu - dent of poetic art has the advantage of Mr.
Sy	PERSON	- monds , in recent work on the psychic effects of rhythm in general .

		But Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	's book , though written some time ago , has much that seems to show that he had divined , as it were , a good deal as to the nature of rhythm in poetry .

		156 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, A new hutory In '' The History of the English Lan - oj the English guage '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Professor Ql - language .

		j ver -RSB- ?

		arrar
Emerson	PERSON	has produced a book that admirably serves the twofold purpose claimed for it in the preface as being '' designed for college classes and for teachers of English . ''

		The treatment throughout is wholly scientific , and the best and latest authorities have been carefully consulted .

		What immediately attracts attention is the comparatively large space devoted to phonet - ics , for which , however , few readers will prob - ably quarrel with the author .

		The stand taken on the question of the influence of the Norman Con - quest on the language differs considerably from the popular conception , regarding it as incidental rather than revolutionary .

		In this discussion , as in sev - eral others of an historical character , admirable use is made of the results obtained by
Stubbs	PERSON	and Free - man .

		The statement , in paragraph 30 , that '' this twofold declension -LSB- of the adjective -RSB- has been lost in the later development of the English , as in the other Teutonic tongues except High German , '' is too broad , as the same distinction is still kept up in the modern Scandinavian languages .

		An ingenious and useful feature of the index is the distinguishing between subjects and words used as examples , by the use of capitals and small letters respectively .

		The second series of Mr.
James	PERSON	's % r dr J aL. `` Theatricals '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- contains two plays not very unlike those in the first series , which was noticed in THE DIAL for
Sept. 1	DATE	.

		These are rather the more interesting on the whole , although it appears that , like their pre - decessors , they were written for performances which never came off .

		One is tempted to wonder whether , if they had been given in public , they would have met with as striking success as that attending the production of Mr.
James	PERSON	's recent play at the thea - tre of his patron saint .

		The volume is made more interesting by a few pages of comment .

		This is really quite amusing , especially Mr.
James	PERSON	's char - acterization of himself as `` the perverted man of letters freshly trying his hand at an art -LSB- in -RSB- which ... he has if possible even more to unlearn than to learn . ''

		It is rather mean to be sniffy about any - thing by Mr.
James	PERSON	, but one gets a bit irritated that when he can write such captivating things he should write such stupid ones .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Volumes III. , IV. , and V. of
Thiers	PERSON	's '' History of the French Revolution '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , in Mr.
Frederick Shoberl	PERSON	's translation , are now published , and complete what is likely to remain the standard library edition of this work , as far as English readers are concerned .

		The fifth volume is provided with a good index , and the en - tire work is illustrated with more than forty fine steel engravings .

		We congratulate the publishers on their enterprise in producing this work , and the companion work on the
Consulate and Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The late
W. Robertson Smith	PERSON	's '' Lectures on the Re - ligion of the Semites '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- were delivered at
Aberdeen	ORGANIZATION	in three successive courses , from
1888	DATE	to
1891	DATE	, by invitation of the Burnett Fund trustees .

		Only the first of the three series was published , as the failing health of the author checked his activities .

		This first series , having for a sub-title '' The Fundamental Insti - tutions , '' appeared in
1889	DATE	.

		A new edition of these lec - tures now appears , edited by a friend to whom the au - thor entrusted the task , and whom he supplied with a manuscript volume of additional materials for incorpor - ation within the work .

		The new edition thus differs materially from the earlier one , and represents , in all es - sential respects , the ripened and final opinions of the great scholar whose loss we mourned a few months ago .

		It is much to be hoped that arrangements may be made for publication of the two other series of lectures . ''

		Commitment ,
Detention , Care	ORGANIZATION	, and Treatment of the Insane '' and '' Care and Training of the Feeble - Minded '' are the titles of two collections of papers bound in one volume , and bearing the imprint of the
Johns Hopkins Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both collections are reports of proceedings at the
Congress of Charities	ORGANIZATION	, Correction , and Philanthropy , held at
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1893	DATE	.

		The former report has been edited by Drs.
G. Alder Blumer	PERSON	and
H. B. Richardson	PERSON	, and the latter by Dr.
George H. Knight	PERSON	.

		Volume XLI .

		of the '' Dictionary of National Biog - raphy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- extends from
Nichols	LOCATION	to O'Dugan .

		The latter worthy , whose Christian name was
John	PERSON	, was an Irish poet of the fourteenth century , and seems to have left a numerous literary posterity .


Daniel O'Cou	PERSON	- nell gets the longest biography in the present volume , and
Titus Gates	ORGANIZATION	comes next .

		The volume is rich in memoirs of the families of
Nichols , Norris , North	ORGANIZATION	,
O'Brien	PERSON	,
O'Connor	PERSON	, and
O'Donnell	PERSON	, and has , on the whole , a marked Celtic flavor .

		In '' The World 's Largest Libraries '' -LRB- Young -RRB- , a col - lege commencement address delivered last
June	DATE	,
General James Grant Wilson	ORGANIZATION	tells us how , during a recent
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean sojourn , he made a point of examining many famous collections of books , and saw , in the course of his wanderings , no less than thirty-five millions of vol - umes , not to mention manuscripts , pamphlets , and prints .

		He appears to have been duly enthusiastic over the special treasures put before his eyes by various con - tinental librarians whom he visited , and has thrown to - gether in his lecture an extremely readable collection of facts and fancies pertaining to the world of the biblio - grapher .

		The '' Temple '' Shakespeare -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- rounds out the series of the comedies with `` A
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' which has for frontispiece an etching of the kitchen in the
Stratford	LOCATION	hous3 where the poet was born , suggest - ing that here he may himself have listened with open - eyed wonder to many a winter 's tale during the years of childhood .

		At the same time , the series of the his - tories begins with ''
King John	PERSON	, '' the etching in this vol - ume being of the king 's tomb in the cathedral of
Rouen	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
T. M. Clark	PERSON	's `` Architect , Owner , and Builder before the Law '' -LRB-
Macmillau	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is '' a summary of Amer - ican and English decisions on the principal questions relating to building , and the employment of architects . ''

		It includes hundreds of references to leading cases , as well as a great many practical suggestions about the drawing of building contracts .

		The book is one that must find its way into every law library , and that all persons engaged in building even a single house will find it advisable to own .

		THE DIAL 157 YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
February 25 , 1895	DATE	.

		Mr.
Henry Rutgers Marshall	PERSON	, one of the most prom - ising of our rising group of architects , will shortly pub - lish , through
Messrs. Macinillau & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, his second vol - ume , '' ^ Esthetic Principles . ''

		The studies which led up to the publication of his first book , '' Pain , Pleasure , and ^ Esthetics , '' were originally undertaken with the desire of seeing how far the science of aesthetics and the philosophy of art would avail as helps in the author 's practice of his profession .

		But even then , Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	thought he might at some time place the results of his studies in such form that they could be readily understood by the average worker in festhetic subjects .

		This notion was confirmed by the encouraging appreciation of '' Pain , Pleasure , and ^ Esthetics '' by the best thinkers in such matters in this country and
England	LOCATION	; and when Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	was invited to deliver a course of lectures at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	he decided to write the new book . ''

		Esthetic Principles '' comprises most of what he said in his lectures and a good deal more besides .

		The au - thor greatly hopes that it may be found understandable and helpful by his fellow-craftsmen among painters , sculptors , architects , musicians , and literary workers in general .

		It may be considered as introductory to his former book , but it is also a digest , in more popular form , of the aesthetic principles therein discussed .

		An especially important feature is the discussion of the very great negative value of the teachings of the science of aesthetics .

		The author hopes that the chapter on '' neg - ative principles '' will explode many a fallacy of practice and criticism , giving at the same time the truly valuable negative principles to take their place .

		It is a long time since the youthful Pneraphs '' estab - lished their organ , '' The Germ , '' which was to revolu - tionize the world of letters and art ; but whatever the projectors of '' The Germ '' accomplished in other ways , that periodical was soon '' done for . ''

		It is really quite an appreciable time since the
London	LOCATION
Century Guild	ORGANIZATION	established '' The Hobby Horse , '' which is still flourish - ing , having pulled through many a tight place .

		In the wake of `` The Hobby Horse '' have followed `` The Knight Errant '' of
Boston	LOCATION	and '' The Contributor '' of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		These three periodicals are , of course , the progenitors of `` The Yellow Book , '' `` The Chap-Book , '' and , more recently , '' The Bibelot '' and '' The Paper - Knife . ''

		Still another esoteric magazine is projected , 41 The Chameleon , '' at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, which probably takes its name from
Theodore Tilton	PERSON	's new book of poems , '' Cham - eleon 's Dish , '' lately published at the
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		With all these should be named
Elbert Hubbard	PERSON	's '' Lit - tle Journeys to the Homes of Good Men and Great , '' brought out each month by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Musing on the multiplication of these titbits of literature , one is led to wonder where the thing will end .

		No publishing firm is now so small that it may not have its monthly or quarterly magazinelet .

		All sorts of little books are coming out , too , by minor , or minute , authors , which can be taken with a tiny sand - wich and a cup of tea .

		In fact , we are witnessing what may be called the
Afternoon Tea Movement	ORGANIZATION	in English and American literature .

		As for the precious wicked ones , they are mostly harmless enough , as Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	-LRB- Americanus -RRB- intimates in this week 's `` Life . ''

		When they become too nasty , they can be served in the same fashion as the one-eyed elder brother of the Sul - tan of
Morocco	LOCATION	, who has just been walled up in his prison at
Widah	LOCATION	; or we may import Australian lady - bugs to prey on these black scales of literature .

		Magazines devoted entirely to literary news and ap - preciations are on the increase , also , as witness the American edition of '' The
Bookman	PERSON	. ''

		I remember tell - ing one of our up-to-date
New York	LOCATION	girls a few years ago that we already had the '' Book Buyer , '' the '' Book Lore , '' the '' Book News , '' the '' Book Worm , '' and the '' Book Chat , '' and that now it was proposed to publish the `` Book Mart . ''

		Quick as a flash came the reply : '' How about the book-martyrs ? ''

		I am afraid this was a reasonable question ; but enough of these papers have suspended to make room for the new `` Bookman . ''

		Speaking of literary journals reminds me that Mr.
Wheeler	PERSON	, of the '' Literary Digest , '' has associated with himself Mr.
John H. Boner	PERSON	, the Southern poet , as co - editor of that able paper .

		The
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	is following its book-binding ex - hibit with a collection of engraved portraits of woman writers .

		About one hundred and twenty-five are to be represented , from
Sappho	LOCATION	to
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		In some cases a number of portraits are given , representing the subject at various ages , nine likenesses of Hannah More being shown .

		There will be a '' ladies ' day , '' when Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney	PERSON	will deliver an address .

		This exhibition will be succeeded by a complete collection of the engravings of Mr.
Asher B. Durand	PERSON	, from his appren - ticeship to an engraver , in
1812	DATE	, until he abandoned en - graving for painting , in
1831	DATE	.

		It is rumored that still another book club is to be es - tablished , this time in
Buffalo	LOCATION	by Mr.
Irving Browne	PERSON	and other members of the
Grolier	ORGANIZATION	.

		This will be in ad - dition to the Philobiblon of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, the Rowfant of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and the
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The most important announcement of the week in the way of new clubs , however , is the organization of '' The Society of Iconophiles of
New York	LOCATION	, '' composed of ten gentlemen interested in engraving and in the preservation of accu - rate reproductions of historic houses .

		Mr.
William L. Andrews	PERSON	is the first president ; Mr.
Robert Hoe Law	PERSON	- rence is secretary and treasurer ; and Messrs.
Avery	PERSON	,
Bierstadt	PERSON	, Chew ,
Foote	PERSON	,
Holden	PERSON	, and
Lefferts	LOCATION	are among the members .

		Mr.
E. D. French	PERSON	, who has gained wide reputation for the designing of book-plates , has been appointed engraver to the society .

		The first engraving published will be a view of old
St. Paul 's Church	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	.

		It will be followed by views of the Bowl - ing
Green	ORGANIZATION	and
Fraunces Tavern	LOCATION	.

		Fifty copies of each of the first ten engravings will be for sale , and may be obtained of Mr.
James O. Wright	PERSON	, No. 6 East 42d st. Professor
H. H. Boyesen	PERSON	has finally completed the '' Essays on Scandinavian Literature , '' on which he has been engaged for several years , and they will be pub - lished by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	early in
March	DATE	.

		Chap - ters will be devoted to
Bjornson	PERSON	,
Jonas Lie	PERSON	,
Alexander Kielland	PERSON	,
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	,
Georg Brandes	PERSON	,
Esaias Tegner	PERSON	, and others ; as well as a chapter on the minor Danish authors .

		Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	has had a personal acquaintance with many of these writers .

		The announcement of a novel by
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, '' A Monk of Fife , '' dealing with the life and times of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , in view of the
Harper	PERSON	novel on the same subject , raises an interesting question of literary priority .

		Who thought of it first , and who began it first ?

		I learn that '' Coffee and Repartee , '' by Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	, has reached a sale of thirty thousand copies .

		The first edition of the sequel , '' The Idiot , '' will number seven thousand , five hundred .

		ARTHUR
STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		158 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, A WINTER DREAM OF SUMMER .

		Mother of Poesy , dear Idleness !

		To-day I 'm thine in this cool nook of earth ; The hills all green around us at their birth , And goodly fields , and trees in
summer	DATE	dress .

		Oh , come and greet me with thine old caress .

		Come and receive me to thy house and hearth , Bring all thy music , waken all thy mirth , Pour round me all thy dreams that soothe and bless !

		Not minutes , but long dreamful hours are thine , And time for life to ripen on the bough Her royal fruitage , love , and thought , and soul ; And these are they that pour the mellow wine Of song , with light to clear the careworn brow , Song , richest draught that sparkles in life 's bowl .

Stevenson	PERSON	's posthumous novel .

		The
February	DATE	number of '' The Bibelot '' is devoted to selections from Mr.

		Mr.

Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's letters as their owners may be willing to submit for publication .

		The English department of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	is about to produce
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's '' Silent Woman , '' with a carefully studied Elizabethan stage-setting .


Reginald Stuart Poole	PERSON	, born in
London	LOCATION	in
1832	DATE	, died at
Kensington	LOCATION	on the eighth of
February	DATE	.

		Archaeology and numismatics were the subjects of his best-known books .

		The Authors ' Guild will have an Authors ' Reading in
New York	LOCATION	on the

England	LOCATION	. ''

		In
Stevenson	PERSON	's Land , '' by Miss
Marie Fraser	PERSON	, an - nounced by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is certainly timely , and its subject possesses , in addition , indepen - dent interest .

		A search has recently been made in
Italy	LOCATION	for the tomb of
Vittoria Colonna	PERSON	, and her remains have been positively identified , with those of her husband , in a church at
Naples	LOCATION	.

		It is announced that there will be this year no Turn - bull lectures on poetry at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, but that Dr.
George A. Smith	PERSON	, of
Glasgow	LOCATION	, has been engaged for a course on Hebrew poetry in
1896	DATE	.

		The Tsar of
Russia	LOCATION	has ordered the appointment of a commission to found , in memory of the late
Alexander	PERSON	, an institution where a home will be provided for dis - abled authors , artists , and actors .

		It was only a few weeks ago that he gave out of his privy purse the sum of 50,000 rubles for the purpose of providing pensions for authors .

		The lately organized
Caxton Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has made a good beginning in providing for what promises to be a very interesting exhibition of fine book bind - ings , to be held at the
Art Institute	ORGANIZATION	, opening
March 4	DATE	.

		The collection includes examples of the work of many of the most famous binders , at home and abroad , and it will doubtless receive due attention and admiration from book-lovers .

		The long-heralded American edition of the
London	LOCATION	`` Bookman , '' published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has at last sent forth its first number .

		It proves to be a magazine of some seventy pages , illustrated , contain - ing reviews , miscellaneous essays on literary subjects , much gossip of a rather trivial sort , and useful tabula - tions of book sales and current publications .

		The mag - azine is attractively printed , and we wish it every suc - cess .

		Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	, in '' The Speaker '' of
London	LOCATION	, pays the following poetical tribute to the four recent dead among English authors Syrnonds ,
Pater	LOCATION	,
Hamer	PERSON	- ton , and
Stevenson	PERSON	: Child of the great Rebirth , who most of men Didst steep in
Italy	LOCATION	the English soul : Thou , Phidias of discourse , who couldst control Speech to Form 's purity by shaping pen : Thou who all Art didst learn to teach again : And thou whose Art was Nature from the scroll Of Life how swiftly blotted !

		Still flourishes the weed , the tree mature With stem and bough and fruitage loads the ground .

		As indicated in the last issue of THE DIAL , the ob - jection to the Covert Copyright Bill rests in its form and not in the principle involved .

		The proposed amend - ment , as it passed the
Committee on Patents	ORGANIZATION	, tended to make damages nominal in both literary and artistic in - fringements , whereas the intention originally was to prevent excessive damages in the case of art and pho - tography alone .


Last week Thursday	DATE	a meeting of representatives of the Publishers ' and Authors ' Copy - right Leagues , and a committee from the
American Newspaper Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, was held in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
J. Henry Harper	PERSON	,
George Haven	PERSON	Put - nam ,
Edmund C. Stedman	PERSON	, and
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	were present , together with Mr.
William C. Bryant	PERSON	of the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	'' Times , '' Mr.
H. F. Gunnison	PERSON	of the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	`` Eagle , '' and Mr.
C. W. Knapp	PERSON	of the
St. Louis	LOCATION	'' Republic . ''

		A revised draft of the Covert amendment was drawn up , relating to art works and photographs alone , and fixing penalties for infringe - , ment in such cases at from one hundred to ten thous - and dollars .

		It is hoped that this draft may be substi - tuted without difficulty when the Covert bill comes up in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The presentation of the '' -LRB- Edipus Rex '' of Sophocles , at
Beloit College	ORGANIZATION	, on the 22d of
February	DATE	, was an event in the history of both the town and the college .

		All the details were under the immediate charge of Profes - sor
Theodore L. Wright	PERSON	, and the result reflected much credit upon him and his colaborers .

		The tragedy was rendered into English verse by the class of
1897	DATE	, as a part of their term 's work in the Greek drama ; the classic forms of stilted expression were avoided , and modern dignified English phrase was employed .

		Other presentations , in the original , with elaborate setting , have been given ; but it is doubtful if the true spirit of the '' -LRB- Edipus '' has ever been as well presented in
America	LOCATION	, in interpretation , translation , or faithfulness
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 159 of costume .

		The stage was nearly square , and was oc - cupied on the same level by both actors and chorus , ac - cording to the later conception of the ancient setting ; the scenery represented a palace in a forest near
Thebes	LOCATION	, and the costumes were all especially designed from the drapery on the figures seen on ancient Greek vases .

		The role of '' -LRB- Edipus '' was taken by Mr.
C. W. Wood	PERSON	of the Senior class , whose interpretation , particularly in the frenzied passages at the climax of the tragedy , was thought by many to be comparable to
Salvini	PERSON	's '' Othello . ''

		The part of '' Jocasta '' was played with great credit by Mr.
Loomis	PERSON	, as was that of '' Creon '' by Mr.
Rose	PERSON	.

		The chorus of bearded Thebans , with Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	as Choragos , was especially strong ; and their rythmic and strange dances , to the flute music especially prepared by Professor
Allen	PERSON	, brought visible relief to the intense strain of the audience .

		The play was largely attended , not only by
Beloit	LOCATION	people , but by visitors from
Chicago	LOCATION	and other neighboring cities .

		By the Right Hon.
ARTHUR J. BALFOUR	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	Crown 8vo ,
$ 2.00	MONEY	. ''

		It is a book of so much philosophical and dialectical ability that were it the work of an unheard-of writer it would make him an immediate reputation .

		... Is extremely well written , in good , manly prose , without a bit of deliberate fine writing , but often rising with the elevation of the thought to great dignity and beauty of expression ... Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	has a remarkable gift for apt and striking illustration , and his illustrations have the quality of his mind .

		They are as fresh as they are forcible .

		Then , too , he is a master of the strong , illuminating phrase ... However we may feel about the course of Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's argument , and the conclusions to which he arrives , we must be very churlish if we do not enjoy his dialectic all the way along , and not only that , but many bright and telling passages which are wonderfully suggestive , even where they do not command our full assent .

		At least we can so far agree with him as he agrees with
Wordsworth	PERSON	's magic phrase , ' We feel that we are greater than we know . '

		And then , too , we must thank him not only for his fascinating book , but , in advance , for the lively and interesting dis - cussion which it is certain to provoke . ''

Brooklyn	LOCATION	-RRB- . ''

		This review of Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's book has been casual .

		Indeed , it has been confined to a hasty outline of his discussion of aesthetics .

		It may , however , give the reader a hint of the sound thinking and clear reasoning to be found between the covers of ' The Foundations of Belief . '

		It is one of the most notable books of the year , and no one who aims to keep in touch with modern thought can afford to leave it unread . ''

		Commercial Advertiser -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		`` Perhaps the greatest service which the leader of
Opposition	ORGANIZATION	has rendered to this generation is not the influence which he exerts as the head of the Conservative party in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, but the force with which , in this striking work , he has illustrated the influence of Authority in the evolution of beliefs , both true and false . ''

		Spectator . ''

		... Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	has put great thoughts into burning words , and the range , as well as the profundity , of his argumentation will certainly provide abundance of matter for the digestion of the intellectual world for some time to come . ''

		Manchester Courier . ''

		This book , modestly termed ` Notes , ' is one of the chief contributions to philosophy made for many years in
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	has much to say of some modern controversies and fallacies which were on the way to oblivion even as he wrote .

		But no fresher and keener examin - ation of dominant systems of thought , no more luminous statement of objections dimly seen by many less acute than he , no more suggestive dis - cussion of old , but ever new , problems , has appeared here for many years . ''

		That the publication of Mr.

Gibbs	PERSON	has collected within his 500 pages probably every story that has ever been recorded of Napoleon in the camp .

		191 THE REPORT ON ELEMENTARY EDUCATION .

		The Preliminary Report of the
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	, presented last month to the confer - ence of school superintendents at
Cleveland	LOCATION	, is an educational document of the first import - ance , and at once takes rank with the Com - mittee of Ten 's Report on
Secondary Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		These two documents may fairly be said to mark a new era in educational discussion , to more than prepare the way for that rational and scientific plan of cooperation among our educators that has so long been hoped for , yet but dimly descried upon the horizon .

		The American political organization , with its un - paralleled measure of local autonomy , has cre - ated a special educational problem in the
United States	LOCATION	, and calls for the evolution of a special system adapted to its needs .

		We are doubtless still in the period of scattered aims and half-wasted energies , but order is slowly emerging from chaos .

		The fermentation must go on for many years yet ; but the clarified final product will , we trust , prove superior to the product of the centralized European sys - tems .

		We have to attain the golden mean between license and rigidity , to devise a plan sufficiently elastic to fit with all of our widely varied conditions , to combine respect for law in the fundamentals with much exercise of free - dom in the details .

		To the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	is due our gratitude for the movement which has resulted in the two Reports above alluded to .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	which has framed the Report now to be considered was appointed at the in - stance of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	early in
1893	DATE	.

		It was divided into three sections of five members each , having for their respective subjects '' The Training of Teachers , '' `` The Correlation of Studies , '' and '' The Organization of City School Systems . ''

		Nearly two years have been spent in the collection and collation of expert opinion upon these three subjects ; the digested result now appears in the Report as presented at
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		The text of this Report makes up the entire contents of the
March	DATE	issue of '' The Educational Review , '' and is thus easily accessible to the public .

		The members of the sub-committees are nearly unanimous in their 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, respective recommendations .

		To the first sec - tion of the Eeport there is no dissenting voice ; to the third , but one or two trifling divergences of opinion .

		To the second alone , as one might have predicted from its subject , are any con - siderable number of exceptions taken .

		These minority opinions , while helpful as offering special points of view , tend , of course , to weaken the force of the document as a whole , and are , pro tanto , to be regretted .

		The first section of the Report , signed , as we have said , by all five members of the sub-com - mittee , lays down the fundamental principles that should be consulted in the training of teachers for their professional work .

		At the start , the requirement is made of high-school education for elementary work , and of collegiate education for secondary work .

		We have no doubt that the equivalent for these respective amounts of school-study would be acceptable to the signers of this Report , but we wish that it had been more explicitly stated .

		If a teacher has the necessary education , it does not matter where or how he got it ; yet the indolence of school officers , or their tendency to discrimi - nate in favor of routine acquisition , often makes them look askance at a well-prepared applicant merely because he has not been through the regular educational mill .

		Again , when we come to the main subject of the Re - port the kind and amount of professional training that ought to be exacted of teachers in addition to the merely academic prepara - tion we can not help noting a tendency to ignore the fact that a considerable number of the best teachers need little or none of this special training , although there is no doubt of its ' beneficial effect upon the rank and file .

		Still , those who are fitted by natural parts or predispositions to dispense with normal school training ought not to have it forced upon them .

		The test of practical success is worth more than any academic tests whatsoever , and some way of giving it a trial ought to be devised for use in promising cases of well-developed nat - ural aptitude .

		This exception being taken , we are free to admit that most young men and women who look to teaching for a career will be helped by the work of the professional school .

		The first point considered is whether academic studies belong to the course of such a school .

		The admission is made , although somewhat grudg - ingly , '' that methods can practically be taught only as subjects , '' and that the work of the normal school '' may so treat of the subjects of study , not as objects to be acquired , but as ob - jects to be presented , that their treatment shall be wholly professional . ''

		We believe that the work of a normal school should be very largely of this character , and wish that the Report had more distinctly emphasized its importance .

		But there still remains , of course , a certain amount of professional training of a more technical character , and with this the major part of the Report is concerned .

		The follow - ing six elements of such training are differ - entiated : Psychology , Methodology , School economy , Educational history , Observation of teaching , and Practice-teaching under criti - cism .

		We think that the Report overestimates the relative importance of the last two of these six elements in recommending that one-half of the total period of training be devoted to them .

		On the other hand , there is no undue exagger - ation in the position so squarely assumed with reference to psychology . ''

		Most fundamental and important of the professional studies which ought to be pursued by one intending to teach is psychology . ''

		This is no whit too emphatic , and it has our cordial approval .

		But by psy - chology must be understood the real thing , not the sorry stuff that parades under that name in too many of our normal schools , and which consists for the most part of empirical facts couched in a meaningless jargon . ''

		Pyschology , what crimes are committed in thy name ! ''

		is an exclamation that must often rise to the lips of those who have had occasion to make ac - quaintance with the popular text-books of the past generation .

		On the whole , scientific psy - chology being given , together with the thorough study of a few carefully chosen subjects con - sidered '' as objects to be presented , '' we should be inclined to make light of special methodol - ogy , of school economy , and of the history of education .

		These things will all be added , in due time , to the equipment of the serious teacher , but they are not of the essentials , and the mind that has had the proper fundamental discipline may as well be left to find its way to them unaided .

		The Report on the organization of city school systems exhibits sound judgment and a proper distribution of emphasis . ''

		The instruction will be ineffective and abnormally expensive unless put upon a scientific educational basis and supervised by competent educational ex - perts . ''

		These words from the opening pages of the Report summarize its recommendations .

		More specifically , the Report calls for a con - centration of responsibility for appointment 1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 rather than election of school directors ; for boards of education numbering from five to fifteen members , '' not chosen to represent any ward or subdivision of the territory or any party or element in the political , religious , or social life thereof '' ; for absolute independence of the superintendent in all matters relating to the selection of teachers and the shaping of instruction .

		The latter of these points is the most important , and here the language of the Report has no uncertain sound .

		`` A city school system , '' we are told , '' may be able to with - stand some abuses on the business side of its administration and continue to perform its function with measurable success , but wrongs against the instruction must , in a little time , prove fatal .

		Government by the people has no more dangerous pitfall than this , that in the mighty cities of the land the comfortable and intelligent masses , who are discriminat - ing more and more closely about the educa - tion of their children , shall become dissatisfied with the social status of the teachers and the quality of the teaching in the common schools .

		In that event , they will educate their children at their own expense , and the public schools will become only good enough for those who can afford no better . ''

		There is one way , and one way only , to avert this danger .

		The whole work of instruction must be put upon a professional and scientific basis by securing competent teachers , ade - quately compensating them for their work , as - suring them of fixed tenure and advancement according to merit , and reducing to a minimum the formal regulations and petty restrictions that hamper the individual and wantonly lower the tone of the whole teaching-force .

		Now all '' this can not be secured if there is any lack of authority , and experience amply proves that it will not be secured if there is any division of responsibility . ''

		We have to choose between a superintendent fully empowered in these matters and fully responsible , on the one hand , and `` administration by boards or committees '' on the other .

		Whatever may be the possibili - ties of evil in the former alternative , they are trifling when compared with the well-proved evils of the latter .

		Boards or committees are simply '' not competent to manage professional matters and develope an expert teaching-force .

		Yet they assume , and in most cases honestly , the knowledge of the most experienced .

		They override and degrade a superintendent , when they have the power to do so , until he becomes their mere factotum .

		For the sake of harmony and the continuance of his position , he con - cedes , surrenders , and acquiesces in their acts , while the continually increasing teaching-force becomes weaker and weaker and the work poorer and poorer .

		If he refuses to do this , they precipitate an open rupture and turn him out of his position .

		Then they cloud the issues and shift the responsibility from one to another . ''

		This vigorous exposure of a great evil and suggestion of a remedy carries conviction in its every phrase .

		It is indeed , as the Report says , '' unprofitable to mince words about this all-important matter . ''

		The dissenting opinions of individual members of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	are upon trifling matters of detail , and only serve to bring out by contrast their unanimity upon the great questions at issue .

		Dealing with the weightiest of educational matters , this Report voices the great body of intelligent opinion , and can not fail to become a power for good .

		It will be read by every American educator worthy of the name , and will strengthen its readers in their determination to uphold the dignity of their profession , to resist to the utmost the ef - forts everywhere made by the vulgar dema - gogue and the ignorant politician to fit our city school systems to their base ideals .

		The third and longest of the Reports , hav - ing for its subject the correlation of elemen - tary studies , must be reserved for considera - tion at some other time .

		It is marked off from the two others by its academical or philosoph - ical , as distinguished from their distinctively practical , character , and it raises a set of prob - lems of an entirely different sort .

		It is also the only Report which exhibits a serious diver - gence of opinion on the part of those who have drawn it up .

		It may well , for these reasons , be made the subject of a separate article .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE HUMANITIES AND THE SCIENCES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Culture deprecates polemics .

		It rejoices when forces unite that were before at odds .

		Yet how often is '' cul - ture '' made the battle-cry of partisanship .

		It has been so in the formation of our college curricula .

		The hu - manities were first supreme in the universities .

		But their supremacy was not long unchallenged .

		The sci - ences called for admission .

		Unfortunately , this was at first denied .

		They had to fight their way in step by step .

		Just as unfortunately , the sciences , now having gained high ground , look down patronizingly at the humanities .

		And there is back-biting between the two .

		But better things are near .

		At first , forced toleration , then self-sought copartnership , will result .

		The scien - tist is seeing that he must be broadly human ; and the 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, humanist is becoming scientific .

		Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	said of Cato : '' He misliked , and cried out against , all Greek learning , and yet , being fourscore years old , began to learn it , belike fearing that
Pluto	LOCATION	understood not Latin . ''

		So the scientist , crying out against the humanistic learn - ing , and regarding its language as pedantry , will in time be forced to acquire it , if for no other reason , to gain the ear of a culture even more exacting perhaps than was
Pluto	LOCATION	. ''

		What lumps of raw fact are flung at our heads ! ''

		wrote
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	. ''

		Through what tan - gles of uninteresting phenomena are we not dragged in the name of Research , Truth , and the higher Philosophy !

		Mr.
Mill	PERSON	and Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	, Mr.
Bain	PERSON	and Mr.
Sidgwick	PERSON	, have taught our age very much ; but no one of them was ever seen to smile ; and it is not easy to recall in their voluminous works a single irradiating image or one mon - umental phrase . ''

		This is the over-statement of parti - sanship .

		But it indicates the nature of the demand that will humanize the sciences .

		On the other hand , the humanities are growing up to the level of the scientific conscience .

		History and lit - erature are becoming scientific studies .

		Sociology , the humanity of humanities , is making good its claim to be reckoned with as a science .

		Thus each is learning from the other .

		Science and the humanities alike are carried on by men .

		And sym - pathetic intercourse is discovering ^ a common standing place and horizon .


Ogden N. Rood	PERSON	, professor of phy - sics at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, was speaking of his walks and talks with the late Dr.
Merriam	PERSON	, professor of Greek .

		`` Dur - ing these , '' he said , '' I became a great deal better ac - quainted with his habits of mind than I had ever been before , and was very much astonished to find that he undertook to treat those matters those things that hap - pened ages and ages ago very much upon the same principles that we employ in physical laboratories .

		I would say to him , with regard to a certain theory : ' This thing looks all right , is n't that so ? '

		He would reply , ' Yes , it is plausible ; there are some things in its favor , but not enough ; we need to study the matter a great deal more . '

		So , from time to time , it happened to me that I received at his hands a dose of my own medicine the kind of medicine that we are in the habit of administering to students in the physical laboratory . ''

		Intercourse such as this will harmonize the efforts of educators .

		We shall have a wide curriculum in our colleges wide enough for the sciences and the human - ities to run side by side to the same goal .

		Students , taking the hand of either , will not be led , one east , one west , as so often happens now .

		ROME AND
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Some years ago I noticed the near coincidence of the latitudes of
Rome	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Thomas 's Gazeteer gives the latitude of St.
Peter	PERSON	's as 41 54 ' 6 '' .

		The lati - tude of
Dearborn Observatory	ORGANIZATION	at the former
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	was 41 50 ' 1 '' .

		Mr.
Elias Colbert	PERSON	favored me with the information that at
Chicago	LOCATION	one minute of latitude is 6074 feet in length hence one second of latitude is 101.23 feet .

		With these data and maps of the cities , I find these relations of place : Extend our Madison street straight east , and it will run over the
Aventine Hill	LOCATION	.

		Van Buren street 's line passes just south of the Aurelian Wall , near the
Porta Appia	LOCATION	.

		St.
Peter	PERSON	's is east of Maple street , and the area between
Maple	ORGANIZATION	and Oak streets , with the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	ex - tending north across Division street .

		The middle of the Forum is about east of
Indiana	LOCATION	street : the
Colosseum	LOCATION	corresponds to the space between
Illinois	ORGANIZATION	and
Kinzie	PERSON	streets .

		The Theatre of
Pompey	LOCATION	, place of the greatest of assassinations , the fall of
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, lay almost exactly in the line of Erie street .

		The whole of old
Rome	LOCATION	, then , as bounded by the Aurelian Wall , lay between the latitudes of our
Schiller	PERSON	street and Van Buren street .

		Compared with our modern cities , the area of
Rome	LOCATION	was small .

		The Servian city , that is , the city included within the walls ascribed to
Servius Tullius	PERSON	, thus the city strictly , as known to
Caesar	LOCATION	,
Cicero	PERSON	, and
Horace	PERSON	had an area almost exactly two square miles ; our great fire of
1871	DATE	ran over three and one-fourth square miles of surface , or as much as the Servian city and sixty-two per cent more .

		The Aurelian Walls added about as much as our burnt area , say three and three-eighths square miles , making the new area 5.3228 square miles , say five and one-third square miles .

		In our city , the area bounded by North avenue and
Harrison	PERSON	street ,
Ashland	ORGANIZATION	avenue and the Lake Shore , is rather large for this .

		If now we add the later annexations west of the Ti - ber , the Leonine city , say nine-sixteenths of a square mile , we have a total area of 5.8831 square miles , al - most six miles ; less than is included by our
Chicago	LOCATION	avenue ,
Ashland	ORGANIZATION	avenue , Twenty - second street , and
State	ORGANIZATION	street .

		Such was the mighty ruler of the civil - ized world .

		It is to be wished that we could deal with population as we can with latitudes and areas .

		But a Roman cen - sus did not involve an enumeration of the whole popu - lation in our sense of the term : its main object was to make up the voting lists , dividing the voters into cen - turies , * the tax lists , and the military lists : hence we have not definite information .

		We have a census of houses taken by the emperor Theodosius , which found of the houses -LRB- domus -RRB- of the rich ,
1780	DATE	; and of the in - sulce , flats and dwellings of the middle class and poor , 46,602 .

		The population of
Rome	LOCATION	under the early emperors , say in the first century , is estimated by
Gibbon	PERSON	-LRB- chap , xxxi . -RRB-

		at 1,200,000 .

		With this ,
Milman	PERSON	, from whose notes I quote , agreed ;
Dureau de la Malle	ORGANIZATION	says 562 , - 000 , or less than half of
Gibbon	PERSON	's number .

		Zumpt says 2,000,000 ; Dr.
Thomas Henry Dyer	PERSON	, the sturdy de - fender of the reality of Romulus and
Numa Pompilius	LOCATION	, estimates aliens , 100,000 ; slaves , 800,000 ; and a total population of 2,045,000 .

		Hoeck raises it to 2,265,000 ; and
Lipsius	PERSON	crowns all with 8,000,000 !

		Where could he stow them away ?

		If we leave out
Lipsius	ORGANIZATION	's exag - geration and take the average of the estimates of the other six , we have 1,545,333 : a number not far from the present population of our city by the lake .

		But if
Chicago	LOCATION	be like old
Rome	LOCATION	in latitude and in population , God forbid that our city follow the other in the horrors of her history !

		I venture to call in question the ordinary der - ivation of this word from centum , a hundred .

		I think centu - ria to be an identical form from two unrelated roots , like jet , lake , last , scald , in English .

		Thus from centum we have cen - turia , a collection of a hundred things , and centurion ; but from censeo , with fundamental meaning to divide , discrimin - ate , we have century , a division of the people , censor , the officer who made the division , census , and censure ; and these have no relation to number .

		THE DIAL 171 Itfefo THE LIVES OF Two ENGLISH NATURALISTS .

		* The two eminent English naturalists , Pro- fessor
Richard Owen	PERSON	and
Dean Buckland	PERSON	, were for many years coadjutors in science , in phil - anthropy , and social reforms .

		Every measure for the general good received their hearty sym - pathy and support .

		They were men of integ - rity rare and fine , with personal traits adding the finishing grace to their mental endowments .

		They adorned the new learning , to which they lent dignity and distinction .

		The records of their life-work , published simultaneously by an American house , borrow interest from each other .

		They are fitting monuments to the mem - ory of two noble scholars and faithful expo - nents of the best spirit of the nineteenth century .

		It is illustrious and charming company to which we are introduced in the volumes com - memorating the life of
Richard Owen	PERSON	, `` the Cuvier of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		From the very outset of his career he came in contact with distin - guished personages , and , winning his way rap - idly among them , the circle of his friendly and familiar acquaintance widened , until seemingly it embraced every notable character from the heads of the
Royal House	ORGANIZATION	down through the various ranks of inherent and acquired nobility .

		He bore himself through it all with the quiet , simple grace of one born to the purple , or , bet - ter still , of one unconscious of worldly honors and successes , intent solely upon the accom - plishment of the work he was given to do .


Richard Owen	PERSON	was born in
Lancaster	LOCATION	in
1805	DATE	.

		His father dying in the boy 's early childhood , he was left to the care and guardian - ship of his mother , a woman of rare intelligence and refinement .

		She was of French extraction , and from her the son doubtless derived many of his mental gifts and personal attractions .

		As a schoolboy he did not in any way distin - guish himself , unless , as his sister said , by being '' very small and slight , and exceedingly mis - chievous . ''

		At the age of sixteen he was appren - ticed to a surgeon , who was , in the words of the *

		indenture , to teach him the '' arts , business , pro- fession and mysteries of a surgeon , apothecary , and man midwife , with every circumstance re - lating thereto . ''

		His new situation undoubtedly revealed him to himself , for he discovered imme - diately the pursuit for which he was endowed , that of dissecting animal organisms and dis - cerning their internal structure and relations .

		A term at the
Edinburgh University	ORGANIZATION	in the winter of 1824-25 was so faithfully improved that his chief medical instructor commended him to the patronage of the famous
Abernethy of St. Bartholomew 's Hospital	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Owen	PERSON	afterwards said : '' I shall never forget the day when I arrived for the first time in
London	LOCATION	, where I had literally not one sin - gle friend ... The sense of desolation which I expe - rienced in walking up Holborn towards
St. Bartholo	LOCATION	- mew 's Hospital ... was something indescribable . ''

		The contrast is sharp between this experi - ence of the desolate youth , not yet twenty-one , and that which , after a brief interval , enriched all his remaining years .

		Dr.
Abernethy	PERSON	di - vined his abilities at a glance , and gave him the post of prosector for his lectures .

		The following year he became a member of the
Royal College of Surgeons	ORGANIZATION	, and was appointed assistant curator of the
Museum	ORGANIZATION	, with a salary of
six hundred dollars	MONEY	a year .

		In another twelvemonth he was lecturing upon compara - tive anatomy at
St. Bartholomew 's Hospital	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor Owen earned his promotions by tire - less toil .

		In addition to his work as curator and lecturer , he cultivated a small medical prac - tice at
Lincoln	LOCATION	's Inn Fields , and gave his ser - vices liberally to the sick poor within his reach .

		He availed himself of the opportunity of dis - secting the animals which died under the care of the
Zoological Society	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, and thus secured valuable materials for increasing his knowledge of comparative anatomy .

		At the age of twenty-six he began the long and able series of original papers contributed to the various learned associations of
London	LOCATION	, and these papers soon procured him the rank of leading anatomist in
England	LOCATION	, and after the death of
Cuvier	LOCATION	, of all
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Eight of these valuable monographs were the product of his twenty - seventh year .

		Directly after them came the famous '' Memoir on the Pearly Nautilus , '' which established his repute everywhere among his peers .

		Along with this manifold and severe work , he was performing the herculean task of cataloguing the Hunterian Collections , compris - ing
3970	DATE	specimens , all requiring careful ex - amination and description .

		The completed lists filled five octavo volumes .

		They were the fruit 172 THE -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, of stupendous labor , but it had afforded their compiler a liberal education in his special de - partment .

		It is impossible to speak in detail of Owen 's achievements .

		They may be summed up in a passage from Professor Huxley : '' During more than half a century Owen 's industry continued unabated ; and whether we consider the quan - tity , or the quality , of the work done , or the wide range of his labors , I doubt if , in the long annals of anatomy , more is to be placed to the credit of any single worker . ''

		Among the men of letters who were drawn to the great master of science ,
Carlyle	PERSON	was con - spicuous , himself requesting an interview with '' the tall man with glittering eyes '' who had excited his interest .

		Visits were exchanged between them , after which
Owen	PERSON	said to his wife : `` I have such a dread of the personality of an author destroying in great measure his ideality , that I am pleased to find in this case that it is not so , and that
Carlyle	PERSON	proved to be , as far as 1 am concerned , much what one could wish . ''

		Carlyle described Owen as that rare thing among men , '' neither a fool nor a hum - bug . ''

		Mrs.
Owen	PERSON	jotted down in her journal , after one of
Carlyle	LOCATION	's interesting visits : '' It is curious how like his books
Carlyle	PERSON	's conversa - tion is .

		He grew very eloquent when telling us of the way in which he is plagued by people who would insist upon sending him their books .

		Young ladies especially often wanted his opinion on their poetry . '

		I hate po - etry , ' he said comically .

		I asked him if he hated Home 's '
Orion	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Ah , ' he said , ' Home 's a clever man . ' ''

		Leave should not be taken of the eminent anatomist without giving one example of his remarkable power of re-creating an entire ani - mal structure from a small given fact .

		The fragment of a thigh-bone , unearthed in
New Zealand	LOCATION	, was brought him by a sailor one day .

		It belonged to no existing creature , and its like Owen had never seen .

		After a brief inspection he drew the entire femur , and built upon it a gigantic wingless bird , which at full size would exceed the ostrich , reaching a stature of sixteen feet .

		The description he presented to the
Zoological Society	ORGANIZATION	excited intense surprise and incredulity .

		It was with difficulty that
Owen	PERSON	secured the admission of his monograph in the Proceedings of the Society .

		He waited with eagerness further discoveries of the skeleton of Zhnornis , as he named the huge bird .

		When in the course of years , bones composing the en - tire frame of the avian were found and for - warded to him , they conformed exactly with the structure he had prefigured .

		In
1856	DATE	, through the generous services of
Macaulay	DATE	, Professor Owen was appointed Su - perintendent of the
Departments of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	in the British Museum .

		To his per - sistent efforts in organizing and furthering the plan ,
England	LOCATION	owes the establishment of the superb institution at
South Kensington	LOCATION	, which houses the crowded and neglected collections formerly under the roof of the British Museum .

		With the completion of this enterprise in the
year 1883	DATE	, the work of the great anatomist was practically done .

		The Queen had generously furnished him a home in one of the houses per - taining to the crown
Sheen Lodge	ORGANIZATION	,
Richmond Park	LOCATION	, which his family are permitted still to occupy .

		He had declined the honor of knight - hood offered by Sir
Robert Peel	PERSON	in
1845	DATE	, but accepted it on a second presentation in his old age .

		Honors had fallen thick upon him dur - ing his long and distinguished career , and gen - tle , peaceful memories sweetened his declining years .

		His passing was with the
last days of 1892	DATE	, and like one gliding into dreamless sleep .

		Appended to his biography is a comprehen - sive and discriminating survey of '' Owen 's Po - sition in the History of
Anatomical Science	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor Huxley .

		A number of portraits and illustrations enrich the work , which is com - pleted by a bibliography of the scientific pa - pers published by Professor
Owen	PERSON	, covering fifty pages , a list of the honorary distinctions conferred upon him , numbering nearly a hun - dred , and an index .

		The life of Dean
Buckland	PERSON	carries us back to the early part of our century and the begin - ning of the acquisitions of modern science .

		He was one of the fathers of geology , who laid the foundations of that domain of knowledge , along with such intellectual giants as
Sedgwick	ORGANIZATION	,
Murchison	PERSON	, and
Lyell	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Buckland	PERSON	had the advantage of a training in natural history from his boyhood , his father , the Rev.
Charles Buck	PERSON	- land of
Devon	LOCATION	, carefully directing his atten - tion , in their daily walks , to the fossils which abounded in the lias rocks underlying the soil of his native section of the southern sea coast .

		The rocks '' stared rne in the face , '' he declared years after ; '' they wooed me , and caressed me , saying at every turn , ' Pray be a geologist ! '

		He could not resist the appeal , especially as his inborn proclivities , stimulated by a parent 's enthusiasm , moved him to the study of the earth 's antiquity as recorded in libraries of mineral and stone .

		At
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, which he entered in
1801	DATE	, the same influences were about him , and in his early residence he took his first lesson in field

		THE DIAL 173 geology , iu a walk to Shotover Hill .

		The stones he brought back from that day 's excur - sion formed the nucleus of a collection that grew , through forty years , into the largest and most valuable private store of the kind in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope .

		The youth took his university degree with honors in
1804	DATE	, and five years after was elected a Fellow of
Corpus Christi College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same year he was admitted into Holy Or - ders .

		Geology was not then admitted into the curriculum at the
University	ORGANIZATION	, nor recognized by many of the grave and reverend teachers as worthy the consideration of a Christian being .

		Young
Buckland	PERSON	persisted in the study ; and as he started on one of his periodical tours of research , the devout Dean
Gaisford	PERSON	exclaimed with satisfaction : '' Well ,
Buckland	PERSON	is gone to
Italy	LOCATION	; so , thank God , we shall hear no more of this geology '' Neither
Buckland	PERSON	nor geology were to be suppressed , however , and in
1813	DATE	he was made
Reader of Mineralogy	ORGANIZATION	in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and in
1819	DATE	was elevated to a full Professorship of his beloved subject .

		He toiled like a hero to reduce the chaotic materials at hand into a dis - tinct and systematic science , and spent all his leisure and money in travels over
England	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	to observe and classify fossils and strata in situ and in cabinets , and get them arranged and mapped out in something like regular and comprehensible order .

		His classes at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	were well attended , as he possessed uncommon tact and talent as a lecturer .

		Full of ardor , of genial good humor , of keen , ready wit , with apt powers of description , he kept his audiences on every occasion tense with interest in the theme he was expounding .

		Always vivacious , merry , and kindly , he was as attractive and persuasive in conversation as in a set discourse .

		Says Professor Masqueline : '' Nothing came amiss to him , from the creation of the world to the latest news in town ; ... through all intermediate time , he was equally at home ... There were few subjects which he could not more or less illus - trate .

		In build , look , and manner he was a thorough English gentleman , and was appreciated in every circle . ''

		He was the first to interpret the significance of the bone-caves in
Europe	LOCATION	, and the result of his discoveries and theories regarding them was published in
1823	DATE	, in a volume entitled , '' Re - liquiae Diluvianae , '' which is still regarded as a classic , despite the changes opinion has under - gone meantime .

		The facts treasured in the book give it lasting value .

		In
1825	DATE	Dr.
Buckland	PERSON	was appointed to a canonry at
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, and the home he then established , by the aid of a partner who was in every respect a perfect mate , was renowned for its cheerful and charming hospitality .

		It was a scene of delightful order in disorder , where the happiest events were sure to be evoked from circumstances always picturesque and often startling .

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	states , from his knowledge of them during his student life , that the Doctor , with his wife and family , had '' orig - inality enough in the sense of them to give sap and savor to the whole College ... All were frank , kind , and clever , vital in the highest degree ; to me , medicinal and saving . ''

		Another writer , telling of the amiable freedom that per - vaded the household , which comprised an ex - traordinary assemblage of animate and inani - mate creatures , relates that '' Guinea-pigs were often running over the table ; and occasionally the pony , having trotted down the steps from the garden , would push open the dining-room door , and career round the table , with three laughing children on his back , and then marching through the front door , and down the steps , would continue his course round
Tom Quad	PERSON	. ''

		There was wise discipline to counteract such unusual license , and parents and children pre - sent many a wholesome example in their busy and lovely home-life .

		How the seniors of the household ever found time to sleep , is a mys - tery ; for they appear to have used the
night	TIME	as well as the day in diligent reading , writing , and study .

		For example , pondering over the fossil footprints on a slab of sandstone , between two and three o'clock in the morning , the Doc - tor suddenly called up his wife to make a paste , while he rushed to bring in a pet tortoise from its haunt in the back yard .

		On his return the paste was duly spread over the kitchen table , the tortoise placed upon it , and , to the delight of the excited couple , the animal traced in the plastic dough an exact reproduction of `` the foot - prints on the sandstone .

		It was a happy so - lution of the problem .

		Their life was a ceaseless round of investi - gations and experiments .

		Even meal-time was a period of practical investigation .

		Lord Play - fair recollects various queer dishes of the Doc - tor 's contriving . ''

		The hedgehog was a suc - cessful experiment , and both
Liebig	PERSON	and I thought it good and tender . ''

		A dish of croco - dile , on the other hand , proved an utter fail - ure .

		As in a similar attempt with garden snails , it was impossible to swallow a mouthful .

		Such incidents were a perpetual spice in the life of the
Bucklands	LOCATION	, and gratefully enliven - ing to their guests and friends .

		After a residence of forty-five years at Ox - ford , from
1801	DATE	to
1845	DATE	,
Canon Bucklaud	ORGANIZATION	was 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, promoted to the
Deanery of Westminister	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here he infused the same vigor into his ad - ministration that had been manifest in all pre - vious undertakings , and reforms and amend - ments were the rule throughout his new prov - ince .

		There was with him no conflict between science and religion .

		He had faith in their fundamental harmony , and both were pursued in a consistent , thorough-going manner for the benefit of mankind .

		An insidious disease laid its paralysing hand upon him several years be - fore his death , quenching his ardor and cutting short his usefulness .

		When , in
1856	DATE	, at the age of seventy-two , his final summons came , the earth was poorer for the loss of one who had devoted his rich and varied talents to the enlightenment and elevation of his fellow - bein g g -

		THE ANTEN ^ JE ix POETRY .

		* THE PHILISTINE .

		I do n't like Whitman .

		I like either Poetry or Prose when they are good .

		But this is something betwixt and between , neither one nor another .

		I ca n't give it a name .

		I do n't like it .

		THE AMATEUR -LRB- is silent -RRB- .

		If the reader can conceive of Poetry under the guise of a member of the sub-order Hy - menoptera , he will be able to begin this article without trouble .

		The comparison is possibly a quaint one , but it is not wholly out of the way .

		I read of the Hymenoptera , that '' the mouth-parts are well developed both for biting and feeding on the sweets of plants , the ligula especially , used in lapping nectar , being greatly developed . ''

		The wings are said to be '' adapted for powefful and long-sustained flight , '' which is very well , although some people who write poetry are like some exceptional members of the Hymenoptera and have no wings at all .

		It is also said of this sub-order or I sometimes hear of it as an order that '' they have very large heads -LSB- which seems to me character - istic -RSB- , with large compound eyes and three ocelli . ''

		Some of them have stings .

		So if the muse of Poetry should ask me what costume to wear to the fancy ball , I should say , '' Go as one of the higher and more typical forms of Hymenoptera . ''

		Interesting as are the wings and the mandi - bles , and the nectar-lapping ligula , I find more present interest in the antennae .

		The antenna -RCB- are the sort of feelers that a Hymenopteron sticks out in front of himself , to see where he is going , to experiment , to investigate , to bring himself into relation with things lying a bit be - yond his particular sphere .

		They fulfil a very useful function , for Poetry or indeed for any kind of art , being always on the look-out for things that are new and edifying and amusing . ''

		Vistas , '' by Mr.
William Sharp	PERSON	, is then an experiment , or a series of experiments .

		When Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	asked the author what his aim was in writing such things , what was the purpose he would realize , Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	found it exceed - ingly difficult to make a definite answer ; and the reader will perhaps pardon me if I am not abso - lutely categorical either .

		It is , however , obvious that we have here new modes of conceiving things and new means of expression .

		The eleven pieces which make up '' Vistas '' are of the nature of reveries , of visions which have been given as clear a form as could well be .

		Questionings as to the mys - tery of life , passionate struggles of love , brood - ings on the origin of sin and its influence upon this life and that which is to come , imaginations concerning the life but just beyond the grave , a playing on the chords where love and death are bound together , such things as these have taken form and are presented to us in these dra - matic interludes .

		Now , since these matters are of course by no means extraordinary topics , the experimentary character lies in the mode of their conception , or , perhaps more properly , of their presentation .

		They are not conceived in any approach to the classic manner , but in a manner ultra romantic .

		For although the main emotion is always present before us , it is not presented simply , but always by means of a multitude of extremely fine and delicate nuances .

		Indefinite hopes and fears , presen - timents , imaginings of spiritual accompani - ment , premonitions almost occult , faint rip - plings of emotion , the little wavelets that skim over the waves of passion , it is in such forms that Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	conceives his subjects and in such forms that he presents them to us .

		To me it seems that he is remarkably successful in communicating to us the emotion that he has it at heart to give : the touches are slight , but the effect is cumulative .

		Somewhat new as is his mode of expression , the means of expres - sion is also an experiment .

		The '' dramatic in - terlude '' is what Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	calls it .

		Here I
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 175 must confess I do not think him so successful .

		Most dramatic pieces convey their impression chiefly by the speeches of the characters .

		So do some here .

		But others have much more stage direction . ''

		The Passion of Pere
Hila	PERSON	- rion '' consists chiefly of narrative and descrip - tive passages , with one long dialogue in the middle . ''

		The Lute Player '' has hardly a hint of dramatic form , except for being printed in two kinds of type .

		It is at least an extension of the usual conception of the word `` dramatic '' to apply it to such work .

		It may be pictorial , but it is hardly dramatic .

		It is possibly very
Philistine	LOCATION	, but it has seemed to me in reading several of the pieces that the chief thing dra - matic about them is the manner of printing .

		I should like to see a copy printed with the stage direction in large print and the speeches not given each a line to itself .

		This would do much to take away the dramatic character which they seem to possess in the mind of the author .

		They would then be seen to be mostly prose phantasies , not very different in structure from a good deal of De Quincey .

		It seems to have been hinted that Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	is an imitator of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		There is certainly a superficial resemblance between the two which lies largely in the fact that both use a dramatic form , both have a very pictorial way of conceiving things , both have a certain studied simplicity of diction , both endeavor earnestly to give an indefinite sort of toning to every sit - uation .

		But in some important respects they are certainly very different .

		In the power of conceiving and presenting character ,
M. Mae	PERSON	- terlinck is immensely the superior .

		Mr. Sharp presents situations vividly enough , but such characters as he presents vanish from the mind almost before they enter it .

		In '' The Coming of the Prince '' and `` A Northern Night `` the two pairs of lovers are merely two pairs of lovers , and not four people .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, on the other hand , discriminates very delicately .

		The King in '' The Princess Maleine '' is very dif - ferent from the King in '' The Seven Sisters , '' and both differ from the King in '' Pelleas and Melisande . ''

		As to the value of the characters , opinions may differ ; but the power of conceiv - ing and drawing is conspicuous .

		This means , to my mind , that
M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck is a true dramatist .

		Eccentric in many of his ideas , he undoubtedly creates persons and sets them in relation to each other .

		It seems , rather , as though he then left them to pursue their own devices .

		Some of his plays have a very definite scheme and structure , but others seem extremely incoherent .

		Still , the reader is carried along , even though he may not always be sure whither or why .


M. Maeter	PERSON	- linck has evidently no such definite elements of subject-matter as has Mr. Sharp .

		The atmos - phere of the two is entirely different .

		Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	's world is sensuous -LRB- one may be allowed to suggest that it is somewhat improper -RRB- , full of the delight of color and odor , glowing and throbbing with life .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's is low - toned , troubled , generally of a malefic green tone .

		His characters are always in gloomy and awe-inspiring places -LRB- the weight of evil seems brooding over everything -RRB- , but they never seem to have any understanding of their rela - tion to their surroundings .

		One feels that if any one of the characters could make a violent effort he might wake from the nightmare and have no more to do with it .

		Of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	there is much more to be said .

		It was a pity that anyone called him the Belgian Shakespeare , and also that everyone bothers about his symbolism .

		But these mat - ters , and many others , I must leave on one side .

		It may be remarked that Mr.
Hovey	PERSON	's translation is very much better than Mr.
Winslow	PERSON	's .

		But both give a good idea of the original .

		Such work as this , and as Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	's , is at once a challenge and a stimulus , and as such , one is glad to receive it .

		A certain artist , in writing of landscape painting , remarked , '' To this sort of man -LSB- the Philistine -RSB- it does not seem possible that
Monet	PERSON	or Pizzarro can seri - ously think that their pictures in any way sug - gest nature .

		Goliath is quite convinced that they paint in that manner from perversity , chiefly to irritate him . ''

		So with Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	and
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		But we must not think thus .

		There have been those who wrote strange things merely to astonish and bewilder and irri - tate the ordinary person .

		But the work of these men has too much to it to be that kind of thing .

		It is the work of men who are striving to ex - tend our power of feeling and of expression ; and as such , one welcomes it gladly , and tries to gain its secret and its method .

March 16	DATE	, THE STORY OF DEAN CHURCH 'S IJFE .

		* '' A book of letters rather than a complete biography , '' such is the modest claim made by the editor of the `` Life and Letters of Dean Church . ''

		We think the reader 's verdict will be that a book of letters thus edited comes quite near enough to a complete biography .

		Certainly the best biographies in our language are little more than well-edited correspondence , or , as in the case of ''
Boswell	PERSON	's
Johnson	PERSON	, '' notes of familiar conversation ; and nothing is so like good talk as a good letter .

		Whatever
Miss Church	ORGANIZATION	's own work might seem to lack is abund - antly supplied by Dean
Paget	PERSON	's Preface and
Canon Scott-Holland	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant estimate .

		`` The letters , '' writes the Dean , `` tell the story of their writer 's life ; what he was in the depth of char - acter and personality , must be left untold . ''

		Doubtless all that close friends saw in Dean Church can not be told , but '' the distinctive notes of his mind and work '' are clearly and sufficiently indicated in this very attractive volume .

		The person thus outlined before us proves to be well worth considering .

		It was said of him , on his election as Fellow of
Oriel	ORGANIZATION	, that '' there is such moral beauty about Church that they could not help taking him '' ; and that seemed the general judgment among those who knew him when
Gladstone	PERSON	drew him from his rural retirement and made him Dean of
St. Paul 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is what you feel in all his writings the moral beauty of the man , a measure and charm which are no tricks of a well-trained pen , but the natural outcome of character .

		It is not the beauty of flexible weakness , but of polished strength ; the beauty not of a fragile carving but of a columnar shaft finely proportioned to bear its burden to the best advantage .

		Large intelligence , thorough scholarship , rare and del - icate taste , simple and earnest devotion , were all combined with a certain judicial poise , a just measure in thought and conduct .

		The friend and disciple of
Newman	PERSON	and
Pusey	PERSON	, he was the partisan of neither , and could recognize the worth of
Arnold	LOCATION	and the chivalry of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was himself of weight oftener by a certain unconscious influence than by any direct effort .

		His character acted as a force .

		Holding him - self apart in a certain wise reserve , he the more thoroughly affected the judgment and conduct of his fellows .

		It was less what he said than what 1 * THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF DEAN CHURCH .

		he did not say that checked and repressed them .

		His silences were speeches ; his suppressions were verdicts .

		Wisely bold at need , he had no love of figuring at the front of the stage .

		He had greatness thrust upon him .

		He could be gen - erous and expect no recognition .

		You can not think of his taking an unfair advantage or at - tempting to hold untenable ground .

		He knew how to handle hot coals without fanning them into a blaze .

		He could write history from one side of a controverted position , and remain im - partial just to opponents , and no more than just to friends .

		Miss Church has caught her father 's mood .

		No line of hers can embitter controversy .

		She has set forth the moral beauty , the placid wis - dom , the sweet temper , of her father 's life ; has measured fairly his relative importance in his time , and has kept her story within moderate bounds which is something that sufferers from some recent biographies may well be grateful for .

		She nowhere errs by exaggeration or ex - cess .

		You feel that she loved her father too well to risk an over-estimate of his place in his - tory ; that she knew too well his refined taste , his sober judgment , his native modesty of spirit , to jar them even in the grave .

Chicago	LOCATION	:

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL popular presentation of the interesting matters of science is to be commended .

		Professor Mach , of the
University of Prague	ORGANIZATION	, is a master in physics , so much so that he sees as few others do that some of our fundamental conceptions and phraseology need attention even more than fresh experimental results , as his recent book on '' Mechanics '' shows ; a book , by the way , that I heartily wish every teacher of physics would read and digest .

		These '' Pop - ular Lectures '' treat of various subjects , such as '' The Forms of Liquids , '' ' The Causes of Harmony , '' '' The Velocity of Light , '' '' The Principle of the
Conservation of Energy	ORGANIZATION	, '' in a way easy to apprehend by persons who have had no special training in physics .

		There are others on more recondite subjects .

		The lec - ture on '' The Fundamental Concepts of
Elec	ORGANIZATION	- trostatics '' is interesting and helpful to every - one , however familiar with the subject , for it is much simplified by the treatment .

		The last three or four chapters rise into phil - osophy , and in them the relationships that phys - ics bear to other lines of thought and human interest are treated .

		The one on '' Mental Adaptation '' is excellent , for it calls attention to the necessity for ideality in science .

		We have been so busy gathering the facts of sci - ence , that but little attention has been given to their signification , and many scientific men have come as far short in their judgments of men and of things as have any of those who knew nothing of science .

		In the teaching of physics it is assumed generally that one must become familiar with a great number of facts before he can be permitted to generalize at all .

		Professor
Mach	PERSON	says substantially that it is not needful to know very much that is , many details of a subject in order to understand fundamental principles .

		If this idea were gen - eral , it would make much difference in the amount and kind of instruction given in schools of all grades .

		Finally , the lecturer takes a hand in the old controversy about the curriculum , and speaks as one familiar with the data on both sides of the question as to the relative value of classical and scientific educations .

		Altogether the book is a good one , and will serve a good purpose , both for instruction and suggestion .

		The translation , by Mr.
T. J. Mc	PERSON	-
Cormack	PERSON	, is well done ; and the
Open Court Company	ORGANIZATION	has put the work into a very present - able volume of three hundred pages .

		SOME RECENT BOOKS ON SOCIAL , SUBJECTS .

		* In this article we give a suggestion of the con - tents and points of view of a dozen or more writers who start from very different grounds .

		Five of these relate to some phase of socialism ; one to the social management of dependents and defectives ; and the others to special problems or local interests .

		Professor
Flint	LOCATION	's work on Socialism grew out of a course of lectures to workingmen , and some arti - cles in '' Good Words . ''

		The style is clear , strong , and popular .

		The author is a distinguished writer on philosophy , and the teaching of economics in earlier years made him familiar with the elements of this discipline .

		The first chapters offer a survey of the historical phases of socialism and
State	ORGANIZATION	inter - vention .

		Some of the most important documents of recent theories are printed , and references to re - cent discussions are frequent .

		The doctrines of
Marx	ORGANIZATION	are somewhat fully analyzed .

		The relations of socialism to labor , capital , land , social organiza - tion , democracy , morality , and religion are discussed in other chapters .

		The standpoint is that of ortho - dox political economy , and
M. Leroy-Beaulieu	PERSON	is quoted as a favorite interpreter .

		Socialism is de - fined as '' any theory of social organization which sacrifices the legitimate liberties of individuals to the will or interests of the community . ''

		Pure in - dividualism is repudiated as the opposite extreme .

		The fundamental doctrines of

		178 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, posterous to seek a measure of wages in a mere time standard .

		Mr.
George	PERSON	's half-way socialism is re - jected .

		The author once believed in the absorption by society of the '' unearned increment , '' but now accompanies Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	in abandoning the doc - trine .

		The government that should attempt to man - age all industrial enterprises would break down under the weight of administration .

		Democracy organized in socialism would perish under the hands of a corrupt element .

		Democracy can exist only as it reverences ability and moral greatness , while so - cialism would debase life with its materialistic ethics .

		The fundamental error and evil in current social - ism is its denial of the true grounds of morality .

		It is a Hegelian dialectic , with matter in place of idea as creative force .

		Circumstances are said to deter - mine life , and character is effect and not cause of prosperity .

		There is a one-sided emphasis on econ - omic forces .

		Duties to God are ignored .

		Personal morality is sacrificed to society , and the individual is not esteemed as an end in himself , but is looked upon as an atom or organ in a great Leviathan .

		It is admitted that not all socialists are thus commit - ted to an agnostic and unethical view of the world , but the dominant forces move in this direction .

		What the world has called theft they re-christen justice .

		Their opposition to war and class oppres - sion is recognized as worthy of praise , but their con - stant and general appeals to class hatreds tend to produce the worst of all wars , that of citizens against each other .

		As to the attitude of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the author declares that it has no political or economi - cal programme .

		The Church can do its work under any form of government or industrial organization .

		If socialism succeeds , profound changes would come , but religion would find its best form of expression .

		Of course , with the immoral and irreligious dog - mas of socialism , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is forced into an atti - tude of uncompromising antagonism .

		Whatever measures the socialists propose for the true amelio - ration of mankind should find in the Church hearty support .

		The function of the preacher is judiciously distinguished from that of editor , statesman , and economist . ''

		The power of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, just because the more extended and superficial , may seem the greater , but is really the lesser .

		Spiritual force is mightier than material force . ''

		The Church can well afford to be content with the use of the primary and highest motives of conduct .

		The object of Professor
Nicholson	PERSON	's vigorous at - tack on Socialism is to '' test the ideal by the real , the possible future by the actual past . ''

		Altruism has not yet come to the dominating position assigned to it in
Kidd	PERSON	's '' Social Evolution '' and
Drummond	PERSON	's `` Ascent of Man . ''

		The standing armies of
Europe	LOCATION	and the recent railroad strikes in
America	LOCATION	are evi - dences that the old Adam of egoism must be con - sidered in our calculations of the possible .

		Yet in - dustrial progress is not due to a mere struggle for existence , and must be accounted for by consider - ing characteristic human qualities .

		Biological an - alogies are misleading , since economic advance is due to '' the suppression of those animal instincts and the substitution for them of propensities and practices peculiar to man , '' to invention , language , and free contract .

		Socialism is condemned by his - tory because it involves ruinous taxation , abolition of exchange , the suppression of liberty , security , and private property .

		The State is not a good instru - ment for the management of capital and the regu - lation of income .

		Short of socialism , governmental agencies may do much to promote self-help . ''

		The growth of knowledge and industry opens up new possibilities for the beneficial action of the
State	ORGANIZATION	and the municipalities , and even imposes on them new duties . ''

		The classic political economists are de - fended from the charge of ignoring social sympathies and the beneficent activity of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		One does not find here , however , any statement of a princi - ple of inclusion and exclusion in respect to State functions . ''

		Three Months in a Workshop '' is a remark - able account of a singular experience .


Paul Gohre	PERSON	, a young divinity graduate , wished to learn at first hand the facts about the life of German working - men .

		He entered a machine shop in
Saxony	LOCATION	, worked eleven hours a day as a common laborer , conversed with the men , attended socialistic meet - ings , and went to the places of amusement .

		His study has produced a deep impression in
Germany	LOCATION	, and the author has been made Secretary of the
Evan	PERSON	- gelical
Social Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Deep and extreme want he did not find .

		The worst feature of the material condition was the inhuman crowding of dwellings .

		Low wages compels the larger families to take in boarders .

		Practical communism takes the place of separate family life .

		Socialistic philosophy is nat - ural to those who are thus compelled to live in com - mon. .

		Food and dress are suitable and sufficient , and excessive drinking is not common . ''

		The use of domestic beer at seven pfennigs the bottle was constantly on the increase , and more and more took the place of brandy drinking .

		The chief cause of this change is the invention of the familiar patent cork ; and the workman who formerly bad his brandy flask in his pocket now carries an equally transportable bottle of beer .

		So a small technical invention becomes a great social and ethical influ - ence , and accomplishes more than many sermons and efforts at reform . ''

		The technical processes in the factory are described in detail : the military or - ganization , social classifications , moral effects of in - terior arrangements , and the material environment .

		There is a vivid picture of socialistic agitation , and of the educational , religious , and moral habits of the laboring people .

		The author finds that the labor question is not merely a stomach or wage question , but an educational and religious question of the first importance .

		There is an ardent longing for more re - spect and recognition , for larger share in the knowl - edge and culture of the age .

		Social democracy is the mouthpiece of the labor movement .

		in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 179 '' No liberal trades unions , no young men 's Christian associations , no evangelical working-men 's unions , can stem this process of evolution . ''

		Social democracy may be directed , elevated , regenerated , but can not be destroyed .

		What the government can do to alle - viate their lot should be attempted with their good - will , and after consulting them , not in the way of lofty patronage by the '' upper '' classes .

		What the Church can do must follow the same principle .

		So - cial democracy is now closely bound up with materi - alism .

		Its philosophy of life is narrow and de - grading .

		If learned professors and pastors have a higher view of life they must descend from their pedestals and mingle with the people , in order to diffuse the culture for which many of the socialists are really hungry .

		Parish work must be organized to cover all the territory and touch all the social needs of each community .

		The
Social Congress	ORGANIZATION	must awaken and direct the interest of educated men and women , so that they will learn how to come in contact with the democracy , educate the working classes , and inspire them with higher ideals of life .

		The translation of this work is smooth and clear , and great care has been taken to render technical terms as accurately as possible .

		Professor
Ely	PERSON	has taken great pains to have the work thoroughly done , and his Introduction indicates the place of the book in current discussion .

		The Rev.
S. A. Barnett	PERSON	and his wife have lived in the classic region of poverty , face to face with the pathetic reality , and have maintained high ideals of a beautiful human life .

		This second edition of their '' Practicable Socialism , '' an already famous work , has an Introduction which gives a '' twenty years ' retrospect . ''

		In one of the essays , long before the Dockers ' strike , they had pleaded for the organiza - tion of the undisciplined mob who fought each other for an odd job at the wharf gates .

		Now they can say , '' It is satisfactory that dock labor is organized . ''

		Other objects of their social effort have been gained . ''

		Workmen are eligible as guardians , houses have been built fit for habitation , free libraries , open spaces , and baths have been opened , the poor-law administration has been made more humane , public opinion against impurity is strengthened , some of the restrictions imposed by a narrow code on chil - dren 's education have been removed , twenty thou - sand or thirty thousand children spend their holi - days in the country , the status of young servants has been raised , the People 's Palace and polytech - nics have been provided , universal pensions and agricultural training farms are within the range of practical politics , the offer of the best the best pictures , the best music to all is not so unusual , the entertainment of the poor as equals is not so uncommon , and university settlements have been started . ''

		But work remains to be done . ''

		There has been no attempt to fit the Church for its work . ''

		Dishonesty , gambling , and impertinence have in - creased .

		Dole charity is still expected to relieve the poor , whereas the chief aid must come from so - cialized effort to '' make poor neighborhoods as clean , as healthy , as well provided with means of study , cleanliness , and play , as rich neighborhoods .

		These things stimulate and do not paralyze energy . ''

		The criticism of
Chicago	LOCATION	life , after a visit here , deserves serious reflection .

		The pages are crowded with practical suggestions of ways in which philanthro - pists can study , help , and humanize the life of the poor : but on one condition that they live with the poor , and know them personally and in natural re - lations , as Mr. and Mrs.
Barnett	PERSON	know them .

		The writer of '' Towards Utopia '' resolutely re - fuses to attempt to wade an ocean or walk to the moon .

		He insists that we can take but one step at a time .

		Experience , however , tells us at a given moment the wisest direction for the step .

		We should begin at home and relieve the burdens of the ser - vant girls .

		These modern helpers of domestic life have breathed the air of democracy .

		They are half - conscious of the vast change which all society has undergone .

		They resent badges of inferiority , and their assertion of womanhood in curious and trying ways must be met by a frank and honest adaptation to the fact of democracy .

		The illustrations of waste of food , clothing , time , strength , and even of cigar ashes and stumps , are very interesting .

		The author does not seem to be aware of the difficulties of mak - ing the sewage of cities into fertilizers in such a place as
London	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	.

		The criticism of lingering caste spirit and caste immoralities is search - ing and caustic .

		The epithets sometimes come close to billingsgate idioms , but the level of view is high enough .

		The chief value of the book lies in its specific examples of the vices of the rich and lux - urious , and of many who regard themselves as very patterns of goodness .

		Few persons can read the pages without being startled and made to wince under the keen discernment of the lines .

		Possibly some of the proposed reforms are not practicable , and not '' towards Utopia , '' but the exposure of fol - lies and wrongs is wholesome .

		The author 's agnos - ticism , his despair of immortality , and certain other very gloomy vistas of life , will be judged by each reader according to his own life philosophy .

		It is only fair to notify the reader that such views are in the book .

		But the tendency of the work must be to make believers in democracy and Christianity both live up to their creed , or be uncomfortable with their consciences if they refuse .

		Mr.
Kelley	PERSON	's teaching , in `` The Law of Service , '' is that the ethical law of life is the law of the ut - most possible service .

		Whatever may be in ques - tion , this is certainly of the essence of Christianity .

		The Church has always recognized the law , but its view has been obstructed by egoistic and introspec - tive habits of mind .

		Sermons fall short of their full force , because they teach too little aud pass over difficult duties with commonplaces . ''

		The feeble - ness and inconsequence of the average prayer-meet - ing need only be mentioned .

		The inefficiency of the
Sunday	DATE	School is monumental . ''

		Selfishness rules 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, our social life , and vulgar ostentation desecrates even the sanctuary .

		The rich and the poor do not meet on fraternal terms in the house of God .

		Du - ties to dumb animals hardly find place in religious instruction .

		Business and politics become corrupt because they are divorced from religion .

		Art , fallen from the law of human service , pursued for its own sake , ministering only to the rich , becomes de - graded ; only under the law of utmost service can it become noble and enduring .

		Art is a slave when it serves mere luxury .

		Literature becomes worthy , in journalism and books , only as it is altruistic .

		Col - leges and universities used simply for the conven - ience of a class , and given over to research without teaching , are checked in their development .

		The writer is a believer in Christianity , and his criti - cism is intended to be the wound of a friend .

		It has something of the faithful searching quality of the old Covenanters . ''

		American Charities '' is a welcome volume , the ripe fruit of scientific study and of the author 's expe - rience as a superintendent of charities , and it deserves special notice .

		It presents the select results of the discussions of the specialists who form the
National Conference of Charities	ORGANIZATION	and Corrections , fused into one logical whole by long reflection .

		The field of view is indicated by the title .

		The social treatment of the criminal is only incidentally touched .

		Atten - tion is concentrated upon the almshouse , out-door relief , the unemployed dependent children , the des - titute sick , the insane and feeble-minded .

		A care - ful review of the causes of poverty and degenera - tion , personal and social , illustrates the great value of statistics in social inquiry .

		Under the topic ''
Phil	PERSON	- anthropic Financiering '' the author discusses public and private charities , endowments , and public subsi - dies to private charities .

		He has studied
Chicago	LOCATION	char - ities , and finds them chaotic and full of grave abuses , due to absence of charity organization .

		The list of books cited , and a full index , make the work con - venient for reference .

		The style is sober , yet inter - esting , and the attacks on wrongs of administration are frequently shrewd and incisive .

		It is the best work available for its purpose .

		The luminous ac - count of the objects , methods , and machinery of charity organization would of itself give a high place to the discussion .

		Mr.
Tolman	PERSON	's book on '' Municipal Reform Move - ments in the
United States	LOCATION	'' is a timely and perti - nent publication .

		The author 's association with Dr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	in the
City Vigilance League of New York	ORGANIZATION	has given him exceptional means of studying the new movements and methods of municipal re - form .

		Dr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	furnishes a suggestive intro - duction to his work .

		Part I. discusses the '' Civic Renaissance , '' and lays down the ethical principles and social forces of the movement .

		Here are dis - cussed the functions of the city , the causes of the awakening and of encouragement , and the way to utilize the victory .

		In Part II .

		we have eighty-four pages devoted to an account of the municipal re - form movement in the leading cities and large towns of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In Part III .

		the author gives the names and principles of the educational organ - izations .

		In Part IV .

		we have an exhibition of the increased activities of women in promoting civic righteousness .

		In Part V. the
City Vigilance League	ORGANIZATION	is treated as the typical organization of the
United States	LOCATION	for municipal progress , and a more detailed explanation is offered of its origin and methods .

		In a volume of a little over two hundred pages we have a fairly complete story of the present state of the effort in this country .

		The materials for plans of organization are here supplied in a most conven - ient form .

		The study of '' Un-American Immigration '' is based on the census of
1890	DATE	.

		It is an argument against free immigration of foreigners , rather than an investigation .

		The conclusions reached relate to a law regulating the subject : it should be gen - eral and not special , excluding the unfit but admit - ting others without distinction of race ; illiterate im - migrants should be excluded ; each one must have money for his support for at least six months ; crim - inals and paupers should be deported at the cost of the transporting company ; immigrants must de - clare their intention in respect to naturalization , and only those naturalized should vote ; the law should be enforced by officers free from bias .

		To enforce these recommendations , the influence of immigra - tion on crime , pauperism , illiteracy , and corrupt pol - itics , is traced .

		The statement made on page 56 , in respect to the apparent increase of crime , is mis - leading , as Mr.
F. H. Wines	PERSON	has pointed out .

		The suggestion that child labor is due to immigration alone leaves out of account the universal effect of factory organization in the absence of rigid legisla - tive control .

		The collection of statistics will be found convenient , and the general effect of the dis - cussion ought to be helpful .

		A very depressing picture of social conditions in the South is that drawn by Mr.
Otken	PERSON	.

		There is a description of the desolations of the Civil War , the consequent poverty of the whites , the suspicion and hate of the blacks , the heavy taxation imposed by the carpet-bag governments .

		The author tells of a merchant class which is growing rich out of the farmers , but he does not seem to explain the abundant supply of blood for so many leeches .

		Then he reveals the cause of the ruin of the far - mers , by telling us that they keep no accounts , have no idea what compound interest means , and insist on impoverishing their land by excessive growth of one kind of crop .

		He insists on the obsolete method of computing ante-bellum wealth by adding the market value of slaves .

		He declares that the negro is a hopeless failure .

		Education is wasted on him .

		He will not work regularly , but he will lie and steal .

		In both North and South he eats more than his share of penitentiary bread .

		The only hope of the South is in transporting the whole race to Af - rica .

		But the author himself suggests here and
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 181 there the outlines of a more humane and practicable policy .

		What certain industrial schools have done for some of the blacks , they can do for all .

		Some - thing more is required than the '' Three R 's , '' and this by the poor whites as well as by the blacks .

		The difficulties are intellectual and moral , and there - fore can be overcome by changes within human power .

		The case is a hard one ; but the writer gracefully shows that
Northern	ORGANIZATION	philanthropy and Southern self-help have already removed many ob - stacles to the splendid future which a great and noble and brave people ought to expect for them - selves .

		The book gives many statistics with illus - trative examples , but the presentation is too pes - simistic to be complete .

		`` Young West '' is a sequel to
Bellamy	PERSON	's `` Look - ing Backward , '' another castle in the air .

		One can imagine anything which can be constructed out of mundane materials .

		Plato in picturing an ideal Republic , More in giving us his fancy of
Utopia	LOCATION	,
John	PERSON	the Seer in presenting the
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	, must employ the materials furnished by actual life .

		This author can not escape from the nineteenth cen - tury , and the attempt to do so is amusing .

		Telephones are somewhat improved ; aluminum is so cheap and plentiful that columns and beams are made of it ; glass is substituted for stone ; but there is no new machine , no new law .

		Romancers must wait for men of science and invention .

		Some of the social changes expected by socialists are promised : an eight-hour day , and all working ; women serving their time in the industrial army ; bad tempers are cured by mesmerism , and electrified water is used for a disinfectant ; volapiik is the universal language ; family affection is pale and feeble ; death is with - out a pang and without a hope ; in a funeral dis - course , God is not hinted at ;
Vedas	LOCATION	,
Koran	LOCATION	, and Bible are all put on a forgotten shelf , for reasons which would consign much of
Shakespeare , Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and all the rest , to oblivion ; hope of immortality perishes , because the earth has become so comfortable for all ; children are brought up by state officers , and so bereavement of families falls lightly .

		The outlook is that in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's picture of the despairing agnostic , '' love and die . ''

		One can hardly tell whether the work is interpretation of materialistic communism or its caricature .

		In '' Social Growth and Stability '' the author 's purpose is `` to promote a better understanding in regard to men 's relations to one another , and to stimulate increased effort in behalf of the unfor - tunate wage-earners . ''

		He has had business expe - rience in manufacturing during thirty years , and writes a series of brief reflections , in pleasing popular form , on the measures which he believes would promote social welfare .

		He favors protec - tive tariff , an eight-hour day , restriction of immi - gration , regulation of trusts , and compulsory edu - cation .

		After stating the nature and causes of friction and unrest in industrial relations , the author of '' The Rights of Labor '' proposes a remedy : '' Fix by statute a maximum per cent profit upon capital in - vested ... Declare by statute that all profits real - ized from any enterprise , after expenses and the per cent allowed to those contributing money or property , be divided among those who do personal service in the factory or other industry . ''

		These books may be taken as indications of the intense and general interest in social questions , and some of them are real contributions toward pro- gress of thought and action .

		This article attempts to give means for the foundation of an independent judgment of their relative value , so far as the limits of space permit .

		and his opinions are always put with a pungency that arrests the attention .

		The verbal tricks by which this effect is secured are often far from admirable , and the opinions themselves some - times display an indiosyncrasy as far as possible removed fr < m what is sane and veracious .

		In his recent volume of '' Corrected Impressions '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , for example , he is capable of describing
George Eliot	PERSON	's fame as '' almost utterly vanished away , '' and of saying that
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's `` Literature and Dogma '' is '' now abandoned to cheap beginners in undogmatism alike by the orthodox and the unor - thodox of some mental calibre . ''

		Such amazing judgments as these do not inspire confidence , and yet there is no little criticism of a really valuable sort in the volume from which we have taken them .

		In a series of brief papers on
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Tenny	PERSON	- son ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Dickens	LOCATION	, Ar - nold , Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, and Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	, the author has given us '' a kind of fore - shortened review of the impressions , and the correc - tions of them , which the great Victorian writers '' have made at different times upon a reader of thirty years ' standing .

		The personal note in these essays gives them their main attractiveness , and is obtruded in many places .

		Some incautious critic has said , for example , that
Dickens	PERSON	's `` Agnes is perhaps the most charming character in the whole range of fiction . ''

		Most sympathies will be with Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's outburst : `` Agnes !

		No decent violence of expletive , no reasonable artifice of typography , could express the depths of my feel - ings at such a suggestion . ''

		The paper on Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	is particularly appreciative and enjoy - able , although anything but adequate .

		This bit about the poet 's parodists is simply delicious : '' Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, like other poets on the right side of the line , is not imitable , at any rate , he has not been imitated .

		They have gotten his fiddle , but not his rosin , they can pile on alliteration , and be biblical in phrase , and trench on things forbidden in sub - 182 THE DIAL -LSB-

Plato	ORGANIZATION	.

		They can write lines in twenty-seven syllables or thereabouts if necessary ; but they ca n't write poetry .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	can and does . ''

		Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	has collected Historical essays by i _ t i i
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, seventeen papers upon historical sub - jects into a volume entitled '' The Meaning of History , and Other Historical Pieces '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Most of the papers have appeared in English or American reviews during the past ten years , but they are of sufficient value to be welcome in book form .

		Indeed , the brilliant and forceful style of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, his knowledge and grasp , his subordination of details to general principles , fit him as few are fitted to set forth the educational value of history and to arouse enthusiasm in the pursuit of historical studies .

		There are not many writers , for example , who could make so clear , so sound , and so penetrating a survey of universal history as is embodied in the second of these essays , `` The Connection of History . ''

		Nor are there many who could set forth '' The Use of History '' as eloquently as it is done in the opening chapter of the volume .

		The chapter on '' Some Great Books of History '' is as helpful to the beginner or the general reader as the author 's familiar essay on '' The Choice of Books , '' and its leading ideas are even sounder .

		Other chapters of the present volume include the delightful dialogue on '' The History Schools , '' in which adherents of
Freeman	PERSON	and
Froude	PERSON	argue , each for his favorite master ; the somewhat overdone skit on '' Palaeographic Purism , '' which really needs its '' Nineteenth Century '' antidote ; the plea for '' The Sacredness of Ancient Buildings , '' a masterly '' Sur - vey of the
Thirteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' and two papers on the
France	LOCATION	of the Revolution and the
France	LOCATION	of to - day .

		The essays that we have thus far enumerated make up about one-half of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's volume .

		The other half is devoted to a group of studies of the great cities that have so largely influenced and shaped European history studies of
Athens	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	,
Constantinople	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and
London	LOCATION	.

		Introductory to this group of special studies is the essay on '' The City : Ancient Mediaeval Modern Ideal . ''

		We can not promise readers of this volume that the author will always compel them to agree with him , but we can safely promise them intellectual stimu - lation and pleasure in its perusal .

		Messrs.

Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's account of his experiences upon his famous trip to the
United States	LOCATION	as a second cabin or steerage passenger .

		His subsequent adventures , on the way to
California	LOCATION	with an emigrant train , have already been publicly told in the volume entitled `` Across the Plains . ''

		The posthumous book is one of the
Stevenson	PERSON	as a steerage passenger .

		best examples of
Stevenson	PERSON	's exquisitely finished prose composition , and the reader will do well not to let a single word escape him .

		The little volume is packed full of sanity and wholesome views of life .

		Pregnant passages , such as the following , abound : '' One thing , indeed , is not to be learned in
Scotland	LOCATION	, and that is the way to be happy .

		Yet that is the whole of culture , and perhaps two - thirds of morality .

		Can it be that the Puritan school , by divorcing a man from nature , by thin - ning out his instincts , and setting a stamp of its disapproval on whole fields of human activity and interest , leads at last directly to material greed ? ''

		An amusing story is told of the ship 's purser , who , learning that his passenger was a writer , '' touched to the heart by my misguided industry , offered me some other kind of writing , ' for which , ' he added pointedly , ' you will be paid . '

		This was nothing else than to copy out the list of passengers . ''

		There is no more truthful touch in the whole volume than the description , so familiar to every ocean voyager , of the occasional excursions made by cabin passen - gers into the steerage . ''

		It was astonishing what insults these people managed to convey by their presence .

		They seemed to throw their clothes in our faces .

		Their eyes searched us all over for tatters and incongruities .

		A laugh was ready at their lips ; but they were too well-mannered to in - dulge it in our hearing .

		Wait a bit , till they were all back in the saloon , and then hear how wittily they would depict the manners of the steerage .

		We were in truth very innocently , cheerfully , and sen - sibly engaged , and there was no shadow of excuse for the swaying elegant superiority with which these damsels passed among us , or for the stiff and waggish glances of their squire .

		Not a word was said ; only when they were gone

		Besides chapters on the popular poetry of
Lower Brittany	LOCATION	,
Poitou	LOCATION	, Por - tugal ,
Hungary	LOCATION	, and
Roumania	LOCATION	, on American sea - songs and on the folk-songs of our Civil War , and besides a newspaper review of Professor Child 's great collection of ballads , the book contains three essays that at first blush appear out of place in this volume .

		But the author 's treatment of
Lady Nairne	LOCATION	, Sir
Samuel Ferguson	PERSON	, and
William Thorn	PERSON	-LRB- the Weaver Poet -RRB- brings these three essays easily within the scope of the book : '' The Land o ' the Leal , '' `` The Laird of Cockpen , '' ` and other songs of
Lady Nairne	LOCATION	, are true folk-songs , not literary makings ; '' the main literary work of Sir
Samuel Ferguson	PERSON	was devoted to -LSB- the -RSB- revivification of the spirit of ancient Celtic poetry '' ;

		THE DIAL 183 viduality of his genius .

		The essay on Sir
Samuel Ferguson	PERSON	, by the way , suggests a previous work by Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, `` The Poets and Poetry of
Ireland	LOCATION	. ''

		Our author evinces a fine appreciation of folk-song , but he possesses the critical instinct rather than the critical faculty ; he knows songs , not texts .

		The volume before us gives vivid first-hand impressions , richly illustrated by full and free and admirable citation .

		The style of the writer is spirited and readable , but careless : there is no excuse for '' a comic opera libretto writer , '' none for the telescop - ing of paragraphs at page 91 , none for the hopeless confusion of nomen et omen at page 108 , where the
Laurence Oliphant	PERSON	of our own generation seems to be identified with the
Laurence Oliphant	PERSON	of the Jacobite rising in
1745	DATE	.

		In fine , the book is a wit - ness to the abiding interest of its new-old themes , though hardly a contribution to the fund of knowl - edge on the subject of folk-song .

		German studies The work which Miss
Helen Zim	PERSON	- of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's mern has translated from the Ger - man of
Louis Lewes	LOCATION	, and published with the title ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Women '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , has little to distinguish it from the hundreds of sim - ilar books of Shakespeare commentary .

		It begins , as such books usually do , with chapters on Shake - speare 's times ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life , the English stage before
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		The author claims some originality , however , in the fact that he presents studies of the whole line of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's women , chonologically , in what he conceives to be the order of their creation ; beginning with
Venus	PERSON	in ''
Venus	PERSON	and Adonis , '' and ending with Queen
Catharine	PERSON	.

		His reason for this is that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own life and character being developed by a process of evo - lution , so these characters of his creation were of necessity subjected to the same psychological pro- cess .

		But this petitio principii has so little justifi - cation in any exact knowledge , and the learned author 's style being moreover heavy and verbose , one fails perhaps of being sufficiently grateful for his endeavor , except as another illustration of the capacity of the German mind for exploring every nook and corner of a subject , and bringing to light with equal pains the infinitely little and the infi - nitely great .

		Seldom has a more delightful book A French sailor of ^ k j n -LRB- j fal j en j n Qur than ^ turned author .

		i - r 11 Memoirs of the Prince de Join - ville '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .


Joinville	LOCATION	was the sailor son of
Louis Philippe	PERSON	, and he served his country with dis - tinction in many parts of the world .

		In his open - ing chapters he draws a lively picture of his child - life and school-days , and then passes on to the story of his professional wanderings , which takes up the bulk of the volume .

		Born in
1818	DATE	,
Joinville	LOCATION	en - tered the
navy	ORGANIZATION	in
1831	DATE	.

		He visited the
United States	LOCATION	for the first time in
1837	DATE	, and in the follow - ing year was put in command of a ship and sent to
Mexico	LOCATION	, where he saw active service , and plainly The
London	LOCATION	of To-day .

		showed that , though a prince of the blood , he was no mere holiday captain and fair-weather sailor .

		He made a tour overland of this country in
1841	DATE	, visiting the chief points of interest , playing -LRB- rather reluctantly -RRB- the social lion , and showing , like most of his countrymen , a kindly disposition to make the best of things and to shut his eyes to the seamy side of Brother
Jonathan	PERSON	's coat .

		Returning to
France	LOCATION	in
1843	DATE	,
Joinville	LOCATION	was appointed to the
Admiralty Board	ORGANIZATION	, then engaged in paving the way for the re - modelling of the French navy ; and later on , after a season of active work on the
Barbary Coast	ORGANIZATION	, he had the satisfaction of overseeing , with
M. Dupuy de Lome	ORGANIZATION	, the construction of
France	LOCATION	's first ironclad ship .

		After the revolution of
1848	DATE	, he went into exile in
England	LOCATION	destined , as he says , '' not to see my country again for two - and - twenty years , and then in all the horror of invasion and dismember - ment and the terror of the Commune . ''

		A hearty , kindly sailor , standing as it were midway between the old school and the new ,
Joinville	LOCATION	knew his call - ing thoroughly , from reefing a top-sail to manoeu - vring an iron-clad .

		Yet , good sailor as he was , one is tempted to say that he missed his calling by not turning author .

		The crisp , fluent style loses little in the hands of the excellent translator , Lady
Mary Lloyd	PERSON	.

		Of the making of books about Lon - don there has been no end since the days of Stow , nor need there be an end , the metropolis -LRB- that '' great wen , '' as virulent
Cobbett	PERSON	called it -RRB- , changing socially and archi - tecturally from decade to decade .

		That the Lon - don of to-day is not the
London	LOCATION	of
Pierce Egan	ORGANIZATION	, or even of Thackeray and ''
Boz	PERSON	, '' no one who has travelled thither with anticipations founded on these authors needs be told .

		Much that they espe - cially delighted to honor has vanished .

		The taverns and cider-cellars , the cozy inns and `` back - kitchens , '' where
Costigan	PERSON	warbled and Mr.
Guppy	PERSON	dined with the knowing Mr.
Smallweed	PERSON	, exist only in print .

		They belong to ancient history , like sedan chairs and link-boys ; and their places are filled by great , flaring establishments , all plate glass and gas jets , show , swagger , and discomfort .

		Thirty-seven years ago Mr.
George Augustus Sala	PERSON	published his `` Twice Round the Clock ; or , The Hours of the Day and the Night in
London	LOCATION	'' ; and he now supplements it with ''
London	LOCATION	Up to Date '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a collection of descriptive papers on what is to be heard , seen , and commented on in the British metropolis of
1894	DATE	. ''

		They are , '' says the author , '' so many detached essays describing scenes and characters which did not find a place in ' Twice Round the Clock . ' ''

		In Mr.
Sala	PERSON	's new book there is little or nothing of what is called '' low life '' save , indeed , in a Police Court sketch that '' Boz '' himself might have written .

		The author is no longer at an age when one cares to go , or can go , '' slum - ming '' ; therefore it is mainly the sights and humors of the '' West End '' that he draws for us .

		Such 184 THE DIAL chapter-headings as `` A
First Night	ORGANIZATION	at the Lyceum , '' `` A Ballot at a Pall
Mall Club	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` A Charity Ba - zaar , '' '' A Picture Sale at
Christy	ORGANIZATION	's , '' '' A Culture Conversazione , '' '' Travels in Regent Street , '' etc. , convey a fair notion of the scope of the book .

		The many fragmentary accounts of JSSlEi the famous '' Brook Farm '' experi - ment are now supplemented , in a fairly authoritative way , by Dr.
John Thomas Cod	PERSON	- man 's ' Brook Farm Personal and Historic Me - moirs '' -LRB- The
Arena Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Codman	PERSON	is one of the few surviving members of the
Community	ORGANIZATION	, and his work is therefore based upon intimate personal knowledge of the inner workings of the scheme and of the character and personalities of those inter - ested in it .

		He traces the history of the little pol - ity through its manifold phases , social and indus - trial , touching and humorous , from its germ in the
Transcendental Club	ORGANIZATION	of
1836	DATE	, down to its disrup - tion ten years later .

		The book is plentifully be - sprinkled with memories of the more notable
Brook Farmers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hawthorne spent some months at the Farm , thinking , it seems , '' his manual labors might in a small way do a trifle towards aiding the ideal state . ''

		That the great romancer 's `` manual la - bors '' -LRB- which must have been largely emblematical , like the Emperor of
China	LOCATION	's annual ploughing -RRB- would really have done much to lighten Mr.
Rip	PERSON	- ley 's subsequent load of debt , may be doubted ; and one may add here -LRB- on our author 's authority -RRB- that
Hawthorne	PERSON	himself was one of the creditors , and that he `` growled , '' in a rather unidealistic way , over the amount due him .

		The volume provides data for a thorough understanding of the theoret - ical and fiscal basis of the
Community	ORGANIZATION	; and there is an appendix containing letters to and from Mr.
Ripley	PERSON	, which throw much light upon the moral and intellectual temper of the times .

		Dr.
Codman	PERSON	's book is not only extremely interesting as a narrative , but it furnishes an instructive economic study of the practical workings , under favorable conditions , of a socialistic phalanstery ; nor do we mean to imply here that the Fourierist needs read nothing but fail - ure in the lessons of '' Brook Farm . ''

		Napoleon on the Mr -
Montgomery B. Gibbs	PERSON	's ``
Mili	PERSON	- battie-fieid and tary Career of Napoleon the Great '' by the camp-fire .

		-LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	:
The Werner Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an effort to portray the Emperor as his marshals and soldiers knew him on the battlefield and beside the campfire .

		Mr.
Gibbs	PERSON	has clearly given his subject much thought and study ; and as he is possessed of a notably lively and easy style his book should prove popular .

		Napoleon 's battles are described in turn , from the pictorial and anecdotal rather than the technical standpoint , from
Toulon	LOCATION	to
Waterloo	LOCATION	; and the graphic quality of the text is enforced by numerous full-page illustrations in half-tone , largely after well-known painters .

		The publishers issue the book in good shape , and it is altogether likely to hold its own against its numerous competitors .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		We note the completion , by publication of the second volume , of the fine edition of Malory 's '' Morte Dar - thur '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- edited by Professor
Rhys	PERSON	and illus - trated hy Mr.
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	.

		The work of the artist is , after its peculiar manner , admirable ; but ex - amination only confirms our first impression that of all manners that of Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	is least suitable to adorn the text of our great fifteenth century prose classic .

		But the volumes are in all other respects worthy of the noble piece of literature that they enshrine , and most book-lovers will be willing to put up with Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	's eccentricities for the sake of such beauty of print , generosity of margin , and chaste simplicity of coyer decoration .

		Three more parts XVII. , XVIII. , XIX .

		of The Book of the Fair '' -LRB- The
Bancroft Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- con - firm the favorable opinion we have several times ex - pressed as to the merits of the work .

		The illustrations are profuse and attractive , and their subjects are chosen in a way to represent the varied aspects of the
Exposi	LOCATION	- tion ; while the accompanying text is fairly satisfactory .

		It becomes evident , as the work nears completion , that it will become the chief literary and artistic record of the world 's great event of
1893	DATE	.

		As the printing of this work must be regarded as the most notable achieve - ment of
Chicago	LOCATION	typography , it is fair to mention that it comes from the
Blakely Printing Co.	ORGANIZATION	`` The Book of the Fair '' is sold only by subscription .

		Three recently-published chemical treatises are of much interest to the student .

		Mr.
Douglas Carnegie	PERSON	's '' Law and Theory in Chemistry '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is a course of lectures given before a
summer	DATE	school of teachers at
Colorado Springs	LOCATION	.

		It runs all the way from the al - chemists to the latest theories of molecular architecture . ''

		A Text-Book of Inorganic Chemistry '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Mr.
G. S. Newth	PERSON	, is a compact systematic work based upon the periodic classification of the elements .

		The late
Carl Schorlemmer	PERSON	's '' Rise and Development of Or - ganic Chemistry '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in a new and revised edition , is third of our treatises .

		The work of revision has been done by Mr.
Arthur Smithells	PERSON	.

		In our recent editorial on the subject of poetry as literary criticism , mention was made of two anthologies .

		One of these , edited by Mrs.
Richard Strachey	PERSON	, is en - titled `` Poets on Poets , '' and is imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons . ''

		English Poets on English Poets '' would have been a more exact title , for the ed - itor does not go outside of our own literature either for subjects or extracts .

		She also excludes living writers , which keeps Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	from being represented at all .

		The selections are arranged chronologically by authors , while marginal notes indicate the subjects .

		There are many fragments as well as whole poems .

		The whole is ushered in with some pleasing and sensible prefatory remarks .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have begun the publication of a series of selected English novels , which is designed to include many of the favorites of a past generation .

		The volumes will be illustrated , and each is to have an intro - duction .


Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	's '' Castle Rackrent '' and '' The Absentee '' are grouped in the first volume of this series , and the introduction , which is of some length and extremely readable , is the work of Mrs.
Anne Thackeray Ritchie	PERSON	.

		The volume is moderate in price and attractive in appearance .

		THE DIAL 185 YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
March 9 , 1895	DATE	.

		Mr.
Stnalley	PERSON	's return to
America	LOCATION	and acceptance of the position of
New York	LOCATION	correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' is among the more interesting literary an - nouncements made this year .

		But the
New York	LOCATION	press has , so far as I have been able to observe , ignored it editorially , without exception ; the '' Tribune '' perhaps because that paper may be unwilling to admit the loss of one who has shed such lustre on its pages , the other daily papers for fear of seeming to proclaim the '' Tri - bune 's '' excellence now or formerly .

		I refer to the an - nouncement of Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	's intended return to Amer - ica as a '' literary '' announcement because much of his work as correspondent may be classed as literature .

		The general correspondent of a great newspaper holds a half-way position between the newspaper man and the creative writer , for it sometimes devolves upon him to write for all time as well as for the passing mo - ment .

		It is now thirty-three years since Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	joined the editorial staff of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' having proved his ability as an all-around newspaper man by brilliant reporting in the field during the first year of the Civil War .

		In
1866	DATE	he was sent to report the war between
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, and the following year he became
London	LOCATION	correspondent of his paper .

		It is believed by some people here that on Mr.
Greeley	PERSON	's death , in
1872	DATE	, the mantle of the great editor might naturally have fallen upon Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	's shoulders ; but circumstances brought about a different arrange - ment , and he was content to retain his
London	LOCATION	position .

		As to Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	's ability to edit a great paper , I am free to say that I think there are but two other men in this country with equal qualifications and fate has decreed that one of these should be his bitterest enemy .

		The other , of course , is Mr.
Dana	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	, then , has for twenty-eight years pre - sented to us varying pictures of
London	LOCATION	and
Conti	PERSON	- nental social and political life .

		He has been a constant attendant at `` functions '' of every character ; he has held high converse with leaders of every type , even with royalty itself ; and he has at the same time kept a careful watch upon the manifestations of the arts and the sciences .

		In all this he has assumed the attitude of a candid friend of both the American continent and the British archipelago , and has never hesitated to express his views as to the past , present , or future conduct of any living person .

		One may then feel quite at liberty to speculate upon his probable career as
New York	LOCATION	correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times . ''

		In a cabled ex - tract from an interview , he is represented as saying : '' My experience in
London	LOCATION	has taught me how Ameri - can life ought to be represented in order to interest the British public , and to doing this I shall devote myself . ''

		On the face of it , this statement seems a little discour - aging , as if to imply that there were any need of inter - esting the British public in American life , and that the true perspective must be altered in order to do so .

		I am proud of Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	, as a
Yale	ORGANIZATION	man , and as an American ; but I have sometimes felt that his attitude toward his fellow-countrymen was slightly deprecatory , as distinguished from the sturdy assumption of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, for instance .

		This attitude has been shown in the recent controversy with Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	over the Car - lyle memorial , in which the Curtis memorial has been brought up .

		The fact is that unless such a scheme as the
Carlyle	LOCATION	memorial appeals naturally to those to whom it is presented , it ought to be dropped ; and the names of princes and potentates of church and state should not be dragged in to give it life .

		As for the Curtis memorial , all that our British friends have done about it is to inquire , '' Who is
Curtis	PERSON	, anyhow ? ''

		An absence of thirty years from one 's native land gives large opportunities for observation and compar - ison .

		Will Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	be equal to these ?

		I believe that he can be .

		He has lately been in this city , and he has written his impressions of his visit to the '' Tri - bune . ''

		It is a trifle discouraging to find that they have most to do with the gilded interiors of fashionable
New York	LOCATION	houses of entertainment , and with those true ex - otics , often grafted upon sturdy native stock , the
New York	LOCATION	society girl and married belle .

		Does Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	really consider these the choicest flowers of republican culture ?

		We shall see ; and also we shall see whether he chooses to take his view of American life through the opalescent windows of our Fifth Avenue palaces .

		It is not necessary , far less than the other , that he should look through the dingy window-panes of what a pom - pous candidate for the laureateship has called our '' new Grub street . ''

		Let Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	keep clear of all en - tangling alliances , either with the residents of million - aires ' row or with the literary shysters unfortunately so numerous in this city .

		Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	, by his own statement , returns to Amer - ica a poor man .

		The chief reason for this , it may be supposed , is that he has been a sort of uncommissioned ambassador at the court of
St. James	LOCATION	, sometimes repre - senting his country more truly than the resident at the legation .

		He has spent his means freely , and he de - serves honor for his openhandedness .

		Of late , ill - health has also drawn upon his resources .

		As to his ''
London	LOCATION	Letters and Some Others , '' published two or three years ago , the only fault I have to find with the work is that it is in two volumes instead of in ten .

		His letters are in every sense a history of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in our own times , and many of the author 's best things are unduly abbreviated or not given at all .

		There have been several book-clubs in the
United States	LOCATION	whose chief object has been the publication of fine editions of original or selected books , but Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	, of
Portland	LOCATION	,
Me.	LOCATION	, is , I think , the pioneer publisher of editions de luxe exclusively , at moderate prices .

		His triumphs of daintiness and cheap - ness have been duly chronicled in this correspondence , and I am now glad to announce for immediate publica - tion his new edition of ''
A. E.	PERSON	's '' charming book of '' Homeward Songs by the Way , '' so warmly praised last year by English reviewers both in and out of the '' log-rolling '' set . ''

		A. E. , '' whose identity is not yet revealed , is a young Irishman , and the first edition of these poems was published in
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's edition will consist of 925 copies , with fifty
Japan	LOCATION	vel - lum copies at a slightly higher price .

		Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	, a young designer of promise in
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, will be re - sponsible for the cover design and title-page , as well as for some head-pieces and tail-pieces to the poems . ''

		A. E. '' has contributed fifteen new poems to Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's edition .

		I must defer until another time mention of the pro- posed consolidation of our Astor and Lenox libraries with the
Tilden	PERSON	fund into one vast Public Library of the city of
New York	LOCATION	, representing eight millions of property .

		It is less than a month since I wrote you that ''
New York	LOCATION	has no public library . ''

		The plan awaits 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, approval by the trustees of the Astor library , and action by the
New York	LOCATION	legislature . ''

		The Fine Arts Federation , '' composed of societies interested in the fine arts , now organizing , will no doubt assume national proportions .

		By offering new professorships of political economy , history , and mathematics , the friends of
Barnard Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege have secured admission for their women students to the
Columbia School of Political Science	ORGANIZATION	, in the face of a previous refusal .

		Professor
John B. Clark	PERSON	, author of '' The Science of Wealth , '' has accepted the political economy professorship .

		It may be fitting to mention a recent social event , in - volving a member of a noted literary family .

		Miss
Francesca Monti Lunt	PERSON	, the daughter of
George Lunt	PERSON	, the poet , and the niece of Dr.
Thomas W. Parsons	PERSON	and of
Luigi Monti	PERSON	, has just been married at old
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	to an Italian nobleman .

		Mr.
Monti	PERSON	, it may be remem - bered , is the '' young Sicilian '' mentioned in
Longfel	LOCATION	- low 's '' Tales of a
Wayside Inn	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		He and the late Mr.
Lunt	PERSON	married Dr.
Parsons	PERSON	's sisters , I believe .

		Mr.
Monti	PERSON	has given lectures in Italian literature here for many years .

		Mrs.
Henrotin	PERSON	has made a decided impression here and elsewhere during her visit East as president of the
General Federation of Women 's Clubs	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 187 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS .

		We present herewith our annual list of books an - nounced for
Spring	ORGANIZATION	publication , classified as accurately as our information would allow , and with the books of each publisher arranged in a separate paragraph under the various departments .

		The list embodies informa - tion furnished us by thirty-four publishing houses ; the average of titles is about nine to each house , the list containing something over three hundred books as the prospective output of the
Spring	ORGANIZATION	season .

		This list is somewhat larger than that of a year ago , which , as we then stated , was the largest
Spring	DATE	list yet published .

$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This novel , by a granddaughter of

		The story is French in scene and characters .

		Anarchism pleads its cause in some of the conversations , and shows its destructive spirit in the strike it incites ; love plays its part , but not with a French accent .

		It is an interesting story , and a good deal more ; and in view of the restlessness pervading the industrial world , it is a very timely story , which may be commended to a wide reading .

		The remainder of the volume therefore treats of our economic history . ''

		8vo , cloth ,
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		This brilliant analysis of the literary , aesthetic , and social phases of the end of the century includes an examination of decadence in
France	LOCATION	, the work of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	in
Belgium	LOCATION	, Wagnerisin in
Germany	LOCATION	, Ibsenism in the north , and other as - pects of contemporary sestheticism which are dissected with a thoroughness that renders the book a most remarkable con - tribution to social psychology .

		Prof.
Nordau	PERSON	summarizes the mental unrest and thirst for novelty , which he finds as symp - toms of a phase of alienism due to two generations of over - stimulated nerves .

		His survey is modern to the last degree , and his conclusions are of intense interest .

		His fascinating and most suggestive book gives a picture of the aesthetic man - ifestation of the times , drawn with rare adroitness , vigor , and command of satire , and it will be found to hold a place which has not been occupied .

American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	.

		With over 200 Illustrations .

		12mo , cloth .

		The author 's position has not only given him exceptional opportunities for the preparation of a work which may be con - sidered as authoritative , but has brought him in direct con - tact with beginners in the study of birds whose wants he thus thoroughly understands .

		The technicalities so confusing to the amateur are avoided , and by the use of illustrations , con - cise descriptions , analytical keys , dates of migration , and re - marks on distribution , haunts , notes , and characteristic habits , the problem of identification , either in the field or study , is reduced to its simplest terms .

Louis COUPERUS	PERSON	.

ERNEST DOWSON	PERSON	.

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.00	MONEY	. ''

		There have been many workers among novelists in the field of royal portraiture , but it may be safely stated that few of those who have essayed this dubious path have achieved more striking results than
M. Couperus	PERSON	. '

		Majesty ' is an extraordinarily vivid romance of autocratic imperialism , and the main aim of the book is so legitimate , and its treat - ment so sympathetic and artistic , that it is to be regretted that the au - thor should have adopted the portrait form at all .

		The striking but superficial resemblance between the leading characters of the story and those of more than one reigning imperial house will no doubt prove a bait to readers hungry for personalities ; but the real merits of the book its dramatic intensity and powerful characterization are en - tirely independent of this factitious interest .

		This book is an attempt to show that the Evolution of to - day is differentiated from the Evolution which preceded man by the factor of conscious effort ; that man , by virtue of his faculty of conscious effort , is no longer the product of
Evolu	LOCATION	- tion but the master of it ; that the chief ally of this faculty is religion , and its most fruitful though as yet neglected field is politics ; that an alliance between religion and politics is essential to progress in the struggle of humanity with evil and with pain ; and that this alliance must practice the gospel of effort and not that of laissez faire .

		222 THE NEGLECTED ART OF TRANSLATION .

		These closing years of the nineteenth cen - tury have made us more cosmopolitan , in many respects , than we ever were before .

		The world has shrunk for us in several ways ; as a mere matter of geography , the greater part of it is within easy reach ; politically and soci - ally , the sense of human solidarity is growing all the time ; and in intellectual affairs it is safe to say that no voice having a real message to deliver is likely to wait long for apprecia - tive listeners .

		Neglected genius seems to have become a thing of the past , and we now suffer instead from a tendency to exalt with undue pre - cipitancy to the ranks of genius every ques - tionable and imperfectly-realized talent that appears upon the intellectual horizon .

		In liter - ature , particularly , we are alert as never before to catch the new note , to seize upon and ex - ploit the new thing .

		Let a poet , or novelist , or essayist but raise his head in any corner of civilization , and , if his message be not purely provincial in its application , he will soon find himself translated into the tongues of the aliens , and his thoughts will find lodgment upon their lips .

		Nay , if the message be but a provincial one after all , it is not unlikely to incur the same fate , such has become our curiosity con - cerning all our fellowmen , such our insatiable demand for the new type and the local coloring .

		This linking together of the literatures by translation is particularly noticeable among the peoples using the German , English , and French languages , and , as an intellectual tendency , has followed the order just named .


Germany	LOCATION	was the leader in the movement , and through - out most of the century , has been seizing with omnivorous appetite upon whatever was most notable in the literary product of other coun - tries .

		Not only has she assimilated the pro- ductions of such peoples as the Hungarians , the Scandinavians , and the Slavs peoples closely associated with her either politically or ethnically but also those of the English and French , the Italian and Spanish .

		The works of
Jokai	LOCATION	, CEhlenschlager , and
Pushkin	LOCATION	first found a large foreign audience among the Teutons ;
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Calderon	PERSON	, and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	early 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, became theirs by right of conquest , and the Shakespearian permeation of German litera - ture is so familiar a fact as hardly to need mention .

		The English people , on either side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, have followed the Germans , although at a distance , in thus welcoming the foreigner to their hearth , and we all know the good work of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and
Coleridge	PERSON	, in the English case , and of the
Concord	LOCATION	group of plain livers and high thinkers , in our own .


France	LOCATION	, maintaining longer than
Germany	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	her self-sufficient attitude , has more recently fallen into line , and the most desperate efforts of chauvinism have failed to protect her frontiers from the invasion of the alien writer .

		Indeed , the proposition that new converts are the most zealous of .

		all , is well illustrated by the eager enthusiasm with which the French - man is nowadays taking up the foreigner and his works .

		The distinction is very marked for example , between the polite curiosity with which Ampere explored Scandinavian litera - ture for the information of Frenchmen half a century ago , and the genuine interest which is taken by Frenchmen of to-day in the works of the great Norwegians .

		In our own country , while cordial recogni - tion of the established names of foreign liter - ature has not been lacking since mid-century , we have , until very recently , been slow to seize upon the work of new writers .

		Tourguenieff , for example , had long been naturalized in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	before he was discovered by
America	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	had done the greatest and most enduring part of his work
twenty years ago	DATE	, but the voice of the student here and there among us who had discovered him was that of one crying in the wilderness .

		A few contemporary Germans and Frenchmen , some - what capriciously selected , were known to our readers ; others , equally important , were not known at all .

		As for the contemporary Italian , or Spaniard , or Pole , or Russian , his name was , with hardly an exception , meaningless to us .

		Most of us who studied the history of foreign literatures were content to stop with the dawn of the century ; of active modern tendencies in the world of foreign letters we had not the least notion .

		The rapidity with which , of late , nous avons change tout cela , is a little surprising .

		The past few years have brought before our eyes , in bewildering succession , an array of contem - porary writers from all parts of the civilized world .

		Novelists and dramatists , essayists and poets , of the most diverse nationalities and ideals , compete for our attention .

		Not only do the new works of the older literatures crowd upon us , but the new literatures of
Canada	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
Portugal	LOCATION	, and
Spanish America	LOCATION	as well .

		Now most of these new claimants for attention require conversion into our vernacular before we may become ac - quainted with them .

		And this fact leads us to the real consideration of the present article , which is , briefly , that the art of translation , so far from keeping pace with its practice , lags painfully behind .

		The more translations we get , the worse they seem to be .

		Time was when a translation was at least apt to be a labor of love , conscientiously and sympathetically per - formed .

		At present , it seems a sort of scram - ble to be first in the field .

		A novel by a pop - ular foreign author is almost sure to get before our public in a translation so wooden , so un - idiomatic , so essentially ignorant , as to be a mere travesty of the original .

		One who has occasion to examine many of these productions is only too often reminded of the sort of trans - lation that was suffered by Bottom , and is sur - prised beyond measure when he comes upon a version which is not an utter perversion .

		We do not here speak of the ethical question , so often ignored by those who deliberately alter or cur - tail the text of their originals , but merely of the lack of intelligence and capacity nearly always displayed by translators of contemporary liter - ature .

		The simple fact is that the qualifications of a translator are .

		set far too low , both by his em - ployer and the public .

		The long-suffering public , of course , has to take what it can get , is too apathetic to demand better workmanship , and easily grows accustomed to the hack-work that dulls the taste and deadens the literary sensibility .

		As for the employer , the publisher , he finds a ready sale for the cheap product , and hence does not offer the compensation that good work ought to bring .

		Of course he has a moral responsibility in the matter , but he is not likely to care for that when his pocket is concerned .

		Any young person with a smat - tering of French or German and a dictionary to help him out , feels competent to become a translator , it never occurring to him that the cultivation of an English style is the first requisite of all ; while the average publisher shows that he accepts this view by refusing to pay for translations any sum that a competent workman , the real master of two languages , can possibly accept .

		Of course , honorable ex - ceptions to this rule may be found here and
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 203 there , and equally of course good translations will now and then come from persons actuated , not by self-interest , but by a delight in good workmanship for its own sake .

		But the con - ditions that fix the existing standard of trans - lation are still mainly of the hard commercial kind , and , until they are in some way modified , the standard will remain low .

		It is possible that the art of translation may rise from its present disrepute , but the process will be slow .

		Cause for hopefulness may be found in two facts .

		The first of these facts is that the Copyright Act of
1891	DATE	for the first time gave the foreign writer some measure of control over the American publication of trans - lations of his work .

		He has it in his power to secure an adequate translation , and to preempt the market for it .

		Unfortunately , he does not always know a good translation from a bad one , and even if he does , may find it difficult to arrange for what he wants .

		Possibly he may come to learn by experience how immeasurably his reputation suffers from blundering transla - tions , and take measures to secure himself against them .

		The other cause for hopeful - ness is in the fact that an immense expansion has taken place of late years in the modern language departments of our educational insti - tutions .

		The languages of
Europe	LOCATION	are pur - sued in the scientific and literary spirit by an increasing number of students every year .

		These students will make most of the transla - tions that will be read by the coming decades .

		It is not too much to believe that their better methods and fuller knowledge will make itself felt more and more as the years pass , and that their efforts may cause a marked elevation in the current standard of literary translation .

		FROM SOPHOCLES TO IBSEN .

		The theatre-going portion of the
Chicago	LOCATION	public has recently been given an opportunity to compare two types of dramatic art widely separated in point of time .

		Within the past month , two plays by Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	have been seen upon the boards , while the '' CEdipus Tyrannus '' of Sophocles , given by the stu - dents of
Beloit College	LOCATION	, was repeated at
Chicago	LOCATION	a few days ago .

		Of the Greek play , it may be said that a distinct success was scored , mainly attributa - ble to the remarkable histrionic talent displayed by Mr.
C. W. Wood	PERSON	, who took the part of the
King	LOCATION	.

		There was hardly a trace of amateurishness in his work , and his delivery of the more fateful pas - sages in the tragedy elicited an applause that was richly deserved .

		The only thing about the '' CEdipus '' performance which seems to us to have been ill ad - vised was the use of a home-made translation , which did not commend itself by any markedly poetical quality , in place of some standard English version .

		The two Ibsen plays referred to were '' An En - emy of the People '' and `` Master Builder Solness . ''

		The former was given by Mr.
Beerbohm Tree	PERSON	, and the latter by the students and instructors of the
Chicago	LOCATION	Conservatory of Dramatic Art .

		Mr.
Tree	PERSON	's performance , which was introduced , evidently as a sort of experiment , near the close of his two weeks ' engagement in
Chicago	LOCATION	, was both an artistic and a popular success .

		Its popular success was in fact as - tonishing , for scene after scene was wildly ap - plauded , and at the close Mr.
Tree	PERSON	, who had taken the character of
Stockman	PERSON	, was forced to make a few remarks to the audience .

		He acquitted himself gracefully of the task , thanking his appreciative auditors in the name of the author of the play .

		The most surprising thing about the reception which thus astonished both the actor and the few Ibsenites scattered through the audience was the fact that the greatest applause was called out by the passages in which the author 's assertion of individualism is the most vigorous , and his denunciation of the rabble and the `` compact majority '' is the most uncom - promising .

		`` The majority is always wrong , '' de - claimed Dr.
Stockman	PERSON	; and the house , even the gal - leries , cheered the sentiment to the echo .

		The scene was , on the whole , very disturbing to one 's precon - ceived notions of what the dear public likes and de - mands in matters theatrical .

		The '' Solness '' performance , which was given to a large matinee audience , showed painstaking study on the part of the performers , and seemed to hold the listeners more closely than most plays succeed in doing .

		The marchenhaft character of the drama is quite as evident in the witnessing as in the read - ing , and the veiled symbolism in which the author delights puzzled those of the audience to whom it was all a new thing , and who tried to account to themselves for events as they happened .

		The story of
Aline	PERSON	's lost dolls , as was to be expected , resulted in hilarity pure and simple .

		But the attention with which the work was followed could not fail to be noticed by those who , familiar with the play , found their chief interest in noting its effect upon the aud - ience .

		Although the hearers were not a little per - turbed in spirit by the strange series of episodes unfolded before them , it was clear that the sugges - tiveness of the play was not lost upon many of them .

		And the wisest of critics may hardly blame them for not being quite sure of what the play meant .

		`` THE AIMS OF LITERARY STUDY . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		At a recent meeting of a
Chicago	LOCATION	literary club , the volume of Professor
Corson	PERSON	on '' The Aims of Literary Study , '' and the comment upon the same by Professor
Edward E. Hale	PERSON	in THE DIAL of
February 16	DATE	, were 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, passed in review .

		Having been appointed spokesman of the club , and adding a little indignation of my own , I beg leave to discuss in your columns Mr.
Hale	PERSON	's theory of '' university discipline , '' and to suggest a different reading of the facts of education , so far as these per - tain to the study of literature .

		In one thing we are in complete accord : namely , that literature does not lend itself readily to purely intellec - tual discipline .

		When literature is so employed , not only is offence done to the literature itself , but also to the student whose time is surely misspent in reading with the intellect the masterpieces of literature to be called life presently , when things get their true names .

		The published studies of literature , which reveal the working upon literary material of the intellectual alone , are among the saddest chapters of educational history sad because the materials are put to a use alien to their purpose , and saddest because the mind which has been applied so diligently has really missed its intellect - ual discipline .

		So the matter stands at present , that if the concern of the university is with intellectual train - ing alone , literature is most certainly out of place in the university .

		But can it be that the American university limits itself to this single discipline ?

		We have always sup - posed that the purpose of educational institutions , in this country at least , was to educate .

		While perhaps the primary function of the university is to know , yet other educational forces surround this , which are not '' in - cidental , '' or '' left to care for themselves , '' but are fun - damental likewise .

		By its department of Physical Cul - ture , for instance , the university recognizes its function to educate the body , not primarily for the sake of the sound mind , but for the sound body .

		The recent ac - tion of the
Harvard Faculty	ORGANIZATION	, in voting to abolish inter - collegiate foot-ball , was prompted by the wish to pro- tect the players ' life and limbs , and not to maintain the '' university discipline . ''

		Departments of Art ,
Elocu	PERSON	- tion , and Oratory , the various professional and techni - cal training schools , testify to the interest of the uni - versity in some things besides this one discipline .

		But the point I wish here to make is that the study of liter - ature itself , as conducted to-day in our leading univer - sities , is the best witness to our universal interest in education .

		While Mr.
Hale	PERSON	is affirming that literature is out of place in the university , it is in fact very much in place .

		We suspect that Professor
Lowell	PERSON	, long ago at
Harvard	LOCATION	, taught literature in its absolute character , and found it not so very difficult , or incompatible with the university ideal .

		But we know , from the letters on the teaching of English which so lately graced the col - umns of THE DIAL , that to-day the subject is being taught quite generally in its vital meaning and content , even as Professor
Corson	PERSON	would direct .

		It was stated definitely enough by
Professor Cook of Yale	ORGANIZATION	from whom , as a skilful philologist , we might have expected the narrow definition of university discipline that the object which he proposed to himself as a teacher of lit - erature was the development in the student , whether graduate or undergraduate , of insight and power terms which include the emotional , the aesthetical , and the moral , as well as the intellectual -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Feb. 1 , ' 94	DATE	, p. 71 -RRB- .

		The editorial in the
June	DATE	number of THE DIAL , in summary of the reports on teaching English , rightly affirms that this high aim is general .

		Professor
Corson	PERSON	's book really records the experiences of many .

		To indicate more definitely the present scope and tendency of literary study , and thereby the relation which Professor
Corson	PERSON	's book has to present university teaching , I may report some facts which have just been gathered by the
English Department of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, pertaining to the teaching of literature in various institutions during the current year .

		The work of thirty-four of the leading American colleges and uni - versities was examined with reference to the courses offered in English literature .

		The total number of courses reviewed was 378 .

		Fifty-seven of these are primarily for graduates , with as many more immedi - ately serviceable to them .

		There are thirty-nine gen - eral courses set down for undergraduates , these consti - tuting the required work , and being divided about equally between a general historical course and the study of masterpieces .

		Twenty-eight courses deal with Old and Middle English literature , with
Chaucer	PERSON	as the favorite author .

		Sixty-one courses are devoted to six - teenth century literature , thirty-five of which deal with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	alone .

		There are seventeen courses in seventeenth century literature , twelve of these being given to
Milton	LOCATION	alone .

		To the Classical period , twenty courses are given , thirteen of them relating to the his - torical evolution of literature .

		Twenty courses consider the Romantic period , including eleven devoted to the great authors
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	being the favored ones , the latter having four courses devoted to him alone .

		The nineteenth century has seventy-nine courses to its service , eight of these being general sur - veys , eleven given to American authors , about thirty to different representative authors or groups of writers , five to
Browning	PERSON	alone , five to
Tennyson	PERSON	alone , and six to modern fiction , with
George Eliot	PERSON	as leader .

		In forty - nine courses the different kinds or species of literature are considered , as the epic , the lyric , and the drama ; seven of these review the history of English fiction .

		Prose claims sixteen courses .

		Miscellaneous courses number about twenty , which indicate some personal pre - ference of the instructor or some experiment in teach - ing .

		Twenty-nine other courses , for the most part new ones , constitute what is practically a new department of literature as distinguished from English literature ; of these , sixteen are given to the history of criticism , five are devoted to comparative literature , and six relate to the theory or aesthetics of literature .

		I make bold to say , then , that the case stands thus , that nothing which concerns literature is out of place in the universities .

		And I can not leave the subject with - out exclaiming how well that this is so .

		Science itself requires the cooperation of the literary , the intuitive , the imaginative , the emotional , and the moral .

		In the statutes which established the chair of poetry at
Oxford	LOCATION	, it was declared that the study of poetry would be of value in the university , as tending to the improvement of the sciences , secular and sacred ; recognizing thus that poetry , as a high and holy art , is a motive power among men .

		Not less of literature , but more , is the promise of the future .

		Then it may be that the most pitiable of all sights will vanish from the earth the spectacle of a man who is able to render but a single intellectual response to the universal appeal , the wonder and the glory , of the world .

		Then some other than academical attainments will qualify the doctor of philosophy , even some insight and power .

		But why not recognize at once , with Professor
Corson	PERSON	, that in literature '' Being is teaching , '' and that in the '' university discipline '' being as well as knowing has a place ?

		THE DIAL 205 Itfefo A PSYCHOLOGICAL , AUTOBIOGRAPHY .

		* In composing , or rather in compiling , his life of
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	, Mr.
Horatio F. Brown	PERSON	has confined himself mainly to the task of giving logical and convenient form to the material at his disposal , which has fortu - nately been unusually abundant . ''

		I imagine , '' he says , `` that few men of letters have left be - hind them , in addition to some thirty published volumes , such a mass of letters , diaries , and memoranda as that which has passed through my hands . ''

		The bulk of this material , con - sisting of journals , note-books , an autobiog - raphy , jottings of foreign life and travel , etc. , came directly into the author 's possession under Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	's will ; and this portion has since been liberally supplemented by letters in the hands of relatives and friends , and by a touch - ing account , written by Miss
Margaret Sy	PERSON	- monds , of her father 's last journey and death .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's task has , therefore , been mainly editorial ; and the work before us is virtually an autobiography more specifically , a psy - chological autobiography .

		As such , it is likely to prove a surprise to all but the writer 's closer friends .

		Few who knew Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	personally -LRB- as we gather from Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's engaging sketch of him -RRB- could have surmised that the '' brilliant , audacious exterior '' hid a central core of spiritual pain ; that the genial , cheery conversation , implying at every turn the open sense and the warm artistic temperament , veiled at times a spiritual drama as intense as that which filled the soul of
Bunyan	PERSON	.

		To those who identify religion with fixity and fervor of faith , it may sound paradoxical to say that Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	was both profoundly religious and profoundly skeptical ; yet such was the fact , and the fundamental fact , of his nature .

		To an intellect keenly analytical and impatient of au - thority , a passion for the absolute , and a dis - like of compromise , he joined a temperament essentially religious and perilously emotional . ''

		The central , the architectonic , quality of his nature , '' says one who knew him well , '' was re - ligious .

		... If the honest , courageous recog - nition of the Self confronted with God , the soul with the universe , the struggle to comprehend and be comprehended , is religious , then Sy - *

		monds was preeminently a religious man . ''

		Thus antithetically constituted , with a genius , as it were , for faith , and a passion for demon - stration , his dominating pursuit and life-long occupation was the search for a creed that should satisfy at once his emotional longings and his intellectual scruples .

		This conflict be - tween the desire for the warmth and solace of a personal God , and the rational objections to a God conceived under human attributes ; the clinging to the old , and the vague uneasy sense of the dawning of the new , mark , perhaps , a temperament characteristic of our transitional age , critical and scientific , an age in which , as Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	himself says , '' it is almost the greatest faith to have no faith , for the old faiths are passing away and the new one has not come , and the men of this generation are like travellers before daybreak , the majority asleep , the few awake and watching anxiously for the dawn . ''

		Down to his twenty-ninth year , to what he always termed '' the crisis at
Cannes	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	seems to have confined his specula - tive quest of a self-forged creed to the region of the abstract , where he fought over again , to his infinite spiritual weariness and discomfiture , the old dialectic battles , with the old result , or rather lack of result .

		That he had read Kant previously to this flight into the inane , seems improbable , though we find one reference to the
Konigsberg	PERSON	philosopher .

		After
Cannes	LOCATION	, and down to the end of his life , the inquiry was gradually transferred from the field of the ab - stract to the more congenial , and to his artistic sense more inspiring , field of the concrete ; but the problem and the organic impulse to grap - ple with it remained the same . ''

		I do not think , '' says Mr.
Brown	PERSON	, '' that
Symonds	PERSON	ever expected the problem to be solved , the struggle to be abandoned . '' ''

		The renunciation of the quest would have seemed to him spiritual death the solution of the riddle , also , most likely , death .

		In
December , 1889	DATE	, he wrote : ' When will the soul be at ease ?

		If it has t6 live for - ever , I believe mine will never be at ease . '

		Did he want it to be ?

		I think so , but upon terms which we sup - pose to be precluded by the limitations of human nature , by the loss of its individual self-consciousness , by ab - sorption into the Universal consciousness . '

		E naufragar m ' d dolce in questo mare . ' ''

		The successive steps in Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	's Pyr - rhonic descensus , leading into the -LRB- to him -RRB- fatal abyss of disbelief in a paternal , provi - dential , and humanly lovable God , are clearly traceable in the more introspective journals and letters .

		The process began early .

		A skeptic 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, in his teens , he denied at school the dogmas of original sin and eternal damnation .

		This early lapse could hardly have in itself brought him much spiritual discomfort ; but the habit of doubting , of exacting of each article of faith a precise account of its origin and credentials , once set up , grew apace .

		The result , for a skeptical and severely logical mind , was fore - gone .

		He tells us : '' One after another fell the constituent beliefs of Christianity , and at last , when I considered the history of all religions , and applied the canons of cold analysis to the central creed of all , I was forced to acknowledge that the personal Deity might , after all , be nothing but a mirage a magnificent image of humanity or , as I expressed it , a Brocken spectre , projected by the human consciousness upon the mists of the unknown . ''

		In short , does not man , to reverse the terms of the Mosaic statement , create God in his own image , the concept broadening and refining in proportion to his own advancing growth and refinement ?

		a fact still covered by the meta - phor of the
Brocken	PERSON	spectre , since a giant causes a more splendid phantom than a dwarf .

		In every humanly possible idea of God is present and paramount the element of anthropomorph - ism , so fatal from a rational , yet so precious and salutary from an emotional , standpoint , for is not , after all , a creed which lacks this central and vital concept of a personal and therefore an anthropomorphic God the coldest and most cheerless of empty formulas , a repel - lant Frankenstein-fabric , lacking , as it were , a soul ?

		The overthrow of the hypothesis of a personal God marked the turning-point in Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	's speculations .

		He had reached this nadir of the destructive process '' hastily , ea - gerly , and full of zeal , '' and found himself , at the supreme moment of iconoclastic conquest , face to face with weakness and death .

		Thence - forth , then , the problem of problems must be to build if possible , even to re-build , to re - place with loving care stone by stone the frag - ments of the temple he had thrown down . ''

		I had , '' he says , '' to seek some formula which should satisfy me about myself , the universe , the future .

		How have these things come about ?

		what do they mean ? ''

		Turning for light here to science , one finds its quasi - explanations confessedly null touching these ultimate questions .

		Science knits the web of the larger experience , formulates the cosmic process , subsumes the particular under the gen - eral and the general under the more general a process obviously limited and blocked at pre - cisely the point where the metaphysical inquiry begins ; but so far from explaining , in any re - ligious or transcendent -LRB- extra - experiential -RRB- sense , science tends to breed the conviction that such explanation is impossible .

		Science only intensifies the final mystery and whets the crav - ing for a solution , by telling , in terms unreal - izable and grandiose , of '' innumerable myriads of years , '' of a stretch of time compared with which the duration of the human race is but '' a scape in oblivion , '' of an infinitude of globes and constellations infinitely beyond those to which -LRB- if there be a perceiving eye there -RRB- the light of our sun penetrates vaguely as a mere glow-worm spark or twinkling taper .

		Sci - ence , indeed , everywhere finds law ; but , dis - cerning no Lawgiver , inclines to think the crav - ing for one is but a human and perhaps a transient weakness , an '' idol of the tribe . ''

		The object of its own faith it finds in an eter - nal order , bringing forth ceaseless change , through endless time , in endless space : a con - clusion intellectually imposing , but , to the de - votional temper , lame and impotent enough .

		On comparing the ascertained facts of sci - ence with the Ptolemaic and even ruder concep - tions underlying the general scheme of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , with its primitive spatial and temporal postulates , Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	seems to have found his crucial difficulty in the doctrine of the As - cension : '' When I carried that dogma of the Ascension , on which the peculiarly Christian idea of a corporeal im - mortality rests , to science , science derided it .

		< For , ' she aptly said , ' in infinite space there is no height nor depth ; a body carried upwards through the clouds be - yond the force of gravitation , if that were possible , is simply lost , Do you not perceiye that the Ascension was a beautiful myth , adapted to the simple conception of the universe as it existed in those unscientific days , the whole value of which is now historical , and which must be placed with the other instructive and exquisite religions of the world ? '

		This reasoning I could not answer ; in fact , it seems to me unanswerable .

		And with the Ascension , which is the master-miracle of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , the minor miracles had to give way .

		Christian - ity took its place among the religions of the world , and told me far more about the human than the divine na - ture . ''

		For a man of Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	's temper there was clearly no middle course here , no a pen pres , no convenient half-way station between denial and acceptance .

		Having rejected Christianity in part , he rejected it in all .

		Some will say that , finding the husk of no value , he threw away the kernel not always the highest proof of wisdom .

		The qualified adherence to
Chris	PERSON	- tianity of men like his Oxford mentors , the Master of Balliol and Professor Conington , was impossible for him ; it had , he said character - istically , '' something illogical in it . ''

		Reject -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 207 ing Christianity , he tried in turn , and '' some - what contemptuously '' threw aside , the current spiritual nostrums , more or less idly ingenious attempts at mediation between the outworn old and the conjectural new ; he felt that he '' should not be saved by any of these palliatives . ''

		To one goaded on as he was to suicide itself as a means of discovering the truth , patient agnos - ticism was impossible .

		Even Spinozism , which must have powerfully attracted his intellectual nature , would not do for him . ''

		I would sooner , '' he exclaims , '' have Comte than the worshippers of Ens ! ''

		We have spoken of '' the crisis at
Cannes	LOCATION	'' as the turning-point in Mr.
Syrnonds	PERSON	's spiritual fortunes .

		Extracts from his papers at that pe - riod will serve to show what a struggle it cost him to abandon his old creed .

		They will show also , what most readers will conjecture at the start , that his spiritual torments , the paroxysms of mental agony which racked him at intervals through life and brought him to the brink of madness and suicide , had their pathological side .

		There was more point than solace in the remark he quotes of a common-sense , well - digesting friend -LRB- who probably regarded the possession of '' nerves '' as a reprehensible weak - ness -RRB- that '' when people talk of hell they often mean a state of their nerves . ''

		Touching the
Cannes	LOCATION	crisis , Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	says : '' All the evil humors which were fermenting in my petty state of man poignant and depressing memories of past troubles , physical maladies of nerve-substance and of lung-tissue , decompositions of habitual creeds , sentimental vapors , doubts about the moral basis to hu - man life , thwarted intellectual activity , ambitions rudely checked by impotence , all these miserable factors of a wretched inner life boiled up in a kind of devil 's caldron during those last weeks at
Cannes	LOCATION	, and made existence hell .

		The crisis I passed through then was decisive for my future career .

		... I contemplated suicide .

		But death is not acceptable it offers no solution .

		I loathe myself , and turn in every direction to find strength .

		What I want is life ; the source of life fails me .

		... In my present state of entire negation I can not get the faith without the strength , or the strength without the faith .

		Both remain outside my reach ... The
last night	TIME	I spent in
Cannes	LOCATION	was the worst of my whole life .

		I lay awake motionless , my soul stagnant , feeling what is meant by spiritual blackness and darkness .

		If it should last forever ?

		As I lay , a tightening approached my heart .

		It came nearer , the grasp grew firmer , I was cold and lifeless in the clutch of a great agony .

		If this were death ?


Catherine	PERSON	, who kept hold of me , seemed far away .

		I was alone , so utterly desolate that I drank the very cup of the terror of the grave .

		The Valley of the Shadow was opened , and the shadow still lies upon my soul .

		... In another nature , acting under other circumstances , the phenomenon of what is called ' conversion ' might have been exhibited .

		With me it was different .

		I emerged at last into stoical acceptance of my place in the world , combined with epicurean in - dulgence .

		Together , these two motives restored me to comparative health , gave me religion , and enabled me , in spite of broken nerves and diseased lungs , to do what I have done in literature . ''

		The '' religion '' which was the outcome of the
Cannes	LOCATION	crisis was remote enough from what men commonly understand by that now omin - ously elastic term .

		It was , rather , a substitute for religion ; a last resort ; a drifting spar clung to by one who had long battled with the waves of doubt and darkness , and despaired of the haven .

		It was an abandonment of the old prob - lems , seen at last to be insoluble ; a shifting of the inquiry from the abstract to the pheno - menal , as to the only field where knowledge is possible .

		Doubtless there remained a glim - mering hope , a hoping against hope , that even in the field of sense patient interrogation might yield some faint intimation of the mystery '' be - hind the veil . ''

		Turning to Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	's own confessedly cloudy statement of his self - forged religion , it appears as a nebulous com - pound of pantheism , poetry , stoico-epicurean morality , and generalized science of the Spen - cerian type .

		As it is labelled the '' Religion of the Cosmic Enthusiasm , '' one may pardon - ably infer , as a further element , a tincture of what the Germans call Schw ` drmer & L This sys - tem Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	thought '' the only creed compatible with agnosticism forced upon a can - did mind . '' ''

		Nothing but the bare thought of a God-penetrated universe , and of myself as an essential part of it , to - gether with all things that appear in their succession ether and inorganic matter passing into plants , and creatures of the sea and beasts rising to men and women like myself , and onward from us progressing to the stage of life unrealised by human reason nothing but the naked yet inebriating vision of such a cosmos satis - fied me as a possible object of worship .

		When this thought flooded me , and filled the inmost fibres of my sentient being , I discovered that I was almost at rest about birth and death , and moral duties , and the prob - lem of immortality .

		Having lost the consolations of faith in redemption through
Christ	LOCATION	, and all that per - tains thereto , I had gained in exchange this , that I could lay myself upon the knees Of Doom , and take mine everlasting 1 ease . ' ''

		We have dwelt perhaps too exclusively upon the religious phase of Mr.
Symouds	PERSON	's life-story though this is clearly its dominant element , and the one by virtue of which , to our think - ing , it outweighs intrinsically and will outlive -LRB- as a vivid and eloquent record of our age of spiritual unrest and change -RRB- all else that its writer has given us .

		There is much , of course , in Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	's life that we have not touched upon here : the charming story -LRB- as good as 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	,
David Copperfield	PERSON	-RRB- of his boyhood ; the school - days at
Harrow	LOCATION	; the years at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	under Professors
Jowett	PERSON	and Conington ; the rich travel-pictures ; the tale of his literary career and aspirations ; but for all this , and much more , we must send the reader to the original .

		It were ungracious to close our review of these beautiful volumes without adding a word of thanks to Mr.
Brown	PERSON	for his admirable editing .

		Painstaking , ingenious , and unobtrusive , it could scarcelv be bettered .


E. G. J. LAFAYETTE	PERSON	IN THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION .

		* Mr.
Charlemagne Tower , Jr.	PERSON	, has given us , in two interesting volumes , the best statement that has hitherto been published relating to
Lafayette	LOCATION	in the American Revolution , and , within the limits imposed upon himself , has also given a satisfactory account of the attitude and policy of
France	LOCATION	in our War of Independence .

		If Mr. Tower had added a chapter illustrating the diplomacy of
France	LOCATION	, under the malign in - fluence of
Spain	LOCATION	, relating to the peace negotia - tions of
1782 ' 83	DATE	, in which it was proposed to leave the
United States	LOCATION	a weak nation within the limits of the
Alleghany	ORGANIZATION	mountains and the
Atlantic	LOCATION	and the
Eastern States	LOCATION	, without an acre of ground in the great valley that in a few years was to become the centre of national power , readers of his work would better un - derstand the policy of
France	LOCATION	in the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the
summer	DATE	and
fall of 1776	DATE	,
Lafayette	LOCATION	completed his arrangements to give himself to the American cause .

		It was the darkest period of the War .


New York	LOCATION	was held by the British fleet and army .

		The disastrous battle of
Long Island	LOCATION	had been fought on the
27th of August	DATE	.

		The British cabinet industriously sent over
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope reports that the colonial armies were van - quished .

		Vergennes was compelled to suspend his nearly-completed negotiations with
Spain	LOCATION	for an alliance with
France	LOCATION	in aid of the
United States	LOCATION	; and the alliance was never consummated .


Silas Dean	PERSON	, American agent at
Paris	LOCATION	, was dis - couraged ; and he notified
Lafayette	LOCATION	that , under the circumstances , it would be better to sus - pend his undertaking .

		The answer of
Lafay	PERSON	- ette was characteristic of his inflexible will and purpose .

		In his memoirs he says : * THE MARQUIS DB LA FAYBTTE IN THE AMERICAN REVO - LUTION .

		With some account of the attitude of
France	LOCATION	toward the War of Independence .

		By
Charlemagne Tower	ORGANIZATION	, Jr. .

		In two volumes , illustrated .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		I went to Mr.
Dean	PERSON	and thanked him for his frank - ness . '

		Up to this moment , sir , ' I added , ' you have seen only my zeal ; it is going , perhaps , to become iise - f ul ; I am buying a ship which will carry over your offi - cers ; it is necessary to show some confidence , and it is in danger that I like to share your fortunes . ' ''

		Lafayette was not quite twenty years old , when -LRB-
July 27 , 1777	DATE	-RRB- he presented to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the agreement of Dean , approved by
Franklin	PERSON	, appointing him a major general in the armies of the
United States	LOCATION	.


Congress	ORGANIZATION	hesitated to ratify the appointment .


Washington	LOCATION	had been much perplexed by the applications of French officers for commissions in the service .


Lafay	PERSON	- ette , writing to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, said : '' After the sac - rifices I have made , I have the right to ask two favors at your hands : the one is to serve with - out pay , at my own expense ; and the other , that I be allowed to serve , at first , as a volunteer . ''

		Thereupon -LRB-
July 31 , 1777	DATE	-RRB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	declared : '' Whereas , the
Marquis	PERSON	de
Lafayette	LOCATION	, out of his great zeal to the cause of liberty , in which the
United States	LOCATION	are engaged , has left his family and connections , and , at his own expense , come over to offer his services to the
United States	LOCATION	, without pension or particular allowance , and is anxious to risque his life in our cause Resolved , that his services be accepted , and that , in consideration of his zeal , illustrious family , and connections , he have rank and commission of Major General in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		A few days later
Lafayette	LOCATION	was presented to
Washington	LOCATION	at a dinner in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		As the party was about breaking up ,
Washington	LOCATION	took
Lafayette	LOCATION	aside , complimented him upon his zeal and sacrifices , and invited him to make the military quarters of the Commander-in - Chief his home .

		That was the beginning of an historic friendship .

		Lafayette performed his first military serv - ice under
Washington	LOCATION	, as a volunteer , at Bran - dywine , about six weeks after he received his commission .

		Of this event Mr.
Tower	PERSON	says : '' His conduct during that day had been viewed with the greatest favor by those who shared its incidents with him .

		He had shown himself a man of courage and a soldier ; and although he had been , but a few hours before , but a foreigner , a stranger who had come into the continental army , he was welcomed , that night , in the American camps , as a tried friend and a comrade . ''

		A wound received at
Brandywine	ORGANIZATION	put
Lafay	PERSON	- ette under the surgeon 's care for about six weeks .

		Before his wound was healed , he was again in the saddle ; and he received a favor - able notice from
General Green	ORGANIZATION	for his part in the small action near
Gloucester	LOCATION	.

		Lafayette had now won his spurs ; and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, upon the recommendation of
Washington	LOCATION	, authorized giving to
Lafayette	LOCATION	a separate command .

		With some enthusiasm , Mr.
Tower	PERSON	says :
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 209 '' That which gave
Lafayette	LOCATION	the affection of General
Washington	LOCATION	, which won his way to the hearts of the American people , and made him one of the leaders in the War of Independence , was neither the nobleman nor the representative ; it was the man
Lafayette	LOCATION	himself . ''

		The American army lay at
Valley Forge	ORGANIZATION	in the memorable winter of 1777-8 .

		The British army occupied
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		On the 6th of
February , 1778	DATE	, treaties of commerce and alli - ance were entered into with
France	LOCATION	.

		It was understood that in consequence of those treaties a French fleet equal to the British fleet would soon appear in the American waters .

		In that case ,
Clinton	PERSON	would no longer be safe in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .


Washington	LOCATION	, desiring accurate inform - ation in relation to the movements of
Clinton	PERSON	, sent
Lafayette	LOCATION	, with twenty-two hundred picked troops , to Barren Hill , about eleven miles from the city , to watch the movements of
Clinton	PERSON	, who in turn led out his whole army , more than four times larger than the American force , in the confident expectation of capturing
Lafay	PERSON	- ette .

		But
Lafayette	LOCATION	, by good strategy , foiled the combinations of
Clinton	PERSON	, and drew off his forces without the loss of a man .


Clinton	PERSON	then evacuated
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, marching across
New Jersey	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	, pursued by the American army , which , on the
28th of June	DATE	, fought the drawn battle of
Monmouth	LOCATION	, that might have been a defeat but for the genius of Washing - ton , or a victory but for the treachery of Lee .

		On that day the conduct of
Lafayette	LOCATION	gained for him new laurels .


Clinton	PERSON	did not retire too soon .

		But for untoward delays , the French fleet , in connection with the land forces would -LRB- to use an expression of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have '' bottled up '' the British army on the Dela - ware , as it was afterward '' bottled up '' on the
Chesapeake	LOCATION	.

		On the 21st of
October , 1778	DATE	,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	gave
Lafayette	LOCATION	leave to go to
France	LOCATION	, '' and to re - turn at such time as shall be most convenient to him . ''

		He had come to the
United States	LOCATION	with the promise of a youth of wealth , noble birth , liberal education , and an unfaltering de - votion to the cause of American liberty ; he returned , a man tested by important military service , with the love of the people , the respect of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and the approval of
Washington	LOCATION	, then coming to his recognized position among the great men of the world .

		Lafayette was first of all a Frenchman .

		But , consulted by the king , the ministers , and other eminent men in
France	LOCATION	, in matters relating to the war , he rendered , in his absence from the
United States	LOCATION	, inestimable service to the American cause .

		He arrived at
Boston	LOCATION	, on his return to the
United States	LOCATION	,
April 28 , 1780	DATE	.

		I pass over many interesting events in which
Lafayette	LOCATION	had an influential part , the opera - tions in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, the operations of the French fleet under
Estaing	ORGANIZATION	, the usefulness of
Lafayette	LOCATION	in soothing the jealousies of French officers , and his influence over
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and in the
States	LOCATION	.

		Mr. Tower appropriately gives a large space to an account of the aid given by
France	LOCATION	in response to urgent appeals from the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the first years the aid was given secretly , in order to keep up an appear - ance of neutrality with
England	LOCATION	.

		At the time of
Washington	LOCATION	's disastrous defeat on
Long Island	LOCATION	, while
Vergennes	LOCATION	was giving , and meant to continue secretly giving , all the aid in his power to the
United States	LOCATION	, he wrote to the British minister that he was deeply touched by the attention which permitted him to share the joy he felt at the happy news of the success of the British arms .

		At that very moment Ver - gennes was anxiously waiting for the time when he might throw off all disguise , and give openly and on a large scale all the help the Americans required to win their cause .

		The surrender of
Burgoyne	PERSON	's entire army -LRB-
October 17	DATE	, 1777 -RRB- , gave
Vergennes	LOCATION	his opportunity . ''

		Aut nunc , aut nun quam '' he said .

		The treaty of Feb - ruary 5 ,
1778	DATE	, led to the final victory which ended the war
October 19 , 1781	DATE	; for it is prob - able , if not certain , that without French credit , money , fleets , and soldiers , the American ar - mies , would have been destroyed .

		It does not follow , however , that the spirit of American independence , which took root from
1630	DATE	, would have been extirpated by the entire de - struction of the American armies at that time .

		Burke , in his speech on '' Conciliation with
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
March 22 , 1775	DATE	-RRB- , and Turgot , in his celebrated memoir to the king -LRB-
April 7 , 1776	DATE	-RRB- , declared that upon the destruction of the American armies the contest would be transferred to the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, where British fleets could not penetrate and where British armies would not succeed .

		It is due , however , to French aid , that our cause tri - umphed in the seaboard states where the war began .

		Nor , as Mr.
Tower	PERSON	says , is our debt of gratitude at all cancelled by the considera - tion that
France	LOCATION	acted wholly from interested motives .

		And it is evident enough that , with notable exceptions as in the case of
Lafayette	LOCATION	, Frenchmen generally did not love the Amer - ican cause nor the American people .

		Ver - gennes was frank enough to make no such pre - 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, tence .

		The American colonists had fought under British banners in the war of
1756	DATE	.

		In addition to immense contributions of money , they raised twenty-eight thousand provincial troops ,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	alone raising seven thou - sand men .

		In that war
Washington	LOCATION	won his first military distinction .

		The humiliating treaty of
1763	DATE	, by which
France	LOCATION	was forced to part with all her American possessions on the main land , had left among the French people an inextinguishable hatred of
England	LOCATION	, such as is now felt in
France	LOCATION	against
Germany	LOCATION	for the loss of
Alsace	LOCATION	and
Lorraine	PERSON	.

		The American war , then , was for most Frenchmen an occa - sion for revenge or a possible opportunity to recover the territory lost under the treaty of
1763	DATE	.

		It was the policy of the British Cabinet , in the first three or four years of the Revolution - ary war , to hold possession of the great cities , as
Boston	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		After years of fighting it was discovered that on that policy the country could not be conquered .

		It was then decided to send armies sufficient to subdue and hold the
Southern States	LOCATION	, leaving the North to be dealt with afterward .


Charles	PERSON	- ton was reduced .

		Lord
Cornwallis	PERSON	, left in com - mand of the south , on the
25th of April , 1781	DATE	, transferred his army to
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		To meet the changed conditions ,
Washington	LOCATION	assigned to
Lafayette	LOCATION	a separate command in
Virginia	LOCATION	, where he began active operations on the
10th of April	DATE	.

		This was the last and most import - ant military service of
Lafayette	LOCATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		I shall not attempt to follow
Lafay	PERSON	- ette in the marches and counter-marches of this campaign , covering eleven hundred miles , and over historic ground now especially familiar to readers of the
Virginia	LOCATION	campaigns in our late Rebellion .

		Mr. Tower 's excellent maps enable the reader to follow the entire campaign intelli - gently .

		His force was not sufficient , however , to justify him in bringing on or accepting a gen - eral engagement with
Cornwallis	PERSON	; but he kept the latter constantly occupied , under the instruc - tions of
Washington	LOCATION	, until the
Compte de Grasse	ORGANIZATION	, with a fleet and an army , arrived in
Chesapeake Bay	LOCATION	on the
30th of August	DATE	, when the British army was completely invested within its fortifications at
Yorktown	LOCATION	.

		The French of - ficers desired to make the assault at once , and win for themselves the glory of overthrowing
Cornwallis	PERSON	; but
Lafayette	LOCATION	, as commander-in - chief , wisely determined to wait until Wash - ington , transferring his army from the
Hudson	LOCATION	, should reach the field , take command of the allied armies , and make victory sure in the final battle of the Revolution .

		Lafayette 's military service in the American Revolution ended with the surrender of Corn - wallis .

		He sailed from
Boston	LOCATION	on the 27th of
December	DATE	in the '' Alliance , '' placed at his dis - posal by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Just before he sailed ,
Washington	LOCATION	, writing to him , said : '' I owe it to your friendship and to my affectionate regard for you , my dear
Marquis	PERSON	, not to let you leave this country without carrying with you fresh marks of my attachment to you , and new expressions of the high sense I entertain of your military conduct and other im - portant services in the last campaign , although the latter are too well known to need the testimony of my appro - bation , and the former I persuade myself you believe is too well riveted to undergo diminution or change . ''

		These were not idle words of compliment .

		They were the expression of the habitual feel - ing of
Washington	LOCATION	in relation to
Lafayette	LOCATION	, who was the only foreigner in our armies who had his unqualified confidence and friendship .

		It was a great distinction , and one entirely de - served .


Lafayette	LOCATION	, says
Henry Martin	PERSON	, never changed . ''

		What , above all , distinguishes
Lafayette	LOCATION	, '' says le Comte de Segur , '' is an unchangeable constancy of character , which tends without deviation always to the same end .

		To work ceaselessly to establish , extend , and consolidate liberty is the dominant idea which for more than fifty years has directed his conduct , animated his soul , and inspired his words . ''

		Lovers of liberty , on two continents , cherish his name , on which no clouds rest ex - cept those arising from calumnies engendered in a later strife , some of which , like the vil - lainous charge relating to his conduct on the 5th and
6th of October , 1789	DATE	, were invented on the return of the Bourbons to
France	LOCATION	in
1814	DATE	.

1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 tion of essays on Chinese life entitled '' A Cor - ner of Cathay . ''

		The book is a shining ex - ample of intelligent observation and equally judicious selection .

		It seems to entirely fill
Bovee	PERSON	's two requisites of a book : it is '' luminous and not voluminous . ''

		The titles of the chap - ters show the attractive and varied nature of the subjects treated : '' Farm Life in
China	LOCATION	, '' '' Economy , Household and Personal , '' `` Mar - riage Laws and Usages , '' `` Mortuary Cus - toms , '' '' Babies and their Grandmothers , '' `` Children 's Games , '' `` Schools and Schooling , '' '' Measures of Time , '' '' Suits in Law , '' '' Fab - ulous People and Animals , '' '' Sundry Super - stitions , '' '' A Queer Autumn Entertainment . ''

		`` The Chinese Theory of Evolution , '' ''
Confu	PERSON	- cius and his Teaching , '' '' The Tauists and their Magic Arts , '' '' Chinese Piety , Filial , Fraternal , and Friendly . ''

		It seems impossible to quote , when each page vies with its neighbor in in - terest .

		In the last chapter a touching passage occurs in the story of the bad wife , who de - sired her husband to kill his feeble and depend - ent old mother .

		He consented , and took his old parent away on his back , pretending that he was carrying her out to take the country air .

		On the way , the old woman told her son he had gladdened her heart ten times . ''

		The first was when he was born , when after much sorrow she knew she had a living boy ; the second was when she first saw him smile , and knew that he was comfortable in her arms ; the third was when he first held a thing in his hand , and she knew by his grasp upon it that he was strong ; the fourth was when he be - gan to walk , and she knew that he would learn to take care of himself and to help her ; the fifth was when he first went off to gather fuel , and she thought that hav - ing him she could keep the house and make a home ; the sixth was when she first gave him some money and he started off without her to buy their food in the mar - ket ; the seventh was when she could afford to let him go to school , and he came back at nightfall and told her what the teacher had taught him ; the eighth was when he put on the garb of an adult , and she knew she had a man to depend on at last ; the ninth was when she got a wife for him , had paid all the wedding expenses , and made him able to establish a household of his own ; the tenth was when he just now took her on his back , to carry her out to get sight of the sky and fields , that she might be refreshed and live the longer .

		As she talked thus , her son 's heart was softened , and he could not cast away the mother who had loved him so well . ''

		The chapters on farm-life and economy teem with new , surprising , and important informa - tion ; the ones on schools and children 's games are particularly pleasing .

		Miss Fielde is fitted , through her fifteen years ' residence in
China	LOCATION	, her perfect knowledge of the language , as shown in her marvellous `` Swatow Dictionary , '' and her intelligent discernment , to be an authority upon the subject on which she has written ; and we must have confidence in her judgment when she says of the Chinese : '' That they are people of the highest capabilities is well known to the writer through her personal acquaint - ance with isolated instances of unselfish tenderness , of lofty self-respect , of true spiritual aspiration , and of wide philanthropy , and through her constant observa - tion among them of heroic endurance , of marvellous patience , and of sublime earnestness . ''

		The volume `` Across
Asia	LOCATION	on a Bicycle '' is made up of a series of sketches describing part of a bicycle journey round the world , by two young Americans immediately after their grad - uation from
Washington University	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		They were three years on the journey , and covered over fifteen thousand miles ; they took over two thousand photographs , selections from which are reproduced in the illustrations of the volume .

		The services of guides and interpre - ters were never employed on the trip ; and , without doubt , the hardships of travel were thus much increased .

		But a closer acquaint - ance with strange people was also gained .

		The most interesting chapter in the book is , in view of the present state of affairs , an account of an interview with
Li Hung Chang	PERSON	, the Prime Minister of
China	LOCATION	.

		The description of his person runs thus : '' His face was distinctly oval , tapering from a very broad to a sharp pointed chin , half obscured by his thin gray goatee .

		The crown of his head was shaven in the usual Tseng fashion , leaving a tuft of hair for a queue , which , in the viceroy 's case , was short and very thin .

		His dry , sallow skin showed signs of wrinkling ; a thick fold lay under each eye and at each end of his upper lip .

		There were no prominent cheekbones , nor almond - shaped eyes , which are so distinctively seen in most of the Mongolian race .

		Under the scraggy mustache we could distinguish a rather benevolent though determined mouth ; while his small keen eyes , which were rather sunken , gave forth a flash which was perhaps but a flickering ember of the fire they once contained .

		The left eye , which was partly closed by a paralytic stroke several years ago , gave him a rather artful , waggish appearance .

		The whole physiognomy was that of a man of strong intention , with the ability to force his point when necessary , and the shrewd common sense to yield when desiring to be politic . ''

		The interview impresses us with the Prime Min - ister 's great shrewdness and inquisitiveness . ''

		A merry heart goes all the day , Your sad tires in a mile-a , '' might well be the motto of the joyous book given to us under the happy title '' When We Were Strolling Players in the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		Radiant good spirits , good health , good courage , and a good heart , sparkle in all the pages .

		Even the shadow cast by the two little graves left by the wayside is tender rather than sombre .

		For 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, Mrs.
Miln	PERSON	and her husband did not stroll through Oriental lands unimpeded and unham - pered .

		Young children , and maids and valets , and a company of actors , seemed , however , to her but the natural accompaniments to
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	travel .

		Doubtless in the book on
Japan	LOCATION	by another woman traveller , Mrs.
Isabella Bird Bishop	PERSON	, more real information of the country can be obtained ; but this actress , born in
America	LOCATION	in the South , bred in
California	LOCATION	in the West , educated at
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	in the
East	LOCATION	, and married to an English actor , has such a cheer - ful , interesting way of giving her information , that we love to read it .

		Perhaps the most in - teresting chapters are on four women that Mrs.
Miln	PERSON	knew in Tokio .

		Three were Japanese , one was the Anglo-Saxon wife of a Japanese gentleman .

		Two she met for the first time ; two she had known at
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the latter was
Stamatz Yamakawa	PERSON	, wife of
Japan	LOCATION	's War Minister ,
Oyama	LOCATION	.

		She had lived ten years in
America	LOCATION	, part of the time in the home of Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	.

		She was eleven years old when she came here .

		A brilliant scholar , she took high honors , wrote charming essays , was president of her class , eager to acquire all occidentalisms of thought and dress .

		On her return , she married her elderly husband , to whom she never spoke till after the mar - riage ; and Mrs.
Miln	PERSON	found the girl who had been so anxious to maintain for
Japan	LOCATION	a high intellectual standard , relapsed into a perfect Oriental , drowsy , gentle , a stickler for eti - quette , never reading a word of English or French , caring nothing for news of her college mates , faded in her beauty .

		The other
Japan	LOCATION	- ese Vassar student , of lower birth , is now a teacher of music in the Empress ' College .

		Madame Sannoniya stands alone the one
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean woman of high character , high intellect , and charming personality , who has become a naturalized and potential individual at an East - ern court .

		She is the respected wife of an em - inent man , who is said to be the handsomest man in
Japan	LOCATION	, and the intimate friend of the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The title given by Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	him - self to the papers in his '' Wandering Words '' '' sketchy recollections '' is thoroughly ap - propriate .

		The sketch entitled '' Tent Life '' is scarcely more than an outline , and a rather commonplace outline at that .

		The papers on
Japan	LOCATION	, entitled '' Love and Marriage in Ja - pan , '' '' Japanese Wrestlers , '' '' Some Japanese Pictures , '' `` Oriental Story-Tellers , '' are the most interesting in the book ; and the descrip - tions of life in that land , so beloved of the au - thor , flow with the sugary , sensuous sweetness which he always pours forth at the thought of that earthly Paradise .

		He repeats and empha - sizes his assertion that the Japanese women are semi-angelic , the most pleasing of their sex , and of the purest and most refined on earth .

		That they are tranquil , gentle , and delicate , all who have ever had the pleasure of Japanese women-friends can corroboratively testify .

		We are certainly given plenty of variety in this book .

		We skip from
Honolulu	LOCATION	to peer through the Lick Telescope ; then we are upset in a dahdbeah on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, but are rescued , and travel through the Holy Land to
India	LOCATION	, thence to
Japan	LOCATION	, back to
India	LOCATION	, and again to
Japan	LOCATION	.

		We are then suddenly startled by a purely En - glish tale of the rescue of a nude bather by his sweetheart , which seems but a chilly relation , through its neighborhood to the glowing chap - ters , '' The Tiger 's Village and Wild Boars . ''

		Then we have a realistic study of an English character worthy of
Hardy	LOCATION	's pages , '' a tar - man '' ; then two very nice English stories ; then , through '' Days at Sea , '' to the Orient again , and again to the
Sandwich Islands	LOCATION	, and thence home to
England	LOCATION	; a slipshod , inartistic ar - rangement , by which both Oriental and
Occi	PERSON	- dental tales suffer .

		The book is handsomely printed and illustrated .

		THE DIAL 213 marring to the first assertion .

		Yet they are involved in each other .

		If religion stands for a potent , ever - present combination of causes at work among those forces which collectively make up history , then his - tory , in its unfolding , in its revelation of truth by results in action , must be the only sufficient and ade - quate disclosure of the real nature of any form of faith .

		We must know exactly how that faith pushed its way in the world of realities ; how far events , social and spiritual , accepted it as congenital with themselves ; how far they rejected it as alien to their ultimate success in a
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		These two assertions proceed on the notion that religion , as one whole , stands for natural forces , not supernatural forces , as we ordinarily use the words .

		Religion as strictly supernatural could not find its way into history .

		Like foreign material in a living organism , it would be constantly cast out .

		But if religion is congenital with the human mind , then it follows that history , growth , is the discriminating process by which its just and unjust , less just and more just , forces are discriminated from each other , and at length pronounced on in their ministrations to life .

		The supernatural is in men 's minds only the shadows of those things , not the very things themselves , which work salvation .

		It is very interesting , therefore , to find , as in the works now before us , that history is constantly gain - ing a firmer hold on religion , and that none , even the most obstinate adherents to dogma , wholly over - look it .

		The higher criticism is only an effort to render faithfully historic forces , and the very mo - ment history enters it pushes to this logical result .

		The natural suffers no gaps ; it takes religion to its very soul , and what it can not so appropriate , it leaves behind as error .

		The first of these books , '' The Permanent Value of the Book of Genesis , '' presents an example , which is now becoming strange , of the utter subordination of history to dogma .

		It would matter but little what the facts were , after they had been steamed and twisted in the heat of such a faith as is here presented , they would begin to take the form re - quired of them .

		The book is greatly deficient in his - toric sense and lucidity of thought .

		Perhaps these few sentences may let the reader into its temper . ''

		The Deluge , with its clear piercing note of Judg - ment upon sin , guards through all the ages the true sig - nificance of the Passion of the Christ .

		For it compels men to trace in the Cross the eternal revelation of the wrath of God against moral evil , the fullest manifesta - tion of God 's absolute righteousness , as well as the su - preme appeal of His love .

		Thus the character of God is vindicated from all appearance of indifference to sin .

		The way is prepared for the
Revelation of Himself	ORGANIZATION	in our suffering flesh as men are thus taught to look on from that supreme manifestation of love to the great Judgment , to the disclosures of God 's final and absolute verdict upon human action , when the true measure of each shall be fully shown , as it has all the time been clear and open in the sight of God '' -LRB- page 164 -RRB- .

		If the deluge had so much work on hand , no wonder that it happened . ''

		The Religion of Moses '' is a small volume , con - cisely and clearly written , with great positiveness of thought .

		It aims , as against modern criticism , to rehabilitate , and more than rehabilitate ,
Moses	PERSON	as the great prophet and law-giver of his people .

		The author regards him as the Founder of the Theistic faith of
Israel	LOCATION	.

		As the book , however , opens no new lines of criticism , and confines itself chiefly to a re-rendering of the facts as it conceives them , it does not much alter the question at issue . ''

		The Messiah of the Gospels '' is a sequel to '' Messianic Prophecy , '' and it itself opens the way for a third volume yet to appear on the Messiah of the Epistles and Apocalypse .

		The present volume discusses the Messianic ideas which immediately preceded the Gospels , and the Messiah as presented by each Evangelist .

		It also considers the apocalypse of Jesus as .

		given in the synoptic Gospels .

		The work is a laborious and scholarly one , but is severely trammelled by the conception that these various forms of anticipation have a definite prophetic hold on history .

		Every form of faith , springing from a spiritual interpretation of events , must give rise to a forecast of coming events .

		This forecast con - stitutes its apocalyptic temper , and is a matter of interest as a disclosure of its own character .

		When , however , these conceptions lose their living specu - lative force , and are transformed into a vision of coming events , they become perplexing , and , in a large measure , profitless riddles .

		How much acu - men has been wasted on Revelation !

		There can not well be a more marked inversion of ideas than to suppose that the anticipations of history control his - tory itself , are inseparably associated with it .

		The Professor is compelled , by the want of conformity of events with the shadows of them in men 's minds , to defer the fulfilment of these prophetic ideas . ''

		We have gone rapidly over the eleven Messianic ideals of the Old Testament , and have found only a single one of them , the suffering prophet , was entirely fulfilled by the earthly life of Jesus .

		... It is clear , therefore , that the vast majority of the predictions of the Old Testament prophets and the great mass of their ideals were taken up by Jesus into his predictive proph - ecy and projected into the future '' -LRB- page 336 -RRB- .

		It remains to be seen whether the final volume will still leave these Messianic ideas in the air .

		The title ''
Simon Peter	PERSON	, His Later Life and La - bors , '' is somewhat misleading .

		The book seems to be made up of brief evening lectures , whose unity is chiefly found in the fact that the passage of Scrip - ture selected has usually some connection with
Peter	PERSON	.

		The apostle and his experiences are viewed as a text rather than as a study .

		As lectures , the sev - eral chapters are popular and effective rather than critical and instructive .

		The volume contains some fine pictorial illustrations . ''

		Saint
Paul	PERSON	and His Missions '' is a book which aims to give a vivid historical foreground to the missionary life of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a book of an ex - cellent kind , and admirable of its kind .

		A distinct and realistic character in the circumstances and 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, events which surrounded the apostle makes that great figure in human history more familiar and impressive to us , and tends ultimately to a more just estimate of his works on a basis of facts .

		His - tory and geography contribute freely to the purpose of the writer , and his book is both agreeable and instructive . ''

		St.
Paul	PERSON	's Conception of Christianity '' offers a very full , discriminating , and candid discussion of the doctrinal beliefs of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, the constructive outline of his religious theory .

		The author recog - nizes the fact that the conception of salvation , as entertained by
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, is diverse from that in - volved in the words of Christ , though he softens the difference between them .

		Our Lord makes spiritual development a perfectly open and normal move - ment in human life .

		The disciple is as a child with God .

		Nothing intervenes to disturb them .

		All progress is growth an enlarged interplay of vital impulses between them .

		St.
Paul	PERSON	, on the other hand , profoundly influenced by his own misleading ex - periences and futile efforts , believes that legal bar - riers lie athwart the upward way , and are to be re - moved as a condition of salvation .

		Thus the death of Christ is not merely an appeal to the heart of man , but makes new relations with God possible to him .

		Much of the confusion and controversy in the - ology have arisen from an effort to reconcile and make identical the perfectly free naturalistic con - ception of Christ with the artificial and arbitrary one of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	.

		The moment we are content to accept a radical diversity in these two outlooks on the spiritual world , the binding power of dogma gives way , and the spiritual world becomes to us a new creation .

		In this particular the free recog - nition of the diversities of belief involved in the New Testament '' The Gospel and its Earliest In - terpretations , '' by Rev.
Orello Cone	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, recently noticed by us -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Sept. 16 , 1893	DATE	-RRB- , is a most penetrative and able volume .

		`` The Old Church in the New Land '' is made up of pleasant and instructive lectures on the church history of
England	LOCATION	, given by a rector to his people .

		They naturally show the lively interest of the speaker and audience in the subject , and are some - what less critical and impartial than they would have been , offered as general history to indifferent or unfriendly readers .

		Churchmen frequently suffer from being closely connected with a great church whose greatness they fully appreciate .

		Like a mem - ber of a large college , or the citizen of a large city , they become confused in their standards of meas - urement .

		Our author says of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, that '' she put none to death for religious convictions ; if there were some that died for their opinions , it was not because those opinions were religious , but because they were political . ''

		The next author we have to consider , Rev.
John W. Chadwick	PERSON	, incidentally affirms that good Queen
Bess	PERSON	burned one Arian in
1583	DATE	and another in
1585	DATE	.

		Unitarianism is not a belief it is the free - dom of belief , the liberty to pursue truth in one 's own way through all its wide field .

		It is natural that such a faith should call out bold , earnest spirits , and that they should feel much confidence and en - thusiasm in their intellectual attitude .

		They inhale mountain air , and can not but exult in its tonic force .

		When they are able to unite to this temper , tender - ness and a wide sympathy with the wants of men , they become very lovable .

		Few among them sur - pass , in these best characteristics of their kind , Mr.
John W. Chadwick	PERSON	.

		His latest volume is a history of Unitarians , broken into parts and shaped to the definite purpose of impressing anew upon his audi - ence some pregnant principle , imparting a large outlook .

		One who has sought for truth diligently and found it with difficulty may well have an en - thusiasm of presentation quite his own .

		The first discourse and the last discourse are more general , but the intermediate ones take up particular sub - jects '' The Doctrine of Man , '' '' Concerning God , '' '' The Future Life , '' and consider them first in their historical development , and then press them home as the victories of spiritual life .

		The whole soul of the author is in this gathering in of sheaves .

		Take the passage under The Bible : '' And still , though much is taken , much abides for those who are capable of serious study : a splendid pro- sess of religious evolution sweeping through a thousand years of busy , checkered time .

		Never at any time be - fore was the study of the Bible so rich and so reward - ing as it is now , and never before was it pursued among us with such enthusiasm and such large results '' -LRB- page 107 -RRB- .

		Or this passage , under '' The Doctrine of Man '' : '' For I hold that nothing is more sure than this : that underlying and overtopping every other necessity of our industrial organization is the necessity , on the part of the employer , of seeing in every workman at his forges or his looms , in his quarries or his mines , not merely so much ' labor , ' and not merely an industrial machine , but a fellow-creature , a human being , a conscious soul , a brother man whom he must not treat with any least indignity or disrespect '' -LRB- page 43 -RRB- .

		The two remaining volumes are practical .

		The first , '' Religious Progress , '' is a comprehensive , penetrative , and admirable estimate of Christian de - velopment , and men 's part in it , as made up of con - flicting yet compensatory forces .

		The synthesis of high character and of spiritual growth is not pri - marily a logical one , but a coalescing of many forces in a wide upward movement .

		We press for - ward by some hidden insight ; we harken backward to things we were ready to lose ; we close up the ranks and once more renew the march . ''

		It is a lesson we are slow to learn , that opposites are closely , even vitally related ; that hostile attitudes which seem irreconcilable may both be true .

		Our own experience or the experience of history may reveal to us the ease , the naturalness of the transition from one extreme to another '' -LRB- page 9 -RRB- .

		`` But , at least , the lessons of history , the experience of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, our own individual experience as well ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 215 may teach us , and comfort us by teaching , that oppos - ing aspects of truth do not neutralize or destroy each other .

		The reformers who speak so confidently about this or that phase of ecclesiastical thought or practice as destined soon to disappear , may be , and probably in most cases are , too sanguine '' -LRB- page 112 -RRB- . ''

		When we discern the true value of our differences , while we shall hold them more firmly , we shall also more easily subordinate them to the higher virtue of Christian charity '' -LRB- page 137 -RRB- .

		The last work on our list is made up of Sermons by
Canon Liddon	ORGANIZATION	, touching chiefly clerical service .

		An ardent , consecrated temper comes forth in this volume .

		We feel that we are in contact with one whose soul is pushing forth toward life , the life of us all .

		One may easily feel , when reading the words of Unitarians , these men are too belligerent , too con - stantly stripped to the waist , too intensely and un - brokenly intellectual ; that the soul does not live by bread alone .

		Many flawed and broken walls are overturned , but what of the vines that clung to them ?

		One wishes the fellowship of devout serv - ants of truth , to sit , for a little , where faith and life unfold themselves quietly under unseen forces , and raise no questions of doubt .

		Such a desire the words of
Robertson	PERSON	and of Liddon meet and satisfy .

		Listening to them , we care not particularly whether the strength of the underlying thought is absolute or not .

		Few cables are so strong that they can not be strained , and some fibre snapped ; but we swing by them in safety all the same .

Opere di Dante Alighieri Nuovamente Rivedute nel Testo	ORGANIZATION	da -LSB- why not dal ? -RSB-

		Dr.
E. Moore	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- such is the title of a volume just issued from the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The whole works of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, Italian and Latin , within a single pair of covers if the thing has ever been done be - fore , it has escaped our notice ; certainly it has never been done , as now , in '' un volume portatile , e quasi tascabile . ''

		And since it was left to be done by an Englishman , the unanimous suffrage of students will agree that Dr.
Moore	PERSON	wa!S facile princeps among those competent to do it .

		The book , in which not a word of English occurs , contains three things : an Introduction by the editor , the Works , and an Index of proper names and cose notabill by Mr.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	.

		There are 490 double-columned pages of fifty-one lines each , something less than half the matter in the '' Globe ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The type is small but readable , being somewhat larger faced as well as leaded .

		Dr.
Moore	PERSON	has been catholic in his inclusions , and gives us everything that any student of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is likely to expect , even the `` Quaestio de Aqua et Terra , '' '' I
Sette Salmi Penetenziali	PERSON	, '' and the '' Prof essione di Fede , '' robaccia though the lat - ter be .

		Only the `` Letter '' to Guido da Polenta is missing ; and this , as the editor says , '' no one would hesitate to condemn in
Scartazzini	LOCATION	's energetic terms as sciocca impostura . ''

		Dr.
Moore	PERSON	expresses his atti - tude towards criticism of the canon , when he says that '' the negative dogmatism of recent critics is no less to be condemned than the too easy credulity of the ancients . ''

		In which opinion we , having in mind , among other things ,
Herr Scartazzini	PERSON	's re - jection of the Letter ; < Amico Florentine , '' most heartily concur .

		We might say parenthetically , that other editors would do well to adopt Dr.
Moore	PERSON	's attitude towards the canon of his author .

		Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's '' Chaucer , '' for example , would have been made far more useful had it included the text of the disputed and even of the rejected works .

		Dr.
Moore	PERSON	has taken his text from many sources .

		Witte is fol - lowed with minute variations , for the `` Vita Nuova , '' the '' De Monarchia , '' and the '' Commedia . ''

		But in the case of the latter work , the editor has felt justified in going outside the four texts followed by
Witte	PERSON	, and in introducing emendations from the various texts that have come to light since
Witte	PERSON	's publication of
1862	DATE	.

		For the minor works , the text of Fraticelli is mainly followed , supplemented by the
Grenoble Codex	LOCATION	for the '' De Vulgari Eloquio . ''

		The disposition of the '' Canzonieri '' has been en - trusted to Mr.
York Powell	PERSON	.

		The hardest work of the editor has been done with '' II Convito . ''

		He has made what may fairly be called a reconstruction of the text , although always working in a spirit of admirable conservatism , and brought into compari - son for the first time the two codices owned in En - gland , one by the editor , the other by the Bodleian .

		These codices , with readings from
Fraticelli	LOCATION	,
Giu	PERSON	- liani , and others , with the aid of
Witte	PERSON	's ''
Centuriae Correctionum	PERSON	, '' and of the '' Saggio '' of the
Milan	LOCATION	- ese editors , constitute the basis of the new text , which is no unimportant jewel in the crown of Dr.
Moore	PERSON	's scholarship .

		A word must be said of Mr.
Toynbee	PERSON	's Index , for which every student will be thankful .

		It is an index of proper names and of subjects , whether mentioned by name or merely referred to , and in the latter case , allusions merely conjectural are dis - criminated from those of which there is no doubt .

		The entries '' Papa '' and '' Papi , '' for example , '' Cristo , '' '' Dio , '' and '' Virgilio , '' bring together all ' references to those subjects throughout the works .

		This is a feature of great value , and , as there are no notes , is the only piece of apparatus supplied .

		Dr.
Moore	PERSON	's edition of Dante certainly ought to be - come the standard work for textual reference , just as the '' Globe ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has so become in its own department .

		Prof. HaeckeVs `` Monism as Connecting Religion confession of and Science '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the scientific faith .

		title of a i ecture by Professor
Ernst Haeckel	PERSON	, delivered at
Altenburg	ORGANIZATION	in
1892	DATE	, and now translated by Dr.
J. Gilchrist	PERSON	.

		This '' confession of faith of a man of science '' is a rapid sketch of the triumphs achieved by investigation and the in - ductive method during the present century , and a 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, statement of the attitude toward fundamental ques - tions of philosophy that the truly scientific thinker -LRB- according to Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	-RRB- is bound to as - sume .

		The writer is firmly convinced that this `` monistic confession '' is shared `` by at least nine - tenths of the men of science now living . ''

		In fact , the writer believes it to be shared '' by all men of science in whom the following four conditions are realized : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Sufficient acquaintance with the vari - ous departments of natural science , and in particu - lar with the modern doctrine of evolution ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- Suf - ficient acuteness and clearness of judgment to draw , by induction and deduction , the necessary logical consequences that flow from such empirical knowl - edge ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- Sufficient moral courage to maintain the monistic knowledge , so gained , against the attacks of hostile dualistic and pluralistic systems ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- Sufficient strength of mind to free himself , by sound , independent reasoning , from dominant religious prejudices , and especially from those irrational dogmas which have been firmly lodged in our minds from earliest youth as indisputable revelations . ''

		This is certainly an excellent statement of the con - ditions under which a man may claim to be in full possession of the fund of scientific knowledge pain - fully accumulated by the ages , but we fear that the author is unduly optimistic in his claim that '' nine - tenths of the men of science now living '' can meet all four conditions .

		As for the monistic system so frankly set forth in Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	's essay , it is undoubtedly a fair statement of that view of the universe as an object upon which all the sciences seem to converge .

		But besides this '' Welt als
Vorstel	PERSON	- lung '' there is the world in its inner subjective as - pect
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's '' Welt als Wille '' and
Kant	PERSON	's '' Ding an Sich '' ; and of this world , or even of the possibility of its existence , Professor
Haeckel	PERSON	's es - say gives no intimation .

		To him , the world of mat - ter , the world of differentiated ether and energy , is the one real thing ; that this world is conditioned by the subject , and inconceivable apart from the subject , is a view that seems to be unintelligible to our ma - terialistic monist , although it is the view of every deep thinker whose name has left an impress upon the history of philosophy .

		With the exception of a flying visit made in
1874	DATE	by
H. M. S. Challenger	PERSON	, the Antarctic regions have been neg - lected by scientists since
Ross	PERSON	's expedition in
1839	DATE	-
1843	DATE	.

		An incident of commerce led , in the
autumn of 1892	DATE	, to a slight renewal of scientific interest .

		A fleet of four whalers was sent out from
Dundee	ORGANIZATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, to search the Antarctic seas for Bowhead whales which may be termed , for the benefit of the ignorant , '' whalebone whales , '' with '' golden heads '' in every sense , for these whales are worth three thousand pounds apiece , thanks to
Dame Fashion	ORGANIZATION	.

		They did not see one Bowhead though they were in the ice over two months nor any other whales of any value , or worth catching ; and the expedition cost twenty-eight thousand pounds .

		Antarctic seas .

		They found and captured plenty of seals , which were not , however , fur-seals ; and the killing of them proved tedious , exhausting , dirty , bloody , and brutal work .

		Important scientific results or data appear to have been as lacking as the Bowheads .

		The story of the trip has been told and illustrated by the artist of the expedition , Mr.
W. G. Burn Murdoch	PERSON	, in a work entitled '' From
Edinburgh	LOCATION	to the Antarctic '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		It is amusing through its descriptions of sailor 's life , though it is not wholly novel in narration .

		Much adscititious `` padding '' in the shape of well-worn sailors ' yarns exceed - ingly ancient junk of the merchant-service is pre - served in the amber of the pages .

		And much gen - eral flippancy of diction detracts from the serious - ness of description and impression ; but the author begs for some change , as it is `` so tedious always writing about snow and mist and bleeding seals . ''

		Perhaps he should be allowed to use
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	's phrase `` to speak disrespectfully of the Poles . ''

		The book is handsomely printed , and the illustrations are spirited though , from the confined scope of boats and ice , somewhat monotonous .

		The work closes with an appeal for a national scientific expedition to the Antarctic regions , `` to show that the
Britain	LOCATION	of to-day is not behind the
Britain	LOCATION	of our fathers . ''

Messrs. John Murphy & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Balti	LOCATION	- more .

		The author is a native of
Guadeloupe	LOCATION	, and combines an intimate knowledge of the language of the negro as he heard it in infancy and childhood , with a scientific training in phonetics and general linguistics .

		Of chief interest to the general reader are the appended specimens of fables , rhymes , pro- verbs , and enigmas , which constitute most of the material for the investigation .

		We meet the charac - ters of '' Br ` er Rabbit '' and '' Br ` er Fox , '' so familiar in the folk-lore of the negroes in the
Southern States	LOCATION	, in
Compere Lapin	PERSON	and
Compere Zamba	PERSON	of the
Guadeloupe	LOCATION	fable ; and the story of '' The Tar Baby '' appears essentially as it iS given in `` Uncle Remus . ''

		The proverbs and enigmas are charming in their na'ivete , and some of them have almost a poetic quality , as , '' The white man 's eyes burn into those of the negro , '' or '' There is one who burns his heart for the pleasure of the company : Answer , a can - dle . ''

		The treatment of sounds and inflections is ex - haustive , and is full of interest and instruction to the student of language .

		The author shows con - clusively that the language of the negro slave of
Guadeloupe	LOCATION	is unmixed French -LRB- which is not true of any of the other `` Creole '' dialects -RRB- , being an adaptation of the speech of his master to his own primitive needs and capacity ; and he has succeeded in explaining many disguised words and phrases

		Travels in the
Sandwich Islands	LOCATION	.

		Open disdain of travels and travellers has often been held to be character - istic of the English people .

		It cer - tainly has been of more than one great literary man .

		Quoth the great Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, pointing contemptu - ously to three volumes of Voyages to the
South Sea	LOCATION	, '' Who will read them ?

		there can be little enter - tainment in them ; one set of savages is just like another . ''

		Yet the book of Mrs.
Isabella Bird Bishop	PERSON	on '' Six Months in the Sandwich Islands '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- has been through five editions in
England	LOCATION	before its present reprint in
America	LOCATION	.

		It was writ - ten over twenty years ago ; and thus is not old enough to have acquired any of the dignity of an - cient history , nor is it new enough to have any fresh - ness .

		It is in the form of letters written to a sis - ter ; and had its four hundred and twenty pages been shortened by judicious '' editing '' it would have been more interesting .

		The really important chap - ters are those that relate to the visits to , explora - tions around , and inquiries about the volcanoes .

		These wonders she explored most thoroughly and intelligently , and gives her reports of them in clear and vivid sentences .

		Her accounts of sociological and ethnological details are not specially valuable , because her visit was made at a time when the islanders were already much affected by civilized , religious , social , and mental training .

		Her account of the Leper settlement , for example , seems very bare , for we now know so much more of its effects and results .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's dictum that '' one set of savages is just like another '' seems true ; for the customs of the Hawaiian savages recounted in this book bear a strong resemblance to those related by
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, at the same date , of the island of Ta - hiti ; but the transcendent glamour of the beautiful French romance is wholly lacking in these prosaic letters .

		Mr.
Herbert P. Home	PERSON	has produced , in `` The Binding of Books '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons -RRB- , what is doubtless the most comprehensive and valuable essay on the dec - orative features of bookbinding that has appeared in English .

		The subject is one of continually grow - ing interest , and there have been many valuable contributions to its literature since
Miss Prideaux	LOCATION	compiled her bibliography .

		Mr.
Home	PERSON	's work is quite technical in character as is to be inferred from its sub-title , '' An Essay in the History of Gold - Tooled Bindings . ''

		It deals familiarly with such mysteries of the craft as '' making up and sewing , '' `` backing and rounding , '' `` beating , '' `` lacing , '' '' heading - banding , '' '' covering , '' etc. , which are treated with considerable detail in the opening chapter .

		Other chapters are devoted to early Italian bindings , French bindings , and English bindings .

		Decorative bookbinding .

		Mr.
Home	PERSON	believes , with many others , that since the death of Le
Gascon	PERSON	, somewhat grandiloquently styled '' the Evening Star of bookbinding in
France	LOCATION	, '' little progress has been made in original designing . ''

		More inspiration and less perspiration '' is urged as necessary to a revival of the art , and this we can - not hope for until book-lovers and patrons of the art are willing to employ creative artists instead of imi - tative artisans .

		Readers of Mr.
Home	PERSON	's pages will note an unpleasant peculiarity in the excessive use of commas , colons , semi-colons , etc. , making his text strongly suggestive of that pointelle style of deco - ration more appropriate on the covers .

		They will , however , pardon more than this for the interest and value of his work .

		Life of
Macready	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among those who have rendered en - during services to dramatic art and literature , the name of
Macready	ORGANIZATION	will always hold a high place .

		He had lofty ideals , not only of acting but of dramatic composition .

		He strove to elevate and increase the acting reper - tory of the English stage , and in this admirable and disinterested endeavor he enlisted the services of
Bulwer	LOCATION	,

		The story of these labors forms the most pleasing portions of Mr.
W. T. Price	PERSON	's '' Life of
William Charles Macready	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Bren	PERSON	- tano 's -RRB- .

		But while
Macready	PERSON	as a force in dra - matic art merits our praise , unfortunately
Macready	PERSON	as a man excites quite other feelings .

		The morbid - ness , the temper , and other unhappy traits of his character , can be regarded only with aversion .

		But , as his biographer justly remarks , `` Any honest life of
Macready	PERSON	must treat with equal frankness his distinct characteristics as an actor and as a man . ''

		And so by this volume once more we are forced to wonder that one personality could be compounded of elements so worthy and so petty .

		The book is not well written ; Mr.
Price	PERSON	's English constructions are so peculiar , and often so incorrect , that the reader is vexed at the poor use of good material .

		The publisher 's part , however , is well done .

		`` American Song , '' by Mr.
Arthur	PERSON	Representative B gimonds -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is further American poems .

		* , '' described on the title page as `` a collection of representative American poems , with analytical and critical studies of the writers , with introduction and notes . ''

		This title leaves little to add by way of explanation of the editor 's aim .

		The '' analytical and critical studies '' are , however , so very brief as to be of little value .

		They exhibit a tendency to take too seriously some very minor poets , and an occasional freakishness of judgment .

		The work has five sections .

		Most of these lesser singers have but a single poem each , and it is some - times surprising to note the editor 's selection .

		The facts stated are accurate , as far as we have ob - served .

		We may note that the deaths of Lucy Lar - com and

		The book has been planned both for school use and for gen - eral reading .

		A moment 's reflection makes the uses of Mrs.
Dahlgren	PERSON	's book apparent .


Washington	LOCATION	etiquette being , as the author shows , largely a thing apart and sui generis , it is plain that one may be enviably au fait of social usages generally , and still be as ignorant as a Comanche of those pecul - iar to the federal capital .

		Mrs.
Dahlgren	PERSON	sets forth the special rules of the
Washington	LOCATION	code clearly and explicitly ; and where the authorities differ as on certain nice points of official prece - dence still unsettled she debates the matter pro and con with great constitutional learning and a becoming sense of the gravity of her theme .

		To the newly-returned member and his aspiring family the little book should prove a real blessing .

		For - tified by its precepts , the novice may venture upon the troubled sea of the semi-official society of Wash - ington with a comparatively light heart .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A beautiful cover imitative of Venetian mosaic , a great number of charming illustrations , and two hun - dred and fifty pages of rather indifferent text , are the gifts brought to us by ''
Venezia	PERSON	, '' a sumptuous quarto volume imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The text , except for a brief and perfunctory introduc - tion by Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	, is '' adapted '' from the Ger - man of
Herr Henry Perl	ORGANIZATION	by Mrs.
Arthur Bell	PERSON	.

		The illustrations , more than two hundred in number , are by well-known Italian artists of the modern school , and certainly give us a most lifelike picture of the
Venice	LOCATION	and the Venetians of to-day .

		Our recent lengthy review of Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's edition of Chaucer makes superfluous any critical comment upon the one-volume edition of the text now published -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , and gracefully dedicated to the
University of Halle	ORGANIZATION	in return for the honorary degree last year con - ferred by that institution upon the editor .

		We now have , in a single compact tome , the entire text of Chaucer in 732 double-columned pages ; an introduction of 22 pages on biography , grammar , verse , and pronun - ciation ; and a `` Glossarial Index '' of 149 pages .

		All students of English poetry will be grateful for this edi - tion , which , for the first time in five centuries , offers a good text at a moderate price .

		The ground covered by Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	's popular work on '' The Sabbath in Puritan New En - gland '' is again gone over , in some respects more minutely , in others less , by Mr.
William Root Bliss	PERSON	, in his '' Side Glimpses from the
New England	LOCATION	Meeting - House '' -LRB-

		Mr.
Bliss	PERSON	dedicates his book to Mrs.

		The illustrations consist of good pictures of Messrs.

		A third volume will complete the selection , and we may incidentally remark that it will round to a full score the volumes of this admirable series .

		Professor
Herford	PERSON	, who edited the first of the
Jonson	PERSON	volumes , has withdrawn from the work , and no editor 's name now appears upon the title-page , although the brief intro - ductions to the separate plays are in the first person .

		The frontispiece is a portrait of
Richard Burbage	PERSON	.

		`` Ideals and Institutions : Their Parallel Develop - ment , '' is the title of a dissertation presented to the
University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
John Ernest Merrill	PERSON	, and now issued from the
Hartford Seminary Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author has made a careful study of Greek , Roman , and Teutonic institutions , and the essential part of his pre - liminary thesis is that the institution is the product of the antecedent national ideal , although of course he does not refuse to admit that the former may react upon the latter .

		The treatment of the subject is largely metaphysical as well as historical , and these two phases are , in fact , discussed in separate sections of the work .

		Numerous tables and charts summarize the investiga - tions made by the writer , and a list of authorities is appended .

		The essay on
Giovanni Boccaccio	PERSON	as Man and Author -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , of which the literary executors of
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	have made a thin octavo volume , is little more than a re-statement of the matter already familiar to readers of
Symonds	ORGANIZATION	's great history of the Renaissance .

		It is , in a way , interesting to have the matter all by itself , but one can not help thinking that a book devoted solely to the immortal author of '' II Decamerone '' ought to be a good deal more of a book than this one proves to be .

		The main facts are here , and the most obvious comments , but little more , and there is so much more to say !

		The '' Smithsonian Report '' for
1893	DATE	is of double the usual size , and is one of the most valuable documents lately issued from the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		The value , of course , resides in the Appendix , with its re - prints of the most important scientific papers of the year , noticeable among which is Mr.
Otis T. Mason	PERSON	's '' North American Bows , Arrows , and
Quivers	PERSON	, '' with over fifty full-page plates .

		Flying machines , Arctic exploration , biological stations , photography , meteor - ology , anthropology , and Oriental scholarship , are a few of the subjects dealt with in the remaining papers .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
March 25 , 1895	DATE	.

		The pressure of topics requiring '' mention '' has never been greater than during the present
Spring	DATE	publishing season .

		One looks , almost with dismay , on the incom - ing rush of announcements of new books , which flutter down like the doves of
San Marco	LOCATION	at the breakfast hour .

		So it behooves one to disregard them for the present , and confine one 's attention to a few subjects of insist - ant importance .

		The bill making possible the incorporation of '' The
New York	LOCATION	Public Library : Astor ,
Lenox	LOCATION	, and
Tilden Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, '' has passed our
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and
House	ORGANIZATION	, and now awaits Governor
Morton	PERSON	's signature .

		The consolidated board of trustees is to be composed of twenty-one mem - bers seven for each of the original foundations .

		The en - dowments and property interests represent , as already stated in this correspondence , about
$ 8,000,000	MONEY	.

		The interest from all the productive investments amounts to about
$ 140,000	MONEY	annually .

		Should the
Lenox Library	ORGANIZATION	building and land be sold , this would be vastly in - creased .

		And herein lies the crucial point of the whole question .

		Will the city of
New York	LOCATION	give this public library a site in a central and accessible part of the city ?

		When I say city , I include much more than Man -
hattan Island	LOCATION	and Westchester county .

		In a certain sense , all of
Long Island	LOCATION	and half of the state of
New Jersey	LOCATION	are now a part of the
Greater New York	LOCATION	.

		A few details are needed here .

		There is at the corner of Fifth avenue and Forty-second street , within one min - ute 's walk of the Grand Central Station , a stone struc - ture known as the '' receiving reservoir . ''

		It has long been useless , having been supplanted many years ago by our present aqueduct system .

		It covers a space of ground which would permit of a library containing four millions of books .

		It adjoins
Bryant Park	PERSON	, one of our city squares .

		On either side run the longitudinal ele - vated railroad systems which connect the Battery with the
North Side	ORGANIZATION	and Westchester county .

		Various street - car lines run east and west on Forty-second street , con - necting with all other tramways and with all our fer - ries .

		In fact , this place is both the physical and the geographical centre of
New York	LOCATION	.

		In any other city , this site would be inevitable for such a purpose ; but after letting this useless stone structure lie where it is for twenty years , objection is now made to giving the site for a library , on the ground that the land is needed to enlarge
Bryant Park	LOCATION	.

		The reservoir plot is now un - doubtedly the most valuable piece of land in the city .

		To purchase an equally convenient site would require an appropriation for which ten times the amount of land could be bought in the tenement districts of the city where small parks are needed .

		With the reservoir site , and with the aid of the stone of which the reservoir is built , the trustees could erect a noble building , suit - able for its purpose , and without encroaching upon their invested funds .

		This plan , of course , would involve the sale of the Lenox Library site .

		I trust that those people who are opposing this inspiring plan will think better of their action .

		While the mercantile and commercial districts of
New York	LOCATION	are extending up-town , the increasing popu - lations of
Long Island	LOCATION	and
New Jersey	LOCATION	long since made it plain that the business centre of the city must remain far below
Central Park	LOCATION	.

		The lofty buildings now go - ing up all over the lower end of
Manhattan Island	LOCATION	are an unfailing indication of this .

		The lower part of the city will thus be the centre of a population spreading in every direction except the southeast .

		Meanwhile , the publishing houses have established their own busi - ness centre along Fifth avenue and the adjacent streets , from Eighth street to Twenty-third street .

		A few still remain in the vicinity of
Astor Place	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among these latter are Messrs.
George Routledge	PERSON	's Sons ; the
Funk & Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
Henry T. Thomas	PERSON	;
E. B. Treat ; E. & J. B. Young & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;

J. J. Lit	PERSON	- tle
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	; and such periodicals as '' The Outlook , '' `` The Review of Reviews , '' `` The Literary Digest , '' `` Current Literature , '' `` Public Opinion , '' and `` The Churchman . ''

		Around the corner from these , on Broad - way , are the American Book Company and
Charles T. Dillingham	PERSON	, but the former will soon remove its quar - ters further up-town .

		Beginning with Ninth street , between Broadway and Fifth avenue , the peripatetic author in quest of a publisher may observe the sign - boards of Messrs.
Bryan	PERSON	,
Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
E. L. Kellog & Co.	ORGANIZATION	;

		Now , what an absurdity it would be , in spite of the fact that our new library is to be a popular institution , to shove it up above the lower end of
Central Park	LOCATION	, and out of reach of all these publishing houses and their myriad workers !

		220 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, UNIVERSITY LIFE AT
LEIPZIG	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-


Leipzig	LOCATION	,
March 10 , 1895	DATE	.

		The
University of Leipzig	ORGANIZATION	was founded in
1409	DATE	, by German scholars from Prag , who left that city dur - ing the Huss troubles .

		It immediately took high rank among the universities of
Europe	LOCATION	, and is to-day the third in
Germany	LOCATION	in point of numbers ,
Berlin	LOCATION	and Mu - nich standing ahead .

		Most of the revenues come from lands granted the university in its early days by one of the Electors , and from valuable property in the very heart of the city .

		The annual income is stated at about two hundred thousand dollars , which seems at first thought a small sum for the maintenance of so large an institution ; but in view of the comparatively small pay-roll , the amount assumes larger proportions .

		The uninitiated , in looking over the Verzeichness -LRB- calendar -RRB- , might wonder where the money comes from which is necessary to salary such an army of teachers .

		But the surprise ceases on learning that only the professors or - dinarius receive salaries , the professors extraordinarius and the privat-docents having only student fees for com - pensation .

		For example , under the head of Germanic Philology nine names appear , but only three are those of professors proper .

		The amount of the salary differs among the different professorships , which vary greatly in this respect , some of them being heavily endowed by private benefactors .

		The head professor of Philosophy receives from the university about
twenty-five hundred dollars	MONEY	, which amount is swelled to over four thousand by fees .

		The latter are comparatively small .

		The stu - dent pays , on entering the university , a matriculation fee of twenty marks ; and for each course he hears dur - ing his residence , four marks an hour , with a mark and a half added for the Famulus and use of a seat .

		Thus , if the course occupies five hours a week , he pays twenty - one and a half marks for the whole semester .

		The Seminars are free , with the exception of the one mark for the Famulus .

		The latter is a relic of the middle ages .

		He is always a student , presumably poor and deserving , and serves the professor as a sort of private janitor .

		He looks after the ventilation , keeps the black - board clean , posts notices , and performs other services of a similar character .

		A more dignified office of the Famulus is that of go-between for professor and student .

		The latter never addresses the former on the street or university premises .

		If the student must see the pro- fessor in person , he makes a formal call at the latter 's place of residence .

		Otherwise all inquiries are ad - dressed to the Famulus , who alone has acccess to the sacred presence .

		There is no hovering about the pro- fessor 's desk , or speaking with him in the corridors .

		On the very minute for the beginning of the lecture , the Famulus opens the door , the professor enters , as - cends the rostrum , begins ''
Meine Herren	PERSON	, '' closes at the stroke of the bell , gathers up his manuscript , and is gone amid the applause -LRB- made by the feet -RRB- of the audience .

		In the Seminars , at the arrival and de - parture of the professor , everybody stands .

		This pro- fessional sacredness is said not to exist at the younger universities , and is especially characteristic of
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		The university has but little to boast of in the way of architecture .

		The Augusteum , the seat of the
Phil	PERSON	- osophical Faculty , is in process of reconstruction .

		It will be a fine building when completed .

		In the mean - time the lectures are held in an old hospital , without comfort or convenience .

		The seats are the rudest benches in the style of those used in the country school - houses of long ago .

		Perhaps the oldest of the univer - sity buildings is the
Church of St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, originally be - longing to the monastery of like name , which was ab - sorbed by the university in its early days .

		In this plain old church the university preacher holds service every
Sunday	DATE
morning	TIME	.

		Not long ago it was the scene of the funeral of the late Professor
Hildebrand	PERSON	, on which oc - casion the long procession of Verein students , with gay colored caps , high boots , swords , and banners , contrasted strangely with the somber edifice and solemn ceremony .

		The student does not play so important a role in
Leip	PERSON	- zig as in the smaller university towns .

		Still , he is very much in evidence on the streets , where he is inclined to occupy more space than rightfully belongs to him .

		The majority of the students are members of some Verein , but only a comparatively small number wear colors .

		The object of most of these societies is serious , although the convivial element is not neglected .

		The corps stu - dent with slashed face is not prominent .

		The daily life of the German student is not attractive .

		He rents a room , usually of humble people , who furnish him his morning coffee ; his dinner he eats at some res - taurant ; buys his supper , of rye bread and sausage , on the way home from his late lecture or afternoon 's loung - ing , and eats it alone , without the encumbrance of knife , fork , and plate .

		Unless he has friends in the city , or brings with him letters of introduction , he has no so - ciety outside of his fellow-students .

		But this satisfies him , and he is never at a loss for entertainment .

		If all else fail , the Kneipe is always open , and ready to furnish its peculiar solace .

		The average student does not ex - pect to work much during the first semester , and often the Bummelzeit lasts longer .

		Unless he belongs to the fast set , he attends lectures with a fair amount of reg - ularity , and keeps up his notes , but that is all .

		While this sounds to his disadvantage , it really has some ex - cuse .

		After the long grind in the gymnasium , the young German is entitled to some lightening of labor .

		He finds plenty of opportunity to dig before his university career is over .

		There are scholarships and funds for poor students ; also the Convict , an eating-house where free dinners are furnished to those holding tickets .

		Our American system of self-help is unknown .

		To perform any kind of manual labor would be a disgrace .

		The relation between student and professor is a dis - tant one .

		The two seldom come together , except on formal occasions .

		The professor has perhaps a slight acquaintance with all the members of his Seminar , and may entertain them occasionally at his home .

		There are a few grand social functions during each semester , to which those students with social introductions are invited .

		Among them are the Professorium , a faculty reception and ball , when the young men have the op - portunity of meeting the professors ' wives and dancing with their daughters .

		Following the example of his predecessor , the learned
King John	PERSON	, the present King visits the university once a year in the capacity of Rector Magnificissimus .

		He at - tends a few lectures , especially those of newly appointed professors , and inspects any changes or improvements made during the year .

		Naturally these are important occasions for both student and professor .

		Not long ago the writer assisted at one of these visits .

		His Majesty in uniform , accompanied by her Majesty , attended by a numerous suite , and escorted by the Rector
Magnificus	PERSON	wearing his chain of office , was made comfortable in an arm-chair before the reading-desk .

		The
Herr Professor 1895	ORGANIZATION	.

		J THE DIAL 221 appeared in a dress suit and white gloves , and the Fam - ulus in a long-tailed coat of black broadcloth .

		The lec - ture proceeded as usual and was closed by a rousing
Hoch	PERSON	to their Majesties .

		To the above some facts may be added concerning the status of women at
the University of Leipzig	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their attendance has always been in theory forbidden ; but professors fell into the practice of failing to discover their presence in the lecture halls .

		Three years ago , eleven women were thus pursuing studies , expecting to secure degrees from less conservative institutions for work which was actually done at
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		This group included
American	ORGANIZATION	, English , and Russian women , and one daughter of the
Fatherland	LOCATION	, Friiulein Kathe Wind - schied , who secured the doctor 's degree a year ago at
the University of Heidelberg	ORGANIZATION	.

		Recently , conservatism has increased .

		Young women who were seeking only a veneer of foreign culture had begun to swell the num - ber in attendance at lectures .

		Professors took their patronage of the more attractive courses for light treat - ment of serious things .

		Some of them have therefore excluded all representatives of the sex even from the rule of unseen listeners .

		At present four women , two from the
United States	LOCATION	, one from
England	LOCATION	, and one from
Germany	LOCATION	, are attending courses of lectures which they have chosen with the purpose of taking degrees at other universities .

		An eminent professor told one of these that if she entered his lecture room he would not see her .

		As for the higher education of women , he did not disapprove of it under all circumstances ; but in
Germany	LOCATION	the professions were already crowded and offered them no place for a career .

		Therefore , to prepare for professional life would only increase their discontent .

		We are glad to note the performances of old English plays that are among the many indications of the good work now being done by the English departments of our colleges .

		A few days ago ,
Jonson	PERSON	's '' Silent Woman '' was given by
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	students ; while
May	DATE	will wit - ness a performance of `` Ralph Roister Doister '' at

		Without any ambitious attempt to emulate Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's achievement in `` Marcella , '' `` Tran - sition , '' a forthcoming novel by the author of '' A Su - perfluous Woman , '' is said to have been written with the express purpose of giving a truer account of the workings of a socialist mind , and the methods adopted in particular by the scientific socialists of the day , than Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	was in a position to do .

		The new
Societa Dantesca d'ltalia	ORGANIZATION	has planned a col - lation of about 400 selected passages of the '' Divina Commedia '' in all the manuscripts known to exist , some 600 in number .

		The results are to be sent to a central committee , which is to sift and discuss and tabulate them , so as to establish families or types of text -LRB- if possible -RRB- , and then select the

		of highest authority to serve as the foundation of a great critical edition .

		The exhibition of line book-bindings held at the Art Institute in
Chicago	LOCATION	, under the auspices of the
Caxton Club	ORGANIZATION	, during the past month , proved a gratifying suc - cess .

		No such collection of books , so interesting and valuable aside from their artistic features , has ever been brought together in
Chicago	LOCATION	before , and it is doubtful if any other American city outside of
New York	LOCATION	could produce a similar exhibit , rich alike in associations and as specimens of the book-binder 's art . ''

		That , in the

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	also discusses the sub - ject , contributing this note : `` Speaking loosely , and subject to correction , I think that colloquial vulgarisms of a peculiar type began to appear in American litera - ture after I860 .

		If
America	LOCATION	possessed an Academy it would probably have set its face against them . ''

		The trustees of the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	have recently taken a number of important steps towards the organi - zation of their work .

		In the resolution to live upon their income , and not to impair their capital even for the purpose of providing a building , they have carried out the suggestion recently made by us , as also in their early selection of a librarian .

		Mr.
C. W. Andrews	PERSON	, of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	, who has just been chosen for their executive head , is admirably qualified for the post offered him .

		It is also gratify - ing to learn that the choice of a librarian was deter - mined by no personal or local considerations , but by taking the best expert advice to be had .

		Of the reso - lution to make the library a collection of scientific lit - erature , we can only say that it does not seem to us the wisest of possible decisions , however great may be the usefulness of a scientific library , and however liberal the construction of the term .

		The claim of the human - ities is , on the whole , greater than the claim of science , particularly at a time when science gets so much more than its due share of the good things of life .

		But the decision is , we understand , irrevocably taken , and it is better than some plans that were reported to be under consideration .

		250 EDUCATIONAL VALUES .

		The subject of educational values is by no means a new one , and the pedagogical litera - ture of all ages offers contributions to its dis - cussion .

		Yet in a certain sense this subject , implied as it is in all educational theory , has just now become a topic of the day , and is in a fair way to receive much new illustration and illumination .

		We may safely predict that for some years to come it will get unusual atten - tion at the hands of educators , and bear an em - phasis hitherto withheld yet preeminently de - served .

		Among the causes which just now are directing educational thought into this channel , two or three of the most important may be spe - cified .

		In the first place , the new psychology by which we mean the new impetus given to the pursuit of that science rather than any of the new methods or results so noisily heralded is being brought into more intimate relations than ever before with the art pedagogic .

		We are learning that knowledge of the human mind must underlie all good teaching , and that the faculties may be effectively played upon only by those who are familiar with their workings .

		Then we are on the eve of a reaction in favor of the humanities .

		The husks of science , even allowing for the solid kernel within , are found less satisfactory as a diet than they seemed a few years ago , and hungry souls in revolt against a regimen are everywhere calling for more generous and vitalizing forms of nutri - ment .

		This state of things naturally reopens the whole question of the relative values of sci - ence and literature , and the spokesmen of the former subject are discovering , somewhat to their surprise , that the champions of the latter are still undaunted .

		In fact , the contest be - tween the advocates of the narrowly practical and those who stand for the broader and more liberal type of education is being renewed all along the line , and philistinism trembles in the strongholds it once thought so secure .

		The very fact that educational values are being everywhere earnestly discussed is itself of the highest significance .

		The bread-and - butter policy of the '' practical '' people has al - ways scoffed at the notion that it was worth while to consider what education could do for 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, the man himself , and has contented itself with asking what kind of a living it could give him . ''

		Man shall not live by bread alone '' was a text to which that policy never attached a se - rious meaning .

		But educational discussion could not , in the very nature of things , and even with so '' practical '' a people as ours , long remain upon so essentially irrational a plane .

		To accomplish results of a higher sort than those which are embodied in worldly success , the centre of attention must be the child himself rather than his material environment ; and the shifting of emphasis which corresponds to this more enlightened view is precisely the most hopeful feature of the phase of educational ac - tivity upon which we have now fairly entered .

		These conclusions as to the new trend of thought upon a subject of so great concern are substantiated by the discussion of the Corre - lation of Studies in
Elementary Education	ORGANIZATION	which is the chief feature of the Report of the
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sub-committee upon this subject was made up of five educa - tors of wide reputation , headed by Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	.

		Their conclusions , as now presented , were not in all respects unanimously reached ; and to the main discussion , prepared by the chairman of the sub-committee , there are ap - pended as many dissenting opinions as there were other members .

		But these minority re - ports , taken all together , do not weaken more than ten per cent of the conclusions embraced in the very able document prepared by Dr.
Harris	PERSON	, and represent no greater a divergence than was natural in view of the ground cov - ered and the complexity of the subject .

		We consider the document just referred to one of the most important contributions that have been made to recent discussion , and one that is sure to exert a wide and helpful influ - ence .

		Its defects are those of its qualities , or rather of those qualities developed in its au - thor 's mind by the metaphysical training which has shaped his thought .

		The discussion is highly abstract , and at times a fictitious im - portance is given to commonplace ideas by their mere verbal garb .

		We hardly need to be told with so much ceremony , for example , that lan - guage is a valuable subject of study because '' it enables each person to communicate his in - dividual experience to his fellows , and thus per - mits each to profit by the experience of all . ''

		Again , we may pardon , in view of the excellence of the principle , the form of the idea thus ex - pressed : '' Only familiarity with fine English works will insure one a good and correct style . ''

		And we are , on the whole , rather grateful to Dr.
Harris	PERSON	for his unexpectedly sparing use of that blessed word `` apperception , '' and the other catch-words of metaphysical pedagogics .

		After a few preliminary remarks upon the condition of elementary studies , the report promptly reaches the question of educational val - ues , taking up successively the subjects of Lan - guage Studies , Arithmetic , Geography , His - tory , and Other Branches .

		Language is placed first , because it '' rightfully forms the centre of instruction in the elementary school . ''

		The importance is emphasized of much reading of good pieces of literature , but we regret to see the '' reader '' spoken of so respectfully , and we more than doubt that '' in almost all series of readers used in our elementary schools ... the selections are literary works of art . ''

		The question of the relative values of the sesthetical and ethical elements in works of literary art is finely set forth in the following passage : '' The ethical should , however , be kept in subordina - tion to the sesthetical , but for the sake of the supreme interests of the ethical itself .

		Otherwise the study of a work of art degenerates into a goody-goody perform - ance , and its effects on the child are to cause a reaction against the moral .

		The child protects his inner indi - viduality against effacement through external authority by taking an attitude of rebellion against stories with an appended moral .

		Herein the superiority of the ses - thetical in literary art is to be seen .

		For the ethical motive is concealed by the poet , and the hero is painted with all his brittle individualism and self-seeking .

		His passions and his selfishness , gilded by fine traits of bravery and noble manners , interest the youth , interest us all .

		The established social and moral order seems to the ambitious hero to be an obstacle to the unfolding of the charms of individuality .

		The deed of violence gets done , and the Nemesis is aroused .

		Now his deed comes back on the individual doer , and our sympathy turns against him and we rejoice in his
fall	DATE	.

		Thus the sesthetical unity contains within it the ethical unity .

		The lesson of the great poet or novelist is taken to heart , whereas the ethical announcement by itself might have failed , especially with the most self-active and aspiring of the pupils . ''

		This is all admirable , but the writer was not well-advised in bringing
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's famous pas - sage about tragedy to his support .

		The
Kaihar	PERSON	- sisfrage has developed many varieties of opin - ion , and this is one of the least justifiable .

		We have space for but few words upon the remaining sections of this discussion .

		An abridgment of arithmetic is recommended , with substitution of elementary algebra .

		Many pu - pils , it is justly said , are now kept back from the secondary stage of education '' on the plea of lack of preparation in arithmetic , the real difficulty in many cases being a lack of ability to solve algebraic problems by an inferior

		THE DIAL 231 method . ''

		What is called '' sailor geography '' is unsparingly condemned .

		History `` should be the special branch for education in the du - ties of citizenship . ''

		A '' spiral course '' in natural science should run from bottom to top of the curriculum .

		Formal English grammar should give way , in part , to a year or more of elementary Latin .

		The best thing that can pos - sibly be said about moral training is tersely put in these words : '' The substantial moral training of the school is per - formed by the discipline rather than by the instruction in ethical theory .

		The child is trained to be regular and punctual , and to restrain his desire to talk and whis - per in these things gaining self-control day by day .

		The essence of moral behavior is self-control .

		The school teaches good behavior .

		The intercourse of a pupil with his fellows without evil words or violent ac - tions is insisted on and secured .

		The higher moral qual - ities of truth-telling and sincerity are taught in every class exercise that lays stress on accuracy of state - ment . ''

		The question of educational values exists , of course , along the whole line of educational work .

		But the controlling principles that must underlie its intelligent discussion are amply illustrated in the field of the elementary studies .

		That field , however , is no longer as sharply marked off as formerly from the outlying fields of secondary and collegiate work .

		The paper that we have just had under discussion exem - plifies the growing tendency to remove the tra - ditional metes and bounds that have hitherto defined the three stages of education .

		It oppor - tunely happens that an extension of the dis - cussion upon the plane of the higher stages is provided by the
April	DATE	number of the '' Educa - tional Review , '' almost the entire contents of which are devoted to a series of papers , by com - petent writers , upon the special educational values of the subjects with which the higher in - struction is mainly concerned .

		These papers are of much interest , and , taken together with the Report of the
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	, afford a convenient starting-point for the further dis - cussion that is sure to be given to a subject so auspiciously broached and of so great an in - trinsic importance .

		THE fourth
summer	DATE	session of the
School of Applied Ethics	ORGANIZATION	will be held at
Plymouth	LOCATION	this year as before , be - ginning
July 8	DATE	, and continuing for five weeks .

		There will be the usual three departments of ethics , economics , and the history of religions , and a new department de - voted to education .

		The latter department will be con - fined to the last two of the five weeks , so as not to conflict with the
Denver	LOCATION	meeting of the
National Edu	ORGANIZATION	- cational Association .

		THE ALLOTROPY OF REALISM .

		No bandying of epithets will ever obliterate either of the `` two eternal types of fiction . ''

		Whenever the realist or '' veritist '' fetches the other fellow a clip , like a Siamese twin he knocks himself down ; for romanticism , no less than realism , has a rational ground in human nature .

		Neither will ever have had its day or be outgrown .

		Whether the English romance dates back to De Foe 's ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' or to
Nash	PERSON	's ''
Jack Wilton	PERSON	, '' and whether English '' realism '' began with
Richardson	PERSON	and Fielding , or with Sir
Roger De Coveiiey	PERSON	, or -LRB- as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	would have it -RRB- with
Jane Austen	PERSON	, the fact remains that realism is as old as Homer and Job , and that '' Romance '' held its own , in
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, with the poetry of the creation .

		Yet a decade ago , in this country , romanticists dismissed realism with disparaging gibes .

		And ever and anon realistic writers are heard berating romanticism , and actually predicting its downfall .

		`` Except in the case of children , '' said a writer in the '' Westminster Review , '' not long since , '' fanciful narrative , whether founded on history or not , is repugnant to the spirit of the age .

		We want facts , not romantic dreams . ''

		One would suppose that the successes of Messrs.
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Kipling	LOCATION	, Quiller-Couch ,
Doyle	PERSON	,
Caine	PERSON	,
Weyman	PERSON	,
Hawkins	PERSON	, and
Crawford	PERSON	would preclude the possi - bility of so one-sided a statement of what `` we want , '' aside from the eternal principle of the thing .

		In a partisan opposition to romance there is no necessity either of underestimating its present vogue or of villifying it .

		When Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	calls the ro - manticists `` mere purveyors of entertainment , '' he is too plainly trifling : who was it said that pleasure , not edification , is the end of all art ?

		But when he gathers up his skirts and with a procul-este - profani air exclains , '' I have never suspended my heroines over the brinks of yawning chasms ; nor have I introduced monkeys falling in love with men or men with monkeys ; nor am I equal to the de - picting of the perennial charms of women two thou - sand years old , '' we can only reply that this is really too bad .

		No wonder the professor finds romance '' a great dead world , whose puppets are galvanized into a semblance of life by the art of the author . ''

		With
Senor Vald	ORGANIZATION	^ s , he would assert , apparently , that novelists '' begin by deliberately falsifying human feelings . ''

		All of which may have been , in the childhood of the race ; and still may survive , in the '' romance , '' say , of the Fijians , who , Mr.
Basil Thomson	PERSON	informs us , '' will tell of doings so strange that the jaws of the listeners fall apart . ''

		The energy consumed in the demolition of straw men , or in trying to prove that the days of realism or of romanticism are ended , might better be spent in the foredoomed attempt to determine who are realists and who are romanticists .

		A good many people would like to know , and withhold their al - legiance till the '' doubtful states '' shall be officially classed with one or the other '' party . ''

		At present , 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, things are in an awful muss .

		Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	, defining romance broadly as the '' novel of plot , romance , in - cident , adventure , '' slyly includes in his camp all the uncertain ones Fielding ,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	, Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	, Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	. ''

		No really great realistic novel has yet appeared in the English language '' !

		Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	opens his '' pantheon '' of realists for
Thackeray	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	, Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, and Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	excludes from his ,
Thack	PERSON	- eray , whom he dubs as most do Dickens a '' car - icaturist . ''

		Balzac '' at his best , '' according to Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, is a realist ; though he wrote , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	claims , '' in the spirit of romance and fantasy , '' and was considered an idealist by
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	in spite of the popular impression .

		Whether Mr.
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	is a realist or romanticist has not definitely been decided , even in
France	LOCATION	; though he '' drew from life '' and was avowedly the `` literary histori - ographer '' of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even Zola , ac - cording to one , excels `` by his epic qualities , '' and to another is '' colossally fantastic , '' not to say ro - mantic .

		At this point one is inclined to look well to his literary armor and make sure of the few re - maining screws .

		There are Le Sage ,
Scott	PERSON	,
Dumas	PERSON	pere , Hugo ; and there are Cervantes ,
Flaubert , Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	, Tourgue ` neff ,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	,
Zola	LOCATION	,
Howells	LOCATION	, and
Miss Wilkins	PERSON	.

		Discouraging indeed to the mere student of text - books , this apparent confusion of terms seems to indicate that the word `` realism '' -LRB- whether or not with the approval of its chief promoters -RRB- is obtain - ing a wider and deeper meaning .

		Ten years ago , it meant that '' a novel should have neither plot , nor beginning nor end . ''

		The realistic novel was then '' the novel of the bare fact , '' photographic , rather than a portraiture , in the delineation of char - acter .

		This now should go , perhaps , by the name of naturalism .

		For realism is gaining a wider sig - nificance : `` A realist , '' Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	well says , '' is a writer who adheres strictly to the logic of reality ... who , to use
Henry James	PERSON	's felicitous phrase , arouses not the pleasure of surprise , but that of recognition . ''

		For a lively , blinding statement of all the ele - ments of the problem , Mr.
H. C. Bunner	PERSON	is respon - sible : '' If I can write a story which will make you believe , while you are reading it , that when my hero was strolling down Fifth Avenue to attend a meeting of the
Young Men 's Kindergarten Club	ORGANIZATION	, he met a green dragon forty-seven feet long , with eighteen legs and three tails , and that the green dragon wept bitterly , and inquired the way to a cheese-shop , why , that 's realism . ''

		We suspect that if terms were clearly defined , all argument would , as in matters political and religi - ous , be either needless or useless .

		But that can never be .

		At any rate , never could all agree as to the true scope of the imagination .

		Already some , with psychological perversity , assume that realism is the special product and prerogative of the observa - tion and the memory , and flourishes consequently only in eras when men are deficient in imaginative grasp ; whereas idealism , so far from penetrating and illumining ordinary daily events , deals only with dazzling incidents and complicated plots .

		This , to one -LRB- whether writer or reader -RRB- who for the mo - ment notes his mental and visual processes , is man - ifestly absurd .

		A little bird 's nest by
William Hunt	PERSON	is an idealistic creation as truly as some picture of a battle , a coronation , or a martyrdom .


Peter Bell	PERSON	inanely dallying with his '' yellow primrose '' is a hideous burlesque , not a type , of the true realist .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's remark , '' When you have seen one green field , you have seen all , '' can be accounted for only on a theory of mental deficiency .

		Imagi - nation , which has been variously defined as reason out for a holiday , or perception in a hurry , or mem - ory gone wild , or the dalliance of desire , whatever it be , is '' the fountain light of all our day , a master light of all our seeing , '' and lends itself willingly , if mysteriously , to depict - '' The green and scarlet of the Park , The undulating streets at dark , The brown smoke blown across the blue , This crowded city we walk through , The pallid faces full of pain , The field-smell of the passing wain , The laughter , longing , perfume , strife , The daily spectacle of life . ''

		Surely if , as Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	asserts , '' the aspirations , dreams , devotions , and sacrifices of men , are as real as their response to self-interest or their tendency to the conventional and the commonplace , '' the con - verse is equally true , that the objective play of per - ception and the selective observation involved in realism are as truly concerned with the imagina - tion as is the veriest romance .

		Coleridge 's advice to poets is not without weight to the realist . ''

		A poet , '' he said , '' ought not to pick nature 's pocket .

		.

		.

		Trust more to your imagination than to your memory . ''

		Which does not mean , in the language of
Sheridan	PERSON	, that he should '' draw on his imagina - tion for his facts . ''

		Whenever Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	shall give to the world his Life of Christ , to be written not from '' the point of fact , '' but from '' the point of imaginative insight , '' it will have a flourishing existence , as
Kenan	PERSON	's did before it .

		Paradoxical as it may sound , it is the idealist who can most ade - quately cope with the real .

		A sketch of a few hasty lines by a true artist is more faithful than any photograph .

		Not literal truth , but '' ideal truth , '' is still the end of literature .

		THE AMERICAN AUTHORS ' GUILD .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB- ''

		Every man a debtor to his profession '' is the motto of the
American Authors ' Guild	ORGANIZATION	, which was organized in the City of
New York	LOCATION	in
May , 1892	DATE	, by upwards of one hundred professional writers .

		Its immediate ob -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 jects are , in the first place , to advise and inform inex - perienced members in regard to royalties , copyright , cost of production , etc. ; to secure fair bargains between au - thor and publisher ; to advocate and procure better laws affecting literary property ; and , lastly , to promote such feelings of professional comradeship as have been fos - tered by similar societies in other callings .

		During the three years of its existence the
Guild	ORGANIZATION	has made rapid progress in efficiency , and it exerts an influ - ence beyond its numerical strength .

		It has nearly trebled its membership ; it has no liabilities , and has a thousand dollars in its treasury .

		It has successfully mediated in all cases brought before it by members where disagreements had arisen with publishers , thereby averting ill-feeling and expensive legal measures .

		It has also , on behalf of its members , brought several pub - lishers to a just accounting .

		It intends to provide an auditor free of charge for members wishing to have their accounts with their publishers examined .

		It will also have at its service several attorneys skilled in copy - right law , to give free legal advice to members ; and in cases where it may be necessary to go into court , to defend their claims for moderate fees .

		The Guild also purposes to establish in the near future a widows ' and orphans ' fund for the benefit of families of members left without means .

		To do all this it needs the active cooperation of the numerous literary workers who are not yet in its ranks .

		These should not be content to let the few fight their battles for them .

		Both honor and professional inter - est suggest that all writers , whether literary , scien - tific , or journalistic , should aid in the common cause .

		The dues are but
three dollars	MONEY	a year , and by rigid economy -LRB- the officers giving their services without compensation -RRB- these dues have proved more than suf - ficient for immediate necessities .

		With a limited mem - bership the yearly income is small .

		Hence the useful - ness of the
Guild	ORGANIZATION	is restricted .

		Only with a large mem - bership , such as is possessed by the English and French societies of a like character , can the Giiild advance its interests .

		We therefore suggest to professional writers the importance , both to themselves and to us , of affiliat - ing with the
Guild	ORGANIZATION	.

		If any of these consider themselves independent of our aid , their profession has still a claim upon them .

		It is a recognized principle that the fortu - nate in any calling should give something of their means and experience in behalf of their young and untried brethren .

		The Guild , however , claims that all will ben - efit from its membership .

		Young writers will especially find it helpful .

		Some of our veteran writers have been glad to make use of its good offices .

		The society spares no effort to support in every honorable way the just claims of its members .

		The Secretary will , on request , furnish a copy of the Constitution and By-Laws , the roll of membership , etc. , and any other information concerning the Guild which may be wanted .

		Any professional writer in good stand - ing , whether the author of a book or not , is eligible for mem - bership .

		A SUGGESTION ON TEACHING ENGLISH LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The usual order of progress in taking up English lit - erature in collegiate instruction is the time order from past to present .

		Where development is traced it is , per - haps invariably , from earlier writers to later .

		But this certainly contravenes , and that very directly , a most im - portant psychic and pedagogic law ; namely , that mind tends ever to pass from known to unknown , from present to past , rather than vice versa .

		In any exploration of lit - erature it is most easy and profitable for the student to begin with the works of the day , as embodying thoughts and feelings familiar to him , and go out and upward from thence to the remote sources .

		If you live at the mouth of a stream , the natural method of tracing its course is to ascend it .

		Further , I would insist that the main divisions of lit - erary study should be not personal or periodic , but top - ical , because the largest and simplest interest runs in this form .

		For the college course , literature may be divided into fiction , drama , essays , and poetry .

		The best introduction to literary study is undoubtedly by - way of fjction ; and the Freshman , beginning with cur - rent novels , should trace backward to the earliest prose romances .

		In the same way let the Sophomore take up the drama ; the Junior , essays ; the Senior , poetry .

		The student in four years might thus come to some large understanding of and real intimacy with the distinct qualities of the distinct forms of literary expression .

		And I would lay the greatest stress ou what is now almost neglected the study of current literature .

		But too often the graduate is led by his collegiate training to look slightingly on the art of his own times , in favor of the supposed classics , and even to sneer at the present under cover of the past .

		This is fatal to all productivity and usefulness in the present .

		Literature is at once the expression of life and the introduction thereto ; and hence the art of every age has its main function for its own time .

		The main interest of the scholar naturally and rightly lies in the present ; to get into true touch with his times , and so find his true place therein , is his most earnest endeavor ; and so for him the study of the life of other ages should be wholly secondary and subsid - iary .

		Current history has recently become a study in some colleges , and I would enter this plea for current literature .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The mention , in the last number of THE DIAL , of the production of Sophocles 's '' -LRB- Edipus Tyrannus '' by the students of
Beloit College	ORGANIZATION	suggests a deserved reference to a similar presentation by the students of
Washburn College	ORGANIZATION	,
Topeka	LOCATION	,

		The '' Electra '' of Sophocles was given , for the third time in this country , on the evenings of

		The final presentation was an outgrowth from the prescribed course in the study of dramatic Greek litera - ture through translations .

		Some months have been spent in the perfecting of the play .

		The cast of char - acters was well adapted to individual powers .

		The highly emotional requirements for the central figure , '' Electra , '' were well sustained .

		The scenery and cos - tumes made for this production followed the ancient style as faithfully as possible .

		Plumtre 's translation into English was used .

		A chorus below the stage ren - dered the music composed for the play by Dr.

		234 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, THE COMMONWEALTH AND PRO- TECTORATE .

		* The period of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	and the
Protectorate	ORGANIZATION	must always remain of deep inter - est to the English or American student .

		It is not simply that men are prone to worship the rising rather than the setting sun , for Crom - well is certainly a far more interesting figure than
Charles I.	PERSON	, but that much of
England	LOCATION	's subsequent greatness , as well as our own first lessons in political liberty , date from the period when the great Protector was at the height of his power .

		It is undoubtedly due to the happy fact that his theme is thus cumulative , that the interest in Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's work has now been sustained through a series of fifteen formidable volumes .

		The theme of this new volume is the beginning of the heroic struggle of republican
England	LOCATION	, for the maintenance of the right to control and direct her own affairs a right which she had gained in the overthrow of Charles I .

		The most fanatical of modern Tories must kindle at the recital of the deeds of valor of the brave men who fought under Crom - well or
Blake	PERSON	.

		The most ardent supporter of royal prerogative must admire the sturdy valor of the little
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, as , beset by bitter foes at home , without a really staunch friend in all the courts of
Europe	LOCATION	, she slowly shakes herself loose from her numerous enemies and emerges at last , triumphant , the one great redeeming fact of a century otherwise bloody enough , and false enough as God only knows , '' the mighty and puissant nation rousing it - self like a strong man from sleep . ''

		The threat - ened invasion from
Ireland	LOCATION	, the actual invasion from
Scotland	LOCATION	, united the factions and consoli - dated the strength of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, until even the pronounced royalists , who regarded the regicide government with horror , refused to support a king who came to them sustained by foreign troops and pledged to foist upon the country an ecclesiastical system which English - men for the most part detested .

		It was the Irish and
Romanism	LOCATION	that ruined the cause of Charles II .

		in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		It was the Scotch and the Kirk that defeated him at
Worcester	LOCATION	.

		It was decided once and for all time that
England	LOCATION	'' should not be ruled by a King who came in as an in - vader .

		When
Charles I.	PERSON	was sent to the block , * HISTORY OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND PROTECTORATE , 1649-1660 .

		By
S. R. Gardiner	PERSON	.

		Volume I. , 1649-1651 .


New York	LOCATION	;
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cromwell had but the support of the army and of a handful of enthusiasts ; when he shattered the Scottish army at
Worcester	LOCATION	he had on his side the national spirit of
England	LOCATION	... En - gland had shown herself strong enough to frus - trate the attempts of
Ireland	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, to dictate the terms on which her internal govern - ment was to be carried on '' -LRB- page 446 -RRB- .

		The plot of the book is as simple as that of the ordinary fashionable novel .

		The Common - wealth and not the great
Oliver	PERSON	is the central figure .

		About this theme , as a skilful artist , the author gathers his material .

		Yet
Cromwell	PERSON	, the Hamlet of the piece , is by no means left out .

		At first his part is almost subordinate ; and yet with each shifting of the play the con - viction grows upon the reader , as it once grew upon the Englishmen of the seventeenth cen - tury , that only
Cromwell	PERSON	can save the Common - wealth , and he passes to the foreground as the one prominent figure of the play .

		This we feel in history ; this is the true
Cromwell	PERSON	, not a dehumanized , colorless adventurer , like the Na - poleon of
Sloan	LOCATION	, but a very human sort of man , a thoroughgoing opportunist who thrusts him - self forward into greatness not from mere sel - fish ambition , but because he and the friends of the Commonwealth see in him the only sal - vation of
England	LOCATION	.

		In the ''
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	'' Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	reveals the same characteristic elements of strength and weakness as in his earlier works .

		In style , however , there is a marked improve - ment .

		Occasionally the old , involved , heavy laden sentence that reminds us of one of Crom - well 's paragraphs , lumbers across the page .

		Yet such sentences are now comparatively rare .

		There is an evident effort on the author 's part to secure clearness even at the expense of printer 's ink .

		THE DIAL 235 tion to anything , not even to himself , the man without principle , without even dignity , upon whose conscience the obligations of friendship sat as lightly as the most sacred oath , in his wandering after
Worcester	LOCATION	, under the skilful pen of Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	, becomes almost a hero .

		In his account of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's Irish campaign , Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	, like many a more pronounced admirer of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, is compelled to face the massacres of
Drogheda	LOCATION	and
Wexford	LOCATION	.

		For
Cromwell	PERSON	, like the Frankish Charles or the French
Napoleon	PERSON	, has left behind him the mem - ory of cold-blooded massacre as an ugly blot upon his fair name which it has puzzled his admirers to explain away .

		But the '' damned spot '' will not '' out . ''

		Nor are Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	's efforts , not at justification , to be sure , but ex - tenuation , more satisfactory .

		Inchiquin , in his dispatch to Ormund of Sep - tember 15 , says : '' Many men and some officers have made their es - capes out of
Drogheda	LOCATION	.

		... All conclude that no man -LSB- had -RSB- quarter with
Cromwell	PERSON	's leave ; that yet many were saved by officers and soldiers ; that the Governor was killed in the Mill Mount after quarter -LSB- had been -RSB- given by the officer that came first there ; that some of the towers were defended until yesterday , quarter being denied them ; and that yesterday morning the towers wherein they were , were blown up ; that
Verney	PERSON	, Fin - glas ,
Warner	ORGANIZATION	, and some other officers were alive in the hands of some of

Fenthal	LOCATION	,

Carlyle Letter	ORGANIZATION	, C. V. -RRB- , there can be little doubt that they too were murdered in the same cold-blooded manner .

		Now it may be that ''

		131-132 -RRB- ; it may be that '' in the heat of ac - tion there stood out in his mind , through the blood-red haze of war , thoughts of vengeance to be taken for the Ulster massacre '' -LRB- p. 133 -RRB- , and that '' the stern command to put all to the sword who ' were in arms in the town , ' leapt lightly from his lips '' -LRB- 76iVZ -RRB- ; the grim fact yet remains that twenty-four hours after the city had been taken , and possibly longer , the hideous work went on , and that when Crom - well 's officers , and even his common soldiers , had spared many of their helpless enemies , they yet cut them down in cold blood in obedience to the order of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was certainly not the result of furious rage , still less did it arise from a purpose on
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's part to take ad - vantage of the laws of war -LRB- p. 132 -RRB- , as
Tilly	PERSON	had taught them on the continent .

		Even by that law , prisoners once received to quarter were to be spared .

		At
Limerick	LOCATION	,
Ireton	PERSON	cash - iered an officer who killed prisoners that a sub - ordinate had spared .

		Cromwell himself , in his wars on the other side of the Irish sea , followed a very different course , and was uniformly mer - ciful .

		At
Worcester	LOCATION	he even imperilled his own life in order to save his foes -LRB- p. 444 -RRB- .

		Now Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	possibly knows what was going on in
Cromwell	LOCATION	's mind , when , upon the third attempt , he saw his soldiers at last carry the wall of
Drogheda	LOCATION	and pour into the city ; but all connected with this dark affair , the use which
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	made subsequently of the ter - ror which the massacre had inspired among the simple-minded Irishry , the all but exact repe - tition of the same scenes at
Wexford	LOCATION	, a few weeks later , indicate a determined purpose on
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's part to adopt this severity in or - der to gain a definite object .

		We may judge the man , but we have no right to take him out of the age in which he acted the age of the religious wars that had followed the Reforma - tion .

		So far , the civil wars in
England	LOCATION	had been political .

		Religious elements , even social elements , were not altogether absent , and from time to time they had added to the bitterness of the conflict .

		But when the war crossed to Ire - land it was no longer Puritan against Cavalier , but Protestant against Catholic ; worse , it was the seventeenth century Englishman against the seventeenth century Irishman .

		Ever since the ` days of
Strafford	LOCATION	, the English had regarded the possibility of an Irish invasion with some such feeling of dread and latent panic as a slave-holding aristocracy might regard the pos - sible terrors of an uprising of their serfs .

		The English despised the Irish , at the same time that they feared them .

		The terrors , the possibility of horrors indescribable , which must attend such an inroad nerved the hands and steeled the hearts of the Englishmen who followed
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	across the Irish Sea .

		They went in 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, order to forestall this long-dreaded calamity , which the presence of Ormund and the purpose of Charles now made imminent .

		Cromwell , while he was certainly above the blind fero - cious instincts of the common soldier , yet saw in the imminence of the peril and the appall - ing nature of the danger a demand for the ut - most severity .

		The danger must not be trifled with .

		He must strike hard .

		He must strike to crush .

		Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	thinks that the letter to the Royalist governor of
Dundalk	LOCATION	, written while the massacre at
Drogheda	LOCATION	was still in progress , indicates an uneasy conscience on the part of
Cromwell	PERSON	and is an attempt on his part at self - justification .

		But such men as
Cromwell	PERSON	are not wont to justify themselves before an enemy , especially when they summon him to lay down his arms .

		The letter really throws a deal of light upon the purpose which
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	had in mind in ordering the slaughter , in showing the use which he made of it at once . ''

		I offered mercy to the garrison of
Drogheda	LOCATION	, '' he writes , '' in sending the Governor a summons before I attempted the taking of it , which being refused brought this evil upon them .

		If you , being warned thereby , shall surrender your garrison to the use of the Parliament of
England	LOCATION	, ... you may thereby prevent effusion of blood .

		If upon refusing this offer , that which you like not , befalls you , you will know whom to blame . ''

		-LRB-
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	, Letter CHI . -RRB-

		.

		This is not a justifi - cation .

		It is a simple threat , in
Cromwell	LOCATION	's cool way , to treat the garrison of
Dundalk	LOCATION	as he had treated the garrison of
Drogheda	LOCATION	.

		Simi - lar terms were sent to other garrisons about him .

		If they dared to defend themselves , they must expect the terms of
Drogheda	LOCATION	.

		Crom - well proposed by the terror inspired by the first blow which he struck to intimidate the half - armed and poorly-disciplined Irish .

		Nor was he altogether unsuccessful .


Wexford	LOCATION	, in the south , dared to stand to the issue of arms , and her fate was that of
Drogheda	LOCATION	.

		But other towns were wiser and yielded .

		The terror of
Drogheda	LOCATION	fell upon the simple-hearted folk , and their officers could not drive them to face the bloody issue .

		That is ,
Cromwell	PERSON	coolly adopted and carried out a plan of repression and cruelty that resembles the cold-blooded measures adopted by Charles the Great in re - ducing the pagan Saxons .

		That
Cromwell	PERSON	did not go as far as
Charles	PERSON	, was not because he was unequal to such a task , but because the Irish were in no condition to make the desper - ate resistance with which the Saxons so long defied
Charles	PERSON	.

		That Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	himself inclines , after all , to this view may be inferred from a passage on page 470 , in which he con - demns Monk 's massacre at
Dunbar	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here , undoubtedly alluding to
Drogheda	LOCATION	, he says : '' With all
Scotland	LOCATION	at his -LSB- Monk 's -RSB- feet , no cruelty was needed to terrify other garrisons into submission . ''

		Cromwell belongs to the seventeenth century .

		In the nineteenth century , with such shadows as
Drogheda	LOCATION	and
Wexford	LOCATION	in the background , his religiousness becomes despicable cant .

		He is a compound of
Pecksniff	PERSON	and
John Girdle	PERSON	- stone .

		The one he surpasses in meanness and the other in cold-blooded villainy .

		But Crom - well does not belong to the nineteenth century .

		He belongs to the seventeenth .

		The treaty of
Westphalia	LOCATION	was scarcely a year old when his ferocious soldiers were roasting Irishmen in the towers of
Drogheda	LOCATION	or knocking priests on the head at
Wexford	LOCATION	.

		Cromwell was a saint of the Old Testament rather than of the New .

		The religious books that the good Ulphilas had once thought too exhilarating for his half-trained Gothic Christians were altogether the favorite reading of
Cromwell	PERSON	and the stern-browed men who followed him .

		Their political creed was a short one .

		The pious were to rule the state .

		Those who resisted were to be as Agag before
Samuel	PERSON	, or as the Canaanite before
Israel	LOCATION	.

		The symbol of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	was the sword of
Joshua	PERSON	rather than the staff of
John	PERSON	.

		The vio - lent contrast between the pious ejaculations ever upon the lips of
Cromwell	PERSON	, and his fero - cious cruelty , do not prove him to have been either a hypocrite or a madman , any more than in the case of
Joshua	LOCATION	or Samuel .

		Satisfied as to the scientific character of the work , the young man closed the book with a mind greatly relieved .

		If some such reader should chance to open
Herr Max Nordau	PERSON	's work on '' Degeneration '' at page 319 , he might get somewhat the same impression .

		That page presents Mr.
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	still clad in the doublet and kneebreeches of fifteen years ago , with the same old sunflower -LRB- not even a green carnation -RRB- , having in his mouth the paradoxes of '' Intentions , '' taken se - riously , set up as an a3sthetic
Aunt Sally	PERSON	, to be promptly knocked down again by
Herr Max Nordau	ORGANIZATION	with such hard words as '' egomaniac , '' and `` hysterical . ''

		The impression , however , would be a mistake : although it may seem wholly absurd to those who have seen only the extracts in the
Sunday	DATE	papers , I can not agree with those who hold the book to be nothing more than clap - trap and sensationalism .

		The subject is in itself a sort of challenge to serious thought .

		The thesis is that the upper classes of the chief races of
Europe	LOCATION	to-day , hav - ing passed suddenly into wholly new conditions , wearied by the complication and rapidity of modern life , by its immensely enlarged range of interest , insufficiently nourished , and pois - oned by large cities and over-use of narcotics and stimulants , are falling into fatigue and ex - haustion , breaking down into prematureold age .

		Among the results of this state of hysteria and nervous prostration on a large scale , and one of the most marked signs of it , appear all manner of perverted eccentricities in the world of art .

		But the promulgators of such perversions , though hailed by the vulgar as heralds of a new era , are in reality but the most enfeebled and degraded of humanity : in other words , to use the scientific term , degenerates .

		If such be a fair picture of our time , the investigation of the literature of the present day from such a stand - point is a matter of interest .

		The question is one which would seem not wholly outside the possibilities of scientific in - quiry .

		Criminal anthropology is a young science as yet ; it is not absolutely sure of its ground ; but a competent scholar could cer - tainly find opportunity here for sound and val - uable work .

		It is rather unfortunate that it was impossible -LRB- page 17 -RRB- for
Herr Nordau	PERSON	to study the physical peculiarities of his subjects and their ancestry as well , for these points are usually regarded by anthropologists as of more importance in the study of degenerates than such psychic phenomena as can be observed .

		These latter peculiarities are sometimes met with in normal subjects : the physical and he - reditary conditions are generally regarded as surest evidence .

		But on the more confined and slightly treacherous ground one may make up for deficiencies by greater care as to the ac - cwacy of observation , the correctness of gen - eralization , and the exactitude of inference .

		The argument is one by analogy .

		There have been observed certain cases with such and such ancestral conditions , such and such physical conditions , and such and such mental peculiar - ities .

		Persons agreeing in such characteristics are known as `` degenerates . ''

		Now on exam - ining the works of various contemporary men of letters
Herr Nordau	PERSON	observes certain mental peculiarities , to which he adds occasionally cer - tain physical traits .

		He infers that these au - thors belong properly to the class in question and should be regarded as morally insane .

		When
Heine	PERSON	prayed to be saved from the evil one and a metaphor , he was thinking of the argument by analogy ; but it hardly seems nec - essary to go to this length .

		We must , of course , recognize its necessary weaknesses , but we may easily ascribe to it such importance as it de - serves .

		The matter is , however , one which can not be presented in popular form save by a master of modern anthropology , of alienism , and of literary criticism .

		The subject is a delicate one ; * it lends itself too readily to exaggeration , to sensationalism , even to prejudice , for it to be a fit task for anyone but a sound and tem - perate scientist .

		For the authorities upon such a subject are not such as the public can readily consult or appreciate ; nor is the general reader able to weigh the evidence properly , nor to de - tect fallacies readily ; he must in a measure rely upon his author , he must , in fact , trust his statements implicitly .

		It is unfortunate , therefore , that the idea should have got about that
Herr Nordau	PERSON	is anything but a skilful scientist , that his methods are not the most exact , that his logic is not the most rigid , that he is not devoted to the attainment of Truth * In more senses than one .

		It ought to be said that no good woman I unless perhaps one who has already studied kindred matters -RRB- will read it without coming across much that is ex - tremely shocking to her .

		238 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, at any cost .

		If he were not such a scholar , his book should never have been published for popular reading by any reputable house .


Herr Nordau	PERSON	is undoubtedly a scientist .

		It is true that we need hardly concede him the title because he has a great number of exact references in footnotes , * nor because he deals largely with technical terms , nor even because he has no admiration for religion .

		But then we need not deny it to him because he is the author of '' Die
Conventionellen Liigen	PERSON	der Kulturmenschheit . ''

		That book was certainly extravagant and journalistic ; but it had con - siderable popularity , and was republished in
America	LOCATION	.

		Nor is it proper to refuse attention to a man because he believes Professor
Lom	PERSON	- broso to be u one of the loftiest mental phe - nomena of the century , '' even if we ourselves believe
Lombroso	LOCATION	to be often over-enthusiastic .

		As to whether
Herr Nordau	PERSON	be a scientist of eminently sound and well-balanced temper - ament , there is , unfortunately , more room for doubt .

		He himself seems to affirm that he is .

		He says -LRB- page 507 -RRB- that except perhaps in his treatment of the '' Young German '' movement , he has observed any given phenomena with the cool equanimity of scientific method .

		There is , however , something about his language which rouses an uncomfortable idea that we have to do with a writer of rather a different character .

		But there are , I think , no passages in the whole book more excessive than these : '' True , science tells us nothing about the life after death , of harp-concerts in
Paradise	LOCATION	, and of the trans - formation of stupid youths and hysterical geese into white-clad angels with rainbow-colored wings '' -LRB- p. 109 -RRB- . ''


George Brandes	PERSON	, a sponger on the fame or name of others , has throughout his life followed the calling of a ' human orchestra , ' who with head , mouth , hands , elbows , knees , and feet , plays ten noisy instruments at once , dancing before poets and authors , and , after the hubbub , passes his hat round among the deafened pub - lic '' -LRB- p. 356 -RRB- . ''

		A poor degenerate devil who scribbles such stuff , and an imbecile reader who follows his twaddle like passing clouds , are simply to be pitied '' -LRB- p. 137 -RRB- . ''

		Another graphomaniac , the author of that imbecile book , Rembrandt as Educator , drivels in almost the same way '' -LRB- p. 106 -RRB- . ''

		The creatures moving on his stage are not thinking and speaking human beings , but tadpoles or slugs , con - siderably more stupid than trained fleas at a fair '' -LRB- p. 238 -RRB- . ''

		...
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, who is likewise one of the deities to whom the degenerate and hysterical of both hemispheres have for some time been raising altars '' -LRB- p. 230 -RRB- .

		* He understands the value of footnotes .

		`` The English - man accepts a fit of delirium if it appears with footnotes '' -LRB- p. 78 -RRB- .

		Of a book like this , we may rightly expect that not only in scientific temper will the author be above reproach , but in his literary criticism as well .

		Here I must allow that
Herr Nordau	PERSON	sometimes leaves a little to be desired .

		It may be too much to expect of a scientist that he should trouble himself with an author 's own standpoint .

		And of course , when a man is criti - cizing the literature of all
Europe	LOCATION	, one can hardly expect him not to slip up now and then .

		Still , I could wish he had not seemed to think that
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's characters always express
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's own sentiments -LRB- pp. 338-415 passim ; but cf. also pp. 342 , 343 -RRB- ; or that
Tolstoi	PERSON	created the murderer Pozdnyscheff in the ''
Kreutzer	PERSON	Son - ata '' as a mouthpiece for his own views -LRB- p. 161 -RRB- .

		It seems hardly to show keen discrimination to recognize in
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's use of anaphora the parallelism of the Psalms -LRB- p. 232 -RRB- ; or to believe that
Rossetti	PERSON	's refrains '' possess the character of an obsession '' -LRB- p. 92 -RRB- , any more than the refrains of the old ballads from which they were imitated .

		As for errors , there will probably be found few worse than the state - ment that '' In the year
1843	DATE	...
Ruskin	PERSON	began to publish the feverish studies on art which were subsequently collected under the title of ` Modern Painters . '

		He was then a young divinity student , '' etc. , * -LRB- p. 78 -RRB- ; or that `` In
1887	DATE	his -LSB-
Tolstoi	PERSON	's -RSB- ` Kreutzer Sonata ' ap - peared , and was the first of his works to carry his name to the borders of civilization '' -LRB- p. 148 -RRB- ; or that
Walt Whitman	PERSON	'' for his fame has to thank just those bestially sensual pieces , which first drew to him the attention of all the pruriency of
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 231 -RRB- .

		With such characteristics as a scientist and a critic , will anyone doubt that
Herr Nordau	PERSON	is fully capable of treating a most difficult and delicate subject in such a manner as will really instruct and assist the general reader , for whom his book seems particularly designed ?

		I suppose some people may have such doubts .

		He , himself , I believe , has none .

		He under - stands that his work will lay him open to mis - conception , but he goes on resolutely . ''

		The danger , however , to which he exposes himself can not deter a man from doing that which he regards as his duty .

		When a scientific truth has been discovered , he owes it to humanity , and has no right to withhold it '' -LRB- p. ix -RRB- .

		True , doubtless ; although there would seem to be no especial need of dressing up the scientific truth as though it were a bit of popular expo - sition .

		* Perhaps this last is due to the translator .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 For my part , I also have little doubt in the matter .

		Although , as I have said , the book is by no means `` nothing more than clap-trap and sensationalism , '' there is a very fair proportion of those two undesirable qualities .

		And this is rather a pity , for there is also much of interest .


Herr Nordau	PERSON	is undoubtedly a student of broad reading in the literature of the subject , a man capable of immense intellectual work .

		He pos - sesses great power of presentation , a keen eye for the follies of others , some sound views on art , * and a hearty admiration for sane and solid thought .

		But he has too much of a steeple - chaser in him ; he gets on his gaudy racing col - ors , sees his goal miles away , and then no ob - stacle will keep him from it .

		So much on
Herr Nordau	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		From the responsibility of discussing the thesis of his book , I must , as gracefully as may be , retire .

		There are many things that might be said for some of his views and against others .

		But the opinions of such an author can not claim serious discussion except it be in the technical journals . ''

		The verbose rhetorician , '' remarks
Herr	PERSON	Nor - dau -LRB- p.
Viii	PERSON	. -RRB-

		`` exposes with more or less grace or cleverness the subjective impressions received from the works he criticises , but is incapable of judging if those works are the productions of a shattered brain , and also the nature of the men - tal disturbance expressing itself by them . ''

		The most fruitful review of
Herr Nordau	ORGANIZATION	's book would be by a specialist in brain-diseases .

		But the colored maps accom - panying the Hull-House book cover a field much smaller than the whole of

		itants of each dwelling separately , even the house numbers being given .

		They are thus made valuable for purposes requiring exact knowledge .

		The section chosen for this graphic treat - ment lies just east and southeast of Hull-House , extending from
Halsted	LOCATION	street east one mile to
State	ORGANIZATION	street , and from Polk street south one - third of a mile to Twelfth street .

		This third of a square mile includes not only the poorest and most crowded part of
Chicago	LOCATION	, but also , east of the river , a part of one of the most openly vicious and criminal districts of the civ - ilized world .

		An adjacent section of this same criminal district was placed under the micro - scope by Mr.
Stead	PERSON	in his work of a year ago .

		The data from which the maps were con - structed were secured in the course of a gov - ernmental investigation of the slums of great cities , undertaken in the
spring of 1893	DATE	by the
United States Department of Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Florence Kelley	PERSON	, of Hull-House , was the special agent expert in charge of this work in
Chicago	LOCATION	; and as the schedules were returned to her daily by her four assistants , the data required for these maps were taken off by a resident of
Hull-House	ORGANIZATION	.

		In one map the nationalities of the people are shown , and a second map shows the average weekly income of the families on each lot .

		In showing the economic condition , the colors adopted in Mr.
Booth	PERSON	's maps are re - tained as far as possible ; but while the
London	LOCATION	maps include all classes of society , these repre - sent only the poorest part of
Chicago	LOCATION	, where those families which have more than
twenty dollars	MONEY	a week are the aristocracy .

		The pre - dominant color on the wage-map is blue , repre - senting wages of from five to
ten dollars	MONEY	a week for an entire family .

		The neighborhood is distinctly cosmopolitan .

		Altogether eighteen nationalities are distin - guished on the map , although the English , En - glish-Canadians , Scotch , and Americans are counted as one nationality , designated by white .

		Even so , the white spots on the map would be few and small were it not for the many Amer - ican-born children , who are often virtually as alien as their parents , but who are counted as Americans if they are more than ten years of age , or if they attend a public school .

		The map shows a preponderence of Italians , Russian and Polish Jews , and Bohemians ; but we are told in the explanatory text that the Irish control the polls .

		In some cases as many as ten na - tionalities are represented in a single building , but usually neither Italians nor Jews are found 240 THE DIAL -LSB-

Gresham	PERSON	's law of demography , the appearance of the '' Dago '' or the '' Sheeny '' drives out all other tenants .

		Race prejudice and class distinctions are as prevalent here as among the brown-stone fronts of
Michigan Avenue	LOCATION	.

		The shop fronts on the principal streets keep up an appearance of re - spectability , so that the casual passer-by gets no idea of the poverty and squalor just beyond . ''

		Rear tenements and alleys form the core of the dis - trict , and it is there that the densest crowds of the most wretched and destitute congregate .

		Little idea can be given of the filthy and rotten tenements , the dingy courts and tumble-down sheds , the foul stables and di - lapidated out-houses , the broken sewer-pipes , the piles of garbage fairly alive with diseased odors , and of the numbers of small children filling every nook , working and playing in every room , eating and sleeping in every window-sill , pouring in and out of every door , and seem - ing literally to pave every scrap of ` yard .

Kelley	PERSON	and Mrs.
A. P. Stevens	PERSON	, the Assistant

		In these two papers are related some of the worst abuses of
Chicago	LOCATION	's industrial life .

		Here we are told that fashionable wraps and the best grades of custom-made clothing , as well as ready-made suits and white underwear , are made in sweat-shops , often in alarming proximity to contagious disease .

		There are only two garment-manufacturers in
Chicago	LOCATION	who do not give out clothing to be made or finished in tenement-houses .

		We read that in each large clothing shop there is an examiner , who combines with the function of passing upon the work that conies from the sweat-shops that of destroying such vermin as his rapid exami - nation of the clothing happens to disclose .

		Af - ter reading of the filthy surroundings among which even expensive clothing is made , and of the deadly disease - germs and loathsome insects which frequently inhabit it , the abolition of the sweating-system becomes not a matter of be - nevolence only , but of self-interest as well , to every member of the community .

		Altruism and enlightened selfishness both lead inevitably to Mrs.
Kelley	PERSON	's conclusion , that the abolition of tenement-house manufacture is the only ade - quate remedy for the existing evils .

		In the article on `` Wage-earning Children , '' it is clearly shown that we are far behind
England	LOCATION	in requiring precautions for the health and safety of working-children .

		This chapter is a pitiful picture of little children exposed by the conditions of their work to vice , disease , and mutilation ; of dissolute adult employees sow - ing moral pestilence among children and young girls ; of boys killed and maimed by machinery without the simplest safety appliances ; of con - tracts with parents releasing the employer from liability in case of accidents ; of employers growing rich on the labor of droves of children , whose wages range from
forty cents	MONEY	to
four dollars	MONEY	a week ; and of men actually superan - nuated at forty , or even at thirty - four , by work begun too early in childhood , and so becoming a burden upon their own children , or upon the county .

		Thus child - labor perpetuates itself .

		A record of physical examinations , with accom - panying charts constructed by Dr.
Bayard Holmes	PERSON	, shows a startling prevalence of dis - ease and deformity among factory children .

		As the solution of the child-labor problem the writ - ers of the paper propose compulsory school at - tendance up to the age of sixteen . ''

		Where they are the wage-earning children are an unmitigated injury to themselves , to the community upon which they will later be burdens , and to the trade which they demoralize .

		They learn nothing valuable ; they shorten the average of the trade life , and they lower the standard of living of the adults with whom they compete . ''

		There is much in these papers to confirm one in the principles for which Hull-House stands , that the poor need not charity , but justice .

		Here one finds repeated references to merchant - prince philanthropists who first make their money by extortion and oppression , and then give back some part of it to the working peo - ple in charity .

		The value of labor organization is shown by the fact that the unorganized and poorly organized trades are just the ones in which the workers receive the least pay for the most work , and seem compelled to set their children at work while they are still babies .

		The papers which make up the remainder of the book are for the most part of a more spe - cial nature .

		They are : '' Receipts and

		STUDIES OF
NEW JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Laf cadio Hearn	PERSON	, who was for many years a teacher of English in various gymnasia of
Japan	LOCATION	, presents us , in his volume entitled '' Out of the East , '' with eleven studies on
New Japan	LOCATION	, distinguished , as was the author 's recent '' Glimpses of
Unfamiliar Japan	LOCATION	, '' by strong sympathy with both the extant religions of Ja - pan Shinto and Buddhism . '

		T is true , ' t is pity , that this rare and valuable sympathy is often allowed to degenerate into distinctly doc - trinaire handling of data , as anyone familiar with the darker side of
Japan	LOCATION	will easily see .

		However , let us be thankful , for just at present something of this kind may prove wholesome equally for American national and religious conceit , both of which have been so long nur - tured by graphic accounts of '' effete monarch - ies '' and '' degraded heathen , '' which , unless much be soon done to check them , may end by calling Oriental reformers and missionaries here !

		Viewed thus as advocacy , and not as scientific , impartial estimate , these essays must be highly commended , especially to those re - pelled by this description ; for such repulsion reveals just that mental condition the book was written and is calculated to meet .

		The eleven essays are so varied in both style and substance that they can be characterized only in turn .

		The first three are slight pieces , but the fourth , '' Of the Eternal Feminine , '' presents very solid material nothing less , in - deed , than an attempt to rally and lead the Orient in a counter charge on the Occident in the matter of the Woman Question . ''

		He who would study impartially the life and thought of the Orient must also study those of the Occident from the Oriental point of view , '' states the author 's principle , which leads him to present some Japanese criticisms of our relations to woman which are original enough to delight some and shock others .

		It appears that while Western usage , art , and life are dominated by woman , and more generally by personality , the
East	LOCATION	has retained the power of viewing nature * OUT OF THE EAST .

		in herself apart from all anthropological media - tion .

		Hence asymmetry , irregularity , variety , and kindred traits in Japanese art .

		The author is careful not to overstate his contention , and presents a suggestive rather than a formally complete article .

		Those who know well that they never saw light or water until
Ruskin	PERSON	opened their eyes by his description of sunlight and of the
Rhone	LOCATION	, which in the last analysis he achieves by interpretation through personality , will not be likely to abandon that master 's method , but may certainly allow the possibility of gaining something from the viewing of na - ture as such . ''

		Bits of Life and Death '' describes well enough those glimpses of Japanese life the strangeness of which justifies insertion here .

		In '' The Stone Buddha '' we pass to the sub - limities of life universal , the question of the ultimate meaning and value of life .

		Here the knowledge of Mr.
H. Spencer	PERSON	, scientist , is shown to run parallel with the enlightenment of
G. Buddha	PERSON	, seer , except where the seer sur - passes the scientist .

		The notions introduced will prove familiar to those abreast with modern philosophic thought , but afford the advantage of sympathetic treatment and of Oriental set - ting .

		Note the illegitimate passage , also not new to those conversant with Buddhist think - ers , from the scientific doctrine of heredity to the visionary notion of karma , pp. 169-70 .

		The essay entitled '' Jiujutsu '' takes as topic the recently demonstrated power of
Japan	LOCATION	to react on Western pressure and assert herself in the councils and activities of the wide world .

		She has shown the very highest capacity that to learn ; and henceforth
Japan	LOCATION	must be declared not imitative but assimilative or adoptive .

		This wonderful achievement of
Japan	LOCATION	forces on us the problem of the future relations of
Occi	PERSON	- dentals and Orientals .

		That the latter can as - similate the former 's acquisitions on a vastly cheaper expenditure , bodes ill to the West , which will be undersold because it can be underlived .

		This interesting article is marred by strictures upon missions in
Japan	LOCATION	so violent as to preclude the attribution of unbiased judg - ment .

		Such garbling , however , has one ex - cuse : the unconsciously , and naturally , almost necessarily , one-sided reports of the '' heathen '' which are forwarded to their supporters at home by foreign missionaries .

		One might have hoped , however , that the censor would not re - peat the error of the censured .

		Next follows a pathetic story of the simul - taneous suicide of thwarted lovers , which clashes 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, unpleasantly with the sweeping claims pre - viously made for the superiority of Japanese to Western morality .

		The sketch entitled '' A Wish Fulfilled '' affords an inside view of an - cestor worship sure to prove illuminating to those who know it only by definition and from afar .

		Last comes ''

		THE BACOXIAX AUTHORSHIP OF THE PLAYS .

		* An American Shakespearian critic , Dr.
W. J. Rolfe	PERSON	, has recently invited contributions from his countrymen , of five shillings each , toward the presentation of an illuminated address to the Rev. Dr.
A. Nicholson	PERSON	, of
Leamington	LOCATION	, En - gland , in grateful recognition of '' his complete refutation of the Donnelly Cryptogram . ''

		By way of encouragement , it is stated that , in En - gland , '' Some have subscribed for themselves and their wives or other members of their fam - ilies . ''

		When the air is thus electric with gen - erous impulses , one almost wonders that some American does not enter the lists , and proceed to demolish Dr.
Owen	PERSON	's latest '' wheel-cipher , '' in the reasonable hope that he will be hon - ored with at least a two-shilling '' illuminated address . ''

		But while we may enjoy this innocent jubila - tion in commemoration of victory in another battle with windmills , and though the illumi - nation be merely the burning of some very old straw , its momentary blaze but reveals the depths profound of the neglect into which char - latan methods have plunged the entire ques - tion of the Baconian authorship of the plays .

		And yet when so many reputable literary men among them ,
Disraeli	LOCATION	, for example , are known to have entertained very serious convic - tions upon the subject , obviously such a ques - tion of authorship should be approached soberly , from the standpoint of the scholar intent upon the discovery of the truth , with an impartial weighing of the evidences , with critical acumen , and carried on in a spirit truly scientific and with a diligent effort to arrive intelligently at a definite conclusion .

		Such was the spirit in which Judge
Holmes	PERSON	addressed himself to the problem , in the pioneer work published many * THE PLAYS OF SHAKESPEARE .

		years ago by
Messrs. Ticknor & Fields of Bos	ORGANIZATION	- ton the predecessors of the eminent firm that now issues the latest contribution to the discussion ; and while the earlier work failed to convince the public , it commanded respectful attention , as will any book written in a like spirit , which presents properly additional data .

		Mr.
Ruggles	PERSON	, the author of '' The Plays of Shakespeare , '' is worthy of commendation for the spirit in which he has designed and writ - ten his book .

		He does not even enter into the direct discussion of the authorship of the plays : instead , he seeks , through a comprehensive com - parison of the several plays with
Bacon	PERSON	's whole system of philosophy in its multiform details , to show , critically and visually , that in their constitution and in their detailed particulars they are the definite outgrowth and concrete development of that philosophy .

		In the exe - cution of this task , he presents much fresh data .

		And it must be confessed that in many important particulars he enables us to see in the plays some striking '' vestiges '' of
Bacon	LOCATION	as their creator .

		Yet the book , in itself per - haps designedly is still inconclusive .

		The author is evidently a convert to
Bacon	LOCATION	's admir - able method in the inculcation of what is con - ceived to be the truth : '' So I like better that entry of truth which comes peaceably as with chalk to mark up those minds which are capable to lodge and harbor such a guest , than that which forces its way with pugnacity and contention . ''

		And yet in the use of this method , the author , possibly through the excessive zeal of a new convert , falls quite into the opposite extreme from that which he would avoid .

		He presents an intricate array of evidences , so interwoven with a vast number of other particulars , that altogether too much labor is imposed upon the reader : too great a strain is placed upon his constructive imagination , and almost inevitably it breaks down under the load .

		If Professor
Henry Drummond	PERSON	has accom - plished nothing else in his little brochure on '' The Greatest Thing in the World , '' he has abundantly paid the debt he owed to his profes - sion by enforcing upon the attention of men of letters , through this example , the old truth that in addressing the public the most artistic is the most effective presentation .

		While there are some fine passages in the book before us as , for example , the delineation of Imogen in the discussion of '' Cymbeline , '' yet , test - ing the work by this standard , in the ungra - cious aspect of criticism , we find that both as a whole and in its several chapters it is sadly de -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 ficient in the artistic element .

		The following , from the chapter on '' The
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' is perhaps a fair example of the style in which much of the book is written : '' Among the uses of speech stand foremost persua - sion and instruction ... To give or receive wise coun - sel , and thereby remove in others or ourselves the troubles of the heart or the perplexities of business , is one of the honorablest offices and rarest fruits of friend - ship .

		Thus
Bacon	PERSON	says : ' No receipt openeth the heart like a true friend to whom you may impart griefs , joys , fears , hopes , suspicions , counsels , and whatever lieth upon the heart to oppress it , in a kind of civil shrift or confession ' and in the same spirit
Leontes	PERSON	says to his counsellor , Camillo : ' I have trusted thee ,
Camillo	LOCATION	; With all the near ` st things to my heart , as well My chamber-councils : wherein , priest-like , thou Hast cleansed my bosom ; I from thee departed Thy penitent reform 'd . ' ''

		Both persuasion and instruction , which in their vari - ous forms have a range from the lispings of the child to the oratory of the senate-house , may be comprised under the head of the communication of knowledge .

		There are two sources of knowledge : experience and testimony .

		The facts of which any one individual has certain knowledge are only those which fall under his own observation and form but an infinitesimal portion of the great mass that makes up the whole truth ; all else to him is but opinion , that is probability , or likeli - hood supported by testimony .

		In the most trivial as in the most important matters , trust must be placed in the sayings and information of others , that is , in testimony , and the sum of the knowledge possessed by any com - munity is the result of the incessant interchange of in - telligence between its individual members as eye-and - ar witnesses .

		Every man , however limited his sphere of action , can contribute some knowledge , whereby he may often , unwittingly , supply a necessary link in a chain of proof , as for instance , the old
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	in the play communicates facts known only to himself , which establish the royal birth of
Perdita	LOCATION	; and thus through the endless intermingling of human affairs ' the in - finite doings of the world ' facts of the greatest mo - ment which have been lost for years to view are fre - quently brought to light by what is called
Time	ORGANIZATION	and Chance . ''

		After reading an entire chapter , one lays down the book almost as wearied as was its author ; and however interested in the theme , unless impelled by duty the reader is inclined to post - pone its further perusal till '' a more conven - ient season . ''

		Adopting for the moment the author 's un - derlying but unexpressed hypothesis of
Bacon	LOCATION	's authorship of the plays , we regret that he had not followed more closely , in spirit at least , the advice given by the poet in the eighty-fourth Sonnet : '' Lean penury within that pen doth dwell , That to his subject lends not some small glory ; But he that writes of you , if he can tell That you are you , so dignifies his story , Let him but copy what in you is writ , Not making worse what Nature made so clear , And such a counterpart shall fame his wit , Making his style admired everywhere . ''

		The book is a large octavo of seven hundred pages ; and we can not but think that had the author omitted the discussion of some of the plays considered , or had otherwise abridged it to a volume of half the size and at half the price , it would have been more effective in the accomplishment of his purpose .

		I also heard them talk of singing fish in the
Ohio	LOCATION	, which so impressed me that I listened for the song of the fish as soon as we reached the
Monongahela	LOCATION	.

		I have since heard these singing fish , which are said to be the white perch , making a low and very musical hum , just about sunset of a
June	DATE
evening	TIME	, when they would gather be - neath a ferry flat-boat , and follow it backward and for - ward across the river .

		The sound they give forth is very sweet , but varied by only two or three notes , and much like the sound made by a silk string fixed in a window . ''

		The people who settled in
Eastern Ohio	LOCATION	, be - low the Beaver Falls , were mostly Scotch-Irish , as were the inhabitants of
Western Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania .

		They were light-hearted , prudent and thrifty , devoted to Calvinism , '' very demo - cratic in politics , and they took kindly to whisky , of which they made and drank large quantities . ''

		Whether grain was scarce or plenty , or times hard , the rude distilleries were kept busy , and custom required that at all social gatherings , as well as log-rollings and corn - huskings , whisky should be offered as an evi - dence of hospitality .

		In time , temperance so - cieties came in to restrict the use of stimulants .

		Money was scarce and the people resorted to barter for most articles purchased or produced .

		Tea , coffee , leather , iron , powder , lead , linen , cloth , feathers , beeswax , deerskins , and furs were cash articles , and could be exchanged one for another , or be sold for money which was re - quired to pay taxes .

		Mechanics took their pay in grain , their customers providing the articles for manufacture .

		A day 's work was equivalent to a bushel of wheat , the value of which was from thirty-five to
fifty cents	MONEY	.

		It would take several bushels to pay for a day 's labor now .

		The female members of a family would card , spin , and weave the flax or wool , and produce the cloth worn by all of its members .

		Linsey cloth , when woven in plaid figures , made a smart dress for e very-day wear .

		Farming work was necessarily carried on by mutual help , from the raising of the rude log cabins and barns to harvesting .

		Social life was promoted in this way . ''

		One of the gatherings for joint work , which has to - tally disappeared from the agriculture of modern times , and one that was always a jolly kind of affair , was the corn-husking .

		It was a sort of harvest - home in its department , and it was the more jolly because it was a gathering with very little respect to persons , and em - braced in the invitation men and big boys , with the un - derstanding that no one would be unwelcome .

		There was always a good supper served at the husking , and as certainly a good appetite to eat it with .

		It came at a plentiful season , when the turkeys and chickens were fat , and a fat pig was at hand , to be flanked on the table with good bread in various forms , turnips and po - tatoes from the autumn stores , apple and pumpkin pies , good coffee , and the like .

		And the cooking was always well done , and all in such bountiful abundance that no one feared to eat , while many a poor fellow was certain of a ` square meal ' by being present at a husking .

		You were sure to see the laboring men of the vicinity out ; and the wives of a goodly number of farm hands would be on hand to help in the cooking and serving at the table . ''

		The huskers were divided and placed under two captains . ''

		From the time they began till the corn was all husked at one end , there would be steady work , each man husking all the corn he could , never stopping ex - cept to take a pull at the stone jug of inspiration that passed occasionally along the line .

		... As soon as one party got done they raised a shout , and hoisting their captain on their shoulders , carried him over to the other side with general cheering .

		All hands would then turn in and finish what remained .

		The shout at hoisting the captain was the signal for bringing the supper on the table .

		This was often followed by dancing after the elders had retired , if the man with the fiddle should attend ... There was a tradition that the boys who accidentally husked a red ear , and saved it , would be entitled to a kiss from somebody .

		But I never knew it to be necessary to produce a red ear to secure a kiss where there was a disposition to give or take one . ''

		Such are the pleasant glimpses of old-time life and manners furnished through the vivid recollections of this
Ohio	LOCATION	pioneer .

W. D. Howells	PERSON	, and covering the closing years of his father 's life , is full of touching interest .

		BRIEFS ox : NEW BOOKS .

		A scholarly volume of literary essays .

		Mr.
John Churton Collins	PERSON	is well known as one of the most thoroughly - equipped among living students of English literature , and as one of the most resolute champions of its claims to serious consideration as an instrument of culture and the higher discipline .

		He need hardly , then , have apologized for collect - ing and republishing , in the handsome volume of '' Essays and Studies '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- now before us , a group of his contributions to the periodical litera - ture of the past twenty years .

		He does not lightly undertake any piece of work , and the broad scholar - ship which informs these essays makes them well worthy of preservation .

		They are five in number .

		The essays on
Dryden	PERSON	and Menander need no ex - planation .

		It is hardly necessary to say that Theo - bald is the subject of `` The Person of Shakespearian Criticism . ''

		The two remaining essays are re - views : '' Lord
Chesterfield	PERSON	's Letters '' of the let - ters to
Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	's godson published a few years ago by
Lord Carnarvon	PERSON	, and `` The Predecessors of Shakespeare '' of the work by the late
J. A. Sy	PERSON	- nionds .

		The latter of these reviews is somewhat
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 245 controversial in tone , and its animadversions upon
Symonds	PERSON	and his methods of composition are too heated to command unqualified assent ; yet there is no doubt that they are in part deserved , and that the interests of sanity demand an occasional protest against the critical extravagances that disfigure the works of what Mr.
Collins	PERSON	calls '' the new school of criticism . ''

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	here , as always , stands for sobriety and carefully-weighed judgments , and we are not sure that one may not catch from his pages a more finely-tempered enthusiasm for , say , Mar - lowe , than from the dithyrambic utterances of Sy - monds and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		The Chesterfield essay is interesting as a '' corrected impression . ''

		The letters to his godson made it fairly evident that their writer had been seriously misunderstood by the public , and Mr.
Collins	PERSON	, in his comments upon both series of letters , adduces much evidence to make good the claim that
Chesterfield	LOCATION	was by no means the apologist of vice and immorality that he is commonly taken to have been .

		As for the Theo - bald essay , its point of view may best be character - ized by its opening statement : '' It may be said with simple truth that no poet in our own or in any lan - guage has ever owed so great a debt to an editor as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	owes to this man . ''

		Introduction to the
Herbartian System	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of its kind , Dr.
Charles De Garmo	PERSON	's ''
Herbart	PERSON	and the Herbartians '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the most important book that has recently issued from the press .

		Within a few years , translations of several Herbartian books of merit have appeared , as
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's '' Psychology , ''
Lange	PERSON	's '' Apperception , ''
Ufer	PERSON	's '' Introduction , '' and others ; there have been also numerous original discussions , both articles and books , among which may be mentioned Dr. De Garmo 's own ''
Essen	LOCATION	- tials of Method '' ; but there has been no general introduction to the whole Herbartian System , and this void the present work worthily fills .

		Part I. deals with
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's contribution to education ; Part II .

		with the extension and application of
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's edu - cational ideas in
Germany	LOCATION	; Part III .

		with Her - bart 's ideas in
America	LOCATION	.

		The author is easily the first Herbartian authority in the country not the most enthusiastic , perhaps , but certainly the most comprehensive , even-minded , and judicious .

		While he is in accord with
Herbartism	PERSON	as a movement , or stream of tendency , he is by no means a stickler for everything that bears the label , or even an advocate of all the ideas that the creator of the school himself propounded .

		He discards , or at least ignores , much of
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's metaphysics in the outset , and steadily holds in view the pedagogical outcome of the sys - tem .

		He tells us that '' the system , after all , de - pends not upon the construction of abstract specu - lation , but upon verifiable facts and experience , '' and that `` to recognize the importance of
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's contribution to pedagogy , it is by no means neces - sary to accept his metaphysical presupposition as to the nature and original equipment of the soul . ''

		Whatever place this system may ultimately hold in pedagogical thought , there can be no doubt that at present it is attracting rapidly increasing attention ; and no competent judge will hesitate in pronounc - ing this work the very best general view of the sub - ject that has been written in the English language .

		It is the last volume of the well-known series , '' The Great Educators . ''

		Life and Essays of
G. W. Curtis	PERSON	.

		A collection of '' Literary and Social Essays '' by the late

Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , and Mr.
Edward Gary	PERSON	's life of Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	in the '' American Men of Letters '' series -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , appear at the same time , and enable us to test the one by the other .

		The biography tells of the social instincts , the mus - ical gifts , the artistic nature of the man ; while the essays , by their penetrating and sympathetic treat - ment of such different characters as
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Rachel	PERSON	,
O. W. Holmes	PERSON	, and
Washington Irving	LOCATION	, confirm the story .

		The biography reports Mr.
Cur	PERSON	- tis 's connection with
Emerson	PERSON	and
Brook Farm	ORGANIZATION	, thus adding to the interest of the three fine papers em - bodying personal reminiscences relating to
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	and
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		But perhaps the most charming of the essays is one , now published for the first time , having for its subject Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	.

		In reading this essay , we feel that much that Mr.
Cur	PERSON	- tis says of
Sidney	PERSON	might , with equal truth , have been said of himself .

		For example , this passage : ''
Sid	PERSON	- ney had that happy harmony of mind and temper , of enthusiasm and good-sense , of accomplishment and capacity , which is described by that most ex - quisite and most abused word , gentleman .

		A gen - tleman is not an idler , a trifler , a dandy ; he is not a scholar only , a soldier , a mechanic , a merchant ; he is the flower of men , in whom the accomplish - ment of the scholar , the bravery of the soldier , the skill of the mechanic , the sagacity of the merchant , all have their part and appreciation .

		A sense of duty is his main-spring , and , like a watch crusted with precious stones , his function is not to look pret - tily but to tell the time of day . ''

		This '' sense of duty as a main-spring '' is what impresses us most distinctly and firmly in the character of

		Did you ever hear the like of that , Amigo ' ? ''

		Mr.
Jebb	PERSON	's record remains as that of a brave and generous man , with the soul of a knight-errant and the guilelessness of a child , who , '' with all his opportunities , '' never did , or even contemplated , a mean or a doubtful act .

		As such , and as a tale of stirring adventure , the record is worth the reading .

		in - rii .

		,
England	LOCATION	01
Elizabeth	PERSON	and the same country under the rule of the infatuated sister whom she succeeded .

		The transition from the weakness and dissensions of the former period , when
England	LOCATION	had lost its prestige abroad and had degenerated into little else than a province of
Spain	LOCATION	, to the strength and vigor of
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's reign , which de - veloped the island kingdom into the most powerful and influential country in the world , is at first sight almost incomprehensible .

		Mr.
Allen B. Hinds	PERSON	, a scholar of
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, in his essay en - titled `` The England of Elizabeth '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has attempted to search out the causes of this mar - vellous reaction , so far as they may be found in the great religious movements which characterized the times .

		The first part of the book contains a history of those Protestants who fled from
England	LOCATION	in the beginning of
Mary	PERSON	's reign to seek refuge in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The author describes with consid - erable minuteness the unfortunate doctrinal dissen - sions which rent the exiles into a number of hostile factions , especially in
Frankfort	LOCATION	,
Geneva	LOCATION	, and Zu - rich .

		He then passes to
England	LOCATION	, and traces , in an interesting chapter , the growth of the new spirit there .

		The book , though small , has cost much pa - tient investigation and study , and is a really valu - able contribution to the religious history of the period .

		A short fits - The want of a concise , authorita - toryofthe tive history of the
British navy	ORGANIZATION	is satisfactorily met by Mr.
Hamilton Williams	PERSON	's ''
Britain	LOCATION	's Naval Power '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author is instructor in English literature to the naval cadets in H. M. S. '' Britannia . ''

		He has drawn largely upon the naval histories of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, South ey , and Yonge , as well as upon the later works of Mr.
Froude	PERSON	and Captain Ma - han , and has succeeded in `` boiling down '' and shaping his multifarious material into a readable and fairly comprehensive and continuous narrative of 250 pages .

		The book opens with the building of the first British fleet by
Alfred	PERSON	-LRB- the founder of
England	LOCATION	's historic `` wooden walls '' policy -RRB- , and closes with the crowning naval glory of Trafalgar .

		The American reader will object that the author 's cutting short of his narrative at this point savors more of patriotism than candor , since it ignores the war with this country in
1812	DATE	surely a consid - erable factor in the record , breaking in as it did rudely and disastrously upon the almost uninter - rupted tale of British maritime victory .

		In these
two and a half years	DATE	of naval war with the
United States	LOCATION	, English commerce was almost annihilated , and in fifteen out of eighteen engagements the once invincible royal navy was signally defeated .

		As the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' confessed , when the loss of the second royal frigate was announced , the '' sea spell '' of
Great Britain	LOCATION	was broken .

		But Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iams 's in most respects admirable little book is pri - marily meant for the young gentlemen of
Her Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's navy , who would scarcely relish or be in - spired by such episodes as the actions between the '' Constitution '' and the '' Guerriere , '' the '' United States '' and the '' Macedonian , '' the '' Hornet '' and ''
Peacock	PERSON	, '' etc. .

		The book is profusely and in - structively illustrated .

		It is a good sign that the book is entitled `` Way-Marks '' and not a `` way , '' `` road , '' or '' path . ''

		Three volumes have appeared .

		The first contains '' Select Chapters and Passages from ' The Wealth of
Nations	ORGANIZATION	' of
Adam Smith	PERSON	. ''

		About one-fifth of the entire work is given , includ - ing everything , the editor claims , '' that enters into the real structure of

Malthus	PERSON	's '' Essay on the Principle of Population , '' with a few added passages from the editions of
1807	DATE	and
1817	DATE	.

		The third volume gives us the first six chapters of Ricardo 's '' Principles of Political Economy and Taxation , '' forming about one-fourth of the whole treatise .

		The usefulness of these handy volumes should be very great .

		The three classical English writers who laid the foundations of economic science are still surprisingly vital and stimulating .

		It has become popular of late , especially among the meta - physical theorists and the historical economists , to speak slightingly and even patronizingly of these great men , but this , we trust , is only a transient phase of discussion .

		We are confident that in the not very distant future of economic thought we shall hear the cry of '' back to Ricardo , '' just as philosophy has heard the cry of '' back to Kant '' within the past decade or two .

		Such books as these which Professor
Ashley	PERSON	has edited will contribute to the emancipation of economic science from the vagaries that now have possession of a part of the field .

		Other volumes are promised for Mun , Child , Tur - got ,
Quesnai	LOCATION	, and
Roscher	PERSON	.

		It is therefore still exceptionally worthy the attention of military students the application of strategical principles being , as
Dufour	PERSON	says , '' the same at all times and places . ''

		Lieutenant Sargent writes mainly from the professional point of view .

		Each campaign is treated in a separate chapter , and to each chapter is appended a brief summary , critical and expository .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` The Book of the Rose '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the Rev.
A. Foster-Melliar	PERSON	, is designed '' to give , from an ama - teur , full details of practical culture for amateurs from the beginning to the end , '' '' to give such descriptions of the best known roses as should tell of their faults and bad habits as well as of their good qualities and perfections , '' and '' to make a readable as well as use - ful book . ''

		In all of these aims the author seems to have been successful , and , in spite of his modest depre - cation of any comparison between Dean Hole 's classic treatise and his own , we are inclined to think that the new book deserves a place by the side of the old .

		General
William Haines Lytle	PERSON	occupies a modest but assured place in American literature on the strength of a single poem , the exquisite lyric , ''
Antony	PERSON	and
Cleo	PERSON	- patra . ''

		It is not generally known that he was the author of a considerable amount of other verse , some of which , although it never caught the public ear , must be placed by the critic nearly if not quite upon the level of the piece which is so familiar .

		To collect the bulk of this work , and to introduce it with a sympathetic personal memoir , has been the task of Mr.
W. H. Venable	PERSON	, a task performed con amore , and that could not easily have fallen into more competent hands . ''

		Poems of
William Haines Lytle	PERSON	'' is the title of the book , which is pub - lished by the
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Joseph A. Willard	PERSON	, Clerk of the
Massachusetts Superior Court	ORGANIZATION	, has collected in a shapely volume of some 360 pages his recollections of '' Half a Century with Judges and Lawyers '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The stories , bon mots , witness-box humors , judicial obiter dicta , etc. , which fill the book are mainly of a humorous cast ; and while losing in print much of their pristine point and flavor , they will be found amusing , especially by mem - bers of the legal profession .

		The '' Dry burgh '' edition of the Waverley novels , some time since completed -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is now sup - plemented by a two - volume edition of Scott 's poems , uniform with the prose , except for the absence of illus - trations .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	is the editor , and in his introductory essay he contrives , as usual , to say the right and the happy thing at not too great length .

		There is little to choose between this edition and that edited a year or so ago by Professor
Norton	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's '' The Playground of
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is one of the classics of mountaineering , and a new edition of the work is welcome .

		The author has the following introductory note : '' In republishing these papers of a young gentleman , whom I shall regard with a certain interest , I have not felt myself at liberty 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, to make any serious corrections .

		He would possibly have denied the force of some critical remarks which to me appear very obvious ; and I do not know that my judgment would be superior to his .

		I have therefore left all faults of omission and commission in the repub - lished chapters . ''

		The author has , however , substituted three new chapters for the '' Eastern Carpathians , '' which he styles irrelevant , and for '' Alpine Dangers , '' which now seems to him obsolete .

		`` The
National School Library	ORGANIZATION	of Song '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Leo R. Lewis	PERSON	, '' will present , in a number of small volumes , musical material adapted to varied wants in upper grades of musical instruction in schools . ''

		The distinctive feature of the first volume , now at hand , is the collection of folk-songs from a score or more of nations .

		The educational value of such music is very great .

		We are particularly glad to find the Danish '' King Christian '' among these pieces .

		The other contents of the book are patriotic , devotional , and occasional songs .

		German texts for school use are not multiplied as rapidly as French ones , but several have been received of late . ''

		THE CLASSICAL , CONFERENCE AT
ANN ARBOR	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The meeting of classical teachers at
Ann Arbor	PERSON	, held on
March 27	DATE	and 28 , was quite fairly representative of the district included in the invitations that were issued .

		The Conference was due to the enthusiasm and energy of Professor Kelsey , of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, and the success of the affair must fully have met his expec - tations .

		College professors and high-school teachers of Greek and Latin were present in large numbers , from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and from Lake Superior to the
Ohio	LOCATION	; and the full and varied programme of pa - pers and discussions was carried through without delays or interruptions .

		The object of the Conference was twofold : '' First , to give to those doing work in
Latin	LOCATION	,
Greek	LOCATION	, and
Ancient History	ORGANIZATION	, an opportunity to present the results of re - search ; and , second , to discuss questions of fundamen - tal importance to the interests of classical study , par - ticularly in the Central and Western States . ''

		The first of these two objects was attained by the reading and discussion of more than thirty papers at the morning and afternoon sessions ; and the second , by the more formal and elaborate addresses delivered in the evenings .

		On
Wednesday	DATE
evening	TIME	the question '' Shall we have a six years ' High School Latin Course ? ''

		was discussed by
Professors West of Princeton	ORGANIZATION	and
Hale	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	, from the point of view of the university ; and by Mr.
A. F. Nightingale	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	, from the point of view of the high school .

		The speakers advocated the extension of the preparatory course in
Latin	LOCATION	, and their arguments met with general favor , though there was some opposi - tion .

		The introduction of Latin into the grammar grades was upheld as good for Latin itself ; as good for other language work , notably that in English and French ; and as tending to obliterate the sharp lines of distinction between the eighth and ninth grades of school work .

		Another interesting deliverance was the report of the committee appointed to consider the question '' What should be the preparation of those who purpose to teach Latin and Greek ? ''

		This committee , composed of a dozen professors and schoolmen , with Professor
Bennett	PERSON	of
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	as chairman , unanimously reported the fol - lowing resolution , which the Conference as unanimously adopted : '' Resolved , that this
Conference	ORGANIZATION	desires to express its sense of the importance of a thorough training for teach - ers in all grades of classical instruction .

		Especially does it urge adequate preparation for the work of secondary instruction .

		The instructor should know much more than he is called upon to impart to his pupils .

		In the high school , the ideal teacher of the classics will be one who has not only specialized in these branches as under - graduate and graduate , but who also , by instinct and training , possesses the enthusiasm to add constantly to past attainment by new study . ''

		The sessions of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	had a brilliant finale on
Thursday	DATE
evening	TIME	, in the masterly address of Pro- fessor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, on '' The Classics in Modern Education , '' to which nothing short of a verbatim report could do justice .

		This was followed by the Hymn to Apollo recently discovered at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, explained by Professor D'Ooge , and magnifi - cently sung by Professor
Lamson	PERSON	, both of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Michigan	LOCATION	.

		The significance and results of this important educa - tional gathering are of course difficult to estimate .

		In setting up high standards of instruction , in awakening new enthusiasm , and in binding the teachers of classics by new and strong ties of sympathy , it was worth all that it cost .

		They also announce a volume on '' The English Versions of the Bible , '' by the Rev.
B. Condit	PERSON	, and one on '' The Signers of the
Decla	PERSON	- ration , '' by Mr.
N. Dwight	PERSON	.

		The publication of a quarterly review of historical studies , under the auspices of a committee represent - ing half a dozen of our leading universities , appears to be practically assured .

		Harvard and
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	broached the subject , and , at a meeting of those interested , called in
New York	LOCATION	for
April 6	DATE	, a board of editors was ap - pointed , and plans laid for securing the necessary finan - cial support .

		In the days of Old
Japan	LOCATION	, before the canny islanders saw themselves as others saw them ,
Townsend Harris	PERSON	, the first American envoy , lived at
Shimoda	PERSON	and Yedo , from
1856	DATE	to

		He kept a journal of his strange experiences and wonderful successes .

		This , edited by Dr.
William Elliot Griffis	PERSON	, with a portrait and biogra - phy , will be published by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Literary School '' of the
Chicago Kindergarten College	ORGANIZATION	is now engaged upon its eighth annual course of lectures .

		Myths '' is the general subject of discus - sion , a subject treated broadly enough to permit of such papers as '' Theology and Literature , '' by Dr.
H. W. Thomas	PERSON	; '' Folk-Lore Legends and Tales , '' by Professor
Frederick Starr	PERSON	; and '' Nature and Culture , '' by Mr.
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	.

		The lectures close on the twentieth of
April	DATE	.

		Among the very last letters written by Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	was a short one to a literary friend , referring in com - plimentary terms to this journal .

		This letter having occasioned considerable comment by its appearance in the poet 's '' Life and Letters '' with the name of the journal referred to by Mr.
Whittier	PERSON	omitted , we are enabled , through the courtesy of the owner of the letter , to present an interesting facsimile of it elsewhere in this issue .

		It was written only about three weeks before the author 's death .

		We learn from the '' Athenaeum '' that Mr.
Mackenzie Bell	PERSON	is writing a book on
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, which will be largely a critical study based on a detailed survey of her work .

		The opening chapter will contain some biograph - ical information and personal reminiscences ; while sub - sequent chapters will be devoted respectively to her general poems , her religious poems , her books for chil - dren , and her religious prose volumes .

		In the conclud - ing chapter an attempt will be made to estimate her place as a writer .

		Mr.
Bell	PERSON	's intention is to make his book popular enough to become to some readers an in - troduction to
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	both as poet and prose writer .

		Our valued contributor Dr.
Fitzedward Hall	PERSON	has in the last '' Academy '' a further communication upon Americanisms , from which we make this excerpt : '' The interest which Americans of the better sort take in the subject of Americanisms is attested by their books de - voted to them , and notably by the dictionaries of Mr.
Bartlett	PERSON	and Professor De Vere .

		Unhappily , however , among those for whose benefit they were intended , there are three classes , out of four , for whom they have been compiled either to no purpose or to very little .

		One of these three classes , which embraces a large portion of the enormous mob connected with the despicable and detestable newspaper-press , while chiefly originating Americanisms , actually revels in them .

		Another class , in - cluding an overwhelming majority of the population , regards them with absolute indifference .

		The third class , in which come , with others , the generality of pro- fessional authors , cares to eschew only such of them as are tabooed by tolerably refined society .

		Far otherwise , the members of the fourth class , comparatively a very small one , strive industriously to acquire passable En - glish ; and , if due allowance is made for their unavoid - ably hearing and reading the most abominable jargon every day of their lives , it may be acknowledged that their efforts to express themselves like civilized beings are rewarded with as much success as could be expected .

		Such persons , if corrected , one by another , for Amer - icanizing unnecessarily , are always very thankful .

		And they are , certainly , quite as thankful , if the same serv - ice is done them , with ordinary courtesy , by an English - man .

		That it should be done by him , as so often hap - pens , with the contumely and invidious reflections which are hardly earned except by filching a purse or spheter - izing a neighbour 's spoons , seems , however , to an Amer - ican , disproportionate . ''

		The Female Offender .

		By Professor
LOMBROSO	PERSON	.

		Illus - trated .

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The study of criminal tendencies is occupying advanced stu - dents throughout the world , but the science has been carried further by the Italian school of criminologists than by any other scientists .

		The influences of heredity , the psychological study of criminals , the mutual relations of offenders and so - ciety , the measures which society should adopt , and other aspects of the problem , are treated in these books by the most advanced students of the subject .

		This series embodies the most interesting and suggestive results of extended investiga - tions .

		The subject is dealt with from the scientific , not from the purely philanthropic , point of view , but the conclusions must necessarily form the basis for humanitarian endeavor .

		In `` The Female Offender '' we see the manner in which Lombroso applies the anthropological method .

		He examines whether , and to what extent , the female criminal differs from the average woman in bodily and mental characteristics .

		As a result of this examination he arrives at many interesting conclusions as to the personal or individual conditions which are calculated to turn women into offenders against criminal law .

		277 THE IBSEN LEGEND .

		One of the most curious chapters of literary history is that which deals with the greatest of Roman poets as he appeared to the imagination of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		The Master Virgil of mediaevalism stands out as a vivid enough fig - ure , exerting a marked influence upon the cur - rent of mediaeval thought ; yet how unlike the personality of the Mantuan as he appears to us , with our fuller knowledge of classical times , and the truer intellectual perspective of our view .

		It was a singular refraction , indeed , that shaped the outlines of the poet into the dis - torted figure of the wizard , a strange limitation of outlook that in so literal a sense made of his name a word with which to conjure , while blind to his genius and its true significance .

		Books have their fates , runs the Latin saying , and pre - sumably their authors no less .

		But never was the fate of bookman more ironical than that of the poet of the '' JEueid '' and the '' Fourth Eclogue , '' envisaged , a thousand years after his death , as an allegorist and a wonder-worker .

		It is a far cry , in more ways than one , from
Virgil	LOCATION	to Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, and there is but a single fact that could lead us even for a moment to couple their names .

		That fact is the preva - lence and seemingly continued growth , at least in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, of an Ibsen legend , grotesquely divergent from the truth , and cal - culated to make of the Norwegian poet and dra - matist a figure as unlike his real self as Master
Virgil	PERSON	was unlike the poet who chiefly made glorious the Augustan Age .

		Our newspapers , and even some of our serious organs of opinion , afford frequent indications that the popular consciousness holds Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	to be the poet of gloom , of the morbid aspects of character , of the seamy side of life and the unsavory among human relations .

		A German sensation - alist , long discredited , but whose latest work is just now getting much attention , finds in Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	a conspicuous illustration of what he calls Entartung .

		A typical newspaper article just now under our eye , an article of the bet - ter sort and evidently written in all seriousness , calls him '' grim '' and '' egotistical , '' speaks of his '' icy indifference , '' his '' dank philosophy , '' and his '' intolerable pessimism . ''

		No one who does much reading in current criticism can 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
May	DATE	l r have failed more than once to come across even the suggestion that he deliberately panders to the lower instincts of human nature , that he revels in what is revolting and unclean .

		Anyone who has read the writings of Dr.
Ib	ORGANIZATION	- sen , and who knows something of the aims and ideals that they embody , rubs his eyes in won - derment when he meets with such epithets and opinions as have just been mentioned .

		But when amazement at the misconception has a lit - tle abated , he is apt to ask himself if there is any possible way of accounting for the origin of opin - ions so grotesque , unless , indeed , he summarily sets them down as adding another to the many existing illustrations of the essential irrationality of the majority of minds .

		The last count of the indictment above outlined may safely be left to shift for itself .

		There is no shred of evidence for it , and no sane mind could for a moment seriously entertain the suggestion .

		Nor is it without reluctance that we so far consider the poet 's '' icy indifference - '' as to recall the infi - nite tenderness of '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt , '' or illustrate his '' dank philosophy '' by the pas - sionate idealism of '' Love 's Comedy '' and '' Emperor and Galilean . ''

		The reader is to be pitied , indeed , who is not stirred to the depths of his soul by the agonies of Brand as child and wife are taken from him one after the other , or by that vision of the '' third kingdom '' which , in the story of
Julian	LOCATION	, casts its mystical glamour over the last struggle of dying paganism , and which might have been inspired by the choruses of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's Hellas . ''

		The last of these illustrations leads us to the subject upon which more than a word or a ref - erence is needed .

		Of all the charges commonly made against Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, that of pessimism is probably the most persistent .

		This is not sur - prising when we consider the ignorant way in which that term is bandied about by most peo - ple , yet here , if ever , the accusation calls for an energetic protest .

		Pessimism is both a mood and a philosophical doctrine .

		Whatever standing it has , considered in its latter aspect , it owes to the authority of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, who , by logic convincing at least to himself , thought he had demonstrated the soul of things to be evil , believed irremediable suffering to lie at the root of conscious existence .

		To this doc - trine the whole of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's work is tacitly but resolutely opposed .

		He never presents to us the gloomy side of life without suggesting the possibility of something better , rarely without indicating the way out of what seems an im - passe to the soul of little faith .

		So far from preaching evil as irremediable , he constantly ascribes it to lack of knowledge , infirmity of vision , and weakness of will .

		If there is any one trait dominant above all others throughout his writings , it is the persistent note of an idealism unshaken by '' The absurdity of men , Their vaunts , their feats , '' an idealism as absolutely opposed as anything well can be to the philosophical doctrine of pes - simism .

		If Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	is to be styled a pes - simist in this sense , it must be in the company of all the satirists , ancient and modern , who have scourged the vices of mankind , and all the moralists who have discerned the good life and sought to bring about its realization in fact no less than in dream .

		Of pessimism as a mood it may be said that Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	exhibits it as it has been exhibited by greater men than he , from Homer to Ten - nyson , by a large proportion , in fact , of the greatest poets that have ever lived .

		This merely means that he does not , like such men as
Brown	PERSON	- ing and
Emerson	PERSON	, deliberately exclude from his view a large share of the facts of human life , that he is not content to build for himself a fool 's paradise and dwell therein .

		He is not to be deluded by '' The barren optimistic sophistries Of comfortable moles , '' and endeavors , according to the light that is in him , to see life steadily and see it whole .

		Like all writers of the second or third rank , he has his limitations , and his vision is defective ; but to describe his prevalent mood as pessimistic , or even as cynical , is grossly to pervert the truth .

		The principal reasons for the current mis - conception of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's fundamental attitude towards life may be briefly set forth .

		In the first place , much of his work is satirical , and this fact , combined with his power of express - ing the white heat of indignation , naturally makes many people think that only one at heart a cynic could find so much to condemn in the conduct and the ideals of his fellow-men .

		In the second place , his work is nearly all dramatic in form , and dramatists always suffer from a more or less unconscious identification with the characters of their own creation , however ob - jectively conceived .

		Last of all , and most im - portant as far as the English-speaking public is concerned , he unfortunately first became known , and is still chiefly known , by means of a group of his least characteristic and enduring works .

		Most people get their whole notion of him from a group of three or four plays which deal with extremely narrow and specific social
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 problems , which are utterly inadequate to con - vey his essential message , and which embody no suggestion of the high poetic energy with which his really great work is charged .

		It is not altogether surprising that the '' Ibsen legend '' should find credence with readers who know only `` A Doll Home , '' `` Ghosts , '' ''
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	, '' and '' Solness . ''

		To such , and to all who would know what Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	really stands for , we proffer the advice to read '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt , '' those master - pieces of robust social philosophy and high eth - ical aim .

		Their invigorating moral atmosphere has the tonic quality of which our flabby civili - zation is most in need ; their lofty idealism may well put to shame our opportunism , our half - heartedness , and all the paltry conventionalities by which our lives are misshapen .

		And we ven - ture to say that whoever once takes those works to heart will hardly thereafter describe their au - thor as a pessimist , or talk glibly of his '' icy indifference '' and his '' dank philosophy . ''

		For such readers , at least , the '' Ibsen legend '' will be at once consigned to the limbo to which grown-up men and women relegate the nursery tales and pious fables that were literally ac - cepted in childhood , but that can not impose upon the rationalized adult intelligence .

		JAMES
DWIGHT DANA	ORGANIZATION	.

		The death , on the fourteenth of
April	DATE	, of the veteran geologist
James Dwight Dana	PERSON	, made American science the poorer by one of its most illustrious representatives .

		Professor
Dana	PERSON	was born in
1813	DATE	, at
Utica	LOCATION	, N. Y .

		He entered
Yale	ORGANIZATION	at sixteen , attracted by
Silliman	PERSON	's fame , and after being graduated with the class of
1833	DATE	, spent two years in the government service as a mathematical instructor of midshipmen , visiting many parts of the world with the ships to which he was assigned .

		On his return from these journeyings , he became
Silliman	PERSON	's as - sistant at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and prepared the '' System of Miner - alogy , '' which appeared in
1837	DATE	.

		The year following , he started to circumnavigate the globe with the
Wilkes	PERSON	expedition , the voyage lasting four years .

		During these years , he took charge of the expedition departments of geology , mineralogy , and zoology , and made many val - uable collections .

		The thirteen years following his re - turn were chiefly occupied in preparing for publication the scientific results of his journey .

		The subjects of the volumes resulting -LRB- printed by the government -RRB- were '' Zoophytes , '' '' Crustacea , '' and '' Geology of the Pa - cific . ''

		In
1844	DATE	he settled for life in
New Haven	LOCATION	, and married Miss
Henrietta Frances Silliman	PERSON	, who survives him .

		His late publications include ''
Coral Reefs	LOCATION	and Islands , '' '' The Geological Story Briefly Told , '' and the much revised '' Manual of Geology '' which has been our standard text-book of the subject for the past thirty years .

		The life record just closed is one of singular industry , achievement , and honor ; the place he has va - cated in our intellectual life will not easily be filled .

		THE SPECTRAL PUBLISHER .

		It seems to me that if I could lay the spectral head which comes between me and the paper , I should write with a swing and verve that would please the reader as much as it would myself .

		There are sea - sons when I can not write at all ; and then I evoke , but in vain , the spectral publisher .

		He only ap - pears when I am in the mood for work .

		Some - times it is one whom I have known ; at others , a stranger ; and I see , whichever it be , only a head with fixed eyes , and lips apart and formed as if about to pronounce that depressing word '' No . ''

		He it is who is responsible for my evasive and pedes - trian style .

		With his eye upon me I halt at every sentence and consider what he will say , when I ought to be thinking what I have to say .

		When he motions me to be laconic , I become diffuse ; when he commands , '' Now keep in touch with cur - rent times and the general reader , '' I grow at once obscure and wander off into the classics .

		If he chances to look away for a moment , to forget me , I recover myself and write with that abandonment I so much admire .

		Then ideas write themselves ; images come without effort .

		Thus is my spectral publisher the destroyer of the genius which he seeks to discover and introduce to the world .

		But some say the publisher is merely the agent of the public ; that he buys what he can sell ; that the producer that is , the author must conform himself to the market , to the consumer of his wares .

		How this is to be done , and at the same time per - mit an author to keep his intellectual integrity and develop what is within him , is the problem of litera - ture .

		Plenty there are who seem now and in the past td have solved this problem .

		They glide easily into notice with their first book .

		Is there an astute publisher behind them ?

		Or are they so fortunately constituted as to be themselves the counterparts , the reflex public , whom they address ?

		thus quite un - consciously gaining the ear and winning the ap - plause of their readers .

		Success thus achieved is apt to repeat itself .

		It is then that the publisher and the public often seem more responsible for the volumes which follow than the author himself .

		A demand is made upon him temptations from the publisher , the expectancy of readers , and under this stimulus he goes on to further triumphs , or to extinguishment , according to the fertility or poverty of his genius .

		A few successes , often a single one , reverse the positions of author and publisher ; the author becomes master of the situation , the pub - lisher the eager purchaser .

		It is at this point that the author gains his intellectual freedom , if before he has not quite dared to exercise it .

		He can now more energetically say what he thinks , and more freely give form to his feelings , his experiences , and insights .

		He preaches from a pulpit , declaims from the rostrum , espouses reforms , dabbles in philoso - phy , art , and criticism .

		He establishes a sort of confessional , for at least one sex , and either covertly or boldly absolves the woman with a past .

		262 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Is his sense of responsibility at such a point equal to his sense of intellectual freedom ?

		For to him now this question must be addressed , and not to the pub - lisher , who will print without other thought than how many editions may be sold .

		Is he now at lib - erty to controvene the accepted ideas of morality and religion , to assume as established the psycholog - ical phenomena at present only in the most elemen - tary stage of investigation as , for instance , in the case of hypnotism ?

		For I find some readers of re - cent fiction take for granted all its hypnotic ma - chinery as well-established scientific fact .

		The wild and improbable elements in novels carry their own correction , if they chance to need any ; it is not so with speculations on religion , socialism , and adven - tures into the border lands of spiritism .

		It is the author who is responsible , for the publisher 's hand is hidden in the mere mercantile transactions which accompany publication .

		But to the author struggling for recognition the publisher is spectral and formidable , especially to those who are doomed to acquire a hearing only af - ter a slow and laborious career .

		Holding fast to their own genius and style , they work on in obscur - ity for a long time unnoticed , or misunderstood , as was the fate of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		But he had to sustain himself on an income of about twelve hundred dol - lars and infinite patience and faith .

		His books for a long time brought him nothing .

		How they got themselves printed is a mystery .

		Perhaps publish - ers were less spectral and mercenary then than now .

		Mrs.
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	, who might be called a fairly successful writer , received from her five books an income of about a hundred dollars a year .

		She maintained herself chiefly by magazine work , being always and everywhere a welcome contributor .

		Mr.
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	said , in his admirable ad - dress at the recent
Stevenson	PERSON	memorial service , that '' work of the first order can not remain obscure '' ; and added , `` if put forth unheralded it will be found out and will make its way . ''

		There is no doubt of it ; and yet there is a terrible if in the way how to get '' work of the first order '' before the public '' unheralded . ''

		Where to-day is the publisher who will venture upon so daring an under - taking ?

		For this prophecy of `` making its way '' means time , capital , and , withal , exceeding fine dis - cernment and much faith .

		What , then , is to become of those writers who have not the gift or the good luck to make a sensa - tion at once , yet who have talent of a high order , perhaps genius even ?

		who work slowly , carefully , conscientiously ?

		The question is too difficult ; and it seems to be something else than publishers , or even readers to any large extent , that help in bring - ing forward such writers .

		It may be said that poets and other imaginative writers save each other .

		The best discovers the best and preserves it ; and in time , having the sanction of such authority , though limited to the few , it attains to wider and wider form .

		But the first requisite namely , how to get work of the first order into print remains at this time unanswerable .

		Courage and patience for ye , obscure , unacknowledged geniuses .

		Remember
Haydon	PERSON	's advice to
John Keats	PERSON	: '' Do not despair ; collect incident , study character , read
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and trust in
Providence	LOCATION	. ''

		Or read
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Gleam , '' where he for the first and only time , un - der a thin veil , records all the steps of his own ca - reer , and , whatever his impediments , whether snarls of critics or indifference of the public , whether self - despair , long periods of inactivity , loss of friends , and sufferings from without and within , at the end of all the experiences of life has but this one courageous , inspiring refrain : '' Follow the Gleam . ''

		THE CLAIMS OF SCIENCE IN EDUCATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I confess to a good deal of amazement and regret upon reading the editorial on '' Educational Values '' in the last number of THE DIAL ; not that objection should be made to any man 's candid expression of preference for any class of studies , but that he should think it necessary or convincing to use such expressions as '' husks of science '' and the like .

		If the taste for scien - tific study is on the wane , and '' hungry souls '' are call - ing '' for more generous and vitalizing forms of nutri - tion '' to such an extent as the editorial mentioned appears to imply , it seems necessary to explain the increased facilities everywhere provided for the cultivation of sci - ence , and for the increased number of students seeking instruction in science .

		It is unfair in the highest degree to say that the advocates of science are the advocates of the narrowly practical or '' the bread-and-butter policy '' in education .

		Such a characterization scarcely applies to instruction even in technical schools .

		If I have ob - served the signs of the times to any purpose of late , the advocates of a narrow and one-sided policy in edu - cation are not the teachers of science .

		They -LRB- the lat - ter -RRB- are advocating a broad foundation for university study , with a large predominance of language ; but they are not willing to stand by and see the pursuit of pure science , which is as humanistic as that of language itself , characterized as a training for the mere purpose of get - ting a living .

		It is well to bear in mind the fact that the methods of teaching developed by teachers of sci - ence have been adopted by almost if not quite all de - partments of study .

		The powerful influence of science upon our pedagogical practice should not be forgotten in any estimate of '' Educational Values . ''


HENRY S. CARHART	PERSON	.

		University of
Michigan	LOCATION	,
April 19 , 1895	DATE	.

		-LSB- Twenty-five years ago , the demands of science for a larger recognition in educational curricula than had hitherto been accorded it were in the main just , and we do not begrudge its advocates the suc - cess of their efforts .

		But the claims made , how - ever just in themselves , were often urged upon the grounds -LRB- indefensible from a purely educational
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 263 standpoint -RRB- of mere practicality , and were usually coupled with ill-natured and ignorant attacks upon humanistic training .

		In other words a needed ed - ucational reform was urged in a spirit anything but commendable , and that spirit has ever since char - acterized a large proportion of the discussions of the subject by men of science .

		The intolerance of the new scientific education has become every whit as bad as the intolerance , which we freely admit , of the old humanistic discipline .

		Nor can we re - gard as an unmixed blessing the fact that '' the methods of teaching developed by teachers of science have been adopted by almost if not quite all depart - ments of study . ''

		In history and literature , in psy - chology and the classics , there is now something too much , relatively speaking , of the scientific methods referred to .

		The really serious student of science undoubtedly gets educational discipline of a high character from his work , and scientific work is doubt - less undertaken by many students for educational rather than for practical reasons ; bilt the Philistine attitude toward science and the humanities still pre - vails in many quarters , and against it alone were directed the remarks to which our correspondent takes exception .

		We are free , however , to add our opinion that of late years science has been getting from the educators rather more than its due , and this at the expense of those pursuits which we be - lieve should ever occupy the foremost place in the work of shaping to its highest uses the human soul .


EDR	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE UTILITY OF AN AUTHORS ' GUILD .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read with interest the statement of the plans and purposes of the
American Authors ' Guild	ORGANIZATION	, as set forth by its officers in your last issue ; and while I am not insensible to the claim which may justly be made upon every man by his profession , and am heartily in sympathy with many of the objects of the
Guild	ORGANIZATION	, it seems to me that a word of caution or remonstrance may be in order as to one phase of the purposes of the society .

		Authors should not expect too much of the ability of such an organization to help them practically in their relations with publishers .

		Inexperienced au - thors especially will be likely to overestimate the ad - vantages to be derived from it in this respect .

		I could scarcely conceive myself , as an author , invoking the aid of such a society in a dispute or disagreement with a publisher .

		And I am not without my own bit of experi - ence of what such disagreements may be having known what it is to be deliberately '' bunkoed '' by one pub - lisher , while treated by another with an unfairness , in the handling of one of my books , which resulted in in - jury that could scarcely be condoned or repaired .

		But I suppose one must either stand such things , or seek whatever of relief and reparation the law may allow .

		I do not see how the sympathy or mutual indignation of an Authors ' Society could help the matter much .

		It seems to me that such things must be settled , like other business affairs , by the individual on his own basis .

		A protective association for looking after the business in - terests of authors savors a little too much of '' paternal - ism '' to suit my taste .

		Besides as a very practical consideration may not such a society tend to antago - nize publishers as a class , and in this way work a cer - tain disadvantage to its members ?

		May there not be seen in it an implication that publishers as a class are men who , to put it mildly , will '' bear watching '' ?

		and is not such an implication one that the many honorable members of the publishing trade would naturally be in - clined to resent , and thus an antagonism be created be - tween publishers and members of the society , which might be , to say the least , unfortunate ?

		This seems but human nature .

		Experience has shown me that this matter , like most others in our tangled modern life , is not one-sided .

		If there are dishonest or unfair or blun - dering publishers , so there are unreasonable and imprac - ticable and pestering authors .

		Better not , it seems to me , array the two classes or crafts against each other as natural or necessary adversaries .

		I am aware that much is claimed for the good results of the
London	LOCATION	Authors ' Society , of similar character and aims ; and it certainly speaks well for it that it includes in its membership the foremost living English men of letters .

		But the statement of what has been accom - plished by the
London	LOCATION	society may perhaps be taken with some allowance in the absence of anything from the publishers ' side of the case ; and , besides , the con - ditions in our new country are widely different from those that have long existed in
England	LOCATION	.

		My final thought is that the American society can be made suc - cessful only by including in its membership the leading and most influential authors of our country ; and this the Authors ' Guild seems thus far not to have accom - plished .

		A real and representative Society of Authors is no doubt a good thing , and such I supposed we had in the
Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		But a Society of Authors-with-a - grievance is a different matter ; and this , in my judg - ment , is what the American Authors ' Guild should strive not to become .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Since reading the prospectus of the '' American Au - thors ' Guild , '' in your issue of
April 16	DATE	, 1 have chanced to see two pamphlets issued by the Guild , containing its latest reports ; and a perusal of these astonishing publications awakens chiefly a curiosity to know what one of the
American Authors	ORGANIZATION	in the
Guild	ORGANIZATION	is responsi - ble for its literature .

		I find , for example , that a recent report of the Secretary '' was read and laid on the table , owing to its violation of certain technical rules . ''

		An - other curious parliamentary proceeding was that a mem - ber '' was asked to take the chair until the officers could be reflected for the remainder of their term .

		This was done . ''

		Among the complaints offered was one from a member who alleged that '' a trade journal had not paid him '' for an article '' accepted by them . ''

		Another mem - ber related how '' a publishing house which had agreed to publish his book '' had at last been forced to '' a ful - filment of their contract '' with him .

		Further encour - agement was afforded by the reading of '' a letter from Mrs. A. , now in
England	LOCATION	, who had seen Mr.
Besant	PERSON	, and that Mr.
Besant	PERSON	wished , '' etc. .

		A member '' offered a resolution that a pamphlet be prepared , and to have one thousand copies printed . ''

		It is to be hoped that before the new pamphlet appears the
American Authors	ORGANIZATION	will have provided themselves with an editor .

		264 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, FAB EASTERN PICTURES AND PROBLEMS .

		* In his '' The Peoples and Politics of the Far East , '' Mr.
Henry Norman	PERSON	presents the results of four years of study , travel , and adventure in
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
Korea	LOCATION	,
Siberia	LOCATION	,
Malaya	LOCATION	, and the British , French , Spanish , and Portuguese Ori - ental colonies .

		The book seems to us decidedly the best one on the subject since Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	's ; and we especially commend it to all who have been racking their brains of late in the effort to extract the rationale of current
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	ques - tions from the newspapers .

		The ground covered by the volume is too extensive and the treatment too detailed to admit of anything like a com - plete summary of it here ; hence we shall con - fine ourselves to those chapters which seem of most immediate interest .

		Mr.
Norman	PERSON	is at especial pains to set forth what he conceives to be the truth about that hugely miscalculated factor in international problems , the
Chinese Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now that the bubble blown by
Marquis Tseng	PERSON	has been pricked by the sword of
Japan	LOCATION	, and the '' sleep - ing leviathan of the Orient '' has proved to be a mere paper dragon with nothing formidable about it , it is hard to realize that a year ago
China	LOCATION	ranked as a
Great Power	ORGANIZATION	, was Kotowed to by other
Great Powers	ORGANIZATION	, and was even in - vested by the Western fancy with certain vague terrors of her own , boding and mysterious , a legacy of the days of Attila and
Jenghiz Khan	PERSON	.

		When , at the outbreak of the present war , it was announced that each Chinese province was called on for a levy of 20,000 men , the illusion grew .

		Nineteen times 20,000 is 380,000 ; and the timid reader , aghast at these figures and inspired by such political Jeremiahs as Mr.
Charles Pearson	PERSON	, at once figured to himself a host like that of
Tamerlane	LOCATION	sweeping before it the forces of the Mikado like drift before the blast , and then -LRB- obedient to the prophetic Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	-RRB- rolling westward , swelled by the countless hordes of the Yellow Race , to over - run the world and bring on a new interregnum of barbarism .

		As usual , the unexpected has happened .

		Huge
China	LOCATION	, with her 350,000,000 of people , has been soundly and summarily drubbed by little
Japan	LOCATION	, with her 40,000,000 .

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		She has not made even a decent show of re - sistance ; and the lurid Pearsonian dream of a new Mongol invasion of
Europe	LOCATION	has vanished in thin air .

		Without dwelling on events now familiar to the world , it may be interesting to note some of the ways in which
China	LOCATION	has prepared herself for defeat .

		Underlying the more specific causes of it are the following general ones : inbred and fanatical conservatism and consequent stag - nation ; a competitive system which imposes proficiency in the Chinese classics as the uni - versal standard of fitness for office ; lack of racial and territorial unity , there being , says Mr.
Norman	PERSON	, virtually `` no such thing as *
China	LOCATION	' '' ; organic corruption in the public es - tablishments every Chinese official , '' with the possible exception of one in a thousand , '' being as it were ex officio , '' a liar , a thief , and a ty - rant . ''

		The proximate cause of
China	LOCATION	's defeat by
Japan	LOCATION	is of course the worthlessness of her army .

		This perhaps hollowest of all the mani - fold shams of the
Flowery Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	is , as both Mr.
Norman	PERSON	and Mr.
Curzon	PERSON	testify , a half - organized mob of spiritless , lash-driven coolies and uncontrolled savages , armed largely with flint-locks , battle-axes , spears , giugals , bows , gongs , and the like curio-shop rarities , and offi - cered by literati , versed in the lore of Confu - cius and the primary official arts of picking and stealing , but as ignorant as their men of the specific duties of their calling .

		The army more - over is largely a figment .

		Touching the provin - cial levies noted above , Mr.
Norman	PERSON	says : '' The newspaper reader might perhaps not be ex - pected to know that the Emperor of
China	LOCATION	could as easily raise 20,000 men in Mars as in some of his prov - inces ; that it would not be difficult to enlist a consider - able force in one part of
China	LOCATION	to attack another part ; that absolutely no organization exists in
China	LOCATION	for the handling of such masses ; that the men would find themselves without uniforms , without arms , without food , without the most rudimentary knowledge of war , without leaders of any description whatever ; or that a huge army of the kind in the neighborhood of the cap - ital would be almost certain to seize the opportunity to upset the present alien government . ''

		Matters are naturally no better in the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, where the same ridiculous standard of fitness prevails .

		The high-grade naval officer need not necessarily know a sextant from a cathead , or even be capable of boxing the compass ; but he must be well up in the classics .

		He may know little or nothing of Kaper or
Bowditch	LOCATION	, but he must know his Confucius .

		The appoint - ment of the renowned Admiral Ting , for in - stance , seems to have been made largely on grounds which , had the British Government
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 265 looked to
China	LOCATION	for naval precedents , would have warranted it in putting , say , Professor
Jowett	PERSON	in command of the
Mediterranean Squadron	LOCATION	.

		The learned Ting , by-the-bye , is the hero of the famous story of the Chinese Ad - miral who was found one day playing pitch - and-toss , or its Oriental equivalent , on the floor of the Admiral 's cabin with his sentry .

		A few scattered facts noted here by our author speak volumes as to the general condition of the Chinese war establishments .

		He says : '' I was once being shown by a naval officer over one of their two biggest ironclads , which was on a cruise at the time , and presumably in first-rate order .

		I noticed a gun carefully protected in a canvas cover .

		As we passed it , I asked casually what it was .

		The offi - cer explained with pride that it was a new quick-firing gun , and called a quartermaster to remove the cover - ing .

		The order was obeyed with evident reluctance , and when the gun was at length exposed it proved to be used by one of the watches as a receptacle for their * chow , ' and was filled with chop-sticks and littered with rice and pickles . ''

		From a foreign instructor Mr.
Norman	PERSON	got a few significant facts as to the regime on board a Chinese ironclad .

		In reply to an inquiry when his ship would sail , the instructor said : '' ' The only way we really know when we are to sail is by the Admiral coming on board .

		He leaves the ship as soon as we come into port , and we never see him again until we sail .

		He knows nothing at all about naval matters he is just the Mandarin put on board by Li .

		... I have seen him gambling here on the quarter-deck with a common seaman , and when he has won all his money he '11 tell the paymaster to advance him some more , so that he can go on playing ... The only men on board that could really do anything are these young fellows , and they have no power at all .

		They fought against the French and got nothing at all for it just a few dollars , and were told to take them - selves off .

		The rings on the big Krupps are beginning to open out already , and if there is the least dirt or sand you ca n't shut them . ' '

		Then I suppose , ' I said , * that no
European Squadron	ORGANIZATION	need be afraid of the
Pei	PERSON	- yang Squadron yet ? ' '

		No fear , sir , it is only a ques - tion who will get them as prizes , ' was the reply . ''

		Such facts render the '' Pall Mall Gazette '' account of a Chinese warship sailing for the Yalu minus one of its guns , which the com - mander had pawned , credible enough .

		A good story illustrative of the methods of Chinese officialdom dates back to the French war : '' While the French fleet was off Tamsui , the 27-centi - metre
Krupp	ORGANIZATION	guns in one of the shore batteries had been trained upon the Gallisoniere at 1,000 yards range for several days .

		At the first French shot all the Chinese artillerymen fled , except one , who succeeded in discharging three guns before a shot struck him and blew his head off .

		One of the shells he fired pierced the ship and remained imbedded in the woodwork , fail - ing to explode .

		The vessel went to
Hongkong	LOCATION	, where with infinite precautions the shell was removed and opened .

		It had been manufactured at the
Foochow Arsenel	PERSON	, and contained charcoal !

		The maker had , of course , been paid for gunpowder and had pocketed the difference . '' ''

		The more one learns about
China	LOCATION	, '' says Mr.
Norman	PERSON	, '' the less confident become one 's opinions about it '' the first result of experi - ence being to teach that any sweeping general - ization about the country is almost necessarily untrue .

		To the Western mind every individ - ual Chinamen seems a mass of contradictions .

		His ways are not our ways , and his motives are not our motives ; and the moment we attempt to explain him and account for his conduct on purely Western theories we are at sea .

		Take , for example , the difference of views upon a single point human life .

		Mr.
Norman	PERSON	relates that a foreign resident of Peking riding through the streets one day came upon a crowd of natives .

		Drawing near , he found them passively watch - ing a man who was trying to commit suicide by beating his head against a wall .

		Inquiry disclosed the fact that the man was a coolie who , claiming that his wages for a certain job were short by ten cash -LRB- about two cents -RRB- , was proceeding to revenge himself on his employer by dashing out his own brains .

		Another in - stance is told of a man who , on a like provoca - tion , threw himself into a canal , but -LRB- mirabile dictu -RRB- was pulled out by the bystanders . ''

		So he simply sat down on the edge and starved himself to death , to be revenged against some - body who had cheated him . ''

		Lest these stories be lightly ascribed to what Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	called '' the desire to propagate a wonder '' on Mr.
Norman	PERSON	's part , we subjoin a parallel case , the facts of which are taken from a Chinese news - paper .

		It appears that one day a sow belong - ing to a Mrs. Feng happening to knock down and deface the front door of a Mrs.
Wang	PERSON	, the latter presented a claim upon her neighbor for damages .

		Mrs.
Feng	PERSON	, disowning legal respon - sibility in the premises , declined payment ; whereupon a fierce debate ensued , which ended in the injured Mrs.
Wang	PERSON	's threatening to take the life not of Mrs.
Feng	PERSON	or of the original trespasser but of herself !

		But herein she reckoned without her host ; for Mrs.
Feng	PERSON	, ap - prised in time of her danger , and being a per - son of resource and promptitude , at once turned the tables on her enemy by herself jumping into the canal , whence she was dragged the day fol - lowing , to the signal discomfiture of Mrs.
Wang	PERSON	.

		Perhaps the Ghost Theory may be called in to explain these Oriental notions of vengeance .

		There is one point upon which , as Mr. Nor - 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, man testifies , all Chiiiamen are perfectly con - sistent with themselves and with each other ; and that is , hatred of the foreigner .

		Hatred , however , is not just the word here , for it im - plies a tincture of respect ; whereas in
China	LOCATION	the `` foreign devil '' is despised at sight not merely disliked , but regarded with sincere and profound contempt .

		To the apprehension of the rabble , he is an unclean and possibly a dangerous animal , to be baited and disposed of out of hand , like a rat ; while as for the rulers , says Mr.
Norman	PERSON	, '' the better they know us the less they like us . ''

		Said a foreign diplomat at Peking : `` If the Tsungli Yamen -LRB-
Foreign Board	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- were abolished our lives would not be safe here twenty-four hours .

		The people just refrain from actually molesting us because they have learned that they will be very severely pun - ished if they do . ''

		To show what the Celestial really thinks of foreigners , there is nothing like a ramble in Peking . ''

		What are your relations with the people you meet ?

		First of all , they crowd around you whenever you stop , and in a minute you are the centre of a solid mass of humanity , which is eating horrible stuff , which is cov - ered with vermin , which smells worse than words can tell , and which is quite likely to have the small-pox about it .

		... The crowd jostles you , feels your clothes with its dirty hands , pokes its nose in your face , keep - ing up all the time a string of insulting and obscene remarks , with accompanying roars of laughter ... The pedestrian you meet treats you with much less con - sideration than one of his own countrymen ; the children run to the door to cry Kueidzu ! '

		devil at you .

		They have other indescribable and worse ways of insulting you ... '' These street-amenities are , of course , by no means confined to Peking or the mob .

		Says a member of the
China Inland Mission	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1894 -RRB- : '' The Chi-nan-f u fop , dressed in silks and satins , flip - ping his sleeves in the face of the foreign visitor met in the street ; the middle-aged scholar , dressed as a gentleman , not thinking it beneath him to hiss out ' for - eign devil ` or simply ' devil ' ; young and old spitting on the ground in bitterness close to the visitor 's feet , laughing in his face , or , on passing , turning sharply round and making a most hateful noise at his ear , these are some of the petty annoyances that the literati and gentry practise . ''

		The discussion of the relation between Chi - nese and foreigners naturally leads up to the vexed
Missionary Question	ORGANIZATION	, a point on which Mr.
Norman	PERSON	holds very strong opinions . ''

		I believe it to be strictly within the limits of truth to say that foreign missionary effort in
China	LOCATION	has been productive of far more harm than good .

		Instead of serving as a link between Chinese and foreigners , the missionaries have formed a growing obstacle .

		As trav - ellers in the East well know , Oriental peoples are es - pecially susceptible upon two points , of which their re - ligion is the chief .

		We have forced the inculcation of an alien and a detested creed upon the Chinese literally at the point of the bayonet .

		... I am convinced that if the subscribers to Chinese missions could only see for themselves the minute results of good and the consid - erable results of harm that their money produces , they would find in the vast opportunities for reformatory work at home a more attractive field for their charity . ''

		In support of these views the author cites the testimony of some of the leading mission - aries themselves ,
Romish	PERSON	and Protestant ; and we may observe en passant that the Roman propaganda , being the more consistently and devotedly served , and not being discredited in the eyes of the natives by multiplicity of sects , is the more successful of the two .

		Says Mr.
Norman	PERSON	: '' I once asked a Roman Catholic priest whom I met in
China	LOCATION	, and of whose knowledge and character I had formed the highest opinion , if he believed that the result of missionary enterprise would result , even in the ful - ness of time , in anything that could be remotely de - scribed as the Christianizing of
China	LOCATION	.

		` Jamais ! '

		he replied emphatically . '

		Then , ' said I , ' why are you here ? ' '

		1 am here , ' he replied , ' simply in obedience to the command to preach the Gospel to all peoples .

		Like the soldiers in the ranks , I obey the orders of my commander , without understanding in the least what good is to come of them . ''

		Several Protestant witnesses are cited to the like effect ; the main conclusion being that , in the words of Dr.
A. Williamson	PERSON	, '' not only is heathenism extending , but immorality '' -LRB- the sole point in which the Chinese seem eager to learn of the foreign devil -RRB- '' is increasing in all directions . ''

		The Chinese themselves in - cline to bracket missionaries and opium to - gether as the twin curses of their country ; while '' conversion '' to Christianity is regarded by many natives merely as a possible step to an easier livelihood .

		Mr.
Norman	PERSON	tells of a friend of his who asked a Chinese servant , whom he had previously known , what he was engaged in doing .

		He replied , '' My have got that Jesus pidgin . ''

		He simply meant that he had taken up Christianity , with its substantial benefits in the way of board and wages , as his new calling .

		The main drift of the sections of Mr.
Nor	PERSON	- man 's book to which we have confined our - selves seems to be that , in the words of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, '' East is East , and West is West . '

		* Orientals and Westerns are the oil and the water of humanity ; and there is , so far as we can see , no way of blending them .


China	LOCATION	is inspired by this truth when she denounces
Westernizing Japan	LOCATION	as a traitor to
Asia	LOCATION	;
Japan	LOCATION	is inspired by it when she retorts that
China	LOCATION	is the real traitor , since , instead of rousing her - self to resist the tide of
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	advance , she continues to dream on supinely in her long
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 267 sleep of Confucian barbarism even while the enemy is knocking at her gates .

		And
Japan	LOCATION	, says Mr.
Norman	PERSON	, '' is prepared to bring
China	LOCATION	back to Asiatic allegiance . ''

		Her watchword is ''
Asia	LOCATION	for the Asiatics '' ; a federation or Bund of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	powers , with the hegemony for herself , is her political goal .

		Obviously , to the support of such an arrangement as this , an alliance with a
European State	ORGANIZATION	is necessary ; and
Great Britain	LOCATION	is
Japan	LOCATION	's first choice . ''

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	allied in the Far East would be irresistible .

		The one would command the sea , the other would dominate the land ... With such a union the Korean Channel would become a sec - ond Dardanelles , and the Sea of
Japan	LOCATION	would become the Russian Black Sea of the East . ''

		Meanwhile -LRB- be it added -RRB- , tireless
Kussia	LOCATION	is pushing on her Trans-Siberian Railway , not , as Mr.
Norman	PERSON	himself admits , to a terminus at icebound
Vladivostock	LOCATION	, but to a Korean port . ''

		Whatever else may be thought of the
Far East	LOCATION	, let the fact that
Russia	LOCATION	intends to go to
Korea	LOCATION	be regarded as certain . ''

		All things con - sidered , it would seem that a storm is brewing in the Orient compared with which the one just spent will be but a passing squall .

		We heartily commend Mr.
Norman	PERSON	's book as a rich and sug - gestive descriptive , expository , and pictorial aid to a comprehension of the
Far East	LOCATION	, its peoples and its problems .


E. G. J. PROFESSOR TYRRELL	PERSON	, ON IIATIX POETRY .

		*
The Turnbull Lectureship	ORGANIZATION	had a propitious inauguration .

		American literature has pro- duced no work more helpful and suggestive to one who wishes to cultivate the power to appre - ciate verse than Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's lectures on '' The Nature and Elements of Poetry , '' which formed the first series on the Turnbull founda - tion .

		This was followed , in
1892	DATE	, by a con - sideration of '' The Growth and Influence of Classical Greek Poetry , '' by no less an authority than Professor
Jebb	PERSON	, of
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Latin Poetry naturally came in for its hearing next ; and the lecturer chosen was Professor
Tyrrell	PERSON	, of
Dublin	LOCATION	, a Professor of Greek , by the way , though best known in this country , perhaps , by his work in editing the Correspondence of
Cicero	LOCATION	.

		It will be seen that his credentials for such a position as that of the Turnbull lecture - ship , with Latin Poetry as the special subject , * LATIN POETRY .

		Lectures delivered on the Percy Turn - bull
Memorial Foundation	ORGANIZATION	in the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
R. Y. Tyrrell	PERSON	, Regius Professor of Greek in the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Dublin	LOCATION	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		are not , on their face , so unquestionable as those of either of his predecessors ; and a read - ing of the lectures , as they now appear in book form , will be found slightly disappointing to those whose expectations are based upon the standard set by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	and Professor
Jebb	PERSON	.

		One is scarcely influenced to follow Professor
Tyrrell	PERSON	very implicitly in matters of opinion , when he meets , in the introductory chapter , a serious attempt to establish
Cicero	PERSON	in high rank among the Roman bards .

		In his judgment , of all the poets of the Ca3sarean period ,
Lucretius	PERSON	and Catullus excepted , '' by far the most im - portant and interesting , not only for his real poetic ability , but for the influence which he exercised upon subsequent Art , is the great orator and consummate man of letters ,
M. Tul	PERSON	- lius
Cicero	PERSON	. ''

		Several pages are devoted to the maintenance of this thesis ; but the proof adduced does not compel assent .

		Cicero was a man of great versatility , but his achievements in poetry may perhaps more fitly be classed along with his military victory over the Pin - denissitae than made the basis for ranking him as a third after such poets as Lucretius and Catullus .

		As the lecturer is over-charitable toward the pretensions of
Cicero	PERSON	as a poet , so , on the other hand , he seems unduly adverse in his treatment of
Horace	PERSON	.

		Horace may have adapted much from Lucilius , but the evidence of the Lucilian fragments seems rather overworked in the ef - fort to prove that his writings are not '' the artless and candid expression of his personal feelings and experiences . ''

		It is easier to be - lieve that a poet may occasionally set the '' can - did expression of his personal feelings and ex - periences '' in a framework borrowed , in greater or less degree , from the literature of a previous age , than to believe that any considerable por - tion of the verse of
Horace	PERSON	is a mere literary exercise in the modernization of Lucilius .

		Pro- fessor
Tyrrell	PERSON	has not been untouched , how - ever , by the charm of the Odes : '' Whatever may be thought about the meaning which un - derlies them , their form is perfection itself , and they defy imitation ... Each new attempt to copy them has only added a new proof that the mould in which they were made was shat - tered beyond all mending when it fell from the hands of Horace . ''

		The two lectures in which Lucretius and Catullus are considered show a more ardent enthusiasm than any other portion of the series , and the added zest shown in their delivery made 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, an impression upon at least one listener which two years have not effaced .

		Lucretius is to him '' this High Priest of Atheism , this Apostle of Irreligion , who thunders against inspiration like one inspired , and who shows all the rapt devotion of a
Stephen	PERSON	in his denial of immortality , all the fervor of a Bossuet while he scatters to the winds the last perished leaves of human hope . ''

		His poem is kept '' instinct with life , '' notwith - standing the deadness of the philosophy which it embodies , by '' the fine frenzy which clothes every argument , however dry or abstruse , with all the hues of fancy , and which makes the poem like nothing else in all literature , if we except our own
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's ' Two Voices . ' ''

		Again : '' He breathed upon the system of Epicurus , and created a soul under the ribs of death . ''

		As one may see from these short quotations , the
Dublin	LOCATION	professor has found the '' fine frenzy '' of his subject contagious , and the re - sult is a lecture which will be read with intense interest , and by the general reader , too , as well as the student of Latin literature .

		Lucretius , he concludes , '' has now won his place among the great poets of the world ... We now see how religious is the irreligion of this
Titan	ORGANIZATION	.

		We hear in his sombre strains not the sneers of the encyclopaedist , but the high words of Prometheus on the
Caucasus	LOCATION	.

		At last the world has learned that intrepid audacity com - bined with noble sincerity may have a beauty which is like the beauty of holiness ... And we see in him an eager student of Nature , who has been raised by a naturally religious cast of mind , through cold and intangible abstractions to which he tried in vain to cling , raised out of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	and up to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's God . ''

		Passing from the great philosopher , in
Catul	LOCATION	- lus we meet one '' the keynote of whose song is man and man 's heart , '' one tormented not '' by the painful riddle of the earth , '' as
Lucretius	PERSON	, but '' by the pangs of disprized love . ''

		In the poems of which
Lesbia	PERSON	is the subject , Professor
Tyrrell	PERSON	thinks that the poet '' has struck those terrible chords which give us the very vibrations of his heart , chords as true as those of Burns or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and as artistic as those of Keats or Shelley . ''

		-LRB- One pauses here to note the ad - mission that one poet , at least , struck '' true chords , '' notwithstanding the habit of adapta - tion from his predecessors , whether
Horace	PERSON	could do so or not . -RRB-

		The usual comparison of Catullus with
Moore	PERSON	is rejected , and is held to have injured the work of translators , who have missed the deep feeling of the original and fallen into '' the rollicking vein of the Irish melodist . ''

		The opinion of Professor
Sellar	PERSON	is quoted with approval , that the '' Attis , '' `` re - garded as a work of pure imagination , is the most remarkable poetical creation in the Latin language . ''

		Propertius ,
Tibullus	PERSON	, and
Ovid	LOCATION	are passed over hastily at the close of the lecture on Ca - tullus .

		Of the three , Propertius stands first in the sympathy of the author ; and when we leave him , we are told , '' we abandon really ardent sincerity in the expression of the pas - sion of love , never again to meet it in Latin poetry . ''

		If the lecture on Virgil seems some - what less interesting than the two which pre - cede , it is not from any lack of sympathetic treatment , but from the impossibility of work - ing into an hour 's talk on the author of the ^ Eneid any considerable amount of matter not already known to the average reader .

		The lecture on
Horace	PERSON	has been mentioned above .

		The space already taken forbids more than the mere mention of the two remaining , which treat respectively of '' Latin Satire '' and the '' Latin Poetry of the Decline . ''

		To the lectures as delivered is appended an essay of some twenty-five pages on '' Some Re - cent Translations of Virgil . ''

		We have noted but two misprints Fabukmus for Fabulinus , page 63 ; and another on page 297 , which has a quite comical effect , since it makes the pious .

		ZEneas float , instead of flout , '' Dido 's realm as he flies . ''

		One will not find in these lectures a substi - tute for the three excellent volumes of the late Professor Sellar ; but for a general view of Latin poetry , within the compass of a single volume , we know of nothing better .

		By the time the poetry of the leading literary races has been treated in this way , the Turnbull lecture - ship will have done a great service to the Amer - ican people in cultivating the power to enjoy and understand good poetry .

		In
1894	DATE	, Pro- fessor
Norton	PERSON	was the lecturer , with
Dante	PERSON	as his theme ; and no doubt his lectures will be published ere long .

		For some reason or other , the lectureship was not filled for
1895	DATE	.

		Hebrew Poetry is announced as the subject for
1896	DATE	, to be considered by Professor
George A. Smith	PERSON	, of
Glasgow	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 269 LIVES OF THE PRESIDENTS .

		* He who would read the history of American politics in the lives of our great men turns nat - urally to the roll of Presidents .

		General
Wil	PERSON	- son , the editor of the large and handsome vol - ume entitled '' The Presidents of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' states that the twenty-three biographies which it contains present a complete record of the most important events in the nation 's his - tory , from the inauguration of our first presi - dent to the
summer of 1894	DATE	.

		Many of the articles in the book were prepared for the '' Cyclopaedia of American Biography , '' while a few were written especially for this work .

Robert C. Winthrop	PERSON	,
John Fiske	PERSON	,
James Parton	PERSON	,
D. C. Gilman	PERSON	,
John Hay	PERSON	, and others scarcely less known , could hardly fail to be noteworthy .

		The limitations of the work were such that the writers were confined for the most part to a recital of facts already fa - miliar to the average student of American his - tory ; yet the stories are so well told that no one will regret the time spent in reading them in this new form .

		The book is not only a col - lection of interesting biographies , but is also a compendium of the history of
America	LOCATION	under constitutional government .

		Such a work as this can not fail to appeal to the pride of patriotic Americans .

		With all our political faults , it is still true that no other country in the world can boast of such a suc - cession of able rulers .

		In the whole list there are few weak and no unworthy men , while some will rank among the world 's greatest leaders .

		An eminent English historian has recently said that the place of
Washington	LOCATION	in the history of mankind `` is well-nigh without a fellow . ''

		After the death of Mr.

		writing fairly and appreciatively of so sturdy a patriot and so stanch a Union man as
Zachary Taylor	PERSON	.

		Yet Mr.
Davis	PERSON	could speak with author - ity , for he was a member of General
Taylor	PERSON	's staff during the Mexican war , and was his trusted friend .

		He speaks guardedly of Tay - lor 's political opinions , but evidently admired his patriotism .

		He even goes so far as to state his belief that if
Taylor	PERSON	had lived he would have done much to abate the party and sec - tional bitterness which became so much intensi - fied in the years just succeeding his death .

		The book is illustrated with excellent steel engravings of the Presidents , made from noted portraits .

		Each sketch closes with a short bibliography , and the editor has appended sketches of the '' ladies of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, '' together with notices of such descendants of the Presidents as have become prominent in the subsequent history of the country .

		Whatever may be said of the Presidents , it is certain that very few , if any , commonplace women have been numbered in the list of their wives ; and not the least interesting chapter in the nation 's history is that relating to their participation in its social and political life .

		The names of Martha Wash - ington and
Abigail Adams	PERSON	are familiar ones , but the beautiful and accomplished
Martha Jef	PERSON	- ferson seems to have received rather less than her due from posterity .

		It is interesting to read that Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	'' retained a romantic devo - tion for her throughout his life , and because of her failing health refused foreign appointments in
1776	DATE	, and again in
1781	DATE	, having promised that he would accept no public office that would involve their separation . ''

		Mrs.
Polk	PERSON	was a woman of unusual strength of character , and was one of the most popular of the ladies who have presided at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		u She held weekly receptions , and abol - ished the custom of giving refreshments to the guests .

		She also forbade dancing , as out of keeping with the character of such entertain - ments .

		In spite of her reforms , Mrs.
Polk	PERSON	was very popular . '

		Madam , ' said a prominent
South Carolinian	LOCATION	, at one of her receptions , ' there is a woe pronounced against you in the
Bible	LOCATION	. '

		On her inquiring his meaning , he added : ' The Bible says , '' Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you . '' '

		Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	was of a different cast of mind .

		When General
Taylor	PERSON	became President '' she reluctantly accepted her responsibilities , re - garding the office as a plot to deprive her of her husband 's society and to shorten his life by unnecessary care .

		She surrendered to her 270 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The lives of the later Presidents ' wives are enshrined in the hearts of the American peo - ple .

		Each one has been of the noblest type of womanhood , and , both in character and accom - plishment , is worthy of the title of '' the first lady of the land . ''

		RECENT FICTION .

		* The fact is perhaps worth noting that of the fif - teen books of fiction grouped for the purposes of the present article , and representing what is best in the output of the past few months , four should have been written by Chicagoans .

		One swallow does not make a
summer	DATE	, and four novels do not make what the journalist calls a '' literary centre , '' but there is at least an encouraging indication of progress in this almost simultaneous appearance of four exam - ples of skilful and conscientious workmanship .

		For , whatever their shortcomings , the four books alike are possessed of those qualities ; they display , more - over , a feeling for literature as an art , which is a very different thing from literature as '' journalism , '' for example , or from literature that claims the name by mere virtue of the intrinsic human interest of its subject-matter .

		First of all , we will say a few words of Miss Bell 's '' A Little Sister to the Wilderness . ''

		In this book , the reader will find little to remind him of '' The Love Affairs of an Old Maid , '' the delicate * A LITTLE SISTER TO THE WILDERNESS .

		group of social silhouettes with which the author made her debut a couple of years ago .

		Here we have , not the sophisticated society of the cities , but the primitive society of the
Tennessee	LOCATION	mountain regions .

		The ground is peculiarly Miss Murfree 's , but we think that
Miss Bell	LOCATION	has justified her right to join in the occupation .

		Description and charac - terization are both good , and the spiritual issues of the situation are drawn out with a fine sense of rela - tive values .

		The dialect is something of a stumb - ling block , but the writer has a conscience -LRB- as her prefatory note upon this subject shows -RRB- , and it would hardly be reasonable to expect phonetics of more standard type from her mountaineers .

		Of the two central figures , that of the heroine , felici - tously described as a '' soul-endogen , '' is the more finely conceived , and arouses the instant sympathies of the reader .

		The other figure , that of the itiner - ant revivalist , we can hardly take as seriously as the writer would have us .

		The essential vulgarity of the whole theory of religious practice and inculca - tion which he exemplifies stands in the way .

		A man as fine as the writer would have us think her hero would be the last in the world to lend himself to such proceedings .

		Mr.
Bunner	PERSON	, in one of his short stories , has depicted for us the revivalist and his methods with the better art and saner view .

		But for all that ,
Miss Bell	ORGANIZATION	has told a story that deserves attention , and the sincerity of her workmanship is undoubted .

		For this , one may easily pardon some careless phrases , a few defective articulations , and the undue exaltation of a type of character that can - not be called admirable . ''

		A Sawdust Doll '' does not seem to us the hap - piest of titles for the story in which Mrs.
de Koven	PERSON	has outlined the supreme tragic experience of a wo - man 's life .

		The nursery anecdote suggested by the words brings with it associations that are merely amusing , and irony is carried far indeed when we liken the petty disillusionment of a child to the final awakening from that dream of happiness which comes but once in a life .

		Mrs.
de Koven	PERSON	's story is of the simplest in construction .

		Fiction has no more familiar figure than that of the woman who fondly believes that friendship and respect can ade - quately fill the place of love in her heart , and whose wedded life is tranquil for a time with the calm that precedes the storm .

		When passion comes into such a life , it is with the force of the freshet , and devastation marks its path .

		But this new variation upon so common a theme has both force and distinc - tion .

		The force is in the woman 's struggle for self-mastery , eventually at bitter cost attained ; the distinction is in the artistic restraint of the work , and the elaboration of a style that will , for the most part , bear close examination .

		We say for the most part , because there are now and then touches of the stiff and dithyrambic , notes that strike the ear as a trifle discordant , and such infelicitous fig - ures as '' Lightning will breed an infidelity in a compass . ''

		Mrs.
de Koven	PERSON	has set herself so exact -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 ing a standard of form that we must speak of these matters , but mainly for the sake of adding that their mention is a tribute to the high plane of ex - cellence that alone makes them noticeable .

		With the ordinary novel such things are a matter of course , but this novel is one of exceptionally con - scientious workmanship .

		The precision and per - spicuity of the style are French rather than English , and its defects , if we may hazard an opinion upon so delicate a subject , seem to result from the fact that the extremely modern group of Frenchmen have unduly influenced the writer .

		Externally , '' A Sawdust Doll '' is a story of
New York	LOCATION	and
Newport	LOCATION	society , which the author knows and does not take too seriously .

		The mechanical features of the book are so tasteful that its careless proof-read - ing is all the more a blemish .

		. ''

		I wonder how those clever fellows who write books turn out epigrams .

		Do they flow out ready made , or are they worked out with a dictionary ? ''

		This is one of the things that puzzle the '' fool '' who is the hero of Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	's latest novel , but it is clearly no puzzle to the author , for a thick sheaf of epigrams makes up almost the en - tire contents of his book .

		We will not hazard a conjecture as to their genesis : some of them are platitudinous enough to `` flow out ready made '' from any kind of a pen ; others are so neatly turned as to suggest , not necessarily the dictionary which would prove a dubious aid in such a case but rather a considerable acuteness of social observa - tion , or at least a careful study of recent French and English writing of the meteor-studded type .

		But we should say that the author had not been well-advised in abandoning the pleasant narrative style of '' An American Peeress '' to venture upon new ground so dangerous .

		For your epigram must be very good indeed to be tolerable , and must
spring	DATE	from a certain breadth of view and ripeness of ex - perience rarely if ever possessed by young writers .

		The story told -LRB- mostly in the epigrammatic mus - ings of its hero -RRB- by Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	is of the slightest description .

		There is no doubt that the hero is a fool , as he himself frankly admits , for no one deserving a less contemptuous title could so long have hesitated between the two women the pure one and the impure who flit across the pages of the book , and through the reveries of the young ar - tist who loves them both without being able to de - termine which of his two passions is the real thing .

		He is enlightened in the end , but does not deserve the good fortune that seemingly awaits him , and we trust that
Dorothy	PERSON	gives him more than one bad quarter of an hour before she accepts his sullied devotion .

		Not long ago , in commenting upon Mr.
Paul Lei	PERSON	- cester
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's strong novel of
New York	LOCATION	politics , we ventured the prediction that the political motive , being peculiarly available for the purposes of the American novelist , would come to play an import - ant part in our fiction .

		In Mr.
Harry Perry Rob	PERSON	- inson 's '' Men Born Equal '' we have an impressive presentation of one of the most urgent of all our political problems that offered by the ignorant and hot-headed democracy of our large cities , who , in the first flush of their newly-realized power , allow - ing themselves to be controlled by the self-seeking and unscrupulous demagogue , make '' labor '' their shibboleth , and in its name assail the very founda - tions of civilized society .

		This problem Mr.
Rob	PERSON	- inson presents with knowledge and sympathy knowledge of the actual workings of municipal ma - chines and the tactics of labor organizations , sym - pathy with the dull sense of wrong that impels to the senseless antagonisms and riots that
spring	DATE	from the present hostility between employers and em - ployed .

		The situation selected by the author is presented with force and fairness , and the aspira - tions of his hero must be those of every intelligent and unprejudiced observer of the industrial situa - tion .

		The painful reality of the details that make up this story is only too evident to the inhabitants of our large cities , and we must feel with the writer that no specific and immediate remedy is possible .

		The uplifting forces of a widened education and a deepened moral sense will in the end win the fight for civilization , as against the anarchy now threat - ened ; but we must be patient , and not hope to re - construct the world in a day .

		Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	is at times too didactic for the ends of good literary art , but he enlists the feelings of the earnest reader , and offers him not only a political tract , but an at - tractive love-story as well ; the whole being framed in forcible , nervous , and unpretentious English .

		It is distinctly a good book , written from life , homely in its sincerity , and faithful to fine ideals through - out .

		An English visitor to our shores recently ex - pressed the opinion that American labor organiza - tions seemed still to be in a stage long outgrown and left behind by the trades unions of Great Brit - ain .

		He found here the violence and the lawless - ness that the sober second thought of the English workingmen rejected many years ago , as inflicting the deepest of injuries upon the cause of the indus - trial masses .

		A comparative study of present-day strikes in the two countries , and of the coercive methods of labor organizations , would , we think , afford much justification for this view .

		Such , evi - dently , is the opinion of Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	, whose ''
Cceur d'Alene	PERSON	, '' although a sketch rather than a detailed picture , strongly reminds us of
Charles Reade	PERSON	's '' Put Yourself in His Place , '' as far as the two books stand upon the common ground of the dis - cussion of union versus non-union labor .

		A strike of
Montana	LOCATION	miners in the
summer of 1892	DATE	is the subject of Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	's story , and her evident fa - miliarity with the scenes and types of character de - picted gives strength to a work that is yet open to the criticism of being done too much in outline .

		Interest of the tenderer sort is supplied by a love - story , while the perils of hero and heroine keep the 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, interest fresh and the attention alert .

		That the book is an example of good , forcible , picturesque writ - ing , need hardly be added to our comment .

		The author 's name always stands for these qualities , and others no less admirable .

		We have read with much interest the three or four volumes of fiction produced by Mrs.
Van Rens	PERSON	- selaer
Cruger	PERSON	during the past few years , hoping to observe a steady development of the talent undeni - ably latent in her first book .

		The hope has not been realized to any considerable extent , although an increasing firmness of grasp may be recognized in the more recent books , as well as the ability to fill a larger canvas . ''

		Poppsea , '' Mrs.
Cruger	PERSON	's new novel , is the most ambitious work yet attempted by her , and may be regarded as equal in achievement to any of its predecessors , while upon a scale so much larger as to make even this measure of suc - cess creditable .

		But we can not help noting the lingering traces of amateurishness that keep the book well down in the ranks , and the lapses from good and even from grammatical English that too fre - quently occur .

		Such an anti-climax , the consequence of a solecism , as this for example : '' Emotion must be the keynote of her life , Now , if it were me ' is unpardonable .

		There is in this book less , per - haps , of ''
Julien Gordon	PERSON	's '' old tendency to assume that the life of `` society '' in the narrow sense is any considerable part of the life of humanity or is pos - sessed of any broad human interest ; but , per contra , there seems to be an increasing tendency to employ the cheap device best exemplified by '' Ouida '' - of sprinkling the pages with unfamiliar proper names and would-be recondite allusions .

		Mrs.
Cru	PERSON	- ger becomes at times quite as airy in this respect as her prototype .

		As for
Poppaea	ORGANIZATION	's conduct , we must leave that for the moralist to characterize ; but there is one scene at which the gorge must rise , even of those who are not moralists by profession .

		Even
Poppsea	PERSON	's life stands for certain ideals of conduct , albeit neither very lofty nor very wholesome ; and the scene in question is so vulgar and tawdry a dero - gation from these ideals that others than prudes may well find in it some cause for offence .

		The Woman Question looms ominously in the forefront of Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	's latest novel , and casts its shadow over the narrative .

		The '' bach - elor maid '' of the story is a common enough figure in these days , and the author has limned the type with her habitual grace and penetration .

		Further - more , her heroine is made to learn the lesson that awaits all `` bachelor maids '' sooner or later , the lesson that a life of the affections is not incompat - ible with devotion to the purest intellectual ideals the lesson , rather , that the one is the needed com - plement of the other .

		In its tenor and outcome the work is no less sweet and wholesome than Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's earlier books ; yet it is made a compar - ative failure by the forced note of didacticism and by the frequent discussions that contribute anything but enlivenment to its pages .

		Another phase of the
Woman Question	ORGANIZATION	, which is in this case the Man Question also , occupies the at - tention of Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	in her story of '' Philip and His Wife . ''

		Divorce , as it presents itself to variously constituted minds , is the theme from which we never escape to any great distance while engaged with these pages .

		The discussion is not very conclusive , and the sympathies of readers will not always fol - low the author 's lead , but the intensity of feeling brought to bear upon this grave social problem commands respect and makes a deep impression .

		Nor does absorption in an ethical discussion deny to Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	's work some measure of palpitating life at least as far as several of the characters are concerned .

		As for the hero , we are bound to give him the harsh name of a spiritual prig , and it is dif - ficult to feel for him much sympathy in his self - evolved anguish of soul .

		For the rest , Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	depicts for us
New England	LOCATION	village life with accu - racy , discernment , and some slight sense of humor . ''

		Mon verre n'est pas grand , mais je bois dans mons verre '' may fairly be said by her of her work con - sidered in its non-didactic aspects .

		The fine art of padding is by no means a new one , and we have frequently had occasion to name Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	as among the novelists most accomplished in its practice .

		But Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has surpassed even himself in '' The Ralstons , '' a two-volume con - tinuation of ''
Katherine Lauderdale	PERSON	, '' and the most emulous of his successors will not find it easy to tell so simple a story at so great a length .

		We do not say so wearisome a length , for Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's writ - ing , however irrelevant to the situation , and how - ever calculated to make the reader impatient , is al - ways possessed of high literary finish , and flows so smoothly on that one absorbs it with no sense of effort , just as one breathes without consciousness of the act .

		So the various
Ralstons	PERSON	and Lauderdales of his story carry on their interminable conversa - tions , and the author varies their words with his own equally interminable comment , and we bide our time , knowing that a few things must happen somewhere in the course of the two volumes .

		Re - duced to its lowest terms , the novel is a very simple presentation of some very hackneyed material the consequences of a secret marriage and a contest for the immense fortune left by a man who amused himself by making many wills .

		Further develop - ments are promised us by the novelist , and , indeed , there is in the nature of things no reason why the story of this little family group should not go on indefinitely , even to the extent of rivalling the pro- ductions of
Mademoiselle de Scuddry	ORGANIZATION	herself .


Japan	LOCATION	is not wholly a new field for the interna - tional novel , but its possibilities are far from ex - hausted , and Mr.
John Luther Long	PERSON	, the latest writer to exploit its opportunities , must be credited with a distinct success .

		Both in setting and in char - acterization , '' Miss Cherry-Blossom of
Tokyo	LOCATION	'' of - fers convincing evidence of intimate acquaintance with its subject .

		The Japanese heroine has been ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 to be sure , a little sophisticated by a term of resi - dence in
America	LOCATION	, at the '' Bryn Mawr gakko , '' but the author sees better than most observers that the oriental offers no exception to the rule of cesium , non animum mutant .

		We are too apt to think that the subjects of the
Mikado	LOCATION	, by contact with things European , have really become occidentalized at heart Mr.
Long	PERSON	helps us to learn the lesson that their inner life remains all but wholly impenetrable to our barbarian gaze , just as we have learned a similar lesson from Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	concerning the na - tives of British
India	LOCATION	.

		Some concessions , indeed , he is forced to make to the exigencies of the love - story which it was his main purpose to tell , and as far as it has charm for us in this respect , we must admit that he has strained the ethnical probabili - ties .

		But so extremely winning a figure as Miss Cherry-Blossom is her own excuse for being -LRB- in the pages of a novel -RRB- , and we follow her fortunes , listen to her delightful broken English , and share in her griefs with the acutest sympathy .

		Aside from this lovingly-delineated central figure , the book does not offer us anything particularly notable as character - ization or as constructive workmanship . ''

		The Princess Aline '' is really a short story put forth in the guise of a book .

		To say that Mr.
Davis	PERSON	wrote it is to say that it is a good story , original in conception and brilliant in execution .

		The whimsicality of the central idea reminds us somehow of the kind of work that Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	used to give us in the ''
Marjorie Daw	PERSON	'' period of his activity .

		It was distinctly a clever invention to start the hero on a long journey in quest of a woman whom he knew only from her photograph , to bring him on several occasions exasperatingly near an ac - quaintance only to be baffled each time by some untoward incident , to provide him with a sympa - thetic confidant and traveling-companion in the shape of one of his own countrywomen , and to make him discover in the end that the woman he really loved was not the one whom he had unsuccessfully pursued , but the one who had abetted him in the pursuit .

		Anything more exquisite in its suggestive - ness than the episode which closes this charming nouvelle is not often met with in contemporary fiction .

		Mr.
Besant	PERSON	's latest novel is not a very successful performance , although there is some considerable degree of novelty in the fundamental idea .

		An im - mense fortune left by a miser supposed to have died intestate is provided for the reader 's delectation at the outset , and the intrigues of the many claimants who promptly appear form the substance of the story .

		The novelty consists in the fact that the real heir , knowing his rights all the time , deliberately re - frains from asserting them , being influenced to this abstinence by the fact that the fortune had been accumulated by highly disreputable methods .

		We doubt if the ethics of such a case are to be taken for granted as fully as the author would have us so take them , and his scruples are rather likely to irritate the reader .

		Eventually , the heir succumbs to the temptation , but only in time to enjoy -LRB- in im - agination -RRB- his prospective wealth for a brief space , since the tardy discovery of a will sets at naught his ambitions .

		There is a certain impressiveness about the book considered merely as a study in heredity , for several generations of the miser 's fam - ily are brought before us , and nearly all of its mem - bers fall into evil ways as if some necessary curse attached itself to those associated with the ill-gotten store .

		But one has only to contrast
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's '' Det Flager '' with the present story to realize all the difference between working out an idea mechan - ically , and working it out with psychological insight and artistic truth . ''

		A Man of Mark '' is , like '' The Prisoner of Zenda , '' a story of adventure and intrigue , its scene laid in an imaginary South American republic , and told in a manner strongly suggestive of opera bouffe .

		The writer gives his fancy the freest of play , and his characters , despite their unreality , succeed in interesting us in their fortunes .

		The narrative has swiftness of action , diversity of incident , and clever - ness in a hundred minor touches . ''

		A Romance of Dijon '' carries us away to the fair Burgundian land , and back to the great year of
1789	DATE	the year of the States-General and the overthrow of the
Bastile	LOCATION	, and the legislation of Au - gust the fourth the year when a great wave of enthusiasm swept over the French nation , and men fondly believed that a new and better world might be built up post haste upon the ruins of the old .

		These stirring events , as they affected the lives of a few simple provincials a decayed nobleman , - a fair shop-keeping maiden , a Huguenot who had learned in bitter experience the meaning of the Revocation are the subject of the interesting story that Miss Betham-Edwards has told for us , and in - vested with the charm that comes from loving fa - miliarity with the types and scenes described .

		It is something of a coincidence that , simultan - eously with the story just mentioned , there should have appeared another so similar in theme and treatment as Miss Price 's '' In the Lion 's Mouth . ''

		The same momentous years and the same provincial scenes are set before us by the second English - woman as by the first , although the result , it must be confessed , is less satisfactory .

		The author writes from far less knowledge of her subject , and her scenes and characters are the merely conventional - ized reflections of the average reader who has found interesting the history of the great Revolution .

		The story is too diffuse to hold the attention very closely , and , somehow or other , we take but a languid in - terest in the characters .

		Conscientious but dull must be the verdict upon this unpretending per - formance .

		Studies in
Modern Music	ORGANIZATION	.

		A second series of Mr.
W. H. Ha	PERSON	- dow 's '' Studies in Modern Music '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- includes four essays .

		An introductory chapter on the '' Outlines of Musi - cal Form '' is followed by special studies upon
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Dvorak	PERSON	, and
Herr Brahms	PERSON	.

		Four portraits illustrate the text .

		Mr.
Hadow	PERSON	's essay on musical form is one of the most searching discus - sions of this subject with which we are acquainted .

		Starting with the fundamental psychological con - siderations upon which our appreciation of music is based , the author proceeds to examine the princi - ples of structure , style , and function in musical composition .

		His treatment is not over-technical , although to understand it one must know the rudi - ments of musical grammar , and the fruitful method is employed of making large use of the analogies of literary composition .

		The following is a pregnant passage upon the subject of musical function : '' The general function of music may be stated in a single word to be beautiful .

		It is the one art in which no human being can raise the false issue of a direct ethical influence .

		It allows absolutely no scope for the confusion of thought which , on one side , brought '
Madame Bovary	PERSON	' into the law-courts , and , on the other , has taught the British public to regard as a great religious teacher the ingenious gentleman who illustrated the ' Contes Drolatiques . '

		Of course , all contemplation of pure beauty is ennobling , and in this sense music may have the same indirect moral bearing as a flower , or a sunset , or a Greek statue . ''

		This is admirably put -LRB- the remark about Dore '' being borrowed from Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	-RRB- , and yet it does not emphasize quite sufficiently the significance of the '' indirect moral bearing '' of music .

		To compare it with a sunset or a flower in this respect is surely misleading , for the difference in degree is enor - mous .


Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	and the other writers who have argued that the appeal of music is exclu - sively sensuous and intellectual have shown a singu - lar blindness in refusing to admit its power as a factor in the development of the emotional life .

		Yet this is of primary importance , for whatever adds to the richness and purity of that life must re - act upon character .

		We are inclined to say that music is ethical in the highest and best sense , al - though its influence be indirect .

		Possibly , also , the writer goes a little too far in his assertion of the thesis that the discords of one age may be the ac - cepted harmonies of the next .

		The kernel of the contention is in the following passage : '' At the present day , a composer who should end a piece on a minor second would be deliberately violating the established language of the time ; and would be rep - rehensible , not because a minor second is ugly for it will be a concord some day but because , in the existing state of music , it could not be naturally placed at the close of a cadence .

		Imagine
Handel	PERSON	's face on being shown a song when finished on a domi - nant seventh out of the key .

		And , having imagined German criticism of Shakespeare .

		it , turn to
Schumann	LOCATION	's ' Im
Wunderschonen Monat Mai	PERSON	. ' ''

		We must be content to dismiss with a word the three individual studies that follow this intro - ductory essay .

		They are in a high degree sympa - thetic and acute .

		The appreciation of
Herr Brahms	PERSON	, in particular , with its fine but tempered enthusiasm , is a noteworthy contribution to musical criticism .

		The partisans of this great composer have too long been at swords ' points with the Wagnerians ; it is time for sane criticism to grow catholic enough to enroll both composers among the great masters .

		The name of
Bernhard ten Brink	ORGANIZATION	has been long familiar to students of English as authoritative on the lan - guage and literature of Chaucer ; ten Brink 's '' Early English Literature , '' too , holds a place of first importance as guide to the English writers of the earlier epochs .

		The publication of his '' Five Lectures on Shakespeare '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , translated from a German edition by
Julia Franklin	PERSON	, will hardly extend the fame of this clear-minded , finely-appreci - ative German critic of English letters ; for the scope of the volume is too limited and its purpose too modest for that .

		Its appearance , however , will emphasize the loss of such a mind to German and to English scholar - ship , while the book itself will prove a contribution of actual value to standard Shakespeare literature .

		The five lectures included in the volume were given at Frankfort-on-the-Main , if we are not mistaken , in the
winter of 1886-7	DATE	.

		The plan of the lectures , as announced by the author , is `` to touch in their order upon the important problems to which the phenomenon of Shakespeare gives rise . ''

		There - fore the first lecture concerns itself at some length with a discussion of the '' Shakespeare myth '' with respect to which it was needful to speak some word at the beginning of such a course in such a presence .

		That word was spoken by ten Brink , calmly withal , yet effectually .

		Those who sat under the Profes - sor 's instruction at
Strassburg	LOCATION	well remember how , at the beginning of a course similar to this , deliv - ered to his students at this very time , his '' Shake - speare , kein My thus '' rang out roundly as a key-note to the discussion which was to come .

		The titles of the successive lectures are : '' The Poet and the Man , '' '' The Chronology of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Works , '' '' Shakespeare as a Dramatist , '' '' Shakespeare as a Comic Poet , '' '' Shakespeare as a Tragic Writer . ''

		The Shakespearian will find a great deal more than mere platitude in these chapters .

		There is much that is suggestive and not a little that is new .

		Par - ticularly helpful seems the comment on the rela - tionship between the dramatist 's experiences and his creations , as found in the second lecture ; also the discussion of the dramatic idea in the plays , which occurs in the third lecture .

		It is of interest to note in passing that the author regards '' King Lear '' as the play in which '' the poet attains the summit of his tragic powers . ''

		Details can not be added here ; it is enough to call the attention of the student to this volume , to emphasize the intel -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 275 ligence and dignity of its comments , the admirable sanity of its judgments and criticism .

		There is a compact index , and the typography of the volume is excellent .

		The publishers have given us a book in all respects worth while .

		Ancient teacMng , In writing `` The History of Mar - on marriage riage '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , the learned Dean of
Lichfield	LOCATION	,
Herbert Mortimer Luccock	PERSON	, makes no attempt to trace the history of marriage through all times and among all peoples .

		Himself a theologian , he aims only to discover the exact teaching of the
Bible	LOCATION	and the Church in the matters of marriage and divorce .

		In his opening chapter he considers the original institution of mar - riage , asserting that Eve was created that
Adam	PERSON	might more fully be the image of God i. e. , that he might not be alone ; the married state reflects faintly the intellectual and spiritual companionship which prevail within the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	itself .

		Mosaic legislation , Jewish custom , the teaching of the Early and the
Later Church	ORGANIZATION	, are then presented to show that divorce was ever disapproved by them , and that a divorced person who marries during the lifetime of the former companion comes under moral con - demnation .

		In a second part of his book , Dean Luccock examines the Biblical and Ecclesiastical decisions regarding marriage to a deceased wife 's sister .

		He admits that polygamy and the levinate existed and were apparently sanctioned among the Jews , but believes that they were examples of `` con - cessive legislation '' that wrongs were winked at because of the hardness of the Jewish heart .

		But what the Jew was allowed to do may not be best for the Christian , and the Church has ever protested against such marriages and should continue to do so .

		To readers who wish for just this sort of in - formation , nothing can be better than the book be - fore us .

		The author 's style is attractive ; his learn - ing is great ; his heart is in the subject , and he feels that the prevailing laxity in these matters is dan - gerous .

		Perhaps , however , it is best that each gen - eration should deal with its own living questions in its own way .

		The present is little likely to be much affected by the ecclesiastical decisions of by-gone times .

		It is hardly probable that the legislation of the twentieth century will be much influenced by the fact that at the
Spanish Council of Elvira	ORGANIZATION	, in 305
A.D.	LOCATION	, a penalty was inflicted upon a man who married his dead wife 's sister .

		Introduction to English Literature . ''

		An Introduction to English Liter - ature '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Mr.
Henry S. Pan	PERSON	- coast , seems to us as close an approach as has yet been made to the ideal text-book for sec - ondary-school use .

		It is compact , admirable in se - lection of material , reasonable in judgment , well - proportioned as regards historical and critical matter , divided into well-defined sections , and well provided with tables , lists of books , and other help - ful apparatus .

		It does not make the mistake of attempting to include extracts -LRB- except for the brief - est of illustrative passages -RRB- , but sends students di - rectly to the literature itself ; it is a working hand - book which keeps in view the needs of young people , and passes briefly over many matters that would deserve much space in a history proper of English literature ; it does not seek to enforce cut-and-dried critical judgments .

		About one-half of the text is given to writers of the last hundred years , and about one-half of that to the Victorians .

		The importance of knowing English history -LRB- in the broad social sense -RRB- is everywhere inculcated .

		We have noticed a few misprints and other inaccuracies , but nothing very serious , as the book has the special advantage of being the revision and correction of an earlier publication by the same author .

		Altogether , we can recommend it as a manual likely to attract the young mind rather than to repel , the one essential condition being granted of its use by a sympathetic teacher , full of enthusiasm for his subject and his work .

		An adequate In our recent remarks upon '' The translation of Neglected Art of Translation '' we a French classic .

		gpoke of the occasional a p pearance of a translator having quality rather than quantity for an aim , and having the ability to write English as well as the ability to read some foreign language .

		Among the few translators possessed of these qual - ifications , Professor
Melville B. Anderson	PERSON	occupies a conspicuous place , and his several translations from the French are characterized at once by the excellence of their English and by the knowledge of the foreign idiom displayed .

		The most re - markable of the series is undoubtedly Hugo 's `` Will - iam Shakespeare , '' which is a tour de force in En - glish as it is in the original .

		But Professor Ander - son has , in addition , given us versions of several volumes in the series of '' Grands Ecrivains Fran - cais , '' and now offers us the first really acceptable English translation that has ever been made of
St. Pierre	ORGANIZATION	's `` Paul and
Virginia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		In its present form , the reader ignorant of French may for the first time understand why the work has so undisputed a rank among the classics .

		Heretofore he has had to take the statement on faith .

		Besides the translation , Professor
Anderson	PERSON	gives us an ad - mirable Introduction of some fifty pages , biograph - ical , critical , and bibliographical .

		But why does he continually refer to a recent biographer of St. - Pierre as '' Barine ? ''

		The work appears in the series of '' Laurel Crowned Tales . ''

		Later essays by
Garulity	ORGANIZATION	is not a mark of senility Country in the Rev. Dr.
Andrew Kennedy Hutchinson Boyd	PERSON	.

		Neither is ego - tism .

		He is only seventy no very great age for a Scotsman , and both the characteristics above named were as prominent in his essays published a third of a century ago , as in the latest book from his pen ; and both are charming features of all his writings .

		The reader of this latest book might won - der why it was entitled '' St.
Andrews	PERSON	and Else - 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, where '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , but the same reader would be sorely puzzled if asked to suggest a more appro - priate title for this collection of otherwise discon - nected papers ; and if this were his first acquaint - ance with ''
A. K. H. B.	PERSON	, '' he would desire to know him more thoroughly by reading `` Twenty - five Years of
St. Andrews	LOCATION	'' and '' Recreations of a Country Parson . ''

		Dr.
Boyd	PERSON	's style is peculiarly his own .

		We are not prepared to say that it would be improved by a greater conformity to conven - tional rules of punctuation and italicization .

		It might seem paying too great heed to trifling details to mention his peculiar use of the colon ; but a more serious critic , as he tells us , has found fault with his use of italics .

		`` A Text - Book of the History of Painting '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Professor
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	, is the initial vol - ume of a promising series -LRB- edited by Professor Van Dyke -RRB- of concise art manuals designed especially for class-room use .

		The little volume seems a model of pith , lucidity , and practical convenience ; and that it is sound and accurate the author 's name is a sufficient guarantee .

		Essential historical and bio - graphical facts , together with brief critical esti - mates and characterizations of leading schools and painters , are given in a few well-chosen words ; and for students who wish to pursue the subject in de - tail , a list of selected authorities at the head of each chapter points the way .

		Serviceable lists are also provided of principal extant works , together with the places where they are to be found .

		The text is liberally sprinkled with illustrations in half-tone .

		``

		o o \ i '' Lady Stuart . ''

		-LRB- lait & oons -RRB- , a pretty volume trans - lated by
A. C. S.	PERSON	from the French of
M. Paul de Lano	PERSON	, recounts an episode of the Tuil - eries under the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	that recalls the adage about truth and fiction .

		The story seems , at first blush , suspiciously melodramatic ; but
M. de Lano	PERSON	had his facts from `` Lady Stuart '' herself -LRB- whose interest lay rather in suppressing them than in publishing them -RRB- , and he seems satisfied of their truth .

		Intrigue , seduction , kidnapping , murder , and court-yahooism generally , form the sufficiently pun - gent elements of the drama ; and it is hard to say which of its royal and titled protagonists played the most discreditable part .

		The storm of Sedan would seem to have cleared the moral as well as the polit - ical atmosphere in
France	LOCATION	.

		There is a fine portrait of '' Lady Stuart . ''

		The second volume of the publica - tions of the American Folk-lore So - ciety bears the title ''
Louisiana	LOCATION	Folk - Tales '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and contains tales in the Creole dialect and translation , classified as '' animal tales '' of probable African origin , and `` Marchen , '' or fairy tales , probably from
India	LOCATION	.

		No examples are given of the vaudesvilles , or tales and songs , which complete the three kinds of folk-tales found
Louisiana	LOCATION	Folk-tales .

		in
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		These tales are collected and edited by
Alee Fortier	PERSON	, D.Lt. , Professor of Romance Lan - guages in

New Orleans	LOCATION	, and President of the
Folk-Lore Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Frank Preston Stearns	PERSON	's '' Life and Genius of Tintoretto '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a scholarly and well consid - ered study of the great Venetian and his art the most ambitious attempt of the kind , we think , that has yet appeared in English .

		Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	has spared no pains to make his book as complete as possible biographically , and his appreciations of the master 's style and genius are delicate and just .

		There are four well-executed illustrations in photogravure .

		Miss
Wormeley	ORGANIZATION	's translation of
Moliere -LRB- Roberts	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has reached its third volume , which gives us versions of '' Les Femmes Savantes '' and '' Le Malade Imagin - aire . ''

		The introduction to this volume is mainly de - voted to a historical sketch of the
Hotel de Rambouillet	ORGANIZATION	, which , of course , suggested the former of the two plays .

		Of the other , little is said or need be .

		Its satirical qual - ity is obvious enough , and its pathetic association with the death of the author is too familiar a fact to call for more than bare mention .

		We take pleasure in noting the completion , by the publication of a fourth volume , of the magnificent illus - trated edition of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's '' Short History of the English People '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Mrs.
Green	PERSON	and Miss Nor - gate .

		This fourth volume is in all respects worthy of its predecessors , and it would be superfluous to repeat the words of praise that we have already bestowed upon the undertaking now happily carried to a conclusion .

		The work is indeed one that '' no gentleman 's library should be without . ''

		Volume III .

		of Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's edition of '' The Writ - ings of Thomas Paine '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- has just appeared , and covers the period from
1791	DATE	to
1804	DATE	.

		It includes the peculiarly interesting years of
Paine	PERSON	's experience as a French revolutionist .

		The longest of the works re - printed are the `` Memorial to Monroe '' -LRB- 1795 -RRB- , the '' Letter to
George	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
1796	DATE	-RRB- , and the series of '' Letters to the Citizens of the United States '' -LRB-
1802	DATE	-
1804	DATE	-RRB- .

		It is safe to say that Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's labors are for the first time presenting the true
Paine	PERSON	to the eyes of his fellow-countrymen .

		A chatty , pleasantly written book , containing many curious scraps of out-of-the-way information and gos - sip , is Mr.
Henry W. Wolff	PERSON	's '' Odd Bits of History '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Such headings as '' The Pretender at Bar - le-Duc , '' `` Richard de la Pole , ` White Rose , ' '' `` Vol - taire and
King Stanislas	PERSON	, '' '' Something about Beer , '' etc. , indicate the drift of the papers , which originally appeared as review articles .

		The volume is written in a very agreeable style , recalling the author 's charming '' Black Forest Rambles '' of some four years ago .

		We learn from '' The Bookman '' that Professor
C. G. D. Roberts	PERSON	has resigned his post at
Windsor	LOCATION	,
N. S.	PERSON	, and intends to make his home in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		We can assure him of a hearty welcome from our lit - erary folk .

		Mr.
W. I. Fletcher	PERSON	will superintend a five weeks '
summer	DATE	school of library economy at
Amherst	LOCATION	this year , beginning
July 1	DATE	.

		The class will be conducted as one of beginners , and the course offered will afford an ex - cellent basis for professional training , although it can hardly be expected to transform the raw student at once into an accomplished librarian .

		Mr.
Cutter	PERSON	's '' Rules for Cataloguing '' will be the chief text-book used .

		The
Stevenson	PERSON	manuscripts , now in possession of Mr.
Charles Baxter	PERSON	, who is negotiating for their publication , include the following : ''
Vailima Letters	ORGANIZATION	, '' a sort of diary inscribed to Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	; `` St.
Ives	PERSON	, '' a romance within two chapters of completion ; a 50,000 - word fragment , complete in itself , of ''
Weir	PERSON	of
Hermis	ORGANIZATION	- ton '' ; The Great North Road , '' a tale in about 15,000 words ; a small volume of '' Fables '' ; and a series of letters to children on history .

		Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	, by the way , will be
Stevenson	PERSON	's biographer .

		The Woman 's Club of
Chicago	LOCATION	seized the occasion of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's birthday to offer a reception to the '' lit - erary fraternity '' of the city and vicinity .

		A number of brief addresses were made , those of Mr.
H. W. Ma	PERSON	- bie and Mrs.
Lindon Bates	PERSON	being noticeable for both sub - stance and point , and the affair as a whole was very en - joyable .

		Others present included Mr.
Henry B. Fuller	PERSON	, General
O. O. Howard	PERSON	,
Miss Eliza Allen Starr	PERSON	, Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	, Miss Blanche Fearing ,
Miss Lilian Bell	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Mary Hartwell Catherwood	PERSON	.

		Art other than the literary was well represented by
M. Raffaelli	PERSON	and Miss
Harriet Hosmer	PERSON	, both of whom were among the speakers .

		A literary trouvaille of extraordinary interest is re - ported by Mr.
G. C. Macaulay	PERSON	in the last '' Academy '' to reach us .

		It is nothing less than a manuscript poem of the fourteenth century which is believed to be the '' Speculum Meditantis '' of Gower the lost French poem .

		The work is thus described : '' It proves to be a poem of about 29,000 octosyllabic lines , in stanzas of twelve lines each , which rhyme a aba ab b b ab b a .

		The MS. , which appears to be of the fourteenth cen - tury , has at present 152 leaves , including one that is glued down to the binding at the beginning .

		After this first leaf , on which we have the title Mirour de lomme ' and a table of the ten parts of the poem , four leaves have been cut out , and seven more are missing in other parts of the book , besides some it is uncertain how many at the end .

		Thus the beginning and the end of the poem are both wanting ; and the object of my de - scription is partly to direct attention to the title and form of the book , in order that a perfect copy may be found , if it anywhere exists .

		Probably not much is lost at the end , for the poem seems to be nearing its con - clusion when the MS. breaks off . ''

		The work was un - earthed in the
Cambridge University Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The significant features of its career may be comprehended in the statement that in these fifteen years there has been no essential change in the form , aims , or character of the journal , beyond increased frequency of issue and a steady expansion along lines originally contemplated ; and that it continues with the same management under which it was founded .

		A further statement of what it has achieved may best be given in the words of others .

USTA	ORGANIZATION	V FRE YTA G .

		The first day of this month brought word of the death of
Gustav Freytag	PERSON	, at
Wiesbaden	LOCATION	, where he had lived in retirement since
1879	DATE	.

		Freytag has been , on the whole , the most con - spicuous figure in the German literature of the half-century now nearly ended , and of his con - temporaries among belletristic prose - writers , , not more than half a dozen Renter ,
Auer	PERSON	- bach , and
Scheffel	PERSON	among the dead ,
Hen-en Spielhagen	PERSON	,
Heyse	PERSON	, and
Dahn	PERSON	among the living can claim a rank comparable with his .

		The life-work upon which his reputation rests was practically done during the quarter-century be - tween
1855	DATE	and
1880	DATE	, and of late years , al - though not wholly inactive , he has appeared a figure of the past rather than of the present .

		But his death seems none the less a shock , and his loss will be deeply mourned by the country of which he so honored the literature , and which stands to-day in greater need than ever of the social ideals inculcated by his works .

		Freytag was born at
Kreuzberg	LOCATION	, in
Silesia	LOCATION	,
July 13 , 1816	DATE	, thus living nearly to complete his seventy-ninth year .

		The son of a physician , he received his gymnasial training at Oels , and continued his studies at the
Universities of Breslau	ORGANIZATION	and
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Teutonic philology was his special subject , and his thesis for the doc - torate , offered in
1838	DATE	, was entitled `` De Ini - tiis Scenicae Poeseos apud
Germanos	PERSON	. ''

		The years
1839 1846	DATE	were spent at
Breslau	LOCATION	as a privat-docent .

		In
1847	DATE	he married a lady of rank and wealth , removed to
Dresden	LOCATION	, and shortly thereafter to
Leipzig	LOCATION	, where he engaged in the editorial conduct of '' Die Grenzboten . ''

		His connection with this periodical was main - tained -LRB- with an intermission from
1861	DATE	to
1867	DATE	-RRB- until
1870	DATE	.

		He had meanwhile -LRB- 1867 -RRB- become a liberal member of the Nord-Deutscher Reichstag .

		When the war of
1870	DATE	came , he joined the staff of the Crown Prince , and re - mained in the service up to Sedan .

		In that year also he became associated with the new weekly paper '' Im
Deutschen Reich	PERSON	. ''

		The loss of his wife in
1873	DATE	, a subsequent marriage followed by a second bereavement , and his re - moval to
Wiesbaden	LOCATION	, constitute the remaining facts of external interest in his life .

		288 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	,
Freytag	PERSON	's literary activity began during his years as a decent at
Breslau	LOCATION	, with a volume of lyrical poems , and four dramas '' Die Brautfahrt , '' '' Der Gelehrte , '' `` Die
Valen	PERSON	- tine , '' and '' Graf Waldemar . ''

		Two other dramas , '' Die Journalisten '' -LRB- 1854 -RRB- and '' Die Fabier '' -LRB- 1859 -RRB- , complete the list of his writ - ings for the stage , although in his '' Technik des Dramas , '' published many years later , he was to do dramatic art an even greater service than that of producing so acceptable and health - ful a stage-play as kt Die Journalisten . ''

		This discussion of the principles of dramatic art , the recent English translation of which was re - viewed in THE DIAL for
February 1	DATE	of the pres - ent year , is one of the most valuable of modern contributions to the subject with which it deals , and has the added weight of coming from a highly successful writer of plays .

		Freytag 's greatest work , the novel '' Soil und Haben , '' well known to English readers as * ' Debit and Credit , '' appeared in
1855	DATE	, and at once won for its writer the most cordial recog - nition from all discerning critics , although there were not lacking those who saw in the work the apotheosis of philistinism .

		Deliberately put - ting aside the romantic ideals of contemporary German novelists , the author of '' Soil und Haben '' made of the merchant type the centre of interest , and the world of commerce that in which the scenes were laid .

		Realism of the good honest sort dominates this work , which depicts with unsurpassed fidelity the manners of a provincial town .

		Romantic elements , such as the episode of the Polish insurrection , are not lacking , but they are strictly subordinated to the controlling idea of the novel , which is that of rehabilitating in the eyes of the novel - reader those types of character which he is too apt to set lightly aside as prosaic , although they form the bone and sinew of every modern nation well advanced in the ways of civiliza - tion .

		That commercial integrity is as fine a thing as military glory , that the virtues of so - briety , patience , perseverance , devotion to the task at hand , and the performance of the hum - blest duties just because they are duties , are among the worthiest objects of endeavor these are the lessons of the work , not too obtrusively inculcated , but every where underlying its struc - ture .

		So genuine a piece of fiction is not often met with , or one that will so well bear scrutiny . ''

		Die
Verlorne Handschrift	PERSON	, '' published in
1864	DATE	, following the first novel at an inter - val of nearly ten years , is less obviously a mas - terpiece than '' Soil und Haben , '' yet it must always occupy a high rank among the best pro- ducts of German fiction .

		The story is that of a university professor , a large part of whose life is spent in the search for a manuscript of
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	, which he has reason to believe is still extant .

		His fate may be compared to that of
Saul	PERSON	the son of
Kish	LOCATION	, for , while the manuscript eludes his pursuit , he finds instead , and wins for his wife , a very charming woman .

		The book abounds in admirable passages descrip - tive of life in a university town and at the court of a petty German prince .

		The author - does not gild the commonplace as successfully as in '' Soil und Haben , '' and his attempt to be humorous must be reckoned a distinct fail - ure .

		On the other hand , the work abounds in fine , even eloquent , passages , among which the occasional characterizations of Tacitus are the most impressive .

		These , however , are the work rather of the essayist and historian than of the novelist , and our enjoyment of them has little to do with our interest in the story .

		The un - derlying purpose of '' Die Verlorne Hand - schrift '' is the exaltation of the scholar 's life , at the expense of more popular ideals , just as the purpose of '' Soil und Haben '' is the glori - fication if we may use so strong a word of the even less romantic life of the honest mer - chant .

		These two ideals , surely among the worthiest that can be urged , were and are pecu - liarly needed in
Germany	LOCATION	, where the unworthy ideals of militarism and the aristocracy are still opposed to them , and still have a stronger hold upon the nation than in most other civil - ized countries .

		The books thus far enumerated , together with the series of ''
Bilder	PERSON	aus der Deutchen Vergangenheit '' -LRB- 1859-62 -RRB- and the biography of his friend
Karl Mathy	PERSON	-LRB- 1870 -RRB- , complete the list of
Freytag	ORGANIZATION	's works up to the period of the War of
1870	DATE	.

		The outcome of that conflict , so important to every German in its political significance , must be reckoned among the in - fluences that shaped the literary activity of the novelist 's remaining years .

		The most ambi - tious of all his undertakings is that of which the execution was begun soon after
1870	DATE	, and which has represented the greater part of his literary activity since that date .

		It was during the course of the War that the plan of '' Die Ahnen '' suggested itself to his mind , and the first person to whom the project was confided was the Crown Prince .

		The scope of the pro- posed work was thus defined in the dedication : '' This work is to contain a series of freely in - vented tales , in which are related the destinies
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 289 of one family .

		It begins with ancestors of an early time , and shall -LRB- if the author retain his vigor and his interest in the work -RRB- be gradu - ally brought down to the latest descendant , a hearty fellow who is now going about under the light of the German sun , without concerning himself very much about the deeds or trials of his forefathers .

		The book aims to contain po - etic fiction , and by no means a ' history of culture . ' '

		With these introductory words may be placed the other words appended to the last volume of the series : '' The author of ` Die Ahnen ' will be gratified if the reader will con - sider the work as a symphony , in whose eight parts a melodic theme is varied , carried out , and interwoven with others , in such a manner that all the parts , taken together , form a unit . ''

		The eight sections of '' Die Ahnen '' were published in six volumes , between
1872	DATE	and
1880	DATE	.

		The first volume , '' Ingo und Ingraban , '' contains two episodes , both placed in
Thuringia	LOCATION	, and dealing respectively with the fourth and the eighth centuries , with the Germanic strug - gle against Roman domination and the later struggle of the
Franks	PERSON	against the encroaching Slavs . ''

		Das Nest der Zaunkb ` nige '' -LRB- 1874 -RRB- deals with the eleventh century and the ree 's - tablishment of the imperial power by
Henry II	PERSON	. ''

		Die Briider vom Deutschen Hause '' -LRB- 1875 -RRB- brings us to the
thirteenth century	DATE	, to the cru - sades , chivalry , and
Frederick II	PERSON	. ''

		Marcus Kb ` nig '' -LRB- 1876 -RRB- is concerned with the period of the
Reformation	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Die Geschwister '' -LRB- 1878 -RRB- consists of two parts , `` Der Rittmeis - ter von Alt-Rosen , '' placed just after the Thirty Years ' War , and '' Der Foldcorporal bei Mark - graf-Albrecht , '' placed in the times of Freder - ick
William I.	PERSON	of
Prussia	LOCATION	. ''

		Aus einer
Kleinen	PERSON	Stadt '' -LRB- 1880 -RRB- brings us down to the
Napol	PERSON	- eonic invasion and the German national upris - ing of
1813	DATE	.

		To this tale is added a '' Schluss , '' in which the latest descendant of Ingo becomes a liberal editor and political idealist of our own times .

		For a fuller account of the work , we may refer to Professor
James T. Hatfield	PERSON	's school edition of '' Der Rittmeister , '' to which we are indebted for some of the facts above mentioned .

		German fiction has few works equal to '' Die Ahnen '' in symmetry of plan and ex - cellence of execution , and no student of the literature can afford to leave the series unread .

		The temper in which
Freytag	PERSON	wrote , not only '' Die Ahnen , '' but his other books of fiction as well , may be illustrated by a '' thought '' which he contributed as a sort of motto to the English translation of '' Die Verlorne Handschrift '' made five years ago , and issued by the Open Court Publishing Company . ''

		An efficient hu - man life does not end upon earth with death ; it persists in the disposition and acts of friends , as well as in the thoughts and activities of the nation . ''

		This sense of the ideal continuity of soul-life is perhaps the main underlying motive of the best part of
Freytag	ORGANIZATION	's work ; a work , let us add , that everywhere appeals to the deep - est and best instincts of our nature .

		D -LRB- R. LOW 'S GIFT TO
COLUMBIA	LOCATION	.

		President Low 's magnificent gift of a
million dollars	MONEY	, to be devoted to a library building for Co - lumbia College , is a signal illustration of what is sometimes called the '' new philanthropy . ''

		The donor wishes the library to stand as a memorial of his father , the late
Abiel Abbott	PERSON	Low , '' a merchant who taught his son to value the things for which
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	stands . ''

		The announcement of this gift was accompanied by that of a gift from Mr.
W. C. Schermerhorn	PERSON	, of three hundred thou - sand dollars , for the construction of another depart - ment building , the giver suggesting his preference for a scientific laboratory of some sort .

		Since Presi - dent Low 's inauguration , five years ago ,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	has been made the recipient of gifts amounting al - together to more than
five millions of dollars	MONEY	, a rec - ord hardly outdone by the new
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago .

		It is , in our opinion , peculiarly fitting that the central building of a great university should be the library , rather than the laboratory or the lec - ture hall .

		The library typifies historical and hu - manistic culture , and for this the university should stand more distinctly than for anything else , al - though by no means narrowly or exclusively .

		A library building , with an adequate fund for its en - dowment , is the best of all possible gifts to a great institution of learning , and President Low is to be thanked for the wisdom of his choice no less heart - ily than for his munificence .

		C OMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE `` MISSIONARY QUESTION '' IN
CHINA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It was with regret that I noted some of the positions taken in the article on '' Far Eastern Pictures and Prob - lems , '' in THE DIAL of
May 1	DATE	; especially those relating to the '' Missionary Question . ''

		These positions seem to me very superficial , and , indeed , self-evidently un - sound ; amounting to the assumption that Christianity is not adapted to the Chinese , and therefore untrue .

		If evidence of such non-adaptation is to be found in
China	LOCATION	, certainly none of it has been presented in the article in question .

		There are plenty of places in civilized lands where Christianity -LRB- as it is commonly understood -RRB- is making no appreciable progress ; but it does not neces - 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, sarily follow that this is the fault either of Christianity or of those upon whom its claims are urged .

		The ser - vant who had '' got that Jesus pidgin '' for the revenue there was in it may be numerously duplicated in every American and English city .

		The position of the priest , who is quoted against the possibility of the
Christianiz	PERSON	- ing of
China	LOCATION	, is extremely inconsistent , and his own im - plied non-success is anything but conclusive .

		The mo - tives attributed to the suicides might with equal plausibility for anything that appears in the narrative be imputed in
Western	LOCATION	instances . ''

		Asia for the Asiatics , '' far from being a reactionary principle , as the article seems to imply , appears to me to be a perfectly sound and wholesome one .

		Surely the only adequate and hopeful development of
Japan	LOCATION	, as of any other nation , is a self-development .

		I trust that neither Mr.
Norman	PERSON	nor his reviewer would have the Asiatics repeat the experiences of our American In - dians .

		The reference to '' tireless
Russia	LOCATION	, '' at the close of the article , suggests the exploded notions regarding '' the sleeping Leviathan of the Orient '' mentioned at the beginning .


Russia	LOCATION	is no stranger to some of the conditions which have weakened
China	LOCATION	.

		I know of no evidence that the '' Missionary Ques - tion '' is a '' vexed '' one , except in the imagination of those who wish it were so .

		WILLIAM
HARPER	PERSON	.

		Americus ,
Georgia	LOCATION	,
May 4 * 1895	DATE	.

		-LSB- Our correspondent is mistaken in imputing to us '' positions relating to the Missionary Question '' advanced by Mr.
Norman	PERSON	and the missionaries he cites , and distinctly credited to them by Mr.
Nor	PERSON	- man 's reviewer .

		We must also respectfully but firmly disclaim the view , unkindly charged to us by Mr.
Harper	PERSON	, that Christianity is untrue because the Chinese do n't like it .

		Our own limited experience of
John Chinaman	PERSON	leads us to think rather better of him than Mr.
Norman	PERSON	does ; but we are not pre - pared to go the length of setting up his opinions as a general standard of truth .

		As to the Chinese sui - cides , we doubt if Mr.
Harper	PERSON	can find -LRB- even in
Georgia	LOCATION	-RRB- a single '' Western instance '' parallel to the cases given by Mr.
Norman	PERSON	; while that the
Missionary Question	ORGANIZATION	is , as Mr.
Norman	PERSON	thinks , a '' vexed '' one seems pretty fairly inferable from Mr.
Harper	PERSON	's note .

		BROWNING 'S OPTIMISM , SO-CALLED .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Agreeing with the main argument of the article on '' The Ibsen Legend '' in your last issue , may I be al - lowed to take issue with the writer on a side question ?

		It is not necessary to follow a writer in his denials , which usually represent his limitations , because we heartily concur in his affirmations , which , if he be sin - cere , represent his personal experience .

		Why should
Browning	PERSON	be classed with
Emerson	PERSON	as a builder of a royal summer-house in a fool 's paradise ?

		Is
Browning	PERSON	an optimist when he speaks for himself ?

		Indeed , the reverse seems to be true .

		So far as this earth-life is concerned , he is quite as much a pessimist as
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		The difference between
Browning	PERSON	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	in this respect would seem to be that the first , incapable of accepting the witness of reason confined to the data of terrestrial experience , imagines other data , and constantly reads back a meaning into this life which without that other life it simply could not have to any sane and conscientious observer of all its facts .

		Schopenhauer limits himself to those , and therefore reports as he sees regnant Evil !

		In '' La Saisiaz '' we have
Browning	PERSON	speaking for himself .

		`` What to me is pain and pleasure : this is sure , the rest surmize . '' ''

		I must say or choke in silence ' How soever came my fate , Sorrow did and joy did nowise life well-weighed , prepon - derate . '

		By
Necessity	ORGANIZATION	ordained thus ?

		I shall bear as best I can ; By a Cause all-good , all-wise , all-potent ?

		No , as I am a man ! '' ''

		Only grant a second life ; I acquiesce In this present life as failure , count misfortune 's worst as - saults Triumph , not defeat , assured that loss so much the more exalts Gain about to be Worst were best , defeat were triumph , utter loss were utmost gain . ''

		`` So I hope no more than hope , but hope no less than hope . ''

		Of course it remains a matter of delicate and more or less personal estimate how far this or that character speaks for its creator .

		Alas ,
Browning	PERSON	, like Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, is dramatic !

		But when we have before us such a plain confession as '' La Saisiaz '' is anyone justified in making out
Browning	PERSON	a fool , as any man must be who prefers a fool 's paradise to the world of facts ?

		no more , surely , than another can be in calling Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	`` icy , '' '' grim , '' '' egotistical , '' '' intolerably pessimistic , '' be - cause he ventures to speak the truth of this moral chaos in which we , natural lovers of Kosmos , are imprisoned .

		I would only , therefore , blame the writer of that excel - lent plea for Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's sanity -LRB- as against Professor
Nordau	PERSON	's somewhat amusing wholesale disposal of al - most all men of ability excepting his modest self -RRB- for a hasty thrust at another much maligned man .

		Is it well , in helping the public over an acute attack of '' Ibsen-o-phobia , '' to encourage the development of that other disease '' Browning-o-phobia '' ?

		-LRB- Let the hyphen - ated '' o '' in my two fantastic compounds represent the agonies of the poor demented public that is always try - ing to crucify on the charge of blasphemy its truth - tellers and chief-lovers . -RRB-

		Oh , that we would not rob
Paul	PERSON	to pay
Peter !	PERSON

		There is all the difference in the world between an optimism that is the result of ignorance and inexperi - ence an optimism that is not at all disagreeable in a foot-ball champion or a robust school-graduate and an optimism like St.
Paul	PERSON	's and like
Browning	PERSON	's , which dif - fers from frank pessimism only in its superb assumption of a yet unseen and incomprehensible hereafter and beyond : '' On the earth the broken arch ; in the heavens the perfect round . ''

		For
Emerson	PERSON	, I am not prepared to speak .

		However , I believe he can be classed with
Browning	PERSON	as a '' Tran - scendental Optimist , '' i.e. , as one who converts theoretical pessimism into practical optimism by means of an as - sumption a mere '' surmize , '' as
Browning	PERSON	calls it that '' Goodness , wisdom , power '' are not '' all bounded , each a human attribute '' ; that our present `` life , time with all their chances , changes , '' are '' just probation - space . ''

		THE DIAL 291
Efje Nefo BIGELOW	PERSON	'S IjIFE OF TILDEN .

		* We regret that while commending Dr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	's '' Life of
Samuel J. Tilden	PERSON	'' as in many respects a satisfactory book , we can not wholly commend the temper in which it is written .

		We allude more especially , as may be surmised , to the chapters relating to the dis - puted election of

Tilden	PERSON	, to have reviewed this question , on the merits of which honest and in - telligent men are still divided in accordance with their party proclivities , from any but the advocate 's standpoint .

		But advocacy is not incompatible with sobriety of judgment and language .

		Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's plea would , to our thinking , be more effective were it more mod - erate in its claims and less sweeping in its charges ; and it is very probable that not the least conspicuous result of his well-nigh whole - sale denunciation of the Republican leaders of
1876	DATE	may be a revival of half-forgotten cam - paign slanders against Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	.

		These strictures made , it should be added that Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's statement of the Democratic case is , in point of logic and evidence , an undeniably strong one perhaps the strongest yet made ; and it is the more to be regretted that its tone tends rather to provoke recrimination than to invite discussion .

		Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	was born at
New Lebanon	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	,
February 9 , 1814	DATE	.

		His father ,
Elam Tilden	PERSON	, a stanch Jeffersonian , an admirer of
Jackson	PERSON	, and a life-long friend of
Van Buren	ORGANIZATION	, seems to have been in a way the political oracle of the village .

		Young
Tilden	PERSON	's political bent showed itself early .

		While other boys of his age were at tops and marbles , he was reading
Jeffer	PERSON	- son 's writings and taking an assertive -LRB- and un - rebuked -RRB- part in the discussions of his elders .

		Mr.
W. C. Bryant	PERSON	used to tell , with much humor , of a visit of the Tildens to his office , and of the comical deference with which the father would refer to
Samuel	PERSON	for his views , and of the austere deliberation with which those views were unfolded . ''

		He appeared , '' said Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	, '' but for his size and dress , rather the eldest of the party . ''

		Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	's actual schooling was limited .

		He entered
Yale Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege in

		uating .

		In
1838	DATE	he entered the
New York University Law School	ORGANIZATION	, and in
1841	DATE	opened an office in
New York	LOCATION	where he soon secured a moderate practice .

		He had already made his debut as a political writer and speaker ; and by
1844	DATE	, when his warm friend and mentor Mr.
Van Buren	PERSON	was defeated by Mr.
Polk	PERSON	in the
Democratic National Convention	ORGANIZATION	, he was a recognized force in his party .

		In
1848	DATE	the Democratic ranks were fatally split on the sla - very question ; and Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	followed the Free Soil wing .

		The party schism , and the resulting election of .

		General
Taylor	PERSON	, the Whig candidate , determined Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	to avoid pol - itics and devote himself to his profession , in the pursuit of which he rapidly won fame and fortune .

		When , in
1856	DATE	, the Republican party was formed to combat the extension of slavery , Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	was pressed to join the organiza - tion ; but he declined , mainly for the reason that he foresaw that a Republican triumph at the polls meant civil war .

		Strongly opposed to slavery as an institution , he nevertheless clung to the old temporizing policy , trusting that time , the inherent superiority of free labor , and the changes to be wrought by the rapidly grow - ing immigration , would eventually uproot the evil .

		He accordingly voted against Mr. Fre - mont in
1856	DATE	, and Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	in
1860	DATE	.

		Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	's apprehensions of a civil conflict were not generally shared in .

		A few days prior to the election of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, says Dr.
Bige	PERSON	- low , `` he came into the editorial rooms of the 4 Evening Post , ' looking very haggard and pre - occupied . '' ''

		Intimate friends who chanced to be there at the time began to chaff him about the political situation .

		... Presently , as if suddenly filled with the spirit of prophecy , and in a tone of intense emotion , he exclaimed , ' I would not have the responsibility of
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	and
John Bigelow	PERSON	for all the wealth in the sub - treasury .

		If you have your way , civil war will divide this country , and you will see blood running like water in the streets of this city . '

		... Much as it would have grieved me , it would not have surprised me had I heard any time within ten days or ten hours that he was a raving lunatic . ''

		When , on the election of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, the storm broke , Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	at once sided with the administration , his cooperation being - qualified , however , by a difference of opinion on certain points , mainly as to the conduct of the war and the methods of providing for its expenses .

		He was for no half-way measures .

		In a conversation at the war-meeting at
General Dix	ORGANIZATION	's , in
New York	LOCATION	, he was heard to say that '' The prevailing estimate of the war impending was entirely incorrect ; that it could not be a small war ; 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, that , instead of seventy-five thousand men which had been called out by the proclamation of
April 15	DATE	, five hundred thousand at least ou ^ ht to be enlisted two hundred and fifty thousand fur immediate service , and the rest to be put in camps of instruction ; that it was idle to hope to get on , except at imnecessary sacrifice , without the advantages of discipline and without pre - paration commensurate with the territorial proportions of the belligerents . ''

		Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	opposed the Fiat-money policy of Mr.
Chase	PERSON	.

		What his own plan would have been is outlined in his Governor 's message of
1875	DATE	: '' If the federal government had paid out treasury notes not made a legal tender , in its own transactions whenever it was convenient , and redeemed them by the proceeds of loans and taxes on their presentation at a central point of commerce , and meanwhile had bor - rowed at the market rates for its bonds , secured by am - ple sinking funds , founded on taxation , and had supple - mented such loans by all necessary taxes , the sacrifice would not have been half that required by the false system adopted , perhaps the cost of the war would not have been half what it became . ''

		About
1867	DATE	, when he was sent to the
State Constitutional Convention	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	again became a looming factor in politics .

		By com - bating in that body a nefarious scheme for en - larging the
Erie Canal	ORGANIZATION	, he took the first step in the long battle for reform which is his best title to distinction , and which an unsavory member of his party is said to have styled a policy of '' pandering to the respectable classes . ''

		In
1870	DATE	he risked party disaster and his own political ruin by leading an attack on the Tweed Ring , holding that '' a million of peo - ple were not to be given over to pillage to serve any party expediency , or to advance any views of State or National politics . ''

		To Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	more than any other individual was due the downfall of the Ring , and the resulting inter - regnum of approximate judicial , legislative , and administrative honesty in the city of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The victory over
Tammany	LOCATION	led to Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	's election to the Governorship in
1874	DATE	: and his prompt declaration of war on the
Canal Ring	ORGANIZATION	, a corrupt organization embracing about an equal proportion of both parties , made it painfully clear to the raptorial elements in
New York	LOCATION	politics , not only that he proposed to continue at all costs his '' pandering '' policy , but that he meant to pursue the rogues of his own part -RCB- 7 no less vigorously than those of the opposition .

		The Canal Ring went down , as
Tammany	ORGANIZATION	had gone down before it ; and the tremendous ovation received by Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	on his subsequent tour through the '' canal coun - ties '' marked him as the inevitable candidate of his party at the ensuing presidential election .

		As Judge
Blair	PERSON	phrased it , '' he seemed the only arrow in the Democratic quiver . ''

		He had shown himself beyond cavil an able and a con - sistent champion of reform ; and what the peo - ple then wanted was , first and foremost , a re - form administration at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		That they had at that period ample reason for demanding it , will hardly be questioned .

		Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	was nominated for the presidency at
St. Louis	LOCATION	,
June 27 , 1876	DATE	; and it may be taken as a vir - tual tribute to his character that the irreproach - able Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	had been chosen , over showier and perhaps abler aspirants , as the fittest man to oppose him .

		Reviewing the election controversy of
1876	DATE	, we note the following general points : A total popular majority for Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	-LRB- on his oppo - nents ' showing -RRB- of 252,284 ; 184 undisputed electoral votes for Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	, against 166 -LRB- al - lowing him the one disputed vote in
Oregon	LOCATION	-RRB- for Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	the former candidate thus lacking one and the latter nineteen of a major - ity of the 369 electoral votes ; a disputed elec - tion in three States ,
South Carolina	LOCATION	,
Florida	LOCATION	, and
Louisiana	LOCATION	, aggregating just the nineteen electoral votes needed by Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	; the dis - ordered condition of these three
States	LOCATION	, which were still under '' reconstructed '' governments in touch with the administration and backed by federal troops ; the establishment by the '' re - constructed '' governments of Returning Boards charged each with the duty of examining the vote of its
State	ORGANIZATION	and throwing out the votes of counties in which there was evidence of fraud and intimidation ; the actual throwing out by the Boards of counties enough to reduce Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	's admitted majority of the votes cast to a minority ; the consequent receipt at Washing - ton of two sets of returns from each
State	ORGANIZATION	, one set claiming for Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	, the other for Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	; the prospective deadlock , on counting the votes , in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, owing to the fact that the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	was Republican and the
House	ORGANIZATION	was Democratic ; the appointment of an
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	of fifteen members five from the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, five from the
House	ORGANIZATION	, and five from
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	to canvass the returns and decide the issues ; and the ultimate hing - ing of the entire question on the casting vote of the odd Commissioner , Judge
Bradley	PERSON	, a Republican , who , like his colleagues , voted in accord with his party , and probably -LRB- Dr.
Bige	PERSON	- low to the contrary notwithstanding -RRB- with his judgment and conscience .

		The fundamental Democratic contention was that the Returning Boards were anomalous , illegal , and partisan
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 293 bodies , and that their control of the elections was a virtual disf ranchisement of the people : the Republicans contended that , in the then condition of the South , the Boards were neces - sary to prevent force and fraud from carrying the day .

		Touching the action of the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	, a competent observer , Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, says : '' The legal questions were so difficult , and for the most part so novel , that it was pos - sible for a sound lawyer and honest man to take in each case either the view for which the Republicans or that for which the Democrats contended , '' in short that , as in the old quar - rel , the color of the shield depended on the stand - point of the observer .

		From this tamely ra - tional view of the case , Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	, convinced , it would seem , of the total depravity of Repub - lican human nature , in effect utterly dissents .

		He is not only certain that Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	was elected and that Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	was , in the old Greek sense , a tyrant , but he has no manner of doubt that the former was kept out of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	by a shameless conspiracy , in - volving the gravest political crimes , shared in or connived at by almost every Republican leader of note from Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	down to Mr. * ' Bill ''
Chandler	PERSON	, and including Senators Sher - man and
Chandler	LOCATION	, Secretary
Cameron	PERSON	,
Stan	PERSON	- ley
Mathews	PERSON	,
General Garfield	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Evarts	PERSON	,
General Lew	ORGANIZATION	.

		Wallace ,
General Noyes	ORGANIZATION	, and so on , all of whom President
Hayes	PERSON	subse - quently '' recognized '' except , indeed , Mr. '' Bill ''
Chandler	PERSON	, who , '' not receiving a prompt reward for his services , turned upon the chromo President he had hung up in the
White House	ORGANIZATION	... and practically acknowledged that
Hayes	PERSON	had never been elected President by the peo - ple . ''

		We regret to add that Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	by no means excludes
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	Com - missioners from his indictment even intimat - ing that one of them -LRB- unnamed -RRB- was actually '' for sale '' at a stated sum of -
$ 200,000	MONEY	!

		As the author seems to have no evidence worth mentioning of the truth of this amazing story , we can not commend his judgment in print - ing it .

		Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	devotes about a hundred pages to the story of the , way in which -LRB- according to his view -RRB- Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	was robbed of the presi - dency .

		The plot , it seems , was hatched in the '' Times '' office -LRB- Republican -RRB- , on the
night	TIME	of
Nov. 7	DATE	, when enough returns had come in to convince those present of Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	's defeat .

		A leader virtually to that effect was on the press .

		At this juncture a note came from Chairman
Barnum	PERSON	of the
Democratic National Committee	ORGANIZATION	asking for news from
Florida	LOCATION	,
Louisiana	LOCATION	, and
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		This query of the ill-starred
Barnum	PERSON	was the spark that fired the train .

		It operated , says Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	-LRB- who never minces matters -RRB- , '' like an open basement window at night on a burglariously disposed passer-by . ''

		The possibilities of the situation an admitted close vote in
States	LOCATION	notoriously disordered and controlled by '' reconstructed '' governments , Returning Boards , and the like quasi-Republi - can agencies flashed at once on those present .

		They were not slow to act .

		A fresh , and mildly - jubilant , leader was prepared ; party chiefs were consulted in hot haste ; urgent , but diplomatic , telegrams were sent before day - break to the faithful in the pivotal States and the '' conspiracy '' that shortly involved in its meshes two future presidents , '' leading national statesmen , cabinet ministers , and per - sons occupying seats in the highest judicial tribunal , '' was fairly under way .

		Of its pro- gress and outcome the author gives a detailed , dramatic , and , in its way , forcible account .

		In every move of the Republicans he sees an effort , not , as they claim , to secure , but to defeat , a fair count ; and the astonished reader is left to wonder how -LRB- on Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's showing -RRB- all the virtue then extant in the country managed to get into one party , and all the vice inta the other .

		The foreign verdict is not unlikely to be , arcades ambo .

		Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	rests his case on
Florida	LOCATION	and
Louisiana	LOCATION	, where Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	had indisputably a majority of the votes cast .

		He dwells on the gathering of the Republican clans in those States ; on the massing of troops ; on the free use of money ; on the promises of protection and `` recognition '' sown broadcast by Republican `` workers '' - notably by ex - Governor
Noyes	PERSON	, '' the alter ego of Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	'' ; on the throwing out of Democratic precinct after precinct on the flimsiest of pretexts ; on the wholesale perjury and subornation of per - jury , forgery , doctoring of returns , etc. , in the interests of Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	: on the subsequent '' recognition '' by Mr.
Hayes	PERSON	of men whose proper recognition would have been a term in the penitentiary ; and , on the whole , he draws a picture too lurid to be true , and too partisan to be effective with dispassionate readers .

		Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	is often credited -LRB- as by Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	-RRB- with inducing his friends to agree to the compromise expedient of the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and thus sacrificing his ambition on the altar of peace and the common welfare .

		Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	shows that this is an error .

		Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	was not apprised of the scheme till his party were 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, firmly committed to it : and even then he com - bated it as '' a panic of pacificators , '' as an uncalled for and illegal method of deciding questions which the Constitution , impliedly , and settled precedent , had left to the arbitra - ment of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's book is exceedingly readable , and , as a biography , it leaves little to be de - sired - save on the old score of condensation .

		Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	's character is well drawn through - out , the portrait justifying
Whittier	LOCATION	's view of him as one '' Ambitious , cautious , yet the man To strike down fraud with resolute hand : A patriot , if a partisan , He loved his native land . ''

		E. G. J. STUDIES OF GREAT UNIVERSITIES .

		* Dr.
Paulsen	PERSON	's name on a title-page is a suf - ficient pledge of the value of any book in which it is found .

		In the present instance , the book is '' a translation of the Introduction to the great work in two volumes that the Imperial German Government published to accompany its edu - cational exhibit at
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1893	DATE	.

		The word '' introduction '' suggests only an approach to a subject ; but the whole work to which this one was prefixed was executed on such a broad scale as to permit , without sense of dispropor - tion , a comprehensive view of its special sub - ject .

		It is an outline , of course , but it is an outline that fills two hundred and forty pages , and is in itself well proportioned .

		The author begins with a brief chapter on the '' General Character of the German Uni - versity , '' discriminating it sharply from the French Universities -LRB- facultes ^ so called -RRB- on the one hand , and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	on the other .

		The centre of interest is contained in this paragraph : '' If we fix our attention upon the inner nature of the German university , its particular character is plainly seen to be this : It is at once the workshop of scientific research , and an institution for the highest scientific in - struction ; and for general as well as for technical scien - tific instruction .

		a wider and deeper scientific training of a general na - ture this being in particular the task of the philosoph - ical faculty .

		Like the French faculties , it offers the technical training for the learned callings of the minis - try , the bench and bar , the higher civil service , and the office of teaching in the gymnasiums .

		But beyond this the German universities are something which neither French nor English universities are : the chief seats of scientific work in the country , and with that the nur - series of scientific research .

		According to the German conception , the university professor is at once teacher and scientific investigator , and the latter feature is the more prominent , so that we must in fact say : In Ger - many the scientific investigators are at the same time the teachers of the academic youth .

		As a necessary consequence , the academic instruction is above all strictly scientific , not the training for the practice of a profession , but the introduction to scientific insight and research , holding the most prominent place . ''

		There are exceptions to the rule that the most eminent savants are university profes - sors ; but this is the rule , nevertheless .

		`` When , in
Germany	LOCATION	, we speak of a great scholar , '' says our author , '' the question soon follows : At what university is he ?

		And if he is not at any university , we may safely assume that he regards it as a slight .

		So , on the other hand , if there is mention of a professor , the question is soon asked , ' What has he written ?

		What has he achieved in science ? ' '

		The second chapter deals with the develop - ment of the German universities , the subject being divided into two heads .

		Under the Mid - dle Ages the topics are : Origin ,
Method of Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, Organization , Attendance , Con - trol of Students , Teachers , Courses of Instruc - tion , Subjects and Method of Instruction .

		Un - der Modern Times they are : The Renaissance and the Reformation , the
University Sectarian	ORGANIZATION	and Dependent upon the Established Church , the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		While the treatment here is neces - sarily pragmatical and dry , still it is broad in grasp and not unrelieved by luminous ideas .

		The student of educational progress is likely to watch with keenest interest the slow disengage - ment of the universities from the hand of au - thority and the establishment of Lehrfreiheit and Lernfreiheit .

		To
Halle	PERSON	, founded in
1694	DATE	, is ascribed '' the glory of being the first really modern university , for it was here that the lih - ertas philosophandi on which the modern uni - versity rests , the principle of untrammelled teaching , first took firm root . ''

		The signifi - cance of the change is thus marked : '' The older system of university instruction had started in each case from the assumption that truth was given , that education consisted in the transmission of this truth , and that it was the duty of the controlling powers to take heed that no false doctrine be imparted .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 The newer system starts from the assumption that truth must be sought , and that it is the proper task of edu - cation to give the skill and the impulse necessary to the search . ''

		The three succeeding chapters , '' The Ger - man Universities in their Relation to the
State	ORGANIZATION	, to the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and to the Community , '' '' Teach - ers and Teaching in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, '' and `` Stu - dents and the Pursuit of Study , '' embrace the topics of greatest living interest .

		The reader hitherto unacquainted with the subject will find the first of these three chapters throwing im - portant light on the great demonstrations made by professor * and students at Fredericksrhue on the eightieth birthday of Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	.

		The remarks on lectures -LRB- Chapter IV . -RRB-

		and on over-specialization -LRB- Chapter VI . -RRB-

		are of the greatest practical interest to American educa - tors at the present time . ''

		Of course , '' says Dr.
Paulsen	PERSON	, dealing with the second topic , '' there is no possibility of retrogression in the division of labor , upon which depend the mighty advances of scientific research .

		We are called upon , however , to oppose the spirit of special - ism , of over-narrow self-confinement , and small - souled satisfaction with one 's self ; and every one who belongs to a university is likewise called upon to help along the opposition . ''

		The remarks made , passim , concerning the relative positions of the faculties are of pecu - liar interest , furnishing no mean gauge of the movements of thought at different times .

		Thus , in the period of
Church	ORGANIZATION	domination , which closed at the middle of the seventeenth century , the theological faculty still held '' the first place , and had gained greatly in real importance ; for theological study had now become , what it was not by any means in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, a neces - sity for the whole body of clergy a natural consequence of the fact that doctrine made a vast advance and prominence as compared with ritual , first in the Protestant world and thereby also in the Catholic . '' ''

		The faculty of law , also , grew in size and importance , keeping pace with the development of the modern state and of civil service . '' ''

		The faculty of medicine had less growth to show ; it remained the weakest down to the nineteenth century . '' ''

		The philo - sophical faculty , as thefacultus artium was now called , retained in the main its former position , continuing to form the connecting link between the schools below it , which taught only the lan - guages , and the faculties above it , which gave special scientific training ; its object was to supplement the school instruction in general or philosophical science . ''

		In the present century '' we remark a change in the position of the faculty of philosophy .

		Its task used to be the general scientific preparation for special pro- fessional study in one of the so-called upper fac - ulties ; it has now become a professional school for a particular profession : that of teaching in the higher schools . ''

		With the progress of time , the teacher 's office has been dissociated from the ecclesiastical profession ; or , as our author remarks : '' Nowadays teaching has be - come an independent profession for life , and since the middle of this century , changes to church positions have been extremely rare . ''

		These few excerpts will perhaps suffice to whet the interest of the reader .

		Professor
Perry	PERSON	has done his work well , adding frequent notes and somewhat expanding the appendices .

		Dr.
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	contributes an intro - duction on '' The Relation of the German Uni - versities to the
Problems of Higher Education	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		He thinks over special - ization threatens our universities as well as those of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		He observes : '' Perhaps the division of labor can not be carried too far for the value of the product , but it can be car - ried too far for the good of the laborer . ''

		And in education , it should be remembered , the la - borer is the great end in view .

		Of all modes of approach to the German universities known to us , this book is the best that is accessible to the scholarly English reader .

		The second book on our list derives much of its interest and value from its author .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	is an Oxonian of standing , as well as a writer of standing .

		An extended account of our oldest and foremost university , such as this book is , coming from such a source , could not fail to attract attention .

		Besides going care - fully through the standard histories and the official documents , Mr.
Hill	PERSON	has read many books written by
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	men , and books written about them , and has spent time enough in
Cambridge	LOCATION	to become familiar with the spirit of the place .

		He has brought together a great amount of interesting information , which he has arranged , clothed , and commented upon in an interesting manner .

		But the discrimin - ating reader will be most interested in the book as the judgment of an Oxonian of high char - acter upon
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		This phase of it will be the more persistent to his mind , because the writer is constantly making compar - isons between
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		His atti - tude is neither censorious criticism nor fulsome praise .

		He does not hesitate to lash
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	severely for her failings , as her record on the slavery question ; but , on the whole , he is ap - 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, preeiative and sympathetic , and his general view can not fail to be gratifying to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	men .

		We call attention to one or two points more specifically .

		After speaking with much enthusiasm of the bountiful stream of contributions that con - stantly flows into the Harvard treasury , Mr.
Hill	PERSON	writes : '' We of the ancient universities may well look with wonder , and even with a certain touch of sadness , on these great doings .

		Why does not the same stream of bounty flow on
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	?

		Why , when they make known their needs , and their needs often are great , does not a generous benefactor at once arise ?


Balliol College	ORGANIZATION	, as a memorial to its famous Mas - ter , is attempting , this very year , by public subscrip - tion , to enlarge its foundation so that it may do even greater things than it has already done .

		The sum which it has received is not one-tenth part of what this Amer - ican
University	ORGANIZATION	receives almost every year ; and yet less than half a century ago the students at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	were not twice as numerous as those of Balliol at the present time .

		In
Cambridge	LOCATION	, by the great fall in rents , the salary of the Downing Professor of Medicine has dwin - dled to two hundred pounds a year .

		The post lately became vacant by the resignation of the Professor . '

		It will be somewhat difficult , ' wrote The Times , ' to obtain a suitable successor , owing to the fact that the profes - sorship is most insufficiently endowed . '

		All the fame that
Cambridge	LOCATION	ha 's gained by her great School of Med - icine apparently does nothing for her .

		In the
American Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, such an insufficiency in so important a pro- fessorship could scarcely exist ; it certainly would not last long . ''

		Only one reason is assigned for this marked disparity . ''

		Oxford is wronged by the men who , even after all the reforms which have been made , are overpaid for the work they do . ''

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	does not think Oxford teachers , as a class , are overpaid ; '' much of the work done in the Universities is but ill requited '' ; '' many a college tutor measures out his labor , not by what he receives , but by a noble zeal for learn - ing , and for the welfare of his pupils '' ; '' those who are overpaid are few in number compared with the whole body , but they are conspicuous by their position . ''

		He assures us that the greater , and the new , endowments which are so conspicuously needed , '' will flow in but slowly , if they flow in at all , so long as it is known in the country that large sums are still wasted , as wasted they most certainly are .

		No one can reproach
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	with an ill-use of her funds , '' he says : '' no one , I believe , can point to a sin - gle man who does not at least do a fair day 's work for a fair day 's pay . ''

		It is not improbable that some readers will turn with most interest to the pages of the chapter that deals with
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	's relations to the education of woman .

		Here Mr.
Hill	PERSON	deals in severe censure , pointing out that
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has been more timid and gingerly in her treat - ment of women than the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	colleges .

		Rad - cliffe College can not be the goal .

		The Cor - poration and Overseers have not been able to screw their courage to the point of giving de - serving women the
University	ORGANIZATION	degree ; '' but they are much more than half-way across the stream , and onwards they must go . ''

		He con - tinues : '' There is fear , we are told , that the full Harvard de - gree would attract so large a number of women that the new college would be overwhelmed .

		I am reminded how nearly sixty years ago our Postmaster-General op - posed the scheme of penny postage , because the num - ber of letters would be so large that the walls of the postoffice would burst .

		The letters , he seemed to think , should be kept down to the size of the building , and not the building enlarged to the number of the letters . ''

		Our third book will first attract attention by its pictorial features .

		It abounds in attractive illustrations , some of which , or perhaps all , have been already used in another place .

		The letter-press is also meritorious .

		Professor Nor - ton writes of
Harvard , Professor Hadley of Yale	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Sloane	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	, and Pro- fessor
Matthews of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The illustra - tions deal with the several periods of history impartially ; the writers , too , make some use of historical materials , but they have rightly con - ceived it to be their business to present the Universities as they are , alive and growing , rather than the processes that have produced them .

		One gets a new idea of the influence of these old institutions when he finds Professor
Sloane	PERSON	writing : '' While the
Princeton	LOCATION	which is still in
New Jersey	LOCATION	does not equal in num - bers the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
New Haven	LOCATION	, or the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
Cambridge	LOCATION	, she does not yield to them in her wider influence , for she has been the mother of many colleges , about twenty-five directly and indirectly , which are now scattered from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	for
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	is in a sense her daughter to
California	LOCATION	. ''

		And again : '' The history of the
Southern Atlantic	ORGANIZATION	and
Gulf States	LOCATION	might almost be written in the biogra - phies of Princeton graduates . ''

		The three books are all excellent examples of the bookmaker 's art .

		The second one , like the third , is amply and beautifully illustrated .

		THE DIAL 297 THE REVIVAL , OF THE ELIZABETHANS .

		* In spite of all changes of literary fashion , the Elizabethans hold their own .

		The roman - ticists brought them into vogue , but they seem destined bravely to outlive the modern classic reaction and the vicissitudes of the Isms .

		Good taste , like many other good things , goes on widening with the process of the suns , and the * polia opima of literature in the long run man - age to survive the conflicts of the critics and the battles of the schools .

		The Elizabethan lyrics still offer a rich field for the gleaners .

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's recent volume of selections from these lyrics , for the '' Athenaeum Press series , '' is a model of good editing .

		The chronological arrangement of the poems is an excellent idea , the notes are suffi - cient for the purpose , and the introduction is an admirable and judicious contribution to the criticism of the subject .

		The editor discusses with lucidity , and with an excellent sense of proportion , the lyric , its nature and definition , the chief periods in the history of the
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan lyric , the supremacy of the pastoral mode , the sonnet-sequences , the miscellanies and the song-books , the lyric work and influence of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Donne	PERSON	, and
Jonson	PERSON	, and the vari - ous Elizabethan lyrical measures .

		In one in - stance only must I take the liberty of disagree - ing with Professor
Schelling	PERSON	.

		Only by a very lax interpretation of the phrase can the '' Faerie Queene '' be cited as an illustration of the prevalence of the pastoral mode in
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan literature , as a '' pastoral romance ... allegorized and told in verse . ''

		There is a considerable pastoral element in the '' Faerie Queene , '' but the tone of the poem as a whole is hardly that of the pastoral , or even of the pastoral allegorized .

		It is a matter of some surprise that
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's lyric poems have never before been edited in separate form .

		plied an admirable general commentary upon them fin the edition of the
Spenser Society	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	's short introduction is appre - ciative and apt .

		The minor poems , however , still lack the necessary annotations -LRB- such as are supplied in overabundance for the '' Faerie Queene '' -RRB- , and the full and detailed study of their sources and literary relations .

		A volume to include such materials would make an admir - able addition to the '' AthenaBum Press Series . ''

		Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	's edition , as it stands , is nevertheless an excellent idea .

		Spenser 's rank as a lyric poet as a poet of '' the greater lyric , '' the more sustained lyric is among the very first .

		Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	is right in insisting upon this ; he is right also in insisting upon
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's great in - fluence , and right in reprinting the beautiful ''
Shepherd	PERSON	's Calender '' in its entirety ; but he is less right , perhaps , in insisting on the iden - tity of Spenser with the mysterious commenta - tor '' E. K. '' Spenser 's archaisms no longer offer any serious difficulty to the modern reader , with his constantly enlarging vocabulary of his - toric English ; we are passing out from the shadow of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's theory of poetic dic - tion and of poetic theme : the Renaissance model and the neo-Romantic model in pastoral poetry are equally interesting to us ; conse - quently nothing any longer stands in the way of our appreciation of the exquisite charm of a poem which breathes throughout the fresh - ness and magic of such verse as this : '' But friendly Faeries , met with many Graces , And lightfoot Nymphs , can chase the lingering night , With heydeguys and trimly trodden traces ; Whilst sisters nine , which dwell on Parnass height , Do make them music for their more delight ; And Pan himself , to kiss their crystal faces , Will pipe and dance , when Phrebe shineth bright : Such peerless pleasures have we in these places . ''

		Dr.
Grosart	PERSON	, in bringing together
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's love poetry , has exercised a freer principle of selection with a less happy result .

		It is highly interesting to read all of a great poet 's utter - ances on the unending theme of love ; but one may doubt the wisdom of subordinating the purely poetical motives of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's verse in this vein to the personal interest and occasion of it , as Dr.
Grosart	PERSON	does .

		Dr.
Grosart	PERSON	over - emphasizes the personal interest in the case of
Greene	PERSON	also .

		All the critical good-will in the world can not raise
Greene	PERSON	above his natural level of amiable mediocrity and picturesque pathos .

		He is remembered for a few occasional felicities , for a slight vein of grace and fresh - ness that appears here and there in his plays and prose-tales , and for his unhappy career .

		298 -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, Otherwise , as Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	says , '' he is naught , '' and the cause of better men is always injured by the attempt to push forward inferior work into the notice of the public .

		The edition of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's Poems in '' The Muses Library '' is a valuable addition to that excellent series , and the editor deserves praise for the care with which he has traced out the poet 's literary relations and his obligations to his sources .

		Drummond is an interesting fig - ure among the later Elizabethans , a gentle and fervid spirit , `` a polite and verdant genius '' is the characterization of him by Ed - ward
Phillips	PERSON	,
Milton	PERSON	's nephew , a royalist and country gentleman , a scholar and traveller , but first of all a poet , Platonist , and man of letters .

		Nature plays no small part in his verse , and he was a lover of country life : '' Ut hon - esto otio quiesceret '' was the inscription upon his house at Hawthornden . ''

		The great ex - cellence of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	is unaffected feeling and unaffected language , '' says a writer in `` The Eetrospective Review '' ; and Mr.
Ward	PERSON	, his latest editor , lays much stress overmuch stress , perhaps upon the note of sincerity and of personal feeling manifested in his early love - sonnets and madrigals .

		As to his language , it is sufficient to observe that
Drummond	PERSON	was a disciple on the one hand of
Marino	PERSON	and on the other of Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	; although his style is freer from conceits and from affectations than might have been expected under the cir - cumstances .

		He has couplets that point to the school of
Waller	PERSON	, and in style he lies some - where between
Sidney	PERSON	and
Donne	PERSON	.

		His verse is full of colors , especially saffron , azure , ver - milion , amber , rose , and sapphire .

		Fountains and flowers , sky and clouds , stars and moon and night , merles and nightingales , faraway geographical names such as
Ganges	LOCATION	,
Hydaspes	LOCATION	, Ister , and Tanais , music and odors and dreams , enter largely into his effects .

		The brother - hood in the faith of Romanticism which con - nects
Browne	PERSON	and
Drummond	PERSON	with
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley Drummond	PERSON	, like
Shelley	PERSON	, was a Pla - tonist is neither faint nor fantastic .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's introduction , largely drawn from Professor
Masson	PERSON	's
Life of Drummond	ORGANIZATION	, is ad - equate ; but for the purposes of a '' Muses Li - brary '' follows its original too closely in the amount of space devoted to the political aspects of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's career , and , like so much of modern special criticism , it is affected with the vice of exaggeration .

		Moreover , in an edition designed for the general reader rather than for the scholar alone , all of the merely unclean in
Drummond	LOCATION	's verse it is not much might better have been omitted .

		We rejoice , how - ever , that Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has seen fit to include among the poems
Drummond	PERSON	's real master - piece , the prose essay entitled '' The Cypress Grove , '' a production worthy of Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	eloquent ,
Platonic	LOCATION	, of a high imag - ination , and written in a style of exceptional fluency and delightful cadence .

		Drummond 's poetical style also is not without frequent felic - ities ; but he resembles the poets of the meta - physical school in generally affecting a slightly uneven and staccatic rhythm , licentious in met - rical transposition , although founded upon a consistent time-and-thought logic of its own .

		In his own epitaph , he is the author of two perfect lines : '' Here
Damon	PERSON	lies , whose songs did sometime grace The murmuring Esk ; may roses shade the place . ''

IVES CARPENTER	PERSON	.

		THE ART CRITICISM OF ARISTOTL.E .

		* Some hundred and fifty years ago the aver - age critic prepared himself for his task by studying the '' Poetics '' of Aristotle and the different metempsychoses which that work had taken in
Longinus	LOCATION	,
Horace	PERSON	,
Vida	LOCATION	, and
Boileau	PERSON	, in order to know the correct principles upon which to give orthodox judgment .

		Nowadays the average critic is more of a nihilist or an - archist .

		In the first place , he does n't want to give orthodox judgments ; and in the second place , he does n't busy himself much about cor - rect principles .

		If he pay any attention at all to '' the Stagirite , '' it is rather as a matter of historic curiosity than for any other reason .

		Aristotle 's '' Poetics '' is , however , not only a work of great importance in the history of criticism ; it is very stimulating even at pres - ent , and one feels it all the more after reading Professor Butcher 's edition .

		Perhaps it is not in any sense , as a brilliant if erratic critic would have us believe , '' a perfect little work of aes - thetic criticism . ''

		But it presents its subject in a manner so concise and yet so suggestive , that it always causes one to think .

		Mr.
John Mdrley	PERSON	regarded it as a disgrace to human in - telligence that men should have for so many centuries interpreted Aristotle 's dicta on trag - edy , instead of studying tragedies at first hand .

		He was not so very far wrong ; but the fact is * ARISTOTLE 'S THEORY OF POETRY AND FINE ART ; with a Critical Text and a Translation of the Poetics .

		THE DIAL 299 significant of the character of the '' Poetics . ''

		Readers of '' Some Aspects of Greek Genius '' have for some time looked forward to Profes - sor Butcher 's promised edition , and now that it has appeared it is fortunately found to be in no way disappointing .

		It presents a critical text with a translation , and then an exposition of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's theory of Poetry and Fine Art .

		This last part , which takes up two-thirds of a good-sized octavo , is an expansion and remodel - ling of the chapters on the subject in the earlier work just mentioned .

		It is not merely a criti - cism of the '' Poetics , '' but a statement of the aesthetic doctrine to be found throughout Aris - totle 's writings .

		One might perhaps think -LRB- having recollection of eighteenth century dog - matism about Unities , Fable , and the like -RRB- that a discussion of Aristotle 's theory of poetry would be somewhat dry and lifeless .

		But this book is one of the most vitalizing to one 's thoughts on art that has for some time ap - peared .

		Partly this is due to the pregnant thought of Aristotle himself , but in no small measure to the leavening power of his com - mentator .

		Those who read with delight '' Some Aspects of Greek Genius '' will find in this en - larged essay the same qualities , only a little riper , perhaps still more suggestive .

		We may mention one or two cases in point .

		The discussion of music as an imitative art , in the second chapter , is one which , in the light of musical theory at present , is full of interest .

		Aristotle could have had no conception of the power of music as developed in the last two centuries , and when he spoke of the ethical quality of music he must have had in mind something very different from the views of the advanced Wagnerian .

		But there is sufficient parallel to give life to the theory .

		In the same chapter , a remark which brings up a modern idea is that '' Art ... moving in a world of images and appearances , and creating after a pattern existing , in the mind , must be skilled in the use of illusion . ''

		The nature of illusion in general , and of artistic illusion in particular , has only of late years come to be the object of accurate study .

		But the regarding of a work of art as a cause , instead of merely an effect , and the investigation of the manner in which its own effects are produced , is sure to bring forth good results .

		Professor
Butcher	PERSON	's dis - cussion of the katharsis , in which he develops the idea of
Bernays	LOCATION	, has also its current inter - est in view of the present popularity of novels of fierce emotion and stirring adventure in an age when daily life offers little vent for some of the wilder and more elemental passions .

		Many other instances might be noted , but these will be sufficient to give an idea of the work .

		One finishes the book with increased admira - tion for the '' Poetics . ''

		When Professor
Butcher	PERSON	says of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's conception of the tragic hero , that it is incomplete and inadequate , but that '' it contains profound truth and a capacity for adaptation beyond what was immediately pres - ent to the mind of the writer , '' we feel that he is characterizing the whole treatise .

		SOME APPRECIATIONS OF
SIDNEY IjANIER	PERSON	.

		* In the little volume of '' Select Poems of
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	, '' editorial taste , insight , and discrimination are admirably blended with care - ful inquiry , minute accuracy , and painstaking labor .

		Barring a little stiffness in the excellent Introduction , the work is of a really high order throughout .

		The selections are among the choicest products of
Lanier	PERSON	's art , and admirably illustrative of the range and power of his genius .

		The Notes are especially helpful and worthy of praise .

		By every right , Dr.
Galloway	PERSON	should love
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	.

		Of the same
State	ORGANIZATION	, from the same South , with kindred tastes , the younger student of English was strongly drawn to the gifted poet-musician whose life , so heroic , so beautiful , so sad , still rests as a benediction on the great university with which his later years were connected .

		Even yet , his person , as described by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, attracts the reader : '' ... the Southerner , nervous and eager , with dark hair and silken beard , features delicately moulded , pallid complexion , hands of the slen - der , white , artistic type . ''

		His inner life was still more delicate , refined , and beautiful .

		He was the true knight , sans peur , sans reproche . ''

		His song was only singing aloud , His work a singing with his hand . '' ''

		And for my part , '' says his editor , '' I am as grateful for his noble private life as for his distinguished public work . ''

		But his was not a goodly heritage .

		Born with the divine gift of music in his soul , he was cast among a people who held it unmanly to be a musician .

		Born with the divine gift of song , and early manifesting intense longing for * SELECT POEMS OF

		All these things are brought out in a pathetically eloquent let - ter to his father , after he had determined to devote himself to music and literature . ''

		My dear father , think how , for twenty years , through poverty , through pain , through weariness , through sick - ness , through the uncongenial atmosphere of a farcical college and of a bare army and then of an exacting business life , through all the discouragements of being wholly unacquainted with literary people and literary ways , I say , think how , in spite of all these depress - ing circumstances and of a thousand more which I could enumerate , these two figures of music and poetry have steadily kept in my heart , so that I could not banish them .

		Does it not seem to you as to me , that I begin to have the right to enroll myself among the devotees of these two sublime arts , after having followed them so long and so humbly , and through so much bitterness ? ''


Sidney Lanier	PERSON	reminds me of no other En - glish poet so much as of
John Keats	PERSON	.

		It is not
Lanier	PERSON	's manner or style ; for these recall
Brown	PERSON	- ing far too much .

		But he and
Keats	PERSON	had each received a wondrous poetic gift .

		Each followed
Solomon	PERSON	's direction , '' Get learning , get un - derstanding , '' recognizing that the road lay '' through application , study , and thought . ''

		Each had had the chord of life so worn to a slender thread as to beget the ever-increasing dread that any intense feeling or ardor of cre - ative imagination would suddenly snap it asun - der .

		The American , it seems to me , did not realize as distinctly as did the English poet the truth that '' the Genius of poetry must work out its own salvation in man .

		It can not be matured by law and precept . ''

		Loving the principle of beauty in all things , and with an eye single to her service ,
Keats	PERSON	could say not only '' Beauty is truth , truth beauty , '' but also , '' A thing of beauty is a joy forever . ''

		Does any of the finer poetic principles ever permit the poet to work according to a con - scious theory ?

		Why , then , was the English poet able to reach results at twenty - five which the South - erner had not attained at thirty - nine ?

		The chief reason , I believe , was in the surroundings of the two men .

		To
Keats	PERSON	was given a literary atmosphere , the right books at the right time , the friend to listen and to encourage , the select few , clear of vision and stout of heart , whose direct gaze , fixed purpose , and lofty achieve - ment revealed the fact that there is such a place as
Mount Parnassus	LOCATION	in the universe .

		Know - ledge , literary friends , literary methods , a lit - erary atmosphere , these all came into Lan - ier 's life , but too late , I can not but think .

		He became a rare discerner of thought , as well as a passionate lover of beauty , a fine critic and an original thinker , but never the really great poet .

		I would not go so far as with Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	to say , '' I find a painful effort , a strain and rage , the most prominent qualities in every - thing he wrote . ''

		Still less would I agree with Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	in saying , '' As a master of melo - dious metre , only
Tennyson	PERSON	, and he not often , has equalled Lanier '' ; and still less with that English critic who declares that ''
Lanier	PERSON	's vol - ume has more of genius than all the poems of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, or
Longfellow	LOCATION	, or
Lowell	PERSON	-LRB- the humorous poems excepted -RRB- '' , and who considers
Lanier	PERSON	'' the most original of all American poets , and more original than any
England	LOCATION	has produced for the last thirty years . ''

		Our age has pro- duced a special kind of enthusiasm which seems bent upon creating an order or rank of men of genius '' who require something little short of genius on the part of others to recognize the special qualities which really distinguish them . ''


Lanier	PERSON	's life was indeed a true poem . ''

		He was as spotless as the ' Lady of Christ 's , ' and infinitely more lovable . ''

		But his poems are not '' simple , sensuous , impassioned . ''


Cole	PERSON	- ridge maintained that all good poetry was untranslatable into words of the same lan - guage without injury to the sense : in other words , perfect thought or feeling wedded to per - fect form and expression .

		In more than one poem ,
Poe	PERSON	succeeded in achieving this ;
Lanier	PERSON	never in any , throughout .

		How rarely do we find a line or a stanza that imbeds itself in the memory .

		This felicity of speech , with
Poe	PERSON	, as with
Coleridge	PERSON	, was an acquisition .

		This lucid - ity was remarkable in
Keats	LOCATION	, as in other poets who have left us a perfect specimen of their art .

		That
Lanier	PERSON	endeavored to exert his imag - ination to the utmost , to indulge in that exci - tation of feeling which is necessary to this peculiar felicity of choice , can not be doubted .

		He it was who said that '' the artist shall put forth , humbly and lovingly , and without bitter - ness against opposition , the very best and high - est that is within him , utterly regardless of contemporary criticism . ''

		Was he thinking more of the music of his verse or , rather , the music which according to his own theory should blend with his words than of the exquisite polish and nice selection of phrase which con - summate art alone can give ?

Sidney Lanier	PERSON	, then , though he reminds us here and there of
Emerson	LOCATION	, of
Browning	PERSON	, and of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, essayed to give artistic form to his own thoughts and feelings , to sing his own song .

		But either sufficient time was not al - lowed , or fortune did not permit him to arrive at that individuality by which the great poets are instantly recognized .

		Limited , then , as I believe he is , in regard to simplicity , to spon - taneity , to individuality , to passion , and to per - fection , he can not be called '' indisputably a great poet , '' though he does possess decided originality and a real poetic endowment .

		With this understanding , I can heartily endorse Dr.
Galloway	PERSON	's estimate : `` In technique he was akin to
Tennyson	LOCATION	; in love of beauty and lyric sweetness , to
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	; in love of nature , to
Wordsworth	LOCATION	; and in spirituality , to
Ruskin	LOCATION	, the gist of whose teaching is that we are souls temporarily having bodies ; to
Milton	LOCATION	, ` God-gifted organ - voice of
England	LOCATION	, ' and to
Browning	PERSON	, ` subtlest assertor of the soul in song . '

		To be sure ,
Lanier	PERSON	's genius is not equal to that of any one of the poets mentioned , but I venture to believe that it is of the same order , and , therefore , deserving of lasting remembrance . '' '

		The author , as the elect know , is editor of '' The Fishing Gazette , '' a collector of rare Waltons , and a practical brother of the angle withal , whom Mr.
Piscator	PERSON	himself might have been glad to fall in with on '' a line
May morn	DATE	- ing . ''

		The Common Father of all Anglers is natur - ally Mr.
Marston	PERSON	's chief figure ; and seven out of the thirteen chapters are given to him and his mag - num opus .

		The earlier writers , however , are not neglected , such pre-Waltonian worthies as
Piers of Fulham	ORGANIZATION	,
Dame Juliana Berners	PERSON	,
Leonard Mascall	PERSON	,
John Dennys	PERSON	,
Gervase Markham	PERSON	, etc. , being duly noticed and their not very important productions described and listed .

		In addition to his comments on fishing books and authors , Mr.
Marston	PERSON	draws occasionally on his own piscatorial experiences , and he gives , moreover , some practical hints and bits of information as to prized editions of the '' Angler '' which we commend to raw collectors .


Imprimis	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Marston	PERSON	lays down the sound general princi - ple : '' Beware of taking to collect books on angling . ''

		For , he feelingly adds , `` you will find yourself be - come so attached to the fascinating hobby that you would , if necessary , pawn the shirt off your back to obtain some coveted edition . ''

		A snare against which buyers are specially warned is '' the uncom - monly clever spurious editions of
Walton	LOCATION	, made by the aid of photography in
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		That this swindling game is worth the candle is attested by the fact that a perfect copy of
Walton	PERSON	's first edition has been known to bring as high as 310 the buyer thereof being -LRB- to all other appearances -RRB- a man '' clothed and in his right mind . ''

		The vagaries of the confirmed Waltonian are curious .

		One
Higgs	PERSON	, for instance , a pious Vandal , had his pet copy bound in boards that were ripped off the door of Cotton 's fishing-house , '' where he was sure old Izaak 's hand must have touched it . ''

		This copy afterwards sold for 63 . ''


Walton	PERSON	's coffin , '' adds our author , `` would not be safe from some of his ' admirers . ' ''

		Apropos of high-priced editions , Mr.
Marston	PERSON	says that '' all good Waltons go to
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Nor is this fact al - ways relished by the Briton the author relating that he recently bought a copy of the second edition under the owner 's express stipulation that it was not to cross the water . ''

		I do not see , '' he said , `` why all our rarest books should go to
America	LOCATION	. ''

		In his chapter on later editions of
Walton	LOCATION	, Mr.
Marston	PERSON	notes a German one , '' Der Vollkommene Angler , '' which , judging from passages cited , must be nearly as funny as the famous Portuguese phrase - book .

		Comically enough , the translator warns his readers against '' a certain heaviness '' in his author ; after which he proceeds to lighten him up as fol - lows : '' Ich bin wahrhaftig sehr erfreut Sie getrof - fen 7 , u haben ...
Lassen Sie	ORGANIZATION	uns keine Zeit mit Reden verschwenden , sondern uns sofort der Jagd ansschliessen .

Izaak	PERSON	's artless prattle that is most diverting .

Tegne	PERSON	' r are perhaps the most satisfactory of the collection , and we should perhaps add the chap - ter on
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	, since the greater part of it was originally written for THE DIAL .

		Certainly we owe Mr.
Boyesen	PERSON	no slight debt of gratitude for his persistent efforts to help our pub - lic to know something of Scandinavian literature .

		That literature , if we may consider its three branches as forming a single product , is only out-ranked by the three culture-literatures of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		No other modern literature , these three excepted , has a greater claim upon our attention than that which includes the names of
Holberg	PERSON	and Oehlenschlaeger , of
Runeberg	ORGANIZATION	and Tegne ` r , of
Herr Bjb	ORGANIZATION	` rnson and Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		To the '' International Humor '' ser - ies -LRB- Scribner -RRB- are now added '' The Humor of
Ireland	LOCATION	, '' edited by
D. J. O'Donoghue	PERSON	, and '' The Humor of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' edited by
Susette M. Taylor	PERSON	.

		Each of the volumes con - tains an Introduction .

		Of these , Mr.
O'Donoghue	PERSON	's is something over-long , and -LRB- taking his own anthol - ogy as a test , and not counting the extracts from such Anglo-Irishmen as Swift ,
Steele	PERSON	,
Sterne	PERSON	, and
Goldsmith	PERSON	, whose humor is individual rather than national , and is at any rate as much English as Irish -RRB- something over-laudatory .

		Irish fun is better spoken than printed .

		In print we lose the flash , the unexpectedness of the repartee a form of wit in which the
Celt	ORGANIZATION	is facile princeps .

		Lost , too , are the personal accompaniments : the droll face , the sly leer , the brogue , the indefinable something in the Hibernian make-up that renders Pat the world over , like Falstaff , '' the cause that wit is in other men . ''

		It is rather surprising , as Mr.
O'Donoghue	PERSON	says , that the Irish , under such depressing condi - tions , should have evolved a national humor at all ; and we agree with him that `` many countries with far more reason for uninterrupted good - humor , with much less cause for sadness , would be hard put to it to show an equally valuable contribution to the world 's lighter literature . ''

		The present collec - tion is a fairly representative one .

		There is a thought too much , perhaps , of the inevitable potheen and shillelah , and the boisterous ''
Whack Bubba	PERSON	- boo '' element generally ; but the better writers , Lover ,
Maginn	PERSON	, Lever ,
O'Keefe	PERSON	,
Halpine	LOCATION	, etc. , are not slighted .

		Of a decidedly fresh and original savor is '' The Humor of
Spain	LOCATION	'' tickling the pal - ate , after the broader and homelier Irish product , with a tang as of wild fruit .

		Miss
Taylor	PERSON	makes no claim to comprehensiveness for her collection , and its omissions will be patent to Spanish scholars .

		Enough is given , however , in prose and verse , from
Cervantes	PERSON	down to the small witticisms of the news - paper scribe , to make an enjoyable and a fairly illustrative volume .

		The Spaniard jokes , as he lives , with much outward decorum ; and that he is not insensible of the national humors is evident in the following quip from '' Blanco y Negro '' : '' A very ceremonious Spaniard , when asked why he was not present at the funeral of a certain person - age , replied , ' Because he owed me a call . ' ''

		The volumes are acceptably illustrated .

		A primer of American literature .

		Miss
Mildred Cabell Watkins	PERSON	is the author of a primer of '' American Literature '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- well adapted , in simplicity of style and selection of material , to the uses of children .

		The simplicity of the narrative is sometimes a little forced , but it does not degenerate into prattle , and the subject is attractively presented .

		We must enter a protest against such an expression as '' poetry was not in their line , '' and against the use of that unspeakable word '' brainy . ''

		The foot-note which describes
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	as `` one of the greatest of all writers '' may be made the subject of a possible exception ; and that characterizing
Locke	PERSON	as '' a great mental philosopher of
England	LOCATION	who first studied and de - scribed the mind '' is of course absurd .

		But the book , in the main , is well done , and deserves com - mendation .

		We note a few trifling inaccuracies , such as '' Magnalia '' for the title of Cotton Math - er 's most famous work ; the statement that Park - man 's history fills seven volumes ; and the other statement that a volume of
Lowell	LOCATION	's letters has been published .

		Nor is it quite accurate to say of Whitman that '' his style is so very , very singular , that it has been named Whitmanesque . ''

		The plan of the book includes extracts , mostly very brief , and of the sort that children would do well in commit - ting to memory .

		Dates are mostly relegated to the summaries that end the chapters .

		Recent writers are well represented .

		A more modest view than is common in text-books characterizes the majority of the critical estimates , which is well .

		A slight ex - aggeration of the Southern element in our litera - ture may occasionally be detected .

		The Hfe and `` The Life and Correspondence of correspondence of Rufus King '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , edited by RufutKing .

		Dr
Charles R. King	PERSON	, his grandson , is a publication that will extend to five large octavo volumes , and form a worthy addition to the rapidly growing library of the Fathers of our Republic .

		The edition is handsomely printed and limited to 750 copies .

		Two volumes of the series have now appeared , the first covering the thirty years of King 's early life -LRB- 1755-1794 -RRB- , the second carry - ing the record on to the penultimate year of the century .

		Nearly half a century ago the work now inaugurated was undertaken by
President King of Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, the father of the present editor , and the son of the Revolutionary orator , statesman ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 303 and diplomatist .

		It was for some reason abandoned , but we may now expect it to be brought to a happy conclusion .

		Among the papers now published are
King	ORGANIZATION	's notes taken during the Convention of
1787	DATE	, of which he was one of the foremost members , and interesting as confirmatory of the accuracy of Mad - ison 's report . ''

		A continuous narrative of King 's life , '' says the editor , `` has not been attempted throughout the work , the correspondence filling up the gaps , tied together by explanatory remarks and notes .

		In an appendix to each volume there will be found many papers of interest , containing some of the writings and speeches of Mr.
King	PERSON	during his long public career . ''

		The
Arthur	PERSON	legend Readers who are disposed to inquire and
Tennyson	PERSON	's curiously concerning the sources of treatment of it .

		& ^ ^ i nsp i rat j on or the me thods of his workmanship will find an interesting study in Dr.
Richard Jones	PERSON	's examination into '' The Growth of the Idylls of the King '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The
Arthur	PERSON	legend having entered largely into the litei'ature of all European nations , Professor
Jones	PERSON	begins his book with a survey of the development and dissemination of this legend previous to the time when
Tennyson	PERSON	took hold of it .

		He devotes him - self especially to showing that
Tennyson	PERSON	's obliga - tions to
Malory	ORGANIZATION	have been overestimated , and that , in fact ,
Malory	PERSON	has no peculiar claims to stand as the sole representative of Arthurian legend ; his own book being a compilation , and not always a happy one , of tales which were the common prop - erty of the poets of all lands .

		Tennyson 's subject - matter being thus largely the product of the imagi - nation of many peoples , widely separated in space and time , it becomes interesting to trace his use of his material , and to compare his treatment with that by other poets .

		The concluding chapter deals with the completed idylls , and shows that the plan of the poem grew as the poet wrought , and that , spite of their fragmentary mode of composition and publi - cation , the '' Idylls of the King '' is riot merely a succession of panel pictures , but one magnificent painting , an organic unity .

		A handbook T he
Public Library of Denver	ORGANIZATION	has of library issued a ' ' Public Library Hand-book '' which provides a compact body of detailed information concerning the workings and management of the institution .

		This pamphlet ought to be found extremely useful by the custodians of small collections , who are too often ignorant of the principles of library economy .

		In fact , a careful study of the book would provide a very fair substi - tute for professional training in librarianship , al - though we by no means recommend those who are in a position to get such training to neglect the op - portunity .

		The Dewey system of classification is made the basis of the sections on cataloguing , and the implication is now and then met with that a library should follow rather than direct popular taste .

		Such matters as these merely suggest that the book should be used with independent judgment .

		As a compendium of hints and directions bearing upon the minutest details of library work , the book is of a value much more than proportionate to its mod - est dimensions .

		Studies of nature Three uncommonly pretty books bear and humble life a somewhat similar type in being in
England	LOCATION	.

		studies of nature and humble life in small nooks of
England	LOCATION	, and in claiming attention rather by graces of style than by any absorbing in - terest of subject-matter .

		They are : Mr.
J. S. Fletcher	PERSON	's '' The Wonderful Wapentake '' -LRB- Mc - Clurg -RRB- , Mr.
John Watson	PERSON	's `` Annals of a Quiet Valley in the Wordsworth Country '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and Mr.
George Milner	PERSON	's '' Studies of Nature on the
Coast of Arran	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		For daintiness and attractive book-making , '' it would be hard to choose between the three , but the precedence for variety and sprightliness would have to be given to the first named ; for actual information concerning the early English laws , customs , and people , to the second ; and for poetic and literary touch in deal - ing with every-day and commonplace themes , to the third .

		Full-page illustrations , many of them fine copper-plates of much artistic value , are features of the three volumes .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A group of French texts for school use includes M. Verne 's '' Le Tour du Monde en Quatre-Vingts Jours , '' abridged and edited by Professor
A. H. Edgren	PERSON	;
M. Zola	PERSON	's '' La Ddbacle , '' abridged and edited by Dr.
Ben	PERSON	- jamin
W. Wells	PERSON	; and '' Fleurs de
France	LOCATION	, '' fifteen conies by such men as MM .

		Hale `` vy ,
Droz	PERSON	, Coppde , and
E. Daudet	PERSON	, edited by
M. C. Fontaine	PERSON	.

		These three are from
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		send a selection , edited by Professor
L. Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	, from the poems and comedies of
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	, in - cluding three plays , and such poems as the four '' Nuits . ''

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish Mr.
E. E. M. Creak	PERSON	's edition of '' La Poudre de
Soissons	LOCATION	, '' by
Dumas	PERSON	pere , a very small book indeed .

		The '' Atlas of Classical Antiquities '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , prepared by Dr.
T. Schreiber	PERSON	, and edited for English use by Professor
W. C. F. Anderson	PERSON	, offers to English students at a moderate price one of the best reference works produced by recent German scholarship .

		The work is in form an oblong quarto , with one hundred full-page plates , each of which has one or more pages of descriptive text .

		The subjects are classified , those of the Drama , Religion , Athletics , Armor , and Arts and Crafts being especially noteworthy for fullness of illus - trative treatment .

		The work is very attractive in all respects .

		The work of the crammer is not so much in demand in
America	LOCATION	as in
England	LOCATION	, but the publishers of '' The University Tutorial Series '' have concluded to estab - lish a
New York	LOCATION	agency for the sale of their series of compact handbooks -LRB-
W. B. Clive	PERSON	-RRB- .

		We have received the following numbers : '' An Elementary Text-Book of Heat , '' by Mr.
R. W. Stewart	PERSON	; `` An Elementary Text - Book of Hydrostatics , '' by Messrs.
William Briggs	PERSON	and 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	,
G. H. Bryan	PERSON	; an edition of '' De Amicitia , '' prepared by Messrs.
A. H. Allcroft	PERSON	and
W. F. Mason	PERSON	; and one of the '' Phsedo , '' edited by Messrs.
C. S. Fearenside	PERSON	and
R. C. B. Kerin	PERSON	.

		In addition to the recently-noticed modern language publications of Mr.
W. R. Jenkins	PERSON	, we have since re - ceived a number of others from the same house . ''

		Lectures Faciles pour 1 ` Etude du Francais , '' by
M. Paul Bercy	PERSON	, is a volume of simple prose texts , with annotations . ''

		Simples Notions de Frangais , '' by the same author , is a picture-book for very youthful begin - ners . ''

		Mme.
Beck	PERSON	's French Verb Form '' is not ex - actly a book , but rather a sheaf of blanks to be filled out by students with selected conjugations .

		It is a use - ful piece of apparatus for the teacher . ''


Partir & Tiempo	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Don Mariano Jose * de Larro	PERSON	, is a one-act comedy , edited by Mr.
A. W. Herdler	PERSON	, and forming a number of the '' Teatro Espanol '' series .

		The
Northwestern University of Evanston	ORGANIZATION	has issued a handsome pamphlet report of the exercises at the open - ing of the
Orrington Lunt Library Building	ORGANIZATION	,
September 26 , 1894	DATE	.

		Two full-page plates give us a photograpli of the building and a portrait of the donor .

		The '' ex - ercises '' include the address of presentation and accept - ance , a dedication ode by Mrs.
Emily Huntington Mil	PERSON	- ler , some remarks by President
Adams	PERSON	of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and a lengthy address on `` The Develop - ment of the Library , '' by Dr.
Justin Winsor	PERSON	, who was the special guest of the occasion .

		The
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	is the publisher of two doctor 's dissertations recently sent us .

		Mr.
Edwin Seelye Lewis	PERSON	, of
Princeton	LOCATION	, has for his subject '' Guernsey : Its People and Dialect . ''

		Mr.
Lewis	PERSON	made two visits to
Guernsey	LOCATION	, and mingled with all classes of its population .

		A similar study is that of '' The Phonology of the
Pistojese Dialect	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
James Dowden Bruner	PERSON	, recently of the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, and now of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		The writer 's material was collected during a six months ' stay in
Pistoja	LOCATION	and the surrounding villages .

		Both of these dissertations are pieces of solid and conscientious workmanship , and well illustrate the zeal of our younger men in the pursuit of their chosen sciences .

		Messrs.
Eldredge & Bro	ORGANIZATION	.

		publish a neat leather - bound pocket edition of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It will go into the smallest of vest-pockets , and contains , besides the text , a bibliography , an analytical index , the dates of ratification of the instrument , and the dates and manner of ratification of the several amendments .

		The text has been carefully compared with the original in the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	, and what little editing the booklet needed has been done by Pro- fessor
Francis N. Thorpe	PERSON	.

		Two new editions of the novels of
Smollett	PERSON	, inaugur - ated almost simultaneously , call for a word of praise .

		One is an edition to
Bohn	PERSON	's '' Novelists ' Library '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , and gives us `` Peregrine Pickle '' in two vol - umes , and ''
Roderick Random	PERSON	'' in one .

		The familiar style of this '' Library '' makes further description unnec - essary .

		The other edition , of which ''
Roderick Ran	PERSON	- dom , '' in three volumes , is now issued , is edited by Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	, and is published , in close imitation of the Dent editions of English Classics , by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	in this country , and by
Messrs. Gibbings & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	.

		The beautifully-printed polychrome edition of the Old Testament texts , edited by Dr.
Paul Haupt	PERSON	and published in this country by the
Johns Hopkins Press	PERSON	, was described by us some time ago in connection with the `` Job , '' which inaugurated the series .

		``
Leviticus	LOCATION	'' and '' Samuel '' are the two parts now issued , the former edited by Professor Driver and the Rev.
H. A. White	PERSON	, the latter by Professor
Budde	PERSON	of
Strassburg	LOCATION	.

		Two col - ors suffice for the former text , while no less than eight are required for the latter .

		The price of these texts is very low , being made considerably less than cost by the generosity of a modest American Msecenas .

		Dr.
A. H. Edgren	PERSON	has prepared a new translation of '' Sakuntala , '' or , as he spells it , '' Shakuntala , '' and the book is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two previous translations into English are those of Sir
William Jones	PERSON	and Sir
M. Monier	PERSON	-
Williams	ORGANIZATION	, respec - tively dating from
1789	DATE	and
1856	DATE	.

		The present trans - slator has aimed at a more literal version than his pre - decessors .

		The metrical passages are in unrhymed iambic tetrameter .

		We are surely entitled to three En - glish translations of this great work , in view of the fact that the Germans have a dozen or more . ''

		On the Eve , '' that masterpiece of absolutely flaw - less art , appears as the third volume in Mrs.
Garnett	PERSON	's new translation of the novels of Tourgue `` nieff , having been preceded by ''
Rudin	PERSON	'' and '' A House of Gentle - folk '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	writes the introduction , which is in the main an adequate appre - ciation , although the figure of Insaroff appears a failure to the critic -LRB- which it emphatically is not -RRB- , and although too tendenzios a character is ascribed to the novel .

		A library edition of '' The Surprising Adventures of
Baron Munchausen	PERSON	, '' imported by Messrs.
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons , is an unexpected but not unwelcome acces - sion to our shelves .

		The edition is made particularly valuable by Mr.
Thomas Seccombe	PERSON	's lengthy introduc - tion , which discusses the origin and fortunes of the work .


Rudolph Erich Raspe	PERSON	is accepted as the author by Mr.
Seccombe	PERSON	, and some account of his life is given .

		The original text of
1785	DATE	is here reproduced , together with the successive enlargements down to the seventh edi - tion , published in 1 793 .

		Although
Rowlandson	PERSON	,
Cruik	PERSON	- shauk , and Dore * are numbered among the many illus - trators of this work , the present edition , instead of drawing upon the older artists , is supplied with a new set of drawings by Messrs.
William Strang	PERSON	and
J. B. Clark	PERSON	.

		LITERARY NOTES .

		M.
Gaston Boissier	PERSON	has been elected Secretary of the French Academy , to succeed the late
Camille Doucet	PERSON	.

		The
Peter Paul Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Buffalo	LOCATION	have recently purchased '' The Magazine of Poetry , '' and expect to enlarge the magazine by the addition of several new features .

		Professor
Hugo Miinsterberg	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, on behalf of the American members of the
Helmholtz Monument Committee	ORGANIZATION	, invites subscriptions for the proposed me - morial to the great scientist .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	is reported as saying that `` Sig .


Gabriele d'Annunzio	PERSON	and Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	are probably the most gifted persons under the age of thirty now writ - ing verse in any part of the world . ''

		The
University Extension Summer Meeting	ORGANIZATION	at
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	will extend from
June 29 to July 26	DATE	.

		History and political science will be the main subjects , and the lecturers include Professors H.
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305
C. Adams	PERSON	,
A. B. Hart	PERSON	,
J. W. Jenks	PERSON	,
W. G. Sumner	PERSON	, and
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	, the Rev.
E. E. Hale	PERSON	, and Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	.

		We understand that the new series of translations of
Tourgudnieff	ORGANIZATION	's novels will be supplemented by a uniform collection of the short stories .

		We trust that the re - port is true and that the collection will be an absolutely complete one . ''

		Should the elementary study of grammar be chiefly inductive ? ''

		is the question put and affirmatively an - swered by Professor
Starr W. Cutting	PERSON	in a reprint of the proceedings of the last meeting of the Modern Lan - guage Association .


Italy	LOCATION	may be having a hard time of it politically , and may be upon the verge of national bankruptcy , but lit - erary production goes on uninterrupted .

		No less than
9416	DATE	volumes are reported for the past year , nearly two thousand of them coming from
Lombardy	LOCATION	.

		The
Burrows Brothers Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, will in the fall begin publication of their great projected edition of the '' Relations des Je `` suites , '' with a complete text and page-for-page translations .

		There will be about sixty volumes , appearing ' monthly , and the edition will be limited to 750 copies .

		Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	has written a letter to the Rev.
F. D. Greene	PERSON	, author of '' The Armenian Crisis in
Turkey	LOCATION	, '' expressing the belief that the work '' will materially as - sist in rousing public attention to the recent outrages in
Armenia	LOCATION	, which almost pass description , and have in - flicted indelible disgrace on the Sultan of
Turkey	LOCATION	and on his officers and soldiers concerned in perpetrating , in denying , and in shielding them . '' ''

		The Proofsheet '' is the name of a modest periodi - cal , published monthly at 232 Irving avenue ,
Chicago	LOCATION	, whose conductors are making it of practical value to writers and correctors for the press .

		An example of its usefulness is the publication , in its
May	DATE	issue , of a list of words variously spelled by the four dictionaries chiefly used in this country the International -LRB- Web - ster 's -RRB- ,
Worcester	LOCATION	's , the
Century	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Standard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The words are over six hundred in number , and are ar - ranged in parallel columns so as to show the variations at a glance .

		Chancellor
James Hulme Canfield	PERSON	, of the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	, has accepted a call to the presidency of the
Ohio State University	ORGANIZATION	at
Columbus	LOCATION	, and will assume his new duties with the coming academic year .

		This step is full of significance and promise for the fortunes of the
Ohio	LOCATION	institution .

		Dr.
Canfield	PERSON	's reputation has been won in various fields of activity , each of which seems to have added its element of strength to the char - acter of the man .

		Born in
Ohio	LOCATION	, reared and educated in
New England	LOCATION	, attorney and school-superintendent in
Michigan	LOCATION	, professor in
Kansas	LOCATION	, and college president in
Nebraska	LOCATION	, he has now , in the fullness of his powers and the ripeness of his experience , returned to his native State , to take his place at the head of her system of public instruction , and to perform , it is hoped , for
Ohio	LOCATION	, that service which he has so loyally and successfully ren - dered to
Nebraska	LOCATION	.

		It may as well be admitted that the task before him has its perplexities .

		Ohio is now an old
State	ORGANIZATION	, with many persistent strains of immigration , many sharp lines of cleavage in politics and morals , many re - ligious denominations , and a rather unfortunate we will not say a bad eminence in higher education , hav - ing more than three dozen colleges within her borders .

		But '' Res servera est verum gaudium '' and the com - plexity of the problem must constitute , to such natures as Dr.
Canfield	PERSON	's , its attraction and its inspiration .

		Dr.
James Martineau	PERSON	celebrated his ninetieth birth - day on the
23rd of April	DATE	, and was duly congratulated by a deputation from
Manchester College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The address said , among other things : '' We recognise the dignity and honour conferred on the college by your connexion with it as professor , principal , and president , associating its name with your high service to religious philosophy .

		And to the spirit infused into the life of the college by your steadfastness always to the free teaching and the free learning of theology , it largely owes its constant fidelity to this fundamental principle . ''

		Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	made an interesting reply , in which he briefly reviewed his life , touching upon the influences by which it had been shaped , and indicating the future development , in his opinion , of religious philosophy .

		Particularly interesting was his statement of the two influences which claimed special consideration in his retrospect . ''

		One was the literature which had come to this country from the
United States	LOCATION	, chiefly from the pen of Dr.
Chauning	PERSON	.

		He remembered when Dr.
Chan	PERSON	- ning 's teachings were regarded by some of the older men with disfavor amounting even to bitterness ; but he himself , in common with many of the younger men in his day , had been greatly touched by the deep spir - itual humility and search after personal holiness which characterized that great man 's preaching .

		Another in - fluence was that of the Evangelical literature associated with the name of
Wilberforce	LOCATION	, of which he became aware only by accident . ''

		The '' Memoirs of Barras '' appear simultaneously in the
United States	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Beyond all question they will be eagerly read by lovers of Napoleonic and Revolutionary lore , by the historian and the searcher after new and entertaining anecdote .

		The import - ance and historical value of these memoirs may be judged from the fact that for over half a century historians and publicists have been clamoring for their publication .

		Barras was plainly a person of consequence in the turbulent
Paris	LOCATION	of the Revolution and
the Directorate	ORGANIZATION	.

		He touched shoulders with all the leaders .

		He was the patron almost the discoverer of the obscure Lieutenant
Bonaparte	PERSON	, as he was the implacable foe of the Emperor
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		He lived to be the counsellor of kings .

		He was as much at home in the salon of a great lady as in the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, and he knew the gossip of society as well as he knew the decrees of the Deputies .

		He was a good hater .

		The lash of his tongue was sharp , and he spared neither man nor woman .

		Pages of the `` Memoirs '' record his dislikes and his retaliations .

		If he heard a discreditable report about an acquaintance , he imparted it to his confidential blank-books .

		Barras was a sharp observer looking on at history in the making , and his time becomes the more intelligible to us for his interpretation of it .

		A man more qualified than the author for the production of this book it would be difficult to find , for Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	is not only a man of letters , a diplomatist , and a journalist who , for upwards of a generation , has discussed public affairs of the largest significance , but he was bound to the subject of his book by intimate personal acquaintance and by a community of political traditions and sympathies .

		The result is that we have here a complete and vivid portrait of a memorable figure in the public life of the Empire commonwealth and of the nation , and also materials of great value for the political history of the country during the momentous period that intervened between
1830	DATE	and
1880	DATE	. ''


New York	LOCATION	Sun . ''

		Politics aside , the figure of
Tilden	ORGANIZATION	will always be one of the most interesting in American history ; all the more interesting as time brings to view the phenomenal contrasts in his life and character .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's book furnishes material in ample quantity for the study of many of these contrasts . ''


New York	LOCATION	Tribune . ''

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's long and close intimacy with
Tilden	PERSON	, and his own large experience in politics and in authorship , made him naturally the lit - erary executor of his friend , as he was a trustee of his estate .

		The resulting biography , now before us , has an assured historical value , corre - sponding to the importance of Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	's career . ''

		330 THE SUMMER SCHOOL .

		Observers of our educational activity can - not fail to have been impressed by the recent growth of the
Summer School	ORGANIZATION	.

		The phase of educational work represented by that deserving institution attracts yearly more and more atten - tion , and every recurrent
summer	DATE	season offers to the ambitious student a wider choice among places and subjects .

		In the earlier chapters of its history the outcome of private initiative , the organized forces of American education soon perceived the possibilities of the
Summer School	ORGANIZATION	as a supplementary educational process , and now associate themselves unequivocally with its work .

		The imposing list of gather - ings more or less educational in character , planned for the present year , as presented in the
May	DATE	'' Review of Reviews , '' gives some idea of the dimensions to which the work has grown , and even this list is admittedly incomplete . ''

		More than one hundred Summer Schools , '' we are told , '' will be in active operation in the
United States	LOCATION	during the coming season . ''

		Perhaps the best indication of the extent to which Summer Schools have become an ac - cepted factor in our educational work is afforded by the Report of the
United States Commis	LOCATION	- sioner of Education for 1891-92 , just issued from the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		For this Report , a special investigation of the subject of Summer Schools was made by Dr.
W. W. Willoughby	PERSON	, and the results of that investiga - tion may well be considered surprising even by those fairly familiar with the subject .

		Every new educational movement finds dis - senters , and there is involved in this growing utilization of the
summer	DATE	months for educa - tional purposes a fundamental principle that can not be altogether ignored .

		There are some who will see in the movement merely another indication of that hurry and unrest so charac - teristic of American life in its other phases , and who will claim that our
summer	DATE	vacations ought to be devoted to their primary purpose of relaxation and recreation .

		And there is no doubt that we need really to rest at times , to break the process of over-stimulation , to give our weary nerves an opportunity to renew their dissipated energies .

		The best work is not , as a rule , done by those who toil for the greatest number of hours or days , but rather by those who so shape their lives as to maintain the working period at its highest potency .

		Yet it must not be forgotten , on the other hand , that the truest rest is not that of torpor or lethargy , but is rather to be sought in variety of interest or aim .

		And the
Summer School	ORGANIZATION	, carried on as it usually is among the mountains or by lakeside and seashore , means for the most of us so complete a change of environment that it may bring recuperation to the tired brain even although that brain persist in the moderate exercise of its habitual function .

		At all events , the objections of the dissenter are minimized , and need not be taken very seriously .

		Some sympathy may indeed be demanded for the officers and instructors of the
Summer School	ORGANIZATION	, since to them , more nearly than to the average student , the work done is a continuation of the kind of work they have been doing all the rest 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, of the year , and the sacrifices they are called upon to make are not inconsiderable .

		There is something wrong about a system which pre - tends that nine or ten months of work are enough for the teacher , yet which compensates him so inadequately for that work as to force him to eke out his income by working on for the two or three months remaining .

		As long as any large proportion of the instruction in our Summer Schools is done by men thus compelled to do it , not only will the efficiency of the Sum - mer School suffer , but the tone of the whole educational profession will remain lower than it ought to be .

		Historically , the
American Summer School	ORGANIZATION	begins with the establishment , in
1872	DATE	, of the Zoological Laboratory on
Penikese Island	LOCATION	, under the direction of
Louis Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	.

		That fa - mous school , which had but two sessions , was the progenitor of the
Chesapeake School of the Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, the schools at An - nisquam and
Wood	ORGANIZATION	's
Holl	PERSON	, and the school of the
Brooklyn Institute	ORGANIZATION	on
Long Island	LOCATION	.

		These biological schools form a group by themselves , and no one can question the great importance of the work they have done in original research and the training of specialists .

		Allied to them are the schools forming the second group in Dr.
Willoughby	PERSON	's classification , described as '' Summer Schools giving instruction in single subjects . ''

		Towards this group the
Concord School of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, opened in
1879	DATE	, occupies the historical relation of the
Penikese Labora	LOCATION	- tory to the schools of the biological group .

		The
Concord School	ORGANIZATION	had ten annual sessions , the last of them , in
1888	DATE	, being limited to an Al - cott memorial service .

		Of its several succes - sors , the most direct , if we take both spirit and organization into account , is the school con - ducted by Mr.
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	, for a few years at
Farmington	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, afterwards and still at a secluded spot in
Keene Valley	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, beautifully situated in the heart of the
Adirondacks	LOCATION	.

		It is now called the
Glenmore School	ORGANIZATION	, and is devoted to the culture sciences .

		The
Plymouth School of Applied Ethics	ORGANIZATION	, in - augurated in
1891	DATE	, mainly through the efforts of Dr.
Felix Adler	PERSON	, may also be considered here .

		It represents the highest scientific plane yet reached by the schools of this group , and its field and influence have broadened with every succeeding year of its existence .

		We have not space even to name the remaining schools de - voted to special subjects , conspicuous among which are the many flourishing schools of music and the languages dotting the country from
East to West	LOCATION	.

		And we must also pass by with - out mention the countless
summer	DATE	institutes and other schools for the training of teachers that are every year pursuing their silent but effective work of raising the standard of the teaching profession in our country .

		The Chautauqua system , with its ever broad - ening scope , and its countless ramifications , must have a paragraph to itself .

		It is estimated that more than one person in every hundred of our entire population visits the yearly gather - ings of the various schools organized upon the Chautauqua plan , if not directly controlled by its management .

		The beginnings of this sys - tem are to be looked for only a score of years back .

		In
1874 occurred the first summer	DATE	meet - ing on the shores of
Lake Chautauqua	LOCATION	, planned by Mr.
Lewis Miller	PERSON	and Dr.
John H. Vincent	PERSON	.

		From this first meeting , attended by some six hundred students from all parts of the coun - try , there has sprung the system of popular education whose name is now a household word throughout the land .

		The Chautauqua
Assem	PERSON	- bly proper provides a great variety of courses in history , literature , language , science , and pedagogics .

		The
College of Liberal Arts	ORGANIZATION	, superadded in
1879	DATE	, offers courses of a more exacting character , having much of the char - acter of regular college work , and , like such work , leading to degrees that are not so lightly bestowed as some people imagine .

		Then there are the outlying Chautauqua assemblies , a num - erous progeny , held in attractive spots scat - tered all over the country .

		More than sixty of these assemblies attest the fertility of the fun - damental Chautauqua idea of combining in - struction with recreation .

		It is easy to scoff at the work of these assemblies , and to point out the obvious fact that they are in no sense substitutes for the colleges proper ; it is easy to visit any one of them , and have an eye for its vacation aspect alone ; it is easy , also , to talk about scrappiness and superficiality ; but all comment of this sort is beside the mark .

		No one can take a close view of the Chautau - qua work without recognizing in it a very shrewd and practical application of possible means to a highly desirable end ; no one can take a broad view of the work without seeing that it is a factor of appreciable importance in our educational life .

		In conclusion , we must say a few words about the steadily increasing amount of sum - mer work undertaken by the universities them - selves , with the aid of their organization , equipment , and scientific methods .

		In a cer -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 315 tain sense , the
Penikese Laboratory of Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	should open this chapter of our history , for it was the evident utility of such an enterprise that led to the organization of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	summer courses , which have , since
1874	DATE	, formed a regular department of the work of that Uni - versity .

		Scientific subjects have mainly occu - pied these courses , and the work has been chiefly planned to meet the needs of teach - ers .

		These Harvard courses emphasize the im - portant principle that pedagogic instruction should not be purely theoretical , but should rather take up , although still with pedagogic intent , some concrete branch of knowledge , and , in teaching its substance , at the same time convey an acquaintance with the methods that its teachers should employ .

		The Univer - sity of
Virginia	LOCATION	was also a pioneer in the work of
Summer Schools	ORGANIZATION	, and its School of Law was started as early as
1870	DATE	, although it remained in an embryonic state until
1875	DATE	.

		One institution after another has since fallen into line , and
summer	DATE	work is now done at
Cornell , Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Stanford	LOCATION	, and many of the
State Universities	ORGANIZATION	of the
West	LOCATION	.

		The University Ex - tension movement is also taking possession of the
summer	DATE	field , and such a programme as that offered for the coming season at the Uni - versity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	is really extraordinary in its scope and interest .

		It remained , how - ever , for the new
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	first to occupy the position that the
summer	DATE	months are just as good as any others for full univer - sity work in all departments , and first to offer the example of a great institution of learning open to students from one end of the year to the other .

		The results of a first season , and the now completed arrangements for a second , all go to show that President
Harper	PERSON	had reason to attach great importance to this unprece - dented feature of the
University	ORGANIZATION	planned by him .

		At a single bound this new educational departure has passed from the experimental stage to the stage of successfully accomplished fact , and
summer	DATE	education has entered upon the most serious phase that it has yet known in this country .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THE ANTIQUITY OF GREEK LYRIC POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The most competent of American students upon the literary side of classics , reviewing in your columns
Jebb	PERSON	's '' Classical Greek Poetry , '' assures us most em - phatically that we may rely upon the absolute accuracy of the outlines and proportions in this general sketch of Hellenic literature .

		I heartily agree with this judg - ment -LRB- lamenting only that Mr.
Jebb	PERSON	's limits , and Greek sense of proportion , compelled him to omit altogether such fascinating chapters as the Epic Cycle , the
Hom	PERSON	- eric Hymns , etc. -RRB- , and quote it only as an excuse for craving space in your pages to try and point out a single seriously doubtful statement , in a volume which puts every Philhellene under renewed obligations .

		Professor
Jebb	PERSON	declares -LRB- page 35 -RRB- , '' The true epic poetry had finished its course before the earliest lyric strains were heard . ''

		That our earliest authentic remains of literary lyric are those of Callinos and Tyrtseus in the seventh century B. c. , and that the real epic had then already run its course , is unquestioned .

		But Pro- fessor
Jebb	PERSON	's statement , often repeated elsewhere in his volume , is far more sweeping .

		It seems on general grounds quite certain that such a people must have had the '' service of song '' in the more purely personal and social relations of life , cen - turies before Callinos , or even before the stately epic arose .

		The hexameter itself probably represents the doubling of a lighter metrical unit , more suited for personal utterance , perhaps the progenitor of Anacreon 's verse with three accents .

		Even such a mythic figure as Orpheus seems like a survival , not the pure invention of a later age .

		But we may fairly appeal to the evidence of the
Hom	PERSON	- eric poems themselves , to which Mr.
Jebb	PERSON	also has recourse for his conception of the epic minstrel .

		Even if we accept the author 's own rigid definition of epic as '' poetry which was recited , not sung to music '' -LRB- page 32 -RRB- , we need turn but three leaves to find his own transla - tion of the beautiful Homeric passage , describing the '' minstrel whom the gods have taught to sing words of yearning joy to mortals . ''

		But in the larger and more important sense , lyric poetry is surely traceable , in many of its most charac - teristic forms , to the heroic age .

		Of course the pass - ages we cite are perfectly familiar to every Homeric student , indeed , they may have come into our own notebook from Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's still more scholarly earlier manual on Homer , but they do perhaps prove the point , that even he has for once yielded to the pecul - iar temptation of the popular lecturer , and made too sweeping a general statement .

		So early as
Iliad I.	ORGANIZATION	, 473 , we hear the '' Youthful Ach ; eans singing the beautiful paean , Chanting the
Archer	PERSON	's praise '' : And again as a token of triumph the same song is in - tuned , at the great crisis of the plot , when Achilles ex - ults over the dead Hector -LRB- Iliad xxii. , 391-2 -RRB- : '' Come now let us sing our paean , sons of Achaeans , While to the ships we march . ''

		The Dirge must be equally prehistoric , and is plainly alluded to in the lament for Patroclus at
Iliad xix.	ORGANIZATION	, 301-2 , and still more clearly in the mourning for Hec - tor at
Iliad xxiv.	ORGANIZATION	, 720-722 .

		Achilles himself holds the lyre in hand , and sings the `` glories of heroes . ''

		Here , however , Homer may be quietly claiming the high-born hero as one of his own epic school !

		But it can hardly be necessary to multiply citations .

		That immediate im - pulsive expression which we call lyric must surely be almost everywhere the oldest form of rhythmical and musical utterance .

		The freaks that
Time	ORGANIZATION	's gusts have played with the loose Sibylline leaves of recorded tradi - tion is a very different matter .

		316 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, THE NEW COLERIDGE LETTERS .

		* The revival of general interest in the life and works of
Samuel Taylor Coleridge	PERSON	is partly traceable to the excellent Life of him written by Mr.
James Dykes Campbell	PERSON	as an introduc - tion to the single-volume edition of his poems .

		Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's biography , though very concise , contains much new matter , and this was mainly drawn from a mass of then unpublished letters in the custody of Mr.
Ernest Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	, a son of
Derwent Coleridge	PERSON	, the poet 's second son .

		A selection of these letters , together with other important ones already printed , is now issued by Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	in two large and elab - orate volumes under the title of '' Letters of
Samuel Taylor Coleridge	PERSON	. ''

		While the work will not place its author beside his friends Lamb and
Southey	PERSON	as a letter-writer , or even rank him a good second to those masters of episto - lary style , it forms , when read in the light of Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's lucid sketch , a biographical record as full and searching as the most curi - ous Coleridgean can reasonably ask .

		That the record is essentially a painful one we need scarcely say the story , mainly , of a life of un - bounded promise and fragmentary performance ; of splendid powers thwarted by sordid failings and congenital defects .

		The tale of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's shortcomings is familiar enough in its general features .

		His friends and his critics have freely deplored his infirmity of will ; his indolence , unthrift , unreliableness ; his slavery to opium ; his desertion of his family -LRB- for it was nothing less -RRB- ; his small pecuniary shifts ; his aimless drifting from shelter to shelter , content to pay for his lodging with his mellifluous talk , and taking no thought for the morrow , his creditors , his publishers , or his promises , so long as he had the means to satisfy his present craving for '' the Kendal Black Drop . '' ''

		I give it to you as my deliberate opinion , '' wrote
Wordsworth	PERSON	in
1809	DATE	, '' that he neither will nor can execute anything of important benefit to himself , his family , or mankind ; all is frustrated by a de - rangement in his intellectual and moral consti - tution .

		In fact , he has no voluntary power of mind whatever , nor is he capable of acting under any constraint of duty or moral obliga - tion . '' ''

		sent itself as a duty , '' and nowhere has the vital defect in
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's nature been more shrewdly and concisely put .

		Our knowledge of his childhood is drawn entirely from his let - ters to
Poole	PERSON	in
1797	DATE	.

		They are sad enough in substance , though not lacking in a certain plaintive humor .

		He describes himself as a precocious and imaginative child , passionate , timorous , hating rough sports , and immoder - ately fond of reading , a character at eight , '' flattered and wondered at '' by the women , and '' despised and hated by the boys , '' who bullied him after the manner of their kind , and drove him , as a young pariah , from the play - ground to seek refuge with his books and his book-bred fancies . ''

		So I used , '' he says , '' to lie by the wall and mope ; and my spirits used to come upon me sudden and in a flood ; and I would then run up and down the church - yard , and act over again all I had been reading , to the docks and nettles and the rank grass .

		At six years of age I remember to have read ' Belisarius , '
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, ' and `
Philip Quarll	PERSON	' ; and then I found the ' Arabian Nights , ' one tale of which made so deep an impression on me ... that I was haunted by spectres when I was in the dark ; and I distinctly recollect the anxious and fretful eagerness with which I used to watch the window where the book lay , and when the sun came upon it , I would seize it , carry it by the wall , and bask and read ... Alas !

		I had all the simplicity , all the docility of a little child , but none of the child 's habits .

		I never thought as a child , never had the language of a child . ''


Coleridge	PERSON	's use of opiates began in boy - hood .

		Laudanum was administered to him at school during an attack of rheumatic fever brought on by exposure ; and we find in a letter to
Poole	PERSON	that he was using it freely as an ano - dyne in
1796	DATE	.

		After describing the neuralgic pains from which he suffered , he continues : '' It -LRB- the pain -RRB- lasted from one in the morning till half-past five , and left me pale and fainting .

		It came on fitfully , but not so violently , several times on Thurs - day , and began severer threats towards night ; but I took between sixty and seventy drops of laudanum , and sopped the
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	, just as his mouth began to open . ''

		There is little doubt that the baneful disease ran its usual course with
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		He was , as he claimed , '' seduced into the use of nar - cotics , '' using the '' accursed drug '' first as an anodyne ; then as a relief from fits of mental de - pression ; and then as a mere indulgence and for the sake of the pleasurable sensations it arouse ^ .

		Happily , there was with him a fourth stage , the stage of comparative abstinence which marked his closing years spent under the friendly roof of the Gillmans the last of those '' perpetual relays which , '' as De
Quincey	PERSON	said , '' were laid along his path in life . ''

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 317
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's friends placed little credit in his sufficiently lame assertion that he resorted to laudanum -LRB- his allowance at one period being from two quarts a week to a pint a day I -RRB- chiefly to relieve bodily pain .

		The plain - spoken
Southey	PERSON	, for instance , '' knew , * as did all with whom
Coleridge	PERSON	lived , ' that after every allowance is made for ' morbid bodily causes , ' the habit is , ' for infinitely the greater part , ' motived ' by inclination and indulgence . ' '


Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's letters on this painful topic are usually a medley of half-way confessions , lam - entations , and pleas self - justificatory .

		There is one , however , to Mr.
Wade	PERSON	-LRB- 1814 -RRB- , which shows that at bottom he was under no delusions as to the true nature of the habit which , it is no exaggeration to say , blighted his life and cheated his genius of half its fame .

		The letter is the saddest , perhaps the frankest , he ever penned . ''

		DEAR SIR , for I am unworthy to call any man friend much less you , whose hospitality and love I have abused ; accept , however , my entreaties for your for - giveness , and for your prayers .

		Conceive a poor miser - able wretch , who for many years has been attempting to beat off pain , by a constant recurrence to the vice that reproduces it .

		Conceive a spirit in hell employed in tracing out for others the road to that heaven from which his crimes exclude him .

		In short , conceive what - ever is most wretched , helpless , and hopeless .

		... In the one crime of opium , what crime have I not made myself guilty of !

		ingratitude to my Maker !

		and to my benefactors injustice !

		and unnatural cruelty to my poor children !

		self-contempt for my repeated promise breach , nay , too often , actual falsehood !

		After my death I earnestly entreat that a full and unqualified narration of my wretchedness and of its guilty cause may be made public , that at least some little good may be affected by the direful example . ''

		The letters written during the
Cambridge	LOCATION	period throw some light on the familiar dra - gooning episode .

		Of the immediate causes of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's flight from the
University	ORGANIZATION	and sub - sequent enlistment , nothing very definite is known .

		Mr.
Gillman	PERSON	and the delinquent him - self attribute it to debts ; and
Cottle	PERSON	ascribes it to the love affair with
Mary Evans	PERSON	, which certainly played a great part in
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's earlier life .

		Reviewing the letters of this period , it seems pretty plain that , after leaving
Christ 's Hospital	ORGANIZATION	and on going down to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, the erstwhile '' inspired charity-boy '' and docile scholar became a decided scapegrace .

		We read of wild pranks and profane revels ; of a riotous wine-party -LRB- one out of many , probably -RRB- at which '' three or four freshmen were most de - plorably drunk '' ; of '' swinging impositions for cutting morning chapel '' ; of a symposium at which ''
Ned	PERSON	,
Tatuin	PERSON	, and I sat from four till ten drinking '' ; of a party of six undergrad - uates -LRB- with himself as '' General '' -RRB- who '' sal - lied forth to an apothecary 's house to thrash him for having performed so speedy a cure '' on an obnoxious tutor , who had been half drowned in a duck-pond .

		It is certain , too , that his ultra-liberal opinions brought him into some discredit with the
College	ORGANIZATION	authorities .

		In short , the plain prose of the matter seems to be that
Coleridge	PERSON	, getting into debt with the
Cambridge	LOCATION	tradesmen and into hot water with the
Cambridge	LOCATION	authorities , fled to
London	LOCATION	, was coolly treated -LRB- and possibly rejected -RRB- by
Miss Evans	PERSON	, and , seeing no royal road out of his troubles , took the '' Queen 's shilling , '' and joined a dragoon regiment .

		A letter to his brother says : `` My assumed name is
Silas Tomkyn Comberbacke	PERSON	, 15th , or
King 's Regiment of Light Dragoons	ORGANIZATION	.

		My number I do not know .

		The bounty I received was six guineas and a half ; but a light horseman 's bounty is a mere lure ; it is expended for him in things he must have had without a bounty gaiters , a pair of leather breeches , stable jacket and shell ... There will be a large draught from our regiment to complete our troops abroad .

		The men were picked out to-day .

		I suppose I am not one , being a very indocile equestrian . ''

		An '' indocile equestrian '' he certainly was ; for we read in a later letter : '' Within this week I have been thrown three times from my horse , and run away with , to the no small per - turbation of my nervous system , almost every day . ''

		Coleridge 's four-months ' dragoonship was , of course , a farce ; and he seems to have been finally relegated by his superiors to the hospital to nurse his sick comrades , with whom he became vastly popular .

		The pretty story that his release came about through the inter - vention of an officer who became aware of his classical attainments is largely myth Miss Mitford 's '' Captain Ogle '' appearing nowhere in the letters , which show plainly enough that the penitent trooper himself took the initiative , writing the most plaintive and self-accusing letters to his brothers , who finally obtained his discharge .

		Coleridge 's ill-starred marriage with
Sarah Fricker	PERSON	, for which
Southey	PERSON	-LRB- not Heaven , cer - tainly -RRB- was largely responsible , was part and parcel of the famous '' Pantisocracy '' project which was hatched during a visit of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in the
summer of 1794	DATE	.

		The essen - tials of that promising scheme were , as stated by Poole : '' Twelve gentlemen of good education and liberal principles were to embark with twelve ladies in
April	DATE	next , fixing themselves in some delightful part of the new back settlements of
America	LOCATION	.

		The labor of each 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, man for two or three hours a day , it was imagined , would suffice to support the colony .

		The produce was to be common property , there was to be a good library , and the ample leisure was to be devoted to study , dis - cussion , and to the education of the children on a settled system ... Among other matters not yet de - termined was whether the marriage contract was to be dissolved , if agreeable to one or both parties . ''

		The Susquehanna was chosen as an eligible site for the colony , partly because of its musical name , and partly because of '' its security from hostile Indians and bisons '' ; and the three chief `` Pantisocrats ''
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Southey	PERSON	, and
Lovell	PERSON	were to marry the three
Miss Frick	PERSON	- ers , of
Bristol	LOCATION	, as a step preliminary to emi - gration .

		Coleridge , with his usual prudence , fell in with the matrimonial part of the plan , in spite of the fact -LRB- amply proved by his let - ters -RRB- that he still loved his

Mary Evans	PERSON	.

		A letter written during his Welsh vacation tour , a few weeks before his engagement to
Miss Fricker	PERSON	, contains this passage : `` At Wrexham Church I glanced upon the face of Miss E .

		She turned excessively pale ; she thought it was my ghost , I suppose .

		I retreated with all possible speed to our inn .

		There , as I was standing at the win - dow , passed by
Eliza Evans	PERSON	, and with her to my utter surprise her sister ,
Mary	PERSON	, quam efflictim et perdite ama - bam ... I turned sick , and all but fainted away !

		... Viv it , sed mihi non vivit nova forte marita , Ah , dolor !

		alterius card a cervice pependit .

		Vos , malefida valete accensce insomnia mentis , Littora amata valete !

		Vale , ah !

		formosa Maria !

		Almighty God bless her !

		Her image is in the sanc - tuary of my heart , and never can it be torn away but with the strings that grapple it to life . ''

		A few weeks after the date of this epistle the distracted lover engaged himself to
Sarah Fricker	PERSON	, and two months after it he wrote as follows to
Southey	PERSON	from
Cambridge	LOCATION	: '' ... My God !

		how tumultuous are the movements of my heart .

		Since I quitted this room what and how important events have been evolved !

		America !

		Southey !

		Miss Fricker !

		Yes ,
Southey	PERSON	, you are right .

		Even Love is the creature of strong motive .

		I certainly love her -LSB- i.e. ,
Miss Fricker	PERSON	-RSB- .

		I think of her incessantly and with unspeakable tenderness with that inward melting away of soul that symptomatizes it .

		Pantisocracy !

		Oh , I shall have such a scheme of it !

		My head , my heart , are all alive .

		I have drawn up my arguments in battle array ; they shall have the tactician excellence of the mathematician , with the enthusiasm of the poet .

		The head shall be the mass ; the heart the fiery spirit that fills , informs , and agitates the whole . ''

		This letter is dated
July	DATE	; and in the follow - ing
December	DATE	Coleridge quitted
Cambridge	LOCATION	for good , and hastened straight not to Bris - tol , and '' Pantisocracy , '' and
Miss Fricker	PERSON	, but to
London	LOCATION	, where he joined
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and spent with him those ambrosial evenings -LRB- immortal - ized in
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's letters -RRB- at the '' Salutation and Cat , '' '' drinking egg-hot and smoking Oro - nooko , '' and discussing the principles of poesy .

		And there he might have remained indefinitely ; for the landlord of the '' Salutation '' was so charmed with his talk -LRB- or with the sound of it -RRB- that he offered to lodge him gratis so long as he chose to stay .

		Not a line did
Coleridge	PERSON	write to
Southey	PERSON	in the meantime , not a word to Miss
Fricker	PERSON	; until at last
Southey	PERSON	, growing uneasy , posted down to
London	LOCATION	, captured the truant , and fetched him back to
Bristol	LOCATION	, where he at once resumed the role of ardent lover and Pantisocrat .

		Coleridge married
Sarah Fricker	PERSON	on
October 4 , 1795	DATE	; and the results of the ill-assorted union were what might have been expected .

		Things went on well for a time , for there was certainly some attachment be - tween the pair ; but the inevitable estrange - ment came , and grew ; and with it '' those habitual ills That wear out life , when two unequal minds Meet in one house , and two discordant wills . ''

		Coleridge 's gradual drifting away and final separation from his family amounted to , as we have said , nothing less than a desertion of them ; and he alone , for anything that has ever been shown to the contrary , was to blame .

		The only fault as a wife that has been charged against Mrs.
Coleridge	PERSON	is that she was some - times `` fretful '' !

		That she was no more than that , must be credited to her as a virtue ; for her gifted spouse , with all his genius , with all his soaring ideals of human conduct , would , in his conjugal character , assuredly have put a Griselda to the proof .

		While the period spent at Nether-Stowey -LRB- 1797-8 -RRB- , in the bracing companionship of the Wordsworths , may be accounted
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's literary annus mirabilis , it is perhaps to the closing years at
Highgate	LOCATION	that one looks with most satisfaction .

		They were years of comparative fruitfulness and well-being , of calm after storm , a long life 's - evening , as it were , of returning sunshine , when the clouds that had darkened the noontide of his life had at last '' outwept their rain . ''

		The friendship and loving-kindness that followed
Coleridge	PERSON	all his days , and which furnish the best proof of the golden qualities -LRB- irrespective of his poetic genius -RRB- that mingled with the clay of his nature , found their culmination in the devotion of the Gillmans .

		To this worthy pair he truly owed the '' crown of his cup and garnish of his dish , '' a welcome that lasted till the day of his death .

		THE DIAL 319 Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	's editing is all that can be desired , painstaking , thorough , and helpful .

		The volumes are provided with an ample ed - itorial apparatus , in the way of introduction , notes , lists of authorities and of '' principal events , '' etc. ; and they are excellent specimens of book-making .

		Altogether , the work is one which no
Coleridgean	ORGANIZATION	's library , certainly , should be without .

		THE STORY OF THE AMEKICAX PEOPLE .

		* The undertaking of Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	to do for the people of the
United States	LOCATION	what Mr.
Green	PERSON	did for our kinsfolk of
England	LOCATION	is evidently proving a larger one than was at first planned , since the subordinate line on the title-page of previous volumes , '' In five volumes , '' has given place in the fourth instance to '' In six vol - umes '' ; and when the reader finds that the history so far published completes the study only to
1821	DATE	, it seems likely that '' In seven volumes '' may yet be found before the object - ive point , the Civil War , is reached .

		But even if the trying years between
1821	DATE	and
1861	DATE	should require four extra volumes , there would be no complaint from any source , so interesting does the history of our people become when the story is told by a writer so entertaining as is Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	.

		The period covered by this fourth volume is a sort of desert waste , the oases being few and far between .

		Consequently the reader fails to find the usual refreshment .

		There is little to be proud of in the battles of the second war with
England	LOCATION	.

		The closing scene of the third volume was the disgraceful surrender of Que - bec , when a cowardly general sacrificed his men without an attempt at fighting .

		In the fourth book the humiliating story is continued , of store-clothed generals , who issued blustering proclamations , and in periphrastic braggadocio declared what they were going to do , but who lacked every element of success , and were so ill-trained in the use of weapons , that when , to test their relative greatness , they resorted to the duel , they were unable to kill or even hit each other at the usual duelling distance .

		Not more entertaining is the account of the hurried surrender of certain
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast towns on the appearance of a small force of raiders , or of the acts of other places in paying * HISTORY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES .

		money and giving stores to the enemy on prom - ise of exemption from destruction .

		The climax of the whole war was reached , when , with not a bit of credit to the British invaders , the national capital was sacked , the public build - ings destroyed , and the officials of government compelled to flee , the President 's wife , the jolly
Dolly Madison	PERSON	, appearing braver than her hus - band ; but even she was refused shelter by the panic-stricken men , who ran when they saw smoke , and were filled with terror when they heard of a red-coat .

		The summary says : '' In
Maryland	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, there were then living not far from one and a half millions of whites .

		Yet this great population remained in its towns and cities , and suffered five thousand English - men to spend five weeks in its midst without ever once attempting to drive the invaders from the soil . ''

		Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	presents nothing new about this war with
England	LOCATION	; he makes no attempt to find heroes in our army ; he simply tells the story well , and one gets a clearer notion of the conditions in
England	LOCATION	, the difficulty of getting supplies to the front in
America	LOCATION	, the hopeless division of American interests , and the utter failure of our cause on land .

		Even the glori - ous victory at
New Orleans	LOCATION	, after the peace was made , does not efface the record of defeat , how - ever grateful it was at the time to the sorely burdened Republicans , who had looked in vain for solace .

		The naval history is well told , the great achievements of our sailors receiving a proper recognition without unnecessary adulation .

		The various '' ship-duels '' are accompanied with diagrams , and the reader may follow the successive moves of the contending vessels , thanking Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	for his courtesy in lending these graphic aids .

		Of course every American citizen knows the story of
Perry	PERSON	, but the magnitude of his victory appears more clearly when the difficulties in his way are stud - ied under the guidance of Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	.

		The Americans did show some degree of activity in gathering supplies and making entrenchments , and we feel grateful for these things , even though we are told to lay aside the legend of the cotton-bales in the fight of the eighth of
January	DATE	.

		But the volume is particularly valuable for the things which are told about internal devel - opment .

		The fifty pages of Chapter XXXIII. , `` The Routes of
Transportation	ORGANIZATION	, '' are replete with interest .

		The wonderful westward move - ment of population , which brought
Indiana	LOCATION	and
Illinois	LOCATION	into the
Union	ORGANIZATION	within three years after 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, the close of the war ; the growth of
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	trade ; the struggles of the commercial interests to overcome the difficulties of trans - portation , such subjects as these are dis - cussed as only Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	can treat them .

		Sometimes the desire for home and fortune in the West was overpowering .

		.

		`` A family of eight , on their way from
Maine	LOCATION	to
Indiana	LOCATION	, walked all the way to
Easton	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, which they reached late in
February	DATE	, dragging the chil - dren and their worldly goods in a hand-cart .

		A black - smith from
Rhode Island	LOCATION	made his way in the dead of winter across
Massachusetts	LOCATION	to
Albany	LOCATION	.

		In a little cart on four plank wheels a foot in diameter were some clothes , some food , and two children .

		Behind it trudged the mother with an infant at the breast and seven other children beside her .

		The father and a boy of twelve pulled the cart .

		A family of seven passed through
Bridgeport	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, in
March	DATE	.

		They had come down from
Three Rivers	ORGANIZATION	, in
Canada	LOCATION	, the men drawing a small cart on four plank wheels and the women and larger children following on foot .

		Yet another family , consisting of man , wife , and five chil - dren , passed through
Woodbury	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, with all their household goods in a wheelbarrow .

		They were walking to
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		Still another couple with seven chil - dren were so destitute that the man carried his property on his back . ''

		Such instances were exceptional , of course , but they indicate the determination of the peo - ple , and suggest the thought of the very large number who made the journey under more favor - able auspices .

		Improved means of communi - cation became necessary , and the steamboat began to be used .

		The '' teamboat '' was a peculiar stage of development , motive power for boats being furnished by eight horses walking in a circle on deck and turning a crank , this peculiar power being used in rebuke to the steam monopoly .

		Earlier in the volume , Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	gives a very entertaining account of the difficulties of commerce during the Embargo , when horses and oxen were used along the coast highways . ''

		Captain Jinks of the Horse Ma - rines '' appears before us , as we read of the arrival and departure of wagons , announced in the ship-news column of the newspaper , under the heading '' Horse-Marine Intelligence '' ; and the native humor of the people is shown in the banners fastened to these poor substitutes for the Yankee vessel , '' Free Trade and
Teamsters	ORGANIZATION	' Eights , '' '' Free Trade and Oxen 's Rights , '' or '' No Impressment . ''

		But , whether the diffi - culties of communication came from war or from the wilderness , the Americans were bound to overcome them , and their success was shown by the increase of commerce and wealth of the new states of the
West	LOCATION	and
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The troubles with the
Southern Indians	ORGANIZATION	and with
Spain	LOCATION	are well described , the personality of
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	being prominent , of course ; and the busy years of internal development following the second war furnish many special topics for discussion .

		Two of these are wor - thy of particular mention , because the facts have not been easily accessible to the ordinary reader before : the full statement about the wild-cat banking of the new Western common - wealths , and the story of the religious and phi - lanthropic societies , which planned for the white man , who was deprived of the privileges of religion belonging to a member of a settled neighborhood , and for the black man , who was led to look toward
Africa	LOCATION	for home and free - dom .

		And the development of the humanitarian ideas was shown none the less in the move - ments for reform in the penal system of the country , if , indeed , the word system could be used of what seemed hopelessly bad .

		The complexity of American life during the period covered by this volume is sufficient rea - son for the adoption of the topical method of treatment by Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	, although it might seem that there was a failure to show things in their relation to other happenings .

		But even this mild criticism does not take away the im - pression created by an examination of the vol - ume , that careful work has been done by the author , and that the fourth book holds its own with those previously published .

		A NEW TREATMENT or ENGLISH LITERARY HISTORY .

		* The symmetrical and self-centred develop - ment of French thought has always been one of its most marked characteristics , and French literature has thereby been given a unity not presented , except for brief periods , by the lit - eratures of other modern nations .

		There has been something almost Hellenic in its confident assumption that the final cause of the ideas of other peoples was to be found in its own adop - tion of those ideas , that through a Gallic re - mintage alone they might be given full cur - rency and exchange value .

		This assumption , viewed from one side , is mere provincialism if not chauvinism ; viewed from another , it ex - presses a deep artistic sense of the importance of preserving the national spirit from the dis - * A LITERARY HISTOKY OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE .

		THE DIAL 321 integrating influence of alien ideals .

		The finest French thought , from the age of the
Great Monarch	ORGANIZATION	to that which has witnessed the per - manent triumph of the republican principle , has shown a strong instinct of self-preservation in this respect ; it has not been wholly imper - vious to foreign influences , but it has welcomed them only upon condition of complete assim - ilation .

		The most careless observer , however , can not have failed to notice in the French thought of the past few years a significant change of atti - tude towards the foreigner .

		While by no means abandoning the old national ideal , the modern Frenchman lends a more willing ear than for - merly to the words of his European neighbors ; his interest in what they are doing and saying is no longer the mere polite curiosity of old , but has become genuine and absorbing ; a catholicity of taste , almost to be described as eager , has replaced the old narrow indifference .

		The force of chauvinism , if still unspent in political and social affairs , has lost its power to resist the invasion of the educational , artistic , and literary ideals of the rest of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The preaching of
Taine	PERSON	and Renan is bearing fruit , both in its amplification by such of the younger men as
M. Lavisse	PERSON	,
M. Bourget	PERSON	, and the Vi - comte de
Vogue	LOCATION	, and in the widening outlook al - ready gained by a large proportion of cultivated Frenchmen .

		Never has lesson been so taken to heart as that of Sedan , in witness whereof stands the great monument of the national ed - ucational system , erected within the past quar - ter century .

		Never , perhaps , has the innate artistic sense of a people won so complete a tri - umph over national or academic prejudice as in the recent enthusiastic acceptance of the music - dramas of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		In this case , the words of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' We needs must love the highest when we see it , '' find a new application , in the highest degree creditable to the people in whose honor they are now recalled .

		Noticeable among the manifestations of the increase of French interest in the achievements of other nations is the attention recently paid to English literature by a number of competent scholars .

		In this field the path was many years ago marked out by
Taine	PERSON	, whose great history of our letters , in spite of its obvious faults and its doctrinaire method , remains the most im - portant general treatment of the subject any - where yet produced .

		Of late years the study of English literature has been taken very seri - ously by the French faculties of letters , and many important monographs upon special phases of the subject have been published .

		The modern French student of literature is no longer content , as formerly , with a few superfi - cial notions of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and
Byron	PERSON	, but is beginning to learn something about many others of our writers , from Chaucer to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and to follow the lead of
Taine	PERSON	in the study of tendencies and formative agencies in the growth of the English national spirit .

		The trend and the thoroughness of the new training are well exemplified by such books as
M. Rabbe	PERSON	's study of
Shelley	LOCATION	,
M. Chevrillon	PERSON	's study of
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	, and the twelve hundred pages of
M. Angelier	PERSON	's study of Burns ; by
M. Beljame	PERSON	's work on English men of letters in the eighteenth century , and
M. Jusserand	PERSON	's ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, '' '' English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages , '' and '' The English Novel in the
Time of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Such works as these , honorable to the scholarship of any na - tion , are peculiarly gratifying to us of English speech , for their production seems to presage a closer linking together of the two modern lit - eratures that have chiefly influenced the thought and the civilization of the world .

		The works of M. Jusserand already men - tioned have given to their author perhaps the foremost place among living French students of English literature , and prepared us in a way for the more ambitious and comprehensive book which has occasioned the present article .

		That book is called '' A Literary History of the English People , '' and will , when completed , fill three large volumes .

		The one now pub - lished covers the period '' From the Origins to the Renaissance , '' the second will carry the his - tory on to Pope , and the third will bring it down to the present day .

		We are not at pres - ent called upon to pronounce final judgment upon an undertaking of which but a third is yet offered us , yet we can not refrain from say - ing that , as the complete work will be compar - able in dimensions with
Taine	PERSON	's monumental history , it would seem , from the section now at hand , to give promise of being equally com - parable in quality ; that is , in scholarship , sym - pathy , discernment , and philosophical grasp .

		The differentiation of
M. Jusserand	ORGANIZATION	's work from the conventional history of literature may best be described in the author 's words . ''

		Diminishing somewhat in his book the part usually allowed to technicalities and aesthetic problems , '' he has increased '' the part allotted to the people and to the nation . ''

		For a writer with this general object in view , '' the ages 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, during which the national thought expressed itself in languages which were not the na - tional one , will not be allowed to remain blank , as if , for complete periods , the inhabitants of the island had ceased to think at all .

		The growing into shape of the people 's genius will have to be studied with particular atten - tion . ''

		The theory thus expressed is well illus - trated by the present volume devoted to the origins ; and so rich and suggestive a treatment of the
Saxon	PERSON	, and especially the Norman pe - riod , is hardly to be found in the work of any other historian .

		We find here a more intimate association of the literature with customs , pol - itics , and institutions than was given us even by
Taine	PERSON	, and admiration of the author 's schol - arship is evoked by wellnigh every page .

		The Norman period , in particular , is made an inte - gral part of our intellectual development , in - stead of being regarded as a period of alien influences , active for a time , but leaving slight impress upon our literature as a whole .

		In this field , the author makes large use of the immense riches of recent French philological scholarship , even quoting from review articles of the past few months .

		The continuity of English thought , as embodied in its literature , is a fundamental conception of this work , and the unconscious embodiments are given their full value . ''

		Philosophers and reformers must be questioned con - cerning the theories which they spread : and not with - out some purely literary advantage .

		Bacon ,
Hobbes	LOCATION	, and
Locke	PERSON	are the ancestors of many poets who have never read their works , but who have breathed an air impregnated with their thought .

		Dreamers will be fol - lowed , singers , tale-tellers , and preachers , wherever it pleases them to lead us : to the
Walhalla	LOCATION	of the north , to the green dales of
Erin	PERSON	, to the
Saxon	PERSON	church of
Brad	PERSON	- ford-on-Avon , to
Blackheath	LOCATION	, to the '
Tabard	ORGANIZATION	' and the ` Mermaid , ' to the ` Globe , ' to ` Will 's ' coffee-house , among ruined fortresses , to cloud-reaching steeples , or along the furrow sown to good intent by Piers the hon - est
Plowman	PERSON	. ''

		A few words may be given to matters that have particularly attracted our attention dur - ing the examination of this volume , or matters that involve critical problems in their treat - ment .

		Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	will thank the author for his insistence upon the Celtic element in our English race ; on the other hand , the
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian element in the race of the conquering Normans is minimized , unduly , we should say , when we come upon the statement that '' they no longer had anything Scandinavian or Ger - manic about them . ''

		But
M. Jusserand	PERSON	does not exaggerate the significance of the Conquest , or of the fact that after
1066	DATE	, the inhabitants of
England	LOCATION	, '' so used to invasions , were never again to see rise , from that day to this , the smoke of an enemy 's camp . ''

		We might carp a little at this statement , but it remains essen - tially true .

		A characteristic as well as deeply interesting example of the author 's scent for literary parallelisms is offered by this quotation from a twelfth century lyric : '' II n'est mie jors , saverouze au eors gent , Si m ` ait amors , 1 ` alouete nos ment , '' which was the way '' in which , long before
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the Juliets of the time of
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		said to their Romeos : ' It is not yet near day , It was the nightingale and not the lark . ' ''

		But not content with this , the author refers us still farther back , to a Chinese poem antedat - ing the
seventh century	DATE	, where the same motif appears in this form : '' It was not the cock , it was the hum of flies . ''


M. Jusserand	PERSON	's work is one to be readily quoted from , but our indulgence in that pleas - ant task is forbidden by the limitations of space .

		Having piloted us , as guide , philoso - pher , and friend , through the intricate chan - nels of the formative period , the author at last reaches the open sea of Chaucer , with compar - atively plain sailing ahead .

		The chapters on Chaucer and
Langland	PERSON	are lovingly written , and no English historian has surpassed them in charm .

		A long chapter on the beginnings of the drama , and a short one on '' The End of the Middle Ages , '' bring the volume to a close .

		The
Eastern Empire	ORGANIZATION	has succumbed to the onslaughts of the Turk ; classical schol - ars and manuscripts have started on their benef - icent mission to the civilization of the
West	LOCATION	; the quickened life of the Renaissance is trans - forming
Italy	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	; the English people are on the eve of the great flowering period of their national genius ; and we await the sec - ond instalment of
M. Jusserand	ORGANIZATION	's work , confi - dent that he will be equal to the demands made upon him by even u the spacious times of great Elizabeth . ''

		It is not easy to do justice in a brief review to the manifold charms of this work .

		There is the charm of full knowledge and ripe judg - ment , the charm that comes from a treatment always fresh , however hackneyed the theme , the charm that comes from playing allusively about a subject and adorning it with illustrat - ive material from the greatest variety of sources , and , finally , the charm of an English style which we hesitate in attributing to any mere translator .

		Either the author has rewritten his
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 323 own book in English , or he has been singularly happy in the one to whom the preparation of the English text was entrusted .

		And those who entertain a chronic suspicion that graceful writ - ing means superficiality of attainment and the lack of exact knowledge will be reassured by a glance at the footnotes , to which all the erudition has been relegated , and of which the most pedantic and industrious of German scholars would have no cause to be ashamed .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		WOMAN 'S SHARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURE .

		* The initiative volume of the promising '' An - thropological Series , '' edited by Professor
Fred	PERSON	-
erick Starr	PERSON	, is a successful attempt , by Mr.
Otis T. Mason	PERSON	, to present clearly , and in compact form , the part which woman has played in the development of the culture of the world .

		The idea prevails that woman in savagery and in barbarism knows nothing but drudgery and cruelty .

		That this has not been and can - not have been true , the author easily shows .

		`` It is not reasonable to suppose that any species or variety of animals would survive in which the helpless maternal half is subjected to outrageous cruelty as a rule . ''

		Again , `` cruelty does not breed refinement either of manners or of taste . ''

		The earliest division of labor was based upon sex .

		Woman had certain duties ; man had certain other duties .

		The line between the two was as definitely drawn in savagery as it is in civilization , though on a different basis .

		Many kinds of labor which in lower forms of society are performed by women , in civilization are largely in the hands of men .

		The idea that savage or barbarous woman is cruelly treated , and is compelled to do all the work for the fam - ily , is due partly to a misconception of the or - ganization of primitive society , and partly to observation of it under unusual or abnormal conditions .

		A careful reading of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's book will make much clearer the real position of woman outside of civilization .

		On woman , as the '' food-bringer , '' fell the duty of providing a large part of the food .

		She gathered fruits , seeds , and other parts of plants , and prepared them for food .

		Later , she learned to cultivate plants , and became the first farmer .

		For the grinding of fruits and seeds the mortar * WOMAN 'S SHAKE IN PRIMITIVE CULTURE .

		and the mill-stone were invented .

		Woman was then the first miller .

		After the grain was har - vested , it must be protected from vermin ; so the cat was domesticated .

		The part which man played in the food-quest was in providing game .

		But the woman brought it into camp , removed the skin , and prepared the flesh either for im - mediate consumption or to be kept for future use .

		The author interestingly describes many primitive methods of preparing food , some fol - lowed to-day , others no longer used .

		Another of woman 's occupations was as the `` skin-dresser . ''

		All of the many uses to which leather is now put have come from the humble beginning which woman made . ''

		If aught in the heavens above , or in the earth beneath , or in the waters , wore a skin , savage women were found , on examination , to have had a name for it , and to have succeeded in turning it into its primitive use for human clothing . ''

		Various methods of treating skins are described , and the tools used in the processes are illustrated .

		In this connection an interesting illustration of the conservatism of woman is noted .

		Men have for the most part ceased to wear furs , while women still continue '' to use up nearly all the harvest of wild skins that are obtained . ''

		Again , woman has been the '' beast of bur - den . ''

		It is perhaps in this capacity , in bar - barism , that she has aroused the most pity ; although it may be questioned whether much of this pity is not wasted .

		The account of the development of the carrying trade '' from wom - an 's back to the car and the stately ship , '' is one of the best parts of the book .

		Methods of carrying children , cradle-frames , the parts of the body used in burden-bearing , and devices for sustaining the weight , are all discussed .

		Woman has been , too , '' The Weaver , '' '' The
Potter	PERSON	, '' '' The Jack-at-all-trades , '' '' The Art - ist , '' '' The Linguist , '' '' The Founder of So - ciety , '' '' The Patron of Eeligion . ''

		The author 's style is occasionally poetic and too often faulty .

		For example : '' One sunny day a company of savage women were alternately chatting and chipping in a soapstone quarry , when it occurred to one of them to leave a bit of the stone projecting here and there for legs .

		Happy thought !

		No sooner said than done .

		And after that all soapstone pots had legs '' -LRB- p. 34 -RRB- .

		Again , in speaking of the spirit world , he says : '' How unspeakably near must such a world of spirits be to women like unto these !

		They walk hourly among the gods .

		Heaven does not so much come down their souls to greet , as they exist on a narrow island between the two oceans , indistinguishable to their un - tutored minds '' -LRB- p. 242 -RRB- .

		324 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Other like instances might be given .

		The value of the book , however , lies in the new point of view from which culture - history is studied .

		The earliest division of labor is kept constantly in mind , and woman 's side only is considered .

		SIDE PATHS OF PSYCHOLOGY .

		* In the introductory chapter of any recent work upon normal individual psychology will be found paragraphs entitled '' External Aids and Appli - ances . ''

		And among '' external aids '' will be counted the light thrown upon special problems by the re - sults of investigation in cognate disciplines .

		Nor - mal psychology , it is said , can not afford to neglect the inquiries of abnormal , the discussion of dream - ing , hypnosis , and mental derangement ; individ - ual psychology must take account of comparative , and the psychology which treats of the adult mind must pay regard to the phenomena of the child mind .

		At present , it must be confessed , this view of the matter represents the ideal rather than the actual .

		Normal psychology has advanced so rap - idly since the introduction of the experimental method , and '' systematic psychology '' has been so considerably modified and clarified by its applica - cation to the study of consciousness , that the main current has outrun the side streams , the normal is better known than the abnormal , the developed than the incomplete .

		Thus , in the books before us , Dr.
Strahan	PERSON	leaves to the normal psychologist the explanation of the facts of connate impulse or in - stinct ; Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	naively asks of the physio - logical psychologist whether this or that hypothesis may , perhaps , be allowable ; Professor
Lloyd Mor	PERSON	- gan writes in his preface that '' Introspective psy - chology is an essential preliminary to comparative psychology '' ; and Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	, speaking from the other side , remarks that '' It is astonishing that the ' new ' psychology has hitherto made so little use '' of the genetic conception of mind , and that '' The question of race psychology '' has been , `` un - til very lately , a greatly neglected question . ''

		It is well , I think , that emphasis should be laid upon these and similar admissions , since those who are * SUICIDE AND INSANITY .

		impressed by the enormous bulk of , e. g. , hypnotic and alienist literature , and who do not either realize what a drill-course in experimental psychology does for the student or know how to estimate the results detailed in psychological monographs , are apt to un - dervalue both the progress and the achievement of the science at large .

		At the same time , the benefit is not altogether one-sided .

		Dr.
Strahan	PERSON	's work on `` Suicide and Insanity , '' for instance , lightens the task of the nor - mal psychologist by reducing all the various prob - lems of suicide to the single problem of impulse .

		The thesis of the volume is that true suicide is one and indivisible ; that it is in every instance the out - come of the suicidal impulse ; that this impulse is very rarely acquired in the lifetime of the individ - ual , being in the vast majority of cases '' inherited from ancestors who have been cultivating it for a considerable time in one form or other '' ; and that hereditary transmission involves transmutation , the changes being rung upon suicide , insanity , epi - lepsy , idiocy , scrofula , cancer , and the like .

		Rea - soned suicide , whether for gain -LRB- inspired by religion , the desire for notoriety , etc. -RRB- , or for the escaping of evil -LRB- physical suffering , disgrace , etc. -RRB- , is only a quasi-suicide , to be treated apart from the irra - tional or true form .

		The latter is always the ex - pression of the impulse already spoken of , whether the instantaneous expression of a blind , constraining desire , or the final manifestation of a gradually de - veloped instinct .

		Only in a small minority of cases is it correlated with madness ; no influence of cli - mate can be proved ; the fact that it appears most frequently in the
summer	DATE	months is to be accounted for by the consideration that these months repre - sent a period of reaction and comparative exhaus - tion after work at high tension , so that '' at this portion of the yearly cycle '' we naturally '' meet with most breakdowns in the machine '' ; religion and irreligion exert an influence merely by way of hygiene ; drunkenness , sexual immorality , and crime in general , may predispose to suicide , as '' devital - izing agents , '' but do not drive the individual to self-destruction ; women are more immune than men , because less harassed , more timid , more averse to the idea of personal disfigurement , etc. ; age is a determining factor only as it means more or less exposure to occurrences which may serve as ade - quate stimuli to the release of the impulse .

		Each race has a certain proclivity to suicide , which seems to remain stationary .

		Within the race , suicide va - ries directly with civilization and education . ''

		All that goes to make up what we call civilization ... leads to degenerative changes in the human organ - ism , and it is from the abnormal condition of con - stitution thus acquired that arise true suicide and allied evils . '' ''

		Upon direct propagation depends the major part of the increase which has taken place in recent years . ''

		THE DIAL 325 where in which '' are distinct additions to the lan - guage .

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	, on the other hand , throws his studies in morbid psychology into the pleasant literary form in which he was wont , once upon a time , to couch his political controversies .

		Two essays , one of them published in '' The Contempo - rary Review '' and the other in '' The New Review , '' are the foundation of his work on '' Imagination in Dreams . ''

		Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	belongs , with
Johannes Miiller	PERSON	and
Alfred Maury	PERSON	, in the class of those who have a strong tendency towards what is called u vis - ualisation '' or '' visual imagination . ''

		He sees vis - ions and dreams dreams .

		In his case the visions take the form of faces : type-faces , not remembered faces . ''

		They are never seen except when the eye - lids are closed , and have an apparent distance of five or six feet .

		Though they seem living enough , they look through the darkness as if traced in chalks on a black ground .

		Color sometimes they have , but the color is very faint .

		Indeed , their general aspect is as if their substance were of pale smoke ; ... so that , except for the half of a moment , the whole face is never clearly or completely visible at one time . ''

		The account of these personal experi - ences is the most valuable thing , to the psycholo - gist , in Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	's volume .

		It is good raw material , which can be used with advantage for the theory of visual images and their projection-modes .

		The author is himself a little unfair to psychology . ''

		The inquiry '' into dreams '' is almost invariably approached either in the spirit of the old supersti - tion or in the new spirit of materialism and mock - ery . ''

		It is true that scientific psychology will hear nothing of spiritism , dream-prediction , telepathy , and the like ; and it is true that physiologists refer certain dreams to indigestion , a fact which Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	takes as a personal insult throughout his book .

		But there is , as a matter of fact , a fairly large array of monographic literature , which deals with the origination and course of dreaming .

		The central object of Professor
Lloyd Morgan	PERSON	's '' Introduction to Comparative Psychology '' is '' to discuss the relation of the psychology of man to that of the higher animals . ''

		The author seeks to attain this object by a method of duplicate present - ment .

		Thus , Chapter IV .

		treats of suggestion and association in man , V. , of the association of ideas in animals , VIII .

		and IX. , of the analysis , synthe - sis , and correlation of impressions in man , X. , of the sense-experience of animals , XIII .

		deals with the perception of relations by ourselves , XIV .

		asks whether animals perceive relations ; and so on .

		The writing of a comparative psychology on these lines obviously implies the writing of a human psychology ; and it is evident that the method has many disad - vantages .

		Two books have to be crowded into the compass of one ; the human psychology tends to become secondary , and to deal only with topics which lend themselves readily to comparative treat - ment ; and the chapters which treat of the animal mind may very well be made discursive , by the au - thor 's desire to assist the reader , to save him the trouble of constant back-references .

		Professor
Morgan	PERSON	shows considerable skill in the avoidance of these difficulties .

		His exposition is full , clear , and fair ; and he has never forgotten that his book is to serve as an introduction to the subject .

		It is , however , unfortunate that he , like Professor Ro - manes , should be bound by the chains of a psycho - logical system which , despite its historical import - ance , is now in many respects out of date .

		The human psychology which he offers is avowedly Spencerian ; and , indeed , one need read no more than the table of contents to trace the influence of the '' Principles of Psychology . ''

		Associationism is a good psychological position .

		But analysis has progressed of late years by leaps and bounds ; and its results must be recognized by those who under - take to interpret the animal consciousness .

		Pro- fessor
Morgan	PERSON	admits this principle : '' Throughout the whole of these objective investigations , the wise and cautious student never forgets that the inter - pretation of the facts in psychical terms is based upon the inductions he has reached through intro - spection . ''

		It may be that he would affiliate his animal psychology to some more recent outgrowth of the associationist doctrine , were he writing for psychologists von
Fach	PERSON	and not for the general public .

		In the first part of his '' Mental Development in the Child and the Race , '' Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	diverges widely from the traditional lines of psychogenetic discussion , as laid down by
Preyer	PERSON	and others .

		The book has a theory to support .

		Its title might not unfairly be amended to run : '' The Importance of the Motor Consciousness , as illustrated in the De - velopment of the Child and the Race . ''

		The author emphasizes the motor elements in mental evolution , and thus introduces into psychogenesis a point of view which is eminently characteristic of modern psychology and psychophysics , witness the
James	PERSON	-
Lange	PERSON	theory of emotion ,
Kiilpe	ORGANIZATION	's recent analysis of impulse , or
Miinsterberg	ORGANIZATION	's explanation of pleas - antness and unpleasantness .

		The first six chapters are '' devoted to the statement of the genetic prob - lem , with reports of the facts of infant life , and the methods of investigating them , and the mere teas - ing out of the strings of law upon which the facts are beaded , '' suggestion , habit , accommodation , etc. .

		The author begins by noting the advantages offered by the simple , unreflective consciousness of the child to psychological investigation .

		He then describes experiments in which the immediate dynamogenic effect of an impression is turned to account for the determination of color recognition and right-hand - edness .

		The development of imitation is traced in writing and drawing ; and suggestion is made re - sponsible for all acts in the half-conscious begin - nings of life , and for many phenomena of the sub - conscious adult activity .

		Chapters VII .

		and
VIII	PERSON	.

		give a general formulation of the theory of adapta - tion .

		Survival and development depend not only 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, on passive adaptation to environment , but on the ability to react to pleasure-giving stimuli in a man - ner which ensures the maximal continuance of the beneficial stimulation .

		Habit must be supplemented by accommodation .

		Emotional expression is a dynamogenic effect of mental states ; emotion itself is largely '' a revival product , a clustering , so to speak , of organic and muscular reverberations about revived elements of content . ''

		The rest of the book details the genetic view of '' the process of mental development in its great stages , Memory , Asso - ciation , Attention , Thought , Self - consciousness , Volition . ''

		Given contractility and environment , and we have '' organic imitation . ''

		It develops , by the general law of pleasure-pain reactions , into the complex states of assimilation , recognition , etc. .

		All these processes , together with the principle of iden - tity , the distinction between perception and concep - tion , etc. , are made almost exclusively dependent on motor phenomena . ''

		Motor habit is the great devour - ing thing which throws its arms round all mental details , and unifies them in its embrace . ''

		Chapter XII .

		contains some well-chosen rules for the observ - ation of the evolution of imitation in children .

		This summary sketch can give no idea of the variety of topics which Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	handles , or of the originality with which his central thesis is worked out .

		No psychologist can afford to neglect the book , and its second part -LRB- '' Interpretations : Educational , Social , and Ethical '' -RRB- will be eagerly expected .

		We pass from Professor
Baldwin	PERSON	's first word upon his '' Genetic System '' to what is , in all prob - ability , Professor
Ladd	PERSON	's last word upon psychol - ogy in general : the '' Philosophy of Mind . ''

		The work is concerned with three principal problems : the relation of psychology to philosophy , the nature of mind , and the relation of mind to body .

		Every science , as we know , has its own methodological assumptions , which may be said to constitute its special metaphysics .

		Professor
Ladd	PERSON	maintains that the working assumptions of psychology are too nearly allied to the ultimate philosophical ontology to be allowed to remain implicit only .

		Psychology should take its stand frankly upon a metaphysical basis , and the aid of metaphysics be invoked for psychological explanation .

		The author is a veteran worker in both of the fields which he reviews in the present volume , and his conclusions are entitled to our utmost respect .

		But just because of his own familiarity with the fundamental issues , it may be that he underrates the difficulty of metaphysical thought to the beginner in psychology .

		To grasp the meaning of mind as a real being , real enough to interact causally with the body , yet not to be looked upon as a '' soul '' in the ordinary signifi - cance of the term , i.e. , as a pure entity , '' a statical object for its own contemplation , '' and to under - stand that this reality merges every night in the World-ground , to emerge as regularly every morn - ing , this is surely a most difficult matter for the student , whose philosophical training is a matter of but a year or two ; and the working hypothesis of parallelism has at least its surface straightforward - ness to recommend it .

		Still , it is the author 's opinion that difficult metaphysics , if good , is pre - ferable to crude metaphysics , and the opinion is supported by some very effective criticism .

		The work contains chapters on the consciousness of iden - tity -LRB- to the discussion of which is appended an ex - amination of the facts of `` double consciousness '' -RRB- , on materialism , spiritualism , monism , and dualism , and on the place of man 's mind in nature ; in addi - tion to those which bear more directly on the special questions enumerated above -LRB- the concept , reality , unity , origin and permanence of mind , etc. -RRB- .

		Its raking attack upon over-hasty monism is particu - larly well-timed .

		Although the border-land which divides psychol - ogy from metaphysics is partially surveyed in many philosophical and psychological works , Professor
Ladd	PERSON	has for the first time brought the more im - portant questions within the limits of a single vol - ume .

		He has done so after many years of oc - cupation with the empirical facts of the mental life : the '' Elements of Physiological Psychology '' was published in
1887	DATE	.

		Hence his insistence upon the crucial value and irreducible character of the ex - perience of self-activity carries with it a great weight of personal authority .

		The battle between motor habit and conation is not yet over .

		But whether Professor
Ladd	PERSON	prove to have fought upon the weaker or the stronger side , he has done yeoman 's service to his cause : and his three psychological works the '' Elements , '' the '' Psychology , '' and the present essay will take a permanent place among the standard books of the science .

		The myth of
Marshal Ney	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		In his '' Historic Doubts as to the Execution of Marshal Ney '' -LRB- Whit - taker -RRB- , the Rev.
James A. Weston	PERSON	has constructed an argument , more vigorous than convincing , to prove that this execution was a mock affair contrived by the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	in order to avenge the humiliating treatment he had received from
Louis	LOCATION	XVIII .

		when he went to the palace , as is alleged , to ask the king to spare Ney 's life .

		It is highly improbable that
Wellington	LOCATION	ever had such an intention , because the English prime-minister had written , '' One can never feel that the king is secure on his throne until he has dared to spill trai - tor 's blood '' ; and , as
Fyffe	PERSON	remarks , '' when the Premier had dug the grave , it was not for Welling - ton to rescue the prisoner . ''

		Moreover , even con - ceding the intention , a humiliation so public which Mr.
Weston	PERSON	thinks was an insult to
England	LOCATION	and to the allied powers called for a vindication , equally public .

		But a mock execution , which waited eighty years to be thoroughly explained , offered no
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 vindication at all .

		Still , as ''
Wellington	LOCATION	could not have permitted the atrocious butchery , '' for so Mr.
Weston	PERSON	declares , what did become of Ney ?

		For three years he was lost sight of .

		Then he reap - peared in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, transformed into a coun - try schoolmaster , and something of a pedant , for he said he could `` read and converse '' in
Latin	LOCATION	, Greek , and Hebrew , as well as Scotch , French , Italian , Russian , and Polish .

		Curiously enough , he seems to have spoken with a distinct Scotch-Irish brogue .

		He had partially disguised his name as
P. S. Ney	PERSON	, since he was anxious to keep his identity a secret .

		The name Ney he had retained '' because no one would expect him to take it , '' and it would therefore be '' his best foil against suspicion or recognition . ''

		It seems to have been the practice of this military pedagogue to tell his story chiefly to schoolchildren .

		Nevertheless , '' occasionally , when stirred by intoxicants , he would publicly declare that he was Marshal Ney . ''

		The reason why he became a teacher is interesting , doubly so because he explained the matter himself '' twice , when per - fectly sober . ''

		He chose '' the profession of teach - ing , '' he declared , '' because it was in many respects like the military profession ... He could not bear the thought of engaging in any occupation where he would be commanded or controlled by others .

		In the school-room he would be supreme , '' etc. .

		Even after the Revolution of
July	DATE	, he fed the credulous with the absurd notion that were his whereabouts known in
France	LOCATION	his enemies would send over and assassinate him .

		He seems to have spent his leisure composing lame verses , which he called '' Original Poetry , '' and twenty pages or so of which Mr.
Wes	PERSON	- ton quotes , with the result that
Ney	PERSON	's admirers will now hope more strongly than ever that he actually did die gloriously on that
December	DATE	day in
1815	DATE	.

		But , says one of Mr.
Weston	PERSON	's multitude of wit - nesses whose testimony in regard to
P. S. Ney	PERSON	he has patiently collected , it is `` more difficult to say who he -LSB-
P. S. Ney	PERSON	-RSB- was than to believe he was Marshal Ney . ''

		If this be the case he must have been an interesting impostor .


Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	was a much more yMis S d
Edgeworth	PERSON	.

		important figure to the preceding generation than she is in ours . ''

		The Parent 's Assistant , '' `` Moral Tales , '' `` Belinda , '' '' Castle Rackrent , '' comparatively unknown to pres - ent-day readers , were not only the delight of the average reader half a century ago , but served as inspiration to no less a man than Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, who testified that it was
Miss Edgeworth	PERSON	's sketches of Irish character that first moved him to write and publish novels of his own .

		But whether or not we can now feel much enthusiasm about Miss Edge - worth as an author , we discover through the two vol - umes of her '' Life and Letters '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- that she was a very interesting woman .

		She was her - self an illustration of her own opinion , expressed in one of these letters , that '' supereminent talents and an excellent heart almost always go together . ''

		She was the beloved eldest sister in a family of twenty - one children , the cherished friend and companion of three successive stepmothers who followed after the death of her own mother , which occurred when she was six years old .

		The bond between father and eldest daughter was a peculiarly tender one , possibly to the detriment of her literary achieve - ments .

		Although her gifts were far superior to his , so long as he lived much of her work was done in collaboration with him , and a full sketch of the story she was about to write was always required by him before she began its elaboration .

		In the wonderfully harmonious family at
Edgeworthstown House	ORGANIZATION	, composed of the children of four different mothers and the curious combinations of intricate relationships produced by marriage , together with the numerous friends , sometimes twenty or thirty at a time , who often came upon them unexpectedly , but sure of finding a generous hospitality ,
Maria	PERSON	was the central figure .

		Her desk was in the family sitting-room , and most of her literary work was ac - complished amid its manifold distractions .

		Many friendships with distinguished people enriched her life , notably the one with Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, result - ing in the interchange of visits between Abbotsf ord and
Edgeworthstown	PERSON	, and an Irish journey together .

		The charms of the conversation of the two story - writers may be inferred from the confession of the boatman who rowed them over the Lake of
Killar	PERSON	- ney , and who told
Lord Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	twenty years afterwards that the pleasure of rowing them had made him amends for missing a hanging that day .

		Miss
Edgeworth	PERSON	's letters are delightfully written ; their charm as a whole is somewhat lessened , how - ever , by too little discrimination on the part of the editor , Mr.
Augustus J. C. Hare	PERSON	.

		In a correspond - ence covering a long life of eighty-two years , what one wants is not an omnium gatherum , but a judi - cious elimination of such letters as deal only with matters of no possible interest for any but the per - son to whom they are written .

		The Turkish Another in the terrible series of wan - outragesin ton massacres , perpetrated by the
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		Turk upon the defenseless Christian subjects of his misrule , brings before the civilized nations anew the `` Eternal Eastern Question . ''

		From
Armenia	LOCATION	this time comes the cry which ought to rouse those powers that are responsible for the con - tinued existence of Turkish tyranny to some action that shall be effective and final .

		Four times has
England	LOCATION	interfered to save the Ottoman Empire from merited destruction , and thus become respon - sible before the world for a reform of the abuses that have made the lot of the subjects of that Em - pire wretched almost beyond description .

		Yet the Turkish government has grown steadily worse , while
England	LOCATION	and her associate powers have been con - tent with empty promises and paper constitutions .

		The organized robbery that is called the govern - ment of
Turkey	LOCATION	, and the terrible condition of the people , Mohammedans as well as Christians , are 328 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June	DATE	l r clearly portrayed in Mr.
F. D. Greene	PERSON	's little book , `` The Armenian Crisis in
Turkey	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnams -RRB- .

		This is primarily a well-attested account of the mas - sacre of Armenian Christians by the Kurds in
1894	DATE	; but the general question is clearly , though briefly , treated .

		The author lived several years in the re - gion of this massacre , and we can not but accept his account as substantially accurate .

		There is no hope of reform from within , as he clearly shows ; yet he does not seem to appreciate the delicate balance of European powers that makes intervention difficult .

		That American public opinion can accomplish any - thing in the matter is not easy to see . ''

		I am willing to make any part of my I * ?

		Public , if it will help others , '' said Miss
Lucy Larcom	PERSON	, in speaking of her intention to write a volume of reminiscences of her later years , as a continuation of '' A New En - gland Girlhood . ''

		But she did not live to carry out her purposes .

		At her death , her papers fell into the hands of Mr.
Daniel Dulaney Addison	PERSON	, and from them he has prepared a volume entitled the '' Life , Letters , and Diary of
Lucy Larcom	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , which is a successful attempt to carry on the life-story of this interesting woman and poet in the spirit that she would have wished ; that is , dealing chiefly with inner experiences , such as friendship , intellectual and religious experiences , undercur - rents of thought and feeling .

		Miss
Larcom	PERSON	was forty-six years old when her first volume of verse was printed , called simply '' Poems . ''

		It contained many of the lyrics upon which her fame as a poet will always be based ; such as ''
Hannah	PERSON	, '' '' Skip - per Ben , '' ''
Hilary	PERSON	, '' '' A Thanksgiving . ''

		The next sixteen years were ones of considerable productive - ness , and in
1884	DATE	the different volumes were bound together in a '' Household Edition '' of her works .

		Between Miss
Larcom	PERSON	and
J. G. Whittier	PERSON	there was a life-long friendship , and they published several works in collaboration .

		In later years she became acquainted with
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, who soon became the great religious guide of her life ; and under his influence she was finally led to changes of belief far removed from the rigorous Puritan theology in which she had been reared .

		In reading this simple record of a life passed amid seemingly monotonous surroundings , one realizes how often it may happen that mental vicissitudes are more dramatic and real than the outward events of even a varied life .

		Mr.
Charles Carleton Coffin	PERSON	's '' The Daughters of the Revolution '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a commendable at - tempt to vivify the precursory and the opening events of the Revolutionary War by weaving them into a romance .

		History forms the staple of the book , the imaginative part being merely sufficient to supply a connecting thread .

		As the title implies , the author 's main design is to portray the hitherto somewhat neglected share in the Revolution of the wives and daughters of its heroes ; and by making his characters types and his dialogue largely dis - cussion of the questions of the day he has managed to insinuate a fair amount ef solid information .

Lexington	LOCATION	,
Concord	LOCATION	,
Bunker Hill	PERSON	, and of the earlier affrays between the citizens and soldiery , the historic '' Tea Party , '' the shoot - ing of the boy ,

Young America	LOCATION	.

		That is one objection to the '' Reminiscences of Bishop
Clark	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The interesting matter , the sparkling style , the graceful humor , the abounding anecdote , the frank and modest self - revelation , give Bishop
Clark	PERSON	's book a special charm and insure it a universal welcome .

		And we must return to Bishop
Griswold	PERSON	for the only other objec - tion : '' I have never been sorry for the things I have not said . ''

		That is a sad instance of prelatical impenitence .

		There may have been abundant rea - son to be sorry .

		Silence is often as traitorous as any speech .

		At all events , others may reasonably be sorry , when the speaker or writer , secure in his reticence , is content .

		It is not often that what is omitted haunts us .

		But those who have had access to the stores of the Bishop 's memory , and have heard him in his hours of ease pour them out in all their rich abundance , can not but miss what has not been said , can not but wish that he had let himself go more freely and given us two volumes instead of one .

		We are grateful , but unsatisfied .

Milton	LOCATION	serving to illustrate the anti-melancholic character of chalcedony , and Mr.
Eugene Field	PERSON	's '' Little Peach '' being taken to go with nicolo -LRB- a kind of onyx -RRB- , which is supposed to stand for youthful precocity ! ''

		The Northern Library , '' which is a rival to the '' Saga Library '' of Messrs.
Morris	PERSON	and
Magnusson	PERSON	, makes a noble beginning with Mr.
J. Sephton	PERSON	's translation of '' The Saga of King
Olaf Tryggwason	PERSON	. ''

		The transla - tion is simple and straightforward , without recourse to the archaisms of diction that flavor the versions by Mr.
Morris	PERSON	, and has both introduction and index .

		The whole makes a beautifully printed volume of nearly five hundred pages , published in
London	LOCATION	by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	, and in the
United States	LOCATION	by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems to us a very remarkable fact that the great work of
Herr Ferdinand Gregorovius	PERSON	, '' Geschichte der Stadt Rom im Mittelatter , '' should have gone all these years without finding an English translator ; but it is nevertheless true , and Miss
Annie Hamilton	PERSON	's version , now in course of publication , is the first to be set before the English reader .

		This '' History of the City of
Rome	LOCATION	in the Middle Ages '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- follows the latest -LRB- fourth -RRB- edition of the original , and two thick volumes of five hundred pages each are now given us as a first instalment .

		An index is provided , although not a very extensive one .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	is editing a new English translation of the novels of
Balzac	LOCATION	, the first volume of which will be issued at once .

		A new ten-cent monthly magazine , '' The New Gal - axy , '' is to be published by Mr.
Harry C. Jones	PERSON	, editor of '' The Monthly Illustrator . ''

		The
Christian Literature Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	, has just published a lecture by Dr.
Adolf Harnack	PERSON	on ''

Charles R. Gillett	PERSON	.

		The tenth annual meeting of the

		The late General
M. M. Trumbull	PERSON	's papers on '' Wheelbarrow and the Labor Question '' are reprinted by the

		The life of
Sonya Kovalevsky	PERSON	is soon to be issued by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will include an autobiography cov - ering the girlhood of the celebrated mathematician , and a memoir by the late Duchess of Cajanello .

		A recent doctor 's dissertation , presented to the
Heid	PERSON	- elberg philosophical faculty by Mr.
Robert Nelson Cor	PERSON	- win , has for its subject the '' Entwickelung und Ver - gleichung der Erziehungslehren von
John Locke	PERSON	und
Jean-Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	. ''

		Two French professors of the College Chaptal re - cently discovered and bought at a public sale an authen - tic manuscript , hitherto unknown , of
Charles Baude	PERSON	- laire .

		It is entitled '' Les Mosurs et les Coutumes de la Belgique , '' and will be published at once .

		M.
Charles Bourgeaud	PERSON	's '' Etablissement t Revision des Constitutions en Amerique et en
Europe	LOCATION	, '' reviewed by us a year or two ago , has just been turned into En - glish by Professor
Charles D. Hazen	PERSON	, the translation being published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Queen 's birthday brought the honors of knight - hood to Mr.
Henry Irving	PERSON	, Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, Mr.
W. H. Russell	PERSON	-LRB- of Bull Run fame -RRB- , and Mr.
Lewis Morris	PERSON	.

		Why the latter should have received such a distinction is not easy to say ; can it be that the Queen and her ad - visers have taken him for a poet ?

		Two more '' Trilbys '' that is , two independently made translations of
Nodier	ORGANIZATION	's conte , are among the re - cent books .

		One , published by Messrs.
Estes & Lauriat	PERSON	, is the work of Mr.
N. H. Dole	PERSON	; the other , with the im - print of Messrs.
Lamson	PERSON	,
Wolffe & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is put into En - glish by Miss
Minna Caroline Smith	PERSON	. ''

		Volpone , '' '' Epiccene , '' and '' The Alchemist '' on the whole ,
Jonson	PERSON	's dramatic masterpieces have been reserved for the third and concluding volume of the plays of '' rare old Ben , '' just added to the '' Mermaid '' series -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , and forming the twen - tieth volume of that useful collection . ''

		Phallicism in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' a doctor 's dissertation by Mr.
Edmund Buckley	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, has been issued from the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It makes a pamphlet of only thirty-four pages , but as the subject has hardly been touched upon before in the European languages , the amount of research represented is much more than is indicated by the dimensions of the mono - graph .

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	has written the following ode for the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	commencement exercises of this year : i. Hark !

		through the archways old High voices manifold Sing praise to our fair Mother , praise to
Yale !	ORGANIZATION

		The Muses ' rustling garments trail ; White arms , with myrtle and with laurel wound , Bring crowns to her , the Crowned I Youngest , and blithest , and awaited long , The heavenly maid , sweet Music 's child divine , With golden lyre and joy of choric song , Leads all the
Sisters Nine	ORGANIZATION	.

		330 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, In the gray of a people 's morn , In the faith of the years to be , The sacred Mother was born On the shore of the fruitful sea ; By the shore she grew , and the ancient winds of the East Made her brave and strong , and her beauteous youth increased Till the winds of the West , from a wondrous land , From the strand of the setting sun to the sea of her sunrise strand .

		From fanes which her own dear hand hath planted in grove and mead and vale , Breathe love from her countless sons of might to the Mother breathe praise to
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		in .

		Mother of Learning !

		thou whose torch
Starward	ORGANIZATION	uplifts , afar its light to bear Thine own revere thee throned within thy porch , Rayed with thy shining hair .

		The youngest know thee still more young The stateliest , statelier yet than prophet-bard hath sung .

		O mighty Mother , proudly set Beside the far inreaching sea , None shall the trophied Past forget Or doubt thy splendor yet to be !

		The ode has been set to music by Professor
H. W. Parker	PERSON	, and will be sung by a selected chorus with orchestral accompaniment .

June 1 , 1895	DATE	.

		JUST A MOMENT !

		Are you a teacher in any of the departments of modern science ?

		We have the best and the fullest line of elementary text-books in that field published in this country .

		Kindly examine Chute 's PHYSICS ,
Shepard	PERSON	's CHEMISTKIKS ,
Spaldinq	PERSON	' t BOTANY , Cotton 's ZOOLOGY ,
Bayer	ORGANIZATION	's BIOLOGY , OrndorjFs LABORATORY MANUAL IN ORGANIC CHKMISTKY ,
Benton	PERSON	's LABOKATOKY GUIDE ,
Whiting	PERSON	's PHYSICAL MEAS - UREMENTS , and
Clarke	PERSON	' 1 s MICROSCOPY every one a labora - tory manual .

		The pupil , not the teacher , does the experi - mental and analytical work .

		They are just such books in science work as the
Committee of Ten	ORGANIZATION	has recommended .

		In History ,
Civics	ORGANIZATION	, and
Political Science	ORGANIZATION	we have also an interesting list .

		Beginning with
Sheldon	PERSON	's GENKKAL HIS - TORY , the pupil obtains a clear idea of the development of monarchial forms .

		These books follow the laboratory plan .

		Thomas 's HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES is the best type of a constitutional history for grammar schools ever published .

		It is a history of the people , showing the development of a strongly nationalized government .

		A manual of citizenship and a work of scholarship .

		Dole 's
AMERICAN CITIZEN	ORGANIZATION	is a proper sequel to
Thomas	PERSON	's History of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The whole aim and object of this book is the true object of education citizenship .

		For the higher studies in this line we have
Wilson	PERSON	's THE STATE , a book that exhibits the actual organization and administra - tive practice of modern governments , and THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES , by the same author .

		Gide 's THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECON - OMY is a guide book for students who are feeling their way beyond the elementary stage in political economy .

		In
Wenzel	PERSON	's COMPARATIVE VIEW OF THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT are paralleled the outlines of the four great constitutional governments of the world The
United States	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		For stu - dents of political economy , and for the law school , Lawrence 's GUIDE TO INTERNATIONAL LAW is now in press .

		Still another professional work is THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE END OF THE FIRST CENTURY , by Ex-Senator
Boutwell	PERSON	, of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, a source of authority that can not be questioned .

		Our list of Mathematical Text-books begins with the Kin - dergarten and ends with the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the foot of the lad - der there are a number of books and devices that cover every course in primary number work .

		Oral exercises and oral drills are the chief characteristics of Sultan 's PUPILS ' ARITHMETICS , a three-book series .

		Atwood 's GRADED ARITHMETICS , a two - book series , is a very popular work with which to prepare for examinations .

		Walsh 's ARITHMETIC in three parts is ar - ranged by grades and not by subjects .

		An important feature is the introduction of the elementary principles of algebra and geometry .

		Another is the introduction of about one thousand examination questions taken from various sources in actual business life among them , a long list of civil service exam - ination papers .

		Wjiite 's Two YEARS WITH NUMBERS has become popular mainly on account of its simple language and practical examples .

		In Higher Mathematics ,
Bowser	PERSON	's ACADEMIC and
Bowser	PERSON	's COLLEGE ALGEBRA are unsurpassed .

		Notice the treatment of Quadratics both by factoring and by the ordinary methods .

		Bowser 's GEOMETRY is something more than an adaptation of the algebraic equation to geometric theorems .

		You will find a superb exposition of the
Theory of Limits	ORGANIZATION	in this book .

		Mod - ern college work demands not a little analytical work in trig - onometry , and
Bowser	PERSON	's TRIGONOMETRY is the most complete and the best arranged work of the kind published .

		The In - structor in Mathematics of
Dwight Collegiate School	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, says , '' It is the only trigonometry I have yet seen that covers the ground required for the Yale examinations . ''

		Ten years ago , of the twenty-four books on our list , sixteen were German and French text-books .

		Now , our MODERN LANGUAGE list is a little more than ten times as great .

		Our Catalogue of
Modern Language Publications	ORGANIZATION	contains the larg - est and most complete list of German , French , Spanish , Ital - ian , and Scandinavian texts published in
America	LOCATION	.

		They are used in not far from three thousand schools and colleges in the
United States	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, Central Amer - ica , and
South America	LOCATION	.

		The professors of modern languages in twenty-six colleges and universities have given these texts their unqualified approval .

		353 TOUCHSTONES OF CRITICISM .

		We believe it was
Emerson	PERSON	who once said that he was always glad to meet people who recognized the immeasurable superiority of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	over other poets .

		The feeling has doubtless been cherished by many a reader be - sides ; for , after all , what test of the sane out - look upon life , the deep sympathy with its man - ifold phases , the discriminative faculty that knows the ring of the precious metal from the base not in literature alone , could be equal to this ?

		To know the great poets , and to be sure that they are the great poets , not from mere passive acceptance of the traditional appraise - ment , but ^ from reasoned and sincere convic - tion , this is one of the most desirable of pos - sessions ; for it betokens a well-ordered imag - ination , a just balance of the intellectual and emotional elements of the inner life , a capacity for the highest of all possible artistic satisfac - tions .

		A clever simulation of this attitude is sometimes encountered , but it can not long de - ceive the elect .

		It is sure to unmask itself in relations of anything like intimacy , to fall back upon pilfered formulas obviously hollow as far as the one who flaunts them is concerned , to be caught napping when some peculiarly vital point is at issue , to betray by some trick of in - tonation , or gesture , or facial expression , the insincerity of the pretended appreciation .

		Yet even this pretence of comprehension is not always to be condemned .

		If it be made merely for the sake of conventionality , not much may be urged in its favor ; but if it re - sult from the humility of a judgment confident that the estimates reinforced by successive gen - erations must somehow be right , from the con - viction that failure to perceive all the beauty that a clearer vision has discerned must be at - tributable to one 's own spiritual defect , and from the determination to assume the proper initial attitude and patiently wait for enlight - enment to come , then it is hardly chargeable with hypocrisy , and merits sympathy rather than disdain .

		In such a case , we aver , at least , the attitude in question is more becoming , to say nothing of its being more hopeful , than that of the out-and-out Philistine , who raises his stri - dent battle-cry to some such effect as this '' I do n't know anything about poetry , but I know what I like '' and then proceeds to descant upon the beauties of , let us say , Sir
Lewis Morris	PERSON	or Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	.

		This sort of outburst is familiar enough to everyone who unwisely speaks of literature in the pres - ence of people who get their intellectual sus - tenance from the sensational periodical of monthly or daily publication , or from the pa - per-covered fiction of the newstand , and polite - ness usually forbids the only sort of reply that is adequate to the occasion .

		The advice needed by a person of this type is , in Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's phrase , that '' he should fall on his knees and pray for a cleanlier and quieter spirit , '' but it must be left unspoken , and a 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, smile of pity is the only permissible substitute .

		Undoubtedly the best general evidence that one is possessed of the cleanly and quiet spirit to which Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	so feelingly alludes is afforded by a real pleasure in the accepted mas - terpieces of literary art , or at least in a consid - erable number of them .

		The reader whose joy in Shakespeare and
Dante	PERSON	, in
Virgil	LOCATION	and Ten - nyson , in Homer and
Shelley	PERSON	, in
Goethe	LOCATION	and
Cervantes	PERSON	, is genuine and perennial , is entitled to feel some confidence in his judgment of the moderns , as yet unclassified and unranked ; to him , literature is no trackless forest , but a fa - miliar well-travelled highway , provided with sign-posts and landmarks .

		The great names of literature are touchstones which teach us unerringly to know the good from the meretri - cious , even among the slightest productions of the hour .

		For it is a mistake to assume that because the major poet is so immeasurably re - moved from the minor poet each must be judged by the standards of his own class .

		The hope - less confusion of perspective that results from this assumption is only too familiar to readers of current criticism .

		How often do we find some insignificant poetaster of the day charac - terized in terms that would give us pause were they applied to one of the master-singers of the world .

		How many '' new poets '' have been noisily heralded during the last twenty years , only to be consigned to forgetfulness a few months later .

		These critical extravagances are extremely unfortunate , for they bewilder the seeker after the beautiful , leading him into many a will-o ' - the-wisp-haunted morass , besides tending to bring all criticism into disrepute .

		They are probably responsible in large measure for the amazing opinion , to which recent years have given considerable currency , that criticism has no business to be anything more than a sub - jective record of the critic 's impressions , an un - reasoned enumeration of his likes and dislikes .

		But however prevalent such an opinion may become among the superficially-minded , gen - nine criticism , based upon the fundamental principles of art , is not likely to abdicate its function , any more than genuine economics is likely to abandon its scientific and rational pro- cedure because of the subjective semi-emotional discussion that now in so many quarters usurps its name .

		And whatever the special method that criticism may choose to pursue , it will never forget that literary art exists , that its fundamentals have the sanction of the centuries , that any marked departure from those funda - mentals is almost sure to be an indication of decadence or degeneracy , and that approved literature provides an almost infallible touch - stone by which to test the value of the litera - ture yet on trial .

		The best criticism is that which we get from those writers whose knowl - edge of the great poets is widest , and whose sense of their excellence is most unfailing .

		To narrow this suggested method from the general to the particular , we may say that
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's plan of keeping within memory 's reach a few carefully-selected examples of fault - less diction , for purposes of comparison , is hardly to be improved upon .

		Arnold was en - tirely right in saying that to recognize the '' grand style '' by this sort of touchstone we do not need to be able to define it , and he might have added that no kind of a definition would help anyone to recognize it who , when brought into its presence , could remain unconscious thereof .

		What he says of the '' grand style '' is equally applicable to the other types of style which literature embodies .


Symonds	PERSON	suggested a similar test of lyric excellence when he said that '' a genuine liking for ' Prometheus Un - bound ' may be reckoned the touchstone of a man 's capacity for understanding lyric poetry . ''

		And as
Arnold	LOCATION	tells us that the reader who does not intuitively recognize the '' grand style '' in
Milton	LOCATION	's '' Standing on earth , not rapt above the pole , '' etc. , can expect no other answer than `` the Gospel words : Moriemini in peccatis vestris , '' so
Symonds	PERSON	tells us that '' if a critic is so dull as to ask what ' Light of Life !

		thy lips enkindle ' means , or to whom it is addressed , none can help him any more than one can help a man whose sense of hearing is too gross for the tenuity of a bat 's cry . ''

		Perhaps a word may be said , in closing , of another sort of touchstone , one having no objec - tive value to speak of , yet subjectively of con - siderable interest to many of us .

		There are several pretty tales going about of life - long friendships formed and cemented by a common love for
Fitzgerald	ORGANIZATION	's '' Omar . ''

		Akin to these in their suggestion is the beautiful story of the Sicilians and their love for Euripides , the story which
Browning	PERSON	has immortalized in the first adventure of Balaustion .

		Almost everyone who is widely read in literature takes to his heart of hearts some poet , as often as not of inferior rank , whose message is yet of such a nature as to make the strongest possible appeal to the individual idiosyncrasy .

		Such a poet becomes , to the one whose heart he has reached , a sort of touchstone to be applied to the rest of man - kind , a test of the sympathies that must under -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 337 lie real intimacy .

		But it should not be for - gotten that this personal appeal to a few indi - viduals here and there does not warrant them in reckoning their poet among the great singers of the world .

		We should not confuse the sub - jective standards of criticism with the objective ones , strong as is the temptation so to do .

		Even the sanest and most experienced critics do not always escape this confusion .


Victor Hugo	PERSON	, for example , means a great deal to Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	personally , and so Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, presumably writing what he intends for objec - tive criticism , bestows deplorably extravagant praises upon the poet .

		On the other hand ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, not liking some things about
Shelley	PERSON	, is impelled to register the opinion that his prose is better than his poetry .

		It is hard to say which of these two vagaries is the more disheartening .

		If such men are capable of such lapses , what may we hope of lesser critics ?

		One thing , at least , is clear .

		It can not be as - serted too frequently or too insistently that the likes or the dislikes of a critic have nothing to do with criticism , if the term is to be taken intelligibly .

		The argument , '' This work is good because I like it , and this other work is not good because I dislike it , '' is nothing more than childish dogmatism , and quickly leads to some such reductio ad dbsurdum as has been illustrated .

		In any objective sense , no merely personal preference , however strongly felt , is to be reckoned among the touchstones of gen - uine criticism .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A remark made by Mr.
T. R. Sullivan	PERSON	in '' The At - lantic Monthly '' for
May	DATE	, to the effect that Shake - speare 's '' Tempest '' has not been played these forty years , brought to mind a performance of that supreme romantic achievement witnessed by me in
Chicago	LOCATION	six years ago .

		In the
summer of 1889	DATE	, the veteran actor and manager , Mr.
J. H. McVicker	PERSON	, put upon the boards of his theatre a somewhat spectacular , but , on the whole , not inadequate version of '' The Tempest '' ; and the suc - cess of the production is attested by the fact that it ran if I recollect aright nightly for several weeks .

		With this recollection it occurred to me that some people might possibly be interested to know what opportuni - ties have been offered an ardent Shakespearian , living in the great lakeside city , to witness stage performances of the Master during the past score of years .

		Through - out that period , I have never missed an opportunity to see a new play of Shakespeare ; and I find , somewhat to my astonishment , that no less than twenty-five of the thirty-six plays included in the first and second folios have been produced at one or another of the
Chicago	LOCATION	theatres since
1875	DATE	.

		Some of the performances have left much to be desired , have been anything but Shake - spearian in spirit , and have made all sorts of conces - sions to the vulgar taste of the groundlings ; but from the poorest of them all I have got something that I could not get , probably because of defective powers of .

		imagination , from mere reading of the text .

		My first play was '' Hamlet , '' Booth 's '' Hamlet , '' which at once became for me , and remained , the type , although I was afterwards forced to recognize a greater degree of subtlety and tender feeling in Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's presentation of the Dane .

		McCullough 's '' Othello , '' likewise , first made me know and love the Moor , al - though a new revelation awaited me from Sig .

		Salvini .

		But nothing need here be said of these plays , or of ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' '' As You Like It , '' '' Twelfth Night , '' ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' Mac - beth , '' ''
Julius Csesar	PERSON	, '' '' Much Ado about Nothing , '' or ''
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		All eleven of these may be seen almost yearly , if one will , ia any of our larger cities .

		To Mr.
Daly	PERSON	's admirable company I owe my first , and , indeed , my only acquaintance with '' Love 's Labour Lost '' and `` The Taming of the Shrew . ''

		Mme. Mod - jeska won my lasting gratitude by making me ac - quainted with '' The Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	'' and '' Measure for Measure . ''

		Most theatre-goers have seen Messrs.
Robson	PERSON	and
Crane	PERSON	in '' The Comedy of Errors , '' and some in '' The Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	. ''

		To the memory of
Adelaide Neilson	LOCATION	thanks are due for my first '' Cymbeline , '' as well as for other gracious Shake - spearian gifts .

		Miss
Mary Anderson	PERSON	's
Hermione	PERSON	and
Perdita	PERSON	in '' The
Winter	DATE	's Tale '' will always remain fragrant in the recollection . ''


Henry VIII	PERSON	. ''

		has been occasionally given , for the sake of Katharine , by Mme.
Modjeska	PERSON	and others . ''

		The Midsummer Night 's Dream '' was , like '' The Tempest , '' produced by the enterprise of Mr.
McVicker	PERSON	as a
summer	DATE	play . ''

		Cor - iolanus '' I have seen only once , but that once was in Sig .

		Salvini 's superb portrayal .

		Once , likewise , have I seen ''
Richard II.	PERSON	, '' but I shall not easily forget the occasion , since the performance was interrupted by a half-demented wretch in the gallery , who fired three pistol-shots at
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, rudely breaking in upon the fine soliloquy of the King in the fifth act .

		My twenty-fifth play , added to the list only a few weeks ago , was a spirited performance of ''
Henry IV.	PERSON	, '' Part 1 , the leading parts taken by Messrs.
Warde	PERSON	and
James	PERSON	.

		And now , looking over the names of the remaining plays , I fear that I must remain content with what I have seen .

		I still have some hopes of ''
Antony	PERSON	and Cleopatra '' and of ''
Henry	PERSON	V. '' Recent news from
London	LOCATION	indicates that '' All 's Well that Ends Well '' may also be among the possibilities of the future , and the newspapers now report Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	as contemplating a production of `` Timon of
Athens	LOCATION	. ''

		Even `` John '' is not absolutely outside the range of things that may happen .

		But with ''
Henry VI.	PERSON	, '' Parts 1 , 2 , and 3 , with ''
Henry IV.	PERSON	, '' Part 2 , and with ''
Titus Andron	PERSON	- icus , '' and '' Troilus and
Cressida	PERSON	, '' the case , I fear , is hopeless .

		Possible new sensations of the first rank are closely limited to four or five ; I must henceforth be satisfied with those new sensations of the second rank that may come from more adequate presentations of the old plays than I have yet seen , or from more sympa - thetic delineations of the old characters than have yet been brought to my attention .

June 16	DATE	,
Ejje BARRAS	PERSON	'S MEMOIRS .

		* Amid the general chorus of exaltation of the genius and works of the first
Napoleon	PERSON	, the long awaited `` Memoirs of Barras '' sound a sharply discordant note .

		It is well known that the ex-Director and titular commandant of the 13th Vendemiaire came to cordially hate the man he had lifted from the squalid obscu - rity of his earlier life ; and if any further proof of the fact were needed it is to be found in abundance in these volumes .

		Barras died in
1829	DATE	.

		The last ten years of his life were spent mainly in preparing the materials for his Mem - oirs ; and these documents he bequeathed to his friend ,
M. Rousselin	PERSON	de Saint -
Albin	PERSON	, as to a congenial spirit who could be trusted to carry out editorially , and even to further , his cherished design of dwarfing and blackening the fame of the Corsican upstart .

		By a strange irony of fate these venom-laden writings , after lying un - printed for near half a century -LRB- their successive custodians shirking the risk of launching such a '' nestful of libel suits '' -RRB- | , have fallen finally into the hands of an editor who is an ardent admirer of
Napoleon	LOCATION	,
M. George Duruy	PERSON	, who now hands them over to the public , with any - thing but a benison on their author .

		Admit - ting rather grudgingly the general interest and rare piquancy of the Memoirs ,
M. Duruy	PERSON	an - grily brands
Barras	PERSON	's account of
Napoleon	PERSON	as largely a tissue of lies ; and it must be owned that the character of the
Jacobinical Vicomte	PERSON	was not such as to inspire confidence in his veracity .

		Barras was corrupt , self-seeking , and vain .

		There are passages in his book which stamp him as that meanest of black - guards , the '' lady-killer '' who gratifies his van - ity or wreaks his spite by betraying the names of his victims .

		Politically , he was , as
Taine	PERSON	says , a condottiere open to the highest bidder .

		Aristocrat by birth and sans-culotte by trade , he exploited the Revolution to his own profit ; and by adroitly trimming his sails at the right junctures he was borne prosperously on by storms which wrecked many a better and cleaner man .

		His real lack of political ideals is naively betrayed in the Memoirs .

		At the outset , for * MEMOIRS OF BARKAS , Member of the
Directorate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ed - ited , with Introduction , etc. , by
George Duruy	PERSON	.

		In four vol - umes , illustrated .

		Volumes I. and II .


New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		t Under the French law , action may be brought by descend - ants for libel on ancestors .

		instance , we find him covertly bragging of his pedigree : of his ancestral parchments ; of the Provencal proverb , JVobles comme les Barras , aussi anciens que nos rockers ; while later on he is constantly flaunting his
Jacobinism	PERSON	, his contempt of his caste , and proudly recording that , at the various sif tings and purgings of the
Jacobin Club	ORGANIZATION	, no taint of incivism was ever found to attach to the name of citizen
Barras	PERSON	.

		One may add here that it was the hand of cit - izen
Barras	PERSON	that , after the 9th Thermidor , closed the doors of the Jacobins forever .

		Yet , as
M. Duruy	PERSON	admits ,
Barras	PERSON	was not to - tally bad .

		That he had no small measure of both courage and capacity -LRB- the latter of a rather vulpine order , certainly -RRB- his own record , at - tested by history , shows .

		If he was a Terror - ist , he was not cruel ; if he guillotined his neigh - bor , it was to prevent that neighbor from guil - lotining him ; if he outranted in his levelling zeal the simon-pure sans-culottes of the gut - ters , it was to gloss over the perilous fact that he was himself a sans-culotte of the salons ; if he was a trimmer , he could strike , as his ene - mies learned on the 9th Thermidor , the 13th Vendemiaire , the 12th Germinal , etc. , occa - sions on which he clearly regarded himself afterwards as the providential man .

		Profligate , venal , self-centred , a rancorous hater and a fair - weather friend , an aristocrat at heart and a demagogue by calling , a relentless shedder of blood on occasion , yet less cruel than even the best of his colleagues , such we believe to have been in the main this most refined , most epi - curean , most ancien regime of the Montagnards , and most wildly revolutionary among the nobles in the Convention .

		While the Memoirs -LRB- thus far , at least -RRB- can hardly be said to add much to our stock of serious historical knowledge , the chance anec - dotes and pen-pictures of famous people with which they abound are of rare freshness and piquancy .

		Most of them , even where the re - lator 's malice peeps out , bear an unmistakable impress of truth .

		A notable sketch is that of
Robespierre	LOCATION	, to whom
Barras	PERSON	, shortly after his '' pacificatory '' mission of fire and sword to the
South of France	LOCATION	, paid , with
Frcron	PERSON	, a concil - iatory visit .

		Barras had been charged with thieving while on mission ; and hence had good reason to dread the encounter .

		The reception of the two deputies by the '' incorruptible '' one was alarming enough plainly a shadow of com - ing events . ''

		Robespierre was standing , wrapped in a sort of chem - ise-peignoir ; he had just left the hands of his hair -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 dresser , who had finished combing and powdering his hair ; he was without the spectacles he usually wore in public , and piercing through the powder covering that face , already so white in its natural pallor , we could see a pair of eyes whose dimness the glasses had until then screened from us .

		These eyes fastened themselves on us with a fixed stare expressive of astonishment at our appearance .

		We saluted him in the simple fashion of the period .

		He showed no recognition of our courtesy , going by turns to his toilette-glass hanging to a window looking out on a court-yard , and then to a little mirror , intended , doubtless , as an ornament to his mantel-piece ; taking his toilette-knife , he began scraping off the pow - der , mindful of observing the outlines of his carefully dressed hair ; then doffing his peignoir , he flung it on a chair close to us so as to soil our clothes , without apol - ogizing to us for his action , and without even appearing to notice our presence .

		He washed himself in a sort of basin which he held in one hand , cleaned his teeth , re - peatedly spat on the ground right at our feet , without so much as heeding us , and in almost as direct a fashion as
Potemkin	LOCATION	, who , it is known , did not take the trouble of turning the other way , but who , without warning or precaution , was wont to spit in the faces of those stand - ing before him .

		This ceremony over ,
Robespierre	LOCATION	did not even then address a single word to us .

		... I in - formed him politely that our visit to him was prompted by the esteem in which we held his political principles ; he did not deign replying to me by a single word , nor did his face reveal the trace of any emotion whatever .

		I have never seen anything so impassible in the frigid marble of statuary or in the face of the dead ... Such was our interview with
Robespierre	LOCATION	.

		I can not call it a conversation , for his lips never parted ; tightly closed as they were , he pursed them tighter ; from them , I no - ticed , oozed a bilious froth , boding no good .

		I had seen all I wanted , for I had had a view of what has been most accurately described as the tiger-cat . ''

		This meeting was , of course , the prelude to the death-struggle of the 9th Thermidor , of which and the swift denouement Barras gives a detailed and most dramatic description .

		After the parliamentary defeat of
Robespierre	LOCATION	on that day , his arrest , imprisonment , and rescue by the Commune , it was Barras who headed the troops of the Convention detailed to re - arrest him at the Hotel-de-Ville .

		The scene within was tragic enough . ''

		Robespierre had shattered his jaw with one of the two pistols carried by Le Bas , who had blown his brains out with the other .

		Couthon was hiding under a table , and
Robespierre	LOCATION	in a little room , by the door of which Le Bas lay .

		Saint Just was ministering to
Robespierre	LOCATION	.

		Henriot was crouching in a closet ... One of the sur - geons having placed on a table the teeth which had fallen from
Robespierre	LOCATION	's mouth during his examination of it , a gunner who was on duty pounced on them , and , ad - dressing
Robespierre	LOCATION	, exclaimed , You scoundrel , I will keep them as a monument of execration ! ' ''

		It was
Barras	PERSON	who hurried the details of the execution of his fallen foes spurring on to his duty the , for once , reluctant and wavering Fouquier-Tinville ; it was
Barras	PERSON	who insisted that the tumbrels should pass to the scaffold by the old route , past
Robespierre	LOCATION	's house , that
Danton	PERSON	's dying prophecy might be fulfilled ; and it was he who gave to
Sanson	PERSON	the grimly grotesque directions as to the burial . ''

		Let the bodies , '' he said , '' be thrown into the grave of the Capets !

		Louis XVI .

		was better than they .

		It will be some more royalty for Robes - pierre , for it would seem that he too had a taste for it . ''

		From the windows of the
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	,
Barras	PERSON	, breathing freer as the end approached , saw the carts containing the doomed men wend their way by the
Rue Saint	ORGANIZATION	-
Honore	PERSON	to the place of execution . ''

		The immense throng obstructed the streets and was an obstacle to the rapid progress of the procession , but the prevailing feeling was not only one of unanimous rejoicing , but of deliverance , and yet this feeling did not venture to break out in words and escape from hearts so long oppressed until it had become a recorded fact that ' the head of
Robespierre	LOCATION	had really fallen on the
Place de la Revolution	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The baskets of the executioner were then carried away to the cemetery of the Made - leine , and interred in the place designated as the tombe capetienne ... The terrible
Robespierre	LOCATION	was at last launched into the eternal night , and slept side by side with
Louis	PERSON	X VI . ''

		The terrible
Robespierre	LOCATION	, yes ; but was he the mere monster of blood and crime that
Barras	PERSON	depicts ?

		Or was he , rather , as some hold , the pure , if visionary , patriot bent on achieving his Utopia , on purging the new-born Republic of '' that vermin which had fastened on its body '' ; of scoundrels like Tallien ;
Fouche	PERSON	, '' whose atrocious face was less so than his soul '' ; Carrier , '' that bloodthirsty satrap '' ;
Courtois	PERSON	, '' thief and forger '' ; '' the drunken
Freron	PERSON	and his dissolute accomplice Barras , '' all of them men whose hands were , as Robes - pierre said , '' full of plunder and blood '' ?

		There are many , like
M. Duruy	PERSON	and
M. Ernest Hamel	PERSON	, who will see in the issue of the Ther - midorian struggle , not the overthrow of a tyrant , but the defeat of an honest zealot at the hands of the knaves he had determined to strike .

		The question is an open one .

		For our own part , we believe
Robespierre	LOCATION	to have been a danger - ous , if well-intentioned , fanatic , the purest type in history of his kind , who rose to the top by virtue of being the most fanatical man in
France	LOCATION	at a time when fanaticism was the order of the day .

		The far abler Saint-Just was his counter - part .

		In
Danton	LOCATION	,
Barras	PERSON	rightly sees the real hero of the period '' the most magnificent and grandest Revolutionist who ever breathed . ''

		Marat was , he says , Republican , '' but with an ardor over-stepping the bounds of moderation the slightest color of a speech contrary to the principles of equality and liberty inspired him 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, with the most violent suspicions . ''

		That the '' peoples ' friend '' could be easy with his foes the following incident shows . ''

		The mob had seized upon a man wearing a black coat , with the powdered and curled hair of the old regime . '

		To the lamp-post with the aristocrat ! '

		was being re - peated on all sides .

		He was about to be strung up when
Marat	PERSON	, pushing his way through the crowd , said , '' What is it you are going to do with so pitiful an aris - tocrat ?

		I know the fellow . '

		With that he seized the man , and , giving him a kick in the proper place , said , 1 Take that !

		There 's a lesson will teach you to behave better ! '

		The mob clapped its hands , and the aristocrat ran off as fast as his legs would carry him . ''

		Barras draws a striking portrait of Saint - Just , as he appeared in the tribune when read - ing the report that sent
Danton	PERSON	to the scaffold .

		`` Phlegmatic , and in his sententious tone , he recites this incredible theme , holding the manuscript in a hand that remains motionless , while the other makes but one gesture , inexorable and from which there is no appeal a gesture like unto the very knife of the guillotine . ''

		Barras 's treatment of women in his Memoirs is mostly malicious , and sometimes infamous .

		As to
Mme. de Stael	ORGANIZATION	, he declares -LRB- with his usual abominable innuendo -RRB- : '' I never really knew to which sex she belonged .

		... The virility of her form , face , and carriage , her manner of wearing her clothes , the strength of her in - tellectual conceptions , her exuberant vigor and energy , all , in short , would have led me to believe that she belonged rather to our sex than the other , had she not given indubitable proofs of her own by several acts of maternity . ''

		Solely , as we believe , to strike at
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon , it is upon the unhappy
Josephine	PERSON	that our virtuoso of insult launches the full tide of his malice crushing , as it were , with his brutal fist the delicate petals of this frail and lovely tropical flower .

		It must be owned that
Josephine	PERSON	's indiscretions gave matter enough for grievous discoveries .

		But
Barras	PERSON	paints her as a mere vulgar Messalina a '' lewd Creole '' whose most catholic tastes knew no distinction of rank , of character , or even of color ; as the known mistress of himself , of Hoche , of
Hoche	ORGANIZATION	's hostler ; as a sordid strum - pet who '' would have drunk gold from the skull of her lover '' ; as an invalided coquette , precociously decrepit from her excesses , deriv - ing '' none of her attractions from nature , but everything from art the most refined , the most provident , the most finished art ever called into requisition in the exercise of their profes - sion by the harlots of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		`` Confessing '' -LRB- with a fine , grand-gentleman show of '' modesty '' -RRB- his own liaison with
Jose	PERSON	- phine ,
Barras	PERSON	avers , not only that
Napoleon	PERSON	, when expectant bridegroom , was aware of it , but that he exploited it to push his own affairs , and to curry favor . ''

		As he perpetually had something to ask of me , '' says
Barras	PERSON	, '' he thought to appear less of a petitioner by getting her to do the soliciting . ''

		One of these begging interviews , he continues , '' lasted longer than suited me . '' ''

		... Straining me to her bosom , she upbraided me for no longer loving her , again and again saying to me that I was the man whom she had loved more than any other , and that she could not tear herself away from me just as she was about to become the wife of the ' little general . ' ''

		Proceeding with his '' confession , '' this chiv - alrous gentleman charges his petitioner with assuming toward him the role of
Potiphar	ORGANIZATION	's wife , adding -LRB- rather unnecessarily -RRB- , '' I should , nevertheless , be lying did I pretend to have been so cruel as the young minister of Pha - raoh . ''

		We should have spared the reader these unsavory details , were they not essential to a proper estimate of the Memoirs and the mem - oirist .

		* The evidences of
Barras	PERSON	's hatred of the Em - peror are freely sown throughout the volumes .

		He patronizes , sneers at , and reviles him by turns ; jeers at his poverty , his shabby clothes , his diminutive size -LRB- '' puss-in-boots , '' is one of his nicknames -RRB- , and affects to regard the '' Na - poleon legend '' as rooted in the silly cult of a few '' grognards . ''

		He does not hesitate to liken him physically to the hideous
Marat	PERSON	, and morally to the infamous
Marquis de Sade	PERSON	, the list of whose bestialities a nicer historian would hesitate to touch with the tongs .

		Barras cer - tainly played a brilliant and honorable part at the siege of
Toulon	LOCATION	and on the 13th Vendemiaire ; and he is at great pains to belittle
Napoleon	PERSON	's role on both these occasions .

		At
Toulon	LOCATION	this role is summed up in three blunders ; while on the 13th Vendemiaire ,
Barras	PERSON	repeatedly as - serts , ''
Bonaparte	PERSON	was neither more nor less than my aide-de-camp . ''

		Very malicious , very racy , and doubtless largely true , is our Ther - sites 's account of the
Bonaparte	PERSON	family shady adventurers of the '' dead-beat '' order , driven out of
Corsica	LOCATION	, and lighting first on
Antibes	LOCATION	, where they lived on money begged , borrowed , or stolen , and barely sufficient '' to provide them with a mattress which they shared in common , and a cauldron wherein to boil vegetables , and out of which they all ate together . ''

		Strange indeed seem to have been the shifts to which * Some notion of
Barras	PERSON	's repute with his contemporaries may be formed from the fact that there was issued in his life - time a three-volume work entitled '' Amours du Vicomte de Barras . ' ''

		Barras rather boasts of it .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 these Corsican shorn lambs by choice resorted : to posing as refugees ; to begging military ra - tions , on the plea of a relative in the artillery ; in short , to trading on everything dishonora - bly trafficable even on `` the budding allure - ments of the young ladies . ''

		We are far from meaning to imply an opinion that
Barras	PERSON	's nar - rative is mainly false , and therefore valueless as serious history .

		We repeat that much of it bears the unmistakable impress of truth .

		It is the personal side of the Memoirs , the anecdotes , bits of < 7e ?

		we-paintmg and portraiture , that lend them their peculiar interest , and explain the sensation they have excited in
France	LOCATION	and the impatience with which the closing volumes are awaited .

		The work is handsomely mounted , and the portraits , though few , are from rare originals and of singular interest .

		E G j ENGLISH SEAMEN IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY .

		* In his address on '' The Science of History , '' delivered in
1864	DATE	, Mr.
Froude	PERSON	demanded of history that it match itself with the drama : '' There are periods the history of which may be so written that the actors shall reveal their characters in their own words ; where mind can be seen matched against mind , and the great passions of the epoch not simply be described as existing , but be exhibited at their white heat in the souls and hearts possessed by them . ''

		In this latest , posthumous volume , the pro- gramme laid down thirty years before is real - ized .

		The nine lectures of which the book is made up contain the exposition , the develop - ment , and the catastrophe of one of the most picturesque episodes in English history the defeat of the Spanish Armada ; and the his - torian 's method is , as he has proposed , in large measure to let the actors reveal their characters in their own words .

		Thus , we meet hitherto unpublished letters and memoirs from Father
Parsons	PERSON	, the Jesuit general in
England	LOCATION	, from Sir
John Hawkins	PERSON	, Sir
Francis Drake	PERSON	,
Medina Sidonia	PERSON	, and others .

		These are the chief actors .

		Mr.
Froude	PERSON	's style in these lectures well merits the attributive '' dramatic . ''

		It is more nervous , more direct , more personal , than ever before .

		True , we are tolerably well acquainted with this epoch .

		Mr.
Froude	PERSON	himself has treated it twice , in his '' History of
England	LOCATION	'' and in '' The Spanish Story of the Armada . ''

		Thus we are well prepared for a drama .

		The explanation is , in brief , that the
English Navy	ORGANIZATION	, which defeated the Armada and established the imperishable renown of English seamen , grew out of piracy encouraged by self-preservation and revenge for religious persecutions .

		To quote the lec - turer 's own words : '' The English sea-power was the legitimate child of the Reformation .


Matthew Parker	PERSON	and
Bishop Jewel	ORGANIZATION	, the judicious Hooker himself , excellent men as they were , would have written and preached to small pur - pose without Sir
Francis Drake	PERSON	's cannon to play an ac - companiment to their teaching '' -LRB- p. 3 -RRB- ... '' The Pro- testants revenged their injuries -LSB- at the hands of the Inquisition -RSB- at their own risk and in their own way , and thus from
Edward VI	ORGANIZATION	.

		's time to the end of the century privateering came to be the special occupation of ad - venturous , honorable gentlemen , who could serve God , their country , and themselves , in fighting Catholics '' -LRB- p. 18 -RRB- ... `` It was a wild business : enterprise and buccaneering sanctified by religion and hatred of cruelty ; but it was a school for the building of vessels which could outsail all others on the sea '' -LRB- p. 21 -RRB- .

		One tone which Mr.
Froude	PERSON	struck in the overture of
1864	DATE	has almost died out of this opera of
1894	DATE	.

		History is '' A voice forever sounding across the centuries the laws of right and wrong .

		Opinions alter , manners change , creeds rise and
fall	DATE	, but the moral law is written on the tablets of eternity .

		For every false word or unright - eous deed , for cruelty and oppression , for lust and van - ity , the price has to be paid at last . ''

		There we hear the disciple of
Carlisle	LOCATION	.

		But the following sounds like
Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	.

		Speak - ing of
Drake	ORGANIZATION	's splendid piracies on his trip round the world , he says : '' In that intensely serious century , men were more occupied with the realities than the forms of things .

		... The King of
Spain	LOCATION	had given Elizabeth a hundred occasions for declaring war against him .

		Situated as she was , she could not begin a war on such a quarrel .

		She had to use such resources as she had , and of these resources the best was a splendid race of men who were not afraid to do for her at their own risk what commis - sioned officers would and might have justly done had formal war been declared ... No doubt by the letter of the law of nations
Drake	PERSON	and
Hawkins	PERSON	were corsairs .

		But the common sense of
Europe	LOCATION	saw through the form to the substance which lay below it , and the instinct of their countrymen gave them a place among the fight - ing heroes of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 103 -RRB- .

		Quite different is the situation when
Fitzwil	PERSON	- liam uses detective arts to discover the Eidolfi plot against
Elizabeth	PERSON	's life : '' Very treacherous , think some good people .

		Well , there are times when one admires even treachery '' -LRB- P - 67 -RRB- .

		342 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, What a lamentable subtilizing in language is this !

		The
Froude	PERSON	of
1864	DATE	would at least have examined the premises more carefully before allowing himself to pronounce such a conclu - sion .

		Anent Sir
John Hawkins	PERSON	's participation in the slave-trade , after depicting the usual fate of captives in war , Mr.
Froude	PERSON	says : ''
Las Casas	PERSON	and those who thought as he did are not to be charged with infamous inhumanity if they pro- posed to buy those poor creatures from their captors , save them from Mumbo Jumbo , and carry them to coun - tries where they would be valuable property , and be at least as well cared for as the mules and horses ... It was an experiment .

		The full consequences could not be foreseen , and I can not see that as an experiment it merits the censure which in its later developments it eventually came to deserve '' -LRB- p. 38 -RRB- .

		This is not so surprising from the Englishman who in
1864	DATE	thought that ``
Washington	LOCATION	might have hesitated to draw the sword against En - gland could he have seen the country which he made as we see it now . ''

		Mr.
Froude	PERSON	finds the earliest use of the term '' Puritan `` in the memorial of Father
Parsons	PERSON	already referred to , date
1585	DATE	.

		Another inter - esting item is this : '' In the
Portsmouth	LOCATION	fleet lay undeveloped the genius of the future naval greatness of
England	LOCATION	... The watchword on board was ' God save the
King	PERSON	' ; the an - swer was , ` Long to reign over us ' : the earliest germ discoverable of the English National Anthem '' -LRB- p. 14 -RRB- .

		It is a curious circumstance that a professor at Oxford could say to his audience : '' Very few of you probably know more of Lope de Vega than his name '' -LRB- p. 75 -RRB- .

		The strong individuality of the writer per - vades these lectures .

		We get almost as near to him as though we were in his presence . ''

		An
Oxford Church of England	ORGANIZATION	education is an ex - cellent thing , and beautiful characters have been formed in the Catholic universities abroad ; but as the elements of dynamite are innocent in themselves , yet when fused -LSB- sic ? -RSB-

		together produce effects no one would have dreamed of , so
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, when they have run together have always generated a somewhat furious compound '' -LRB- p. 108 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Froude	PERSON	makes , as it were , death-bed con - fession to the rule of force , in these words : '' I have often asked my Radical friends what is to be done if out of every hundred enlightened voters two - thirds will give their votes one way , but are afraid to fight , and the remaining third will not only vote but will fight too if the poll goes against them .

		Which has the right to rule ?

		I can tell them which will rule .

		The brave and resolute minority will rule ... The majority must be prepared to assert their Divine Right with their hands , or it will go the way that other Divine Rights have gone before .

		... I will not believe the world to have been so ill constructed that there are rights which can not be enforced .

		It appears to me that the true right to rule in any nation lies with those who are best and bravest , whether their numbers are large or small '' -LRB- p. 148 -RRB- .

		If Mr.
Froude	PERSON	were only here to answer , one would like to ask him whether , then , the ele - phant should rule his keeper ; by what law the officers rule their men , the general his army , the gentle queen her navy ; whether best al - ways means strongest with their hands .

		But it would not be quite fair now .

		DISCUSSIONS OF LABOR PROBLEMS .

		* Decidedly the best history of trade unions that has appeared in any country is that by Mr. and Mrs.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	, the latter already favorably known in economic literature as Miss Beatrice Pot - ter , author of '' The Cooperative Movement in
Great Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		The only work likely to remain in the field as supplementary , to a large degree , of this new volume is '' Social Peace , '' by Schulze-Gaever - nitz .

		Many readers , knowing the prominent part taken by Mr. and Mrs.
Webb	PERSON	in the propagandism of Socialism of a peaceful evolutionary type , will be surprised to discover how unbiased is the present treatment .

		The study of a movement which , in one century , has grown in
Great Britain	LOCATION	to include over one and a half million members , constituting in many trades nearly every skilled worker , deserves all the attention bestowed upon it .

		This movement , in its comparative freedom from the violence and cor - ruption that weakens some American unions , is a lesson to our own organizations .

		Yet the curious conservatism and trade selfishness still existing in the English unions form a great barrier to rapid progress there .

		The demand for the state manage - ment of industry is becoming more and more gen - eral among English workingmen ; but success in actual achievement will evidently be slow so long as the English wage-workers retain the quality often mentioned by our authors , a refusal to remove incompetent officers , due '' partly to a generous ob - jection to ' do a man out of his job , ' and partly to a deep-rooted belief that any given piece of work can be done as well by one man as another .

		THE DIAL 343 We can commend with equal heartiness the work on cooperative manufacturing in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Benjamin Jones	PERSON	.

		While the general reader , and even the specialist , will desire little more than to glance hastily over the mass of detailed history here presented , every student of cooperation will be greatly interested in the conclusions of this life-long leader of the movement .

		The standpoint is almost precisely that of the more brilliant and less detailed work of Miss
Beatrice Potter	PERSON	-LRB- now Mrs.
Webb	PERSON	-RRB- on '' The Cooperative Movement in
Great Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		After many decades of failure to establish factories wherein the workers should own most of the cap - ital , elect some of their number as managers , suc - cess is beginning to dawn upon an altogether differ - ent type of productive cooperation the '' federalist '' method .

		In this , the capital and managing ability are furnished by the wholesale societies or groups of stores , in other words , by federations of con - sumers , who take charge of manufacturing the goods they need .

		One-seventh of all the population of
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	are entering upon this work .

		If the other six-sevenths , or even most of them , should join the movement , there would be social ownership and management of factories and work - shops , at least .

		Profit-sharing is carefully consid - ered in this work , but receives only condemnation ; though it is not easy to see how anything urged by Mr.
Jones	PERSON	militates against a truly honest profit - sharing plan .

		In its wide range of facts and careful deductions , Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's work deserves to rank as the most exhaustive , as it is the freshest , book on the subject .

		It can hardly be called the most read - able , although it would be difficult to present such an array of facts in better shape ; and the many conclusions drawn are sure to interest all . ''

		The Evolution of Modern Capitalism , '' by Mr.
John A. Hobson	PERSON	, author of '' Problems of Poverty , '' is the keenest discussion of the effects of machinery upon labor , industrial depressions , women 's work , wages , and the evolution of the trust , that we have read for a long time .

		Starting out with a descrip - tion of the industrial revolution , and the irresistible tendency of the present age toward the formation of monopolies of large capital as well as the monop - olies of situation , Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	holds that industrial depressions are caused by an undue proportion of the wealth of society going into capital goods ; that is , people , or society as a whole , save too much and consume too little of the products of machinery , and devote this saving to forms of machinery which are not properly adjusted to the needs of society .

		The chapter on the economy of high wages is the best word that has appeared upon the subject ; taking neither the exaggerated stand of
Schoenhof	PERSON	, nor the too optimistic view of
Rae and Brentano	PERSON	, that the higher the wages per day the greater the efficiency comparatively , or that the less the hours the greater the day 's work .

		Nevertheless , the author shows how the balance of advantage , from a social standpoint , lies in shorter hours and an increase in the rational consumptive capacity of the masses .

		He looks for - ward to a very gradual assumption by society of all monopolistic and machine production , leaving to the individual initiative personal and professional serv - ice and handicrafts .

		He seems to us mistaken in holding that the growth of population , with a con - stantly rising standard of material consumption , is likely to prevent any diminution in the proportion of labor engaged on the soil ; rather , the contrary appears to be probable , because as the world grows wealthier the demand increases for finer and finer finishing of goods rather than an increase propor - tionately in the quantity of raw material in their texture ; while in the second place , the tendency of machinery is to relieve men of the necessity of spend - ing so large a part of his time in gathering the raw material .

		Hence , the growth of city life relatively to the country , despite its many evil sides , is an inev - itable outcome of growing wealth and the power of man over nature .

		Though many will disagree with parts of Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's analysis , no one interested in the problems he treats can afford to overlook his concise and readable discussion .

		Mr.
John Rae	PERSON	, in his volume entitled '' Eight Hours for Work , '' reprints his articles of the last two or three years on the subject from the '' Con - temporary Review '' and the '' Economic Journal , '' with much new matter added .

		Mr.
Rae	PERSON	is an en - thusiastic believer in the increased productiveness which comes from the eight-hour day , and gives very strong evidence from the history of
Australia	LOCATION	and the last fifty years in
England	LOCATION	to show that a reduction in hours does not , as many working-men hold , increase the opportunities for employment .

		Mr.
Rae	PERSON	holds , with Professor
Marshall	PERSON	and other economists , that it is an '' economic fallacy which leads so many persons to think that they will all increase the wealth they individually enjoy by the diminishing of wealth they individually produce , and look for a great absorption of the unemployed to flow from a general restriction of production , the very thing which in reality would have the opposite effect of reducing the demand for labor and throw - ing multitudes out of employment . ''

		This view is not entirely conclusive , because perfect mobility of labor and capital do not prevail so as to allow the logic of competiton to work itself out fully .

		Mr.
Rae	PERSON	shows that the business interests need not fear a shortening of the hours of work , and favors trade - union and state activity for securing these hours .

		Professor
Brentano	PERSON	, in his small but well-written book on '' Hours , Wages , and Production , '' shows how in times past the increase of wages , shortening of hours , and easier conditions of employment , did not necessarily increase the energy of labor , because the wage-worker had then a stationary standard of living , and when he could satisfy this with fewer days a week or fewer hours a day he worked less ; but now , thanks to public education , migration , and other factors which have increased the wants and aroused the ambition , increased wages and shorter 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, hours seem to be accompanied with increased effi - ciency of labor .

		In this book , the author , famous already for his classical but perhaps exaggerated arguments for trade unionism , has rendered another service to the cause of labor .

BEMIS	ORGANIZATION	.

		A DICTIONARY OF NAMES .

		* The '' Century Cyclopedia of Names '' is well conceived .

		To throw under one alphabet succinct descriptions of every interesting thing that has a proper name and of every person of general note or reputation , - to make a dictionary of names as an appendix to a dictionary of words , and to make it a separate volume , this is a highly commenda - ble undertaking .

		Its projector and successful ex - ecutor might fairly be called a public benefactor .

		The idea has the simplicity which is apt to charac - terize discoveries and reforms , and we should be grateful to editor and publishers for the faith and foresight shown in risking so much upon an enter - prise so bold and so original .

		Considering the rapid widening of human interests nowadays , and of the fund of human knowledge , considering , too , the great number of distinguished people of the pres - ent time who are excluded from consideration here , one is inclined to think that the final form of the work will have to be two volumes of this size , instead of one .

		More than two would be inconven - ient as well as costly .

		Meanwhile , it is only fair to judge the present work for what it is , and to make due allowance for the limitations imposed by the plan .

		The book is printed and bound in the magnificent style and form of '' The Century Dictionary , '' to which it forms in reality a seventh and concluding volume .

		I have no hesitation in advising every pos - sessor of '' The Century Dictionary '' to place this volume on the same shelf , he will take it down oftener than the other six .

		And , although he must be prepared for frequent disappointment , and should not stake his reputation -LRB- if that be dear to him -RRB- upon the accuracy of the information here given , he will often consult the book to good purpose ; for it does , undeniably , contain an enormous fund of exact information .

		Having said so much in perfect good faith , I now proceed to give some of the results of a critical ex - amination to which , with the kind assistance of one or two of my colleagues , I have subjected certain de - partments of the work .

		Such an examination must necessarily be in large part microscopic , inasmuch as a book of this kind is , in the last analysis , noth - ing but a vast accumulation of minute details , the * THE CENTURY CYCLOPEDIA or NAMES .

		A Pronouncing and
Etymological Dictionary of Names	ORGANIZATION	in Geography , Biog - raphy ,
Mythology	ORGANIZATION	, History , Ethnology , Art , Archaeology , Fiction , etc. , etc. , etc. .

The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		value of which depends upon their absolute accu - racy .

		Much depends , to be sure , upon the manner in which the details are grouped and presented ; and of this editorial portion of the work I have some - thing to say .

		Inasmuch as I have been compelled to draw certain conclusions which it is an unpleas - ant duty to state , and which it may not be pleasant for the editor and some of his staff of '' Eminent Specialists '' to hear stated , I shall endeavor to array my examples in such a way that they may speak louder than any damaging inferences I may draw from them .

		Nevertheless , my share of these col - umns being limited , I am obliged at every point to select but a few out of the many examples I have accumulated .

		I have been forced to the conclusion that the work of preparing this dictionary has been '' rushed '' unduly ; that many parts of it have been superficially or carelessly done ; that the editor has shown himself lacking in the scholarly sense of the values and relations of things , which the presiding genius of such a work should possess ; and that in consequence the book is deficient in proportion .

		The following sentences from the Preface may suffice to indicate the origin , purpose , and plan of this book : '' This
Cyclopedia of Names	ORGANIZATION	is an outgrowth of The Century Dictionary ... The range of names to be in - cluded was practically unrestricted , since the object sought was ... a general account of all the names ex - cluded , by their nature , from the larger work ... The only condition of insertion has been that the name should be one about which information would be likely to be sought ... The space given to persons and places is relatively much greater than that devoted to any other class , and the others follow in what appeared to be the order of their usefulness to the general reader , whose needs have everywhere been considered in the selection of the names to be defined . ''

		Among the eminent men of the present time of whom no mention is made are the following : Fe ` lix
Faure	PERSON	, the new President of
France	LOCATION	,
Brisson	PERSON	, the leading candidate in opposition , and
Dupuy	PERSON	, the ex - premier ; Dr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	, now one of the most celebrated of living Americans ;
Li Hung Chang	PERSON	, who impressed
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	as one of the greatest of men ;
Karl Hillebrand	PERSON	, perhaps the most cosmopolitan and original of German essayists ;
Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	, `` the Bel - gian Shakespeare '' -LRB- absurdly so styled -RRB- ; Casimir Pe ` rier -LRB- 1811-1876 -RRB- , the more distinguished father of the French ex-President ; the late Sir
John Thompson	PERSON	, Pre - mier of
Canada	LOCATION	, and the Hon.
Mackenzie Bowell	PERSON	, his successor ;
Fukuzawa	PERSON	, the '' great commoner '' of
Japan	LOCATION	, and the
Field Marshal	ORGANIZATION	,
Count Oyama	LOCATION	;
Madame Sophie Kovalevski	PERSON	, the mathematician ;
Alexander Kielland	PERSON	, the Norwegian novelist ;
Carducci	PERSON	, the Italian poet , Far - ina and d'Annunzio , the Italian novelists ;
Friedrich Nietzsche	PERSON	, the philosopher of individualism ; Professor
Weismann	PERSON	, from whose name an international word has been coined ; He 're ` dia , the French poet recently elected to the Academy ; the leading modern political econo - mists ,
Alfred Marshall	PERSON	,
Bastable	PERSON	, aid Bohm-Bawerk .

		This list might be greatly extended without the in - troduction of a single name not conforming to the ed - itor 's one condition of insertion , that it be '' one about which information would be likely to be sought . ''

		But
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 this list of omitted names , all but one or two of which are famous , and some positively illustrious , is in itself sufficient to prove that one can not be at all confident of finding the name of a famous contemporary in this dic - tionary .

		On the other hand , many names , far from famous , are recorded , about whom , for some reason not stated , the editor imagines that information '' would be likely to be sought . ''

		I have taken pains to record in my copy the dates of the deaths of notable people that have occurred since this cycloptedia of names went to press .

		The Preface bears date of
September 1 , 1894	DATE	, by which time , I pre - sume , the printing was completed .

		The latest death that I find recorded here is that of James Strong -LRB- Au - gust 7 , 1894 -RRB- .

		The deaths of Dr.
Richard Morris	PERSON	and Prof.
Henry Morley	PERSON	, which occurred last
May	DATE	, are also recorded .

		The following are among those of whose lives there is some record here , but whose deaths have been too recent to admit of mention : Prof.
John Nichol	PERSON	, Rev.
David Swing	PERSON	, Gen.
N. P. Banks	PERSON	,
Launt Thomp	PERSON	- son ,
G. B. de Rossi	PERSON	,
Celia Tbaxter	PERSON	.

		Concerning the fol - lowing equally notable people , recently deceased , this dictionary is silent : Mrs.
Augusta Webster	PERSON	, F. H. Un - derwood ,
Samuel J. Kirkwood	PERSON	,
John Veitch	PERSON	,
James Darmesteter	PERSON	.

		Mine .

		Fursch-Madi .

		It would be inter - esting to know why the editor supposed
G. B. de Rossi	PERSON	a name concerning which information would be likely to be looked for , and
James Darmesteter	PERSON	not ; why he excluded Fursch-Madi and admitted
Rosina Yokes	PERSON	!

		If
George Riddle	PERSON	, the elocutionist , receives notice be - cause he is an American , why should no mention be made of the far more celebrated
Hutchinson	PERSON	family of singers ?

		Among American authors of more or less recent note , we find recorded the names and achievements of
C. W. Balestier	PERSON	,
J. B. McMaster	PERSON	,
W. H. Gilder	PERSON	,
R. E. Thomp	PERSON	- son , and Schele De Vere ; while among those about whom the editor has supposed that information would not be likely to be sought are
Emma Lazarus	PERSON	,
Edith Thomas	PERSON	,
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	, Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, Bran - der
Matthews	PERSON	, and
John Muir	PERSON	.

		The first and last in this list of omitted names have been held by many , from
Emerson	LOCATION	down , to be among the more interesting fig - ures in American literature .

		In the field of recent British literature a similar lack of any definite system of selection is to be detected .


Edmund Gosse	PERSON	,
Hall Caine	PERSON	,
Kipling	LOCATION	,
W. E. Henley	PERSON	,
William Watson	PERSON	,
James Thomson	PERSON	-LRB- 1834-1882 -RRB- , are duly included ; but why are
Theodore Watts	PERSON	,
Churton Collins	PERSON	,
Conan Doyle	PERSON	,
Rider Haggard	ORGANIZATION	, Dean Hole , and
Roden Noel	PERSON	left out ?

		If '' information would be likely to be sought '' concerning
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, might not that search haply lead straight to his castigator ,
Churton Collins	PERSON	?

		And why should '' the general reader '' be supposed to crave more information about Dr.
Morris	PERSON	and Professors
Morley	PERSON	and
Nichol	PERSON	-LRB- '' all honorable men '' -RRB- than about a really first-rate man like
Theodore Watts	PERSON	?

		Much the same inconsistencies are to be found where - ever I have chanced to look .

		Of our '' great editors , '' we find mention of Stead ,
Reid	PERSON	,
Watterson	PERSON	,
Dana	PERSON	,
J. G. Bennett	PERSON	,
G. A. Townsend	PERSON	,
Parke Godwin	PERSON	, and
Charles Emory Smith	PERSON	; but we look in vain for the names of
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	and
Horace White	PERSON	.

		Passing by an easy transition from editors to horses , we find , in the inter - esting biography of
Palo Alto	LOCATION	, the statement that his record was lowered by
Stamboul	PERSON	, a fact which seems to entitle the latter to a notice , which , however , is not to be found .

		Palo Alto , by a natural if somewhat gro - tesque association , suggests President
Jordan	PERSON	of
Stan	PERSON	- ford
University	ORGANIZATION	, who is duly noticed , although Presi - dents
Harper	PERSON	and
Stanley Hall	PERSON	, and Director
Holden	PERSON	-LRB- of the
Lick Observatory	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , are passed over .

		Among American astronomers
Holden	PERSON	is not the only one for - gotten : Boss ,
Burnham	LOCATION	,
Chandler	LOCATION	,
Hall	PERSON	, and still others , are plunged in the '' sleepy drench . ''

		Barnard ,
Gould	PERSON	,
Newcomb	PERSON	, and others , are mentioned .

		Of the smaller colleges , some , as
Beloit	LOCATION	and
Emory	ORGANIZATION	, find separate men - tion ; others of equal importance , as
Wabash	LOCATION	and
Knox	PERSON	, are omitted .

		Among German professors , Professor Wiilker of
Leipzig	LOCATION	is noticed , while Professor
Rudolph Hildebrand	PERSON	, a more eminent colleague recently deceased , is forgot - ten .

		At
Berlin	LOCATION	, Professor
Lazarus	PERSON	is taken and Pro- fessor
Paulsen	PERSON	is left .

		Of famous actors of present or recent time at the The'atre Franc.ais , the editor notices Got ,
Coquelin	PERSON	-LRB- pere , cadet , and ^ / z/s -RRB- , Mounet-Sully , Fa - vart ,
Brohan	PERSON	,
Samary	LOCATION	, and others , while omitting the names of such equally eminent artists as
Delaunay	PERSON	, Worms ,
Febvre	LOCATION	,
Blanche	PERSON	-
Baretta	LOCATION	,
Broisat	LOCATION	,
Reichem	PERSON	- berg .

		Certainly the least of these last is an artist be - side whom Coquelin fils must take a very modest place .

		The treatment of the subject of pronunciation is often inadequate .

		Oftentimes the pronunciation of a name about which there can be no possible mistake is duly recorded : e. g. , Black , White ,
Brown	PERSON	, Gray ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		No foreigner sufficiently acquainted with English to under - stand the key to the pronunciation and the system of notation would need to be told how to pronounce such words .

		Many longer and less familiar names are left unpronounced : e. g. ,
Wilibald	LOCATION	,
Willard	LOCATION	,
Wollstonecraft	PERSON	.

		In one column the pronunciation of the name Bee is duly given , while that of
Beefsteak Club	ORGANIZATION	is not given .

		Hundreds of similar discrepancies might be cited .

		Again , when definite information is needed the name is in many cases left unpronounced : e. g. ,
Daircell	PERSON	,
Dakiki	LOCATION	, Flore et Blanchefleur ,
Hissarlik	LOCATION	,
Malevole	LOCATION	,
Muspilli	LOCATION	,
Romualdo	LOCATION	,
Strachey	LOCATION	,
Wilkinasaga	LOCATION	.

		Sometimes the information given is of no value , as when the two possible pronunciations of the family name of
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	are both given , the one which this Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	did not use being placed first ; sometimes the marking is positively wrong : e. g. , As - sornmoir ,
Murger	PERSON	,
Rouher	PERSON	, the final r being incorrectly marked as silent .

		When a name is repeated , the pro- nunciation is generally figured under the first entry and omitted under the rest : e. g , ,
Wright	PERSON	-LRB- eight entries -RRB- , but in the cases of some familiar names the marking is repeated : e. g. , Mure ,
Whitney	PERSON	-LRB- six entries , the pronun - ciation marked under the first two -RRB- ,
Wilkinson	PERSON	-LRB- four entries , the pronunciation marked under the first and last -RRB- .

		The cross-references seem to have been very care - lessly edited .

		S. v. '' Castle Rackrent , '' the reader is invited to '' See Rackrent , '' which is invisible ; s. v. '' Gar - ter , '' the only remark is '' See Garter '' ; s. v. ''
Lammer	PERSON	- muir , '' no reference is made to
Scott	PERSON	's romance ; s. v. '' Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' a wrong date of publication is given , the correct date being given s. v. ''
Goldsmith	PERSON	'' ; and a like error in the case of the '' Nouvelle He `` loi ` se '' may be corrected by reference to the article ''
Rous	PERSON	- seau . ''

		If the impatient reader desires information about the Grand Lama , he will look , if he has learned something of the habits of this book , under '' Grand . ''

		No entry : turn to `` Lama . ''

		Under this word stands the sole and mysterious legend , '' See Suahili '' under this , '' See Swahili '' ; under this , '' See Kisuahili '' ; this , 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, when found , is kaleidoscoped into
Kiswahili	PERSON	, who , or which , with `` damnable iteration , '' invites you to `` See Suahili '' - if you live to reach her , he will have a fa - miliar look , but it will persist in his admonition to '' See '' someone else .

		I have myself seen them all fre - quently without yet being the wiser , and am beginning to suspect that they are creatures of the imagination of one of the '' eminent specialists . ''

		An even more unaccountable circumstance is that of the omission of any notice of the famous
Comstock Lode	ORGANIZATION	, which has yielded more than
$ 325,000,000	MONEY	; in the ar - ticles '' Sutro '' and ''
Virginia City	LOCATION	'' it is barely men - tioned .

		Of miscellaneous errors I note the following : S. v. ''
Howells	PERSON	, '' '' The Lady of the Aroostook '' is wrongly dated ; s. v. `` Faust , '' for
Auster	PERSON	read Anster ;
Murger	ORGANIZATION	is germanized into Miirger ; s. v. '' Smart ,
Chris	PERSON	- topher , '' for '' A Song of David '' read '' A Song to
David	PERSON	'' ; for `` Grimm ,
Hermann	PERSON	, '' read `` Grimm , Her - man '' ; s. v. ''
Lessing	PERSON	, '' for Goerze -LRB- thrice -RRB- read Goeze .

		S. v. '' Assommoir , '' the word is explained as meaning `` bludgeon '' ; some clue to the subject would have been given by the statement that , as used by Zola , the word means '' a low drinking-place . ''

		The editor is sure that the word '' Fdlibres '' is derived from a Provencal word felibriges .

		What '' eminent specialist '' told him that ?

		Mistral first heard the word from an old woman who did not know what it meant ; Mistral does not know , and nobody has ever found out .

		So at least says Gas - ton
Paris	LOCATION	, who is indeed an eminent specialist .

		The dictionary goes on to state that the brotherhood was founded by
Roumanille	ORGANIZATION	, `` about
1835	DATE	. ''

		According to
Gaston Paris	PERSON	it was founded by Mistral on the 21st of
May , 1854	DATE	.

		Of course a name-book like this has no space to waste upon theories and conjectures , like those in which Shake - speare scholarship unfortunately abounds .

		Yet the notice of Shakespeare 's '' Macbeth '' is largely made up of a tissue of conjectures which no one , so far as I know , accepts .

		We are informed in large type at the begin - ning of the article that this tragedy was '' first played in
Scotland	LOCATION	about
1601	DATE	, but revised by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and produced at court about
1606	DATE	, and on the public stage in
1610	DATE	. ''

		A greater number of unverified statements could scarcely have been juggled into so few words .

		If there be any evidence that '' Macbeth '' was first played in
Scotland	LOCATION	, that it was afterwards revised by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, that it was produced at coiirt about
1606	DATE	, or at any time , that a term of years elapsed between its revision for production at court and its public repre - sentation , all the recent editors , including
Furness	PERSON	, Fur - nivall , and
Wright	PERSON	, must have entered into a conspiracy to suppress such evidence .

		The name '' Juliet '' is marked as if accented on the last syllable , though to accent it so would be to do vio - lence to the metre whenever the word occurs , either in '' Romeo and Juliet '' or in `` Measure for Measure . ''

		Infelicities of style are much less frequent than errors like those I have cited .

		We are told of
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	that '' At the age of sixteen she was very deaf '' ; it would be very interesting to know whether she ceased to be deaf when she arrived at the age of seventeen .

		Sometimes there is a relative over-fulness of inform - ation , and again the brevity of statement is extremely bald .

		The fictitious creations of several novelists are somewhat fully characterized : Esmeralda ,
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, Mrs.
Poyser	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gamp	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	, for example , receive their share of space .

		Of Me ` rime'e 's ''
Carmen	PERSON	, '' on the other hand , we learn nothing , save that it is a story '' published in
1847	DATE	. ''

		In consideration of the cir - cumstance that a well-known opera has been based upon it , a line or two of fine print should have been spared for a slight account of the story and its heroine .

		I could give scores of similar examples .

		Space , of course , is very limited , but a better editor would have made it .

		In the distribution of space to distinguished names may be found one of the surest criteria of editorial judgment .

		I have accordingly tested this dictionary with regard to the relative prominence it accords to the biographies of some two hundred famous men .

		My list of these names , arranged upon a scale of inches , is an amazing document .

		I must premise that this cyclo - pedia is printed in
1085	DATE	triple-column pages , each col - umn measuring ten and three-eighths inches .

		Some 34,000 inches do not afford too much space in which to record important proper names of all sorts from the beginning of the world .

		Even were but one-fourth of an inch given to each entry , great care would have to be exercised in the selection .

		The present editor varies the length of his articles from one line up to nearly two columns .

		The longest article I have noticed is that upon Na - poleon , seventeen and one-half inches ; or , including the following article upon the
Napoleonic Wars	ORGANIZATION	, twenty - one and one-half inches , i. e. , more than two columns .

		William the Conqueror gets nine inches ;
Washington	LOCATION	, eight ; Cffisar ,
Charlemagne	LOCATION	, and
Grant	PERSON	, respectively , about three ;
Alexander	PERSON	and Hannibal , an inch and a half each .

		Among statesmen ,
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	fills seven and one-half inches , Lincoln four and one-half ,
Franklin	PERSON	three and one-half ,
Webster	PERSON	less than three ,
Bismarck	PERSON	and
Richelieu	PERSON	two each , Pericles scarcely more than an inch .

		Among prophets , saints , and divines , Mohammed fills an entire column -LRB- ten and one-half inches -RRB- ,
Zoroas	PERSON	- ter six ,
Moses	PERSON	and Buddha about five each , Jesus three ,
St. Paul	LOCATION	,
St. Peter	LOCATION	,
Confucius	ORGANIZATION	,
Swedenborg	PERSON	,
Spurgeon	PERSON	, and
Beecher	PERSON	, respectively , about two ,
St. Benedict	LOCATION	and
Talmage	PERSON	an inch and a half each , St.
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	one inch ,
General Booth	ORGANIZATION	and Channing somewhat less .

		There is a notice of the Franciscans but none of the
Benedictines	LOCATION	.

		It was taken for granted that
Benedict	PERSON	and his great foundation , with its untold effect for good upon the human culture , were of no more interest than the performances of the
Reverend T. DeWitt Talmage	ORGANIZATION	.

		It can hardly be urged that this is because
Talmage	PERSON	is an American and a contemporary , for no especial favor is shown to either of these two classes .

		For example , no more space is given to the illustrious Channing than to a certain old English divine named
Laurence Chaderton	PERSON	, and the founder of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	bulks no bigger than the
Girondin Bishop Fauchet	ORGANIZATION	.

		One is at a loss how to account for the circumstance that in this dictionary Jesus and St.
Paul	PERSON	together sum up but half the sum of Mohammed !

		Have the editors gone upon the gen - erous assumption that '' the general reader '' would be sufficiently acquainted with the details of the lives and influence of the two founders of Christianity ?

		Why then should Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, who is a familiar figure , be accorded seven times as much space as
Pericles	LOCATION	, and nearly four times as much as either
Bismarck	PERSON	or Rich - elieu ?

		If there be any theory or principle for this prevail - ing want of proportion in the distribution of space , I have been unable to discover it .

		The examples here cited give but a faint notion of the editoral confusion of mind upon this vital point .

		I say confusion of mind ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 347 but I can not help wondering whether mind have any - thing to do with it , and whether this dictionary was not , like the Epicurean Universe , '' formed by a fortuitous concourse '' of articles .

		In literature and music , an obtuseness if possible even greater is frequently shown to the relative rank of in - dividuals .

		Shakespeare and
Schiller	PERSON	lead with a col - umn and a quarter -LRB- about thirteen inches each -RRB- ; to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is allotted about a column -LRB- thirteen inches -RRB- ; Swift has nine inches ;
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Ben Jonson	PERSON	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wagner	PERSON	, are given respectively about seven inches ; while
Ariosto	PERSON	,
Boccaccio	PERSON	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and Montaigne are respectively despatched in from two to three inches .

		The'ophile
Gautier	PERSON	, a secondary or tertiary figure , usurps the large space of five inches , principally filled with an enumeration of his writings , many of them of quite minor importance .

		He and his works might be of much greater importance than they are , without entit - ling a figure of such purely sesthetic interest to more notice than any one of the following , to select a few typical names at random from the literatures of differ - ent nations :
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Cervantes	PERSON	,
Calderon	PERSON	,
Alfieri	PERSON	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Corneille	LOCATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Sainte	LOCATION	-
Beuve	LOCATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	,
Herder	ORGANIZATION	,
Klopstock	LOCATION	,
Kant	PERSON	,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	,
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	, or any great name in Greek literature or philosophy save Homer .

		What critic will support the editor in conceiv - ing Gautier as more important , or even more interest - ing to '' the general reader , '' than the least of these great men ?

		Yet this is not an extreme example : at least , I can give many such .

		Thus ,
James Granger	PERSON	, an English book - collector , receives three and one - half inches space , as much as the editor feels able to spare to
Bacon	LOCATION	, and more than is accorded
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Renan	PERSON	, and a hundred others of first - rate interest ; Scribe gets also three and one-half , as much as either
Hawthorne	PERSON	or
Leopardi	LOCATION	;
James Shirley	PERSON	, a third-rate dramatist of the decadence , three and one-half , more than
Marlowe	PERSON	, or Massinger , or
John Ford	ORGANIZATION	, or
John Webster	PERSON	, or
Beaumont	LOCATION	.

		Fletcher , however , receives the enormous space of seven and one-half inches , as much as
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	or
Dante	ORGANIZATION	;
Robert Greene	PERSON	gets three inches , more than Pope or
Wordsworth	PERSON	; Gottsched and
Shadwell	PERSON	bulk bigger than
Heine	LOCATION	, or
Lamartine	LOCATION	, or
Schopenhauer	PERSON	;
William Broome	PERSON	gets more notice than
Emerson	PERSON	or
Robert Browning	PERSON	, and almost twice as much as Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, who , in the good company of St.
Francis	PERSON	and of
Dostoyevski	PERSON	-LRB- no saint , he ! -RRB-

		finds her - self prisoned in the nutshell of an inch .

		As I have already remarked , no especial favor is shown to contemporaries : thus ,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	and
John Morley	PERSON	get a little more than an inch each ,
A. J. Balfour	PERSON	and Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	about half an inch .

		No one of these men , famous , brilliant , influential , productive , and learned as they are , three of them men who are mould - ing the policy of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, all of them men who are moulding the thought of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	, no one of these is accorded even as much space as is given to that respectable and commonplace professor ,
Henry Morley	PERSON	.

		Space might at least have been found to men - tion
John Morley	PERSON	's great work on ''
Diderot	PERSON	and the Encyclopaedists . ''

		One of the most difficult questions for the editor of such a work to decide must be that of the relative prom - inence which should be given to criticism and comment .

		This problem also has been evaded in the present work .

		Some of the biographical articles are noteworthy for the precision with which they state the social , cultural , or historic significance of their subjects ; on the other hand , many of those I have examined are absolutely bald in their adherence to facts and dates .

		Compare , e. g. , the articles on Herbart and on
Lotze	PERSON	.

		In many cases rel - atively copious citations are made from such easily ac - cessible books as
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's '' History of French Lit - erature , '' Ticknor 's '' Spanish Literature , ''
Morley	PERSON	's '' English Writers . ''

		When such citations are not at hand , everything in the nature of criticism or interpre - tative comment is usually -LRB- not always -RRB- omitted .

		Touch - ing
Jeffrey	PERSON	, a brief and admirable sentence is quoted from
Bagehot	PERSON	, who manages to hit off
Jeffrey	PERSON	's signifi - cance ; touching Klopstock , on the other hand , there is not a word to give us a clue to the poet 's personal or literary character , to the quality and interest of his work , to his place and influence in German literature , we are not so much as told that he was '' a very Ger - man Milton . ''

		Of Lessing we are informed that '' in
1750	DATE	began a friendship with
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	which had an important influence over his development '' ; but as to the course of this development , and its significance for human culture , there is not a word .

		As a matter of fact , there was no friendship , scarcely an acquaintance - ship , with
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	; hence the inference as to its sup - posed '' influence over his development '' proves nuga - tory .

		On the same page with the
Lessing	PERSON	article , a long quotation -LRB- sixteen lines -RRB- from
Saintsbury	LOCATION	is given , de - fining the place of Mile , de
Lespinasse	PERSON	in French liter - ature .

		To this note alone more space is devoted than to the entire article upon Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, while the whole article ''
Lespinasse	PERSON	'' is longer than that devoted to an incomparably greater writer in the same genre , Mme. de Se ` vignd .

		Evidently , therefore , the prefer - ence given to Mile , de
Lespinasse	PERSON	over such command - ing figures in literature as
Ariosto	LOCATION	,
Boccaccio	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	,
Lamartine	PERSON	,
Leopardi	PERSON	-LRB- to pause in mid-alphabet -RRB- can not fairly be attributed to the intelligible principle involved in the watchword place aux dames !

		Examples of such incongruities in the matter of interpretation and comment might be in - definitely multiplied .

		On the whole , French literature seems to be more intelligently treated than German , or even English literature ; but in the former field the use of scissors and paste in the dissection and appropriation of
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's '' French literature '' has been so free as to seem to call for some prefatory acknowledgement at least , if not for apology .

		It would be interesting to know which member of the staff of '' eminent specialists '' was consulted in the selec - tion of the names of contemporary men of science who are entitled to notice in such a work .

		The selection is eccentric and the notices are out of proportion .

		One looks in vain for the names of noted naturalists who now stand for zoology , botany , and geology , in this country .

		The name of
Eliza Youmans	PERSON	is given , os - tensibly because she is an American botanist ; while those of
Lesquereaux	LOCATION	,
Englemann	LOCATION	,
Vasey	PERSON	,
Watson	PERSON	,
Goodale	PERSON	, and
Farlow	PERSON	are omitted .


James Orton	PERSON	, the writer of a text-book on zoology and author of an un - important book of travels , is mentioned , while
Verrill	PERSON	,
Pourtales	LOCATION	,
Sydney I. Smith	PERSON	,
W. H. Brooks	PERSON	, and
W. H. Edwards	PERSON	are overlooked .


F. B. Meek	PERSON	, the paleontolo - gist , is mentioned ;
Worthen	ORGANIZATION	, his collaborator , is not .


Hayden	PERSON	and
Powell	PERSON	, directors of two of the national sur - veys , are spoken of ;
Wheeler	PERSON	and
King	PERSON	, two other direc - tors , are not .


Wright	PERSON	, a popular writer on glacial geol - ogy , is mentioned ; while
Chamberlin	PERSON	,
Salisbury	LOCATION	, and 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	,
Uphana	LOCATION	, the workers and original writers on glacial geol - ogy , are omitted .


Winchell	PERSON	, known for his text-books and popular writings on geological topics , is mentioned ; but
Charles A. White	PERSON	, the author of one hundred and fifty-five original and valuable contributions to the sci - ence of geology , is omitted .

		Liais ,
Hartt	LOCATION	, and
Derby	ORGANIZATION	, Brazilian geologists , and
Shaler	PERSON	,
Marcou	PERSON	, and
E. S. Dana	PERSON	, American geologists , are mentioned ; and the following , who are , to say the least , quite as well known , are omitted :
Chamberlin	PERSON	,
Dutton	PERSON	,
Emmons	PERSON	,
Fontaine	PERSON	,
Gil	PERSON	- bert ,
Hyatt	LOCATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Iddings	PERSON	,
Lesley	LOCATION	,
Lesquereux	LOCATION	, Pum - pelly ,
H. S.	PERSON	and
G. H. Williams	PERSON	,
C. A. White	PERSON	, Whit - field , and
Walcott	PERSON	, in this country ;
Heim	PERSON	and de Loriol in
Switzerland	LOCATION	;
Beyrich	LOCATION	,
Benneke	LOCATION	,
Credner	PERSON	,
Hauche	PERSON	- corn ,
Neumayr	PERSON	,
Richthofen	PERSON	,
Rosenbusch	PERSON	, and
Zittel	PERSON	, of
Germany	LOCATION	; Suess of
Austria	LOCATION	;
Barrois	LOCATION	,
Gaudry	LOCATION	,
Lappar	PERSON	- ent , and
Michel LeVy	PERSON	of
France	LOCATION	; Capellini of
Italy	LOCATION	;
Karpinsky	PERSON	and Tschernytschew of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		In many cases the text is out of all proportion to the prominence -LRB- among scientific men at least -RRB- of the subjects .

		For example ,
E. S. Morse	PERSON	, whose claim to recognition seems to be based chiefly upon an elementary text-book on zoology -LRB- 190 pages -RRB- occupies sixteen lines ; while
James Hall	PERSON	, the author of more than a hundred original con - tributions to science , many of them large beautifully illustrated quarto volumes , is given nine lines .


A. S. Packard	PERSON	is given a dozen lines , while
Alexander Agassiz	PERSON	is despatched in five .

		Such selections and discrimina - tions must give those who seek information in this book an entirely erroneous impression regarding science and the men who are its life .

		The preface leads one to expect to find the South American list , especially the Brazilian part of it , quite satisfactory , but between current newspaper literature , chorographic literature , and the Aemanach de
Gotha	LOCATION	, there are some important omissions .

		Custodio Jose * de Mello certainly occupies all the space he is entitled to , but
Saldanha da Gama	LOCATION	, a more important figure in Bra - zilian politics ,
Saldanha Marinho	PERSON	, for years the head and front of republicanism in
Brazil	LOCATION	, and Joaquim Na - buco , the leader of the abolition movement , are not even mentioned .

		A few other noteworthy omissions from the Brazilian list taken at random are :
Barao de Cotigipe	ORGANIZATION	, a leading politician , senator , prime minister , and head of a financial reform that did much to save Brazilian credit ,
Couto de Magalhaes	PERSON	, the author of a number of important works on history , travels , and ethnology ;
Nicolau Joaquim Moreira	PERSON	, the leading agriculturist and agricultural writer of
Brazil	LOCATION	;
Mouchez	PERSON	, the author of about thirty of the most important books and charts that relate to the coast and hydrography of
Brazil	LOCATION	;
Felisberto Caldeira Brant	PERSON	, the holder of the third dia - mond contract , and one of the most striking figures in the early history of
Minas	ORGANIZATION	;
Silva Xavier	PERSON	, or ''
Tiraden	PERSON	- tes , '' the early martyr to republicanism -LRB- as if
John Brown	PERSON	of Ossawatamie had been left out -RRB- ;
Homem de Mello	PERSON	, the author of some fifty books and papers on travels and geography ;
Moreira de Azevedo	PERSON	, the author of more than thirty historical publications ;
Mello Moraes	PERSON	, the author of more than thirty important books and papers on history and medicine ; not to mention such writers as
Maria Graham	PERSON	and Luccock , whose books upon the periods they wrote about are classics of their kind .

		The names of South American places , so far as they have been examined , seem to be well chosen .

		We note the absence of Serro , or
Villa de Principe	LOCATION	, where dia - monds were first found in
America	LOCATION	, and for many years the chief city of the diamond district .

		Out of a score of the most prominent writers on the ceramic arts , we find only the names of Brongniart and Champfleury ; those of
Audsley	LOCATION	,
Bowes	LOCATION	,
Ebelmen	LOCATION	, Gar - nier ,
Jacquemart	PERSON	, Salve `` tat , are omitted .

		In fine , this is a publisher 's book , over-hastily concocted for subscription sale .

		It seems to me dis - tinctly inferior in quality of editorial supervision to '' The Century Dictionary , '' a work which I had the pleasure of reviewing , volume by volume , in these columns .

		Although '' The
Century Diction	ORGANIZATION	- ary '' is also defaced by many errors , doubtless due to the haste with which it was produced , it is dis - tinctly a scholarly work .

		u The Century Cyclo - pedia of Names '' is , as I have shown , in many re - spects unscholarly .

		Its chief fault is want of pro- portion and perspective .

		Nevertheless , it is a very useful book to have at hand .

		It contains under one alphabet an enormous amount of more or less exact information about gods , men , and horses , countries , towns , and houses , fictitious characters , books , and battles .

		It gives a date for everything , and I have found but a small proportion of the dates examined to be wrong .

		I expect to continue to use the work with profit , just as we use the predictions of the weather service without accepting them as infallible .

		It should be speedily revised by competent special - ists .

		If I could believe that these strictures might have some influence in inducing the publishers to take in hand such a revision , I should not account the time spent upon these tests as wasted .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The study of English lyric poetry .

		Our generation has seen a steady growth of interest in the study of the lyric , due in part doubtless to the rec - ognition of the fact that for some two hundred years past the lyric has been the only living form of poe - try .

		Palgrave 's '' Golden Treasury '' was the first adequate selection of English lyrics , and gave a new impetus to the study of the subject .

		Ward 's '' English Poets '' covered a wider field , but helped forward the same movement .

		Since then , our knowl - edge of the English lyric in the period of its great - est perfection has been widened through the re - searches and the publications of scholars like Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	and Dr.
Grosart	PERSON	.

		The results of these studies are seen in several popular publications of recent date .

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's '' Elizabethan Lyrics '' has already been noticed in these columns .

		Dr.
James Baldwin	PERSON	also has recently edited a volume of '' Choice English Lyrics '' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of a popular nature .

		Catholicity of taste is an excel - lent thing , but even the most catholic taste would hes - itate to admit into a volume of three hundred and fifty pages , and covering the entire field of the En - glish lyric , as many selections from such versifiers as
Macaulay	LOCATION	,
Moore	PERSON	, Hood ,
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	,
Kirke White	PERSON	, and
Owen Meredith	PERSON	, as Dr.
Baldwin	PERSON	has seen fit to
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 349 admit to his volume .

		The editor 's principle of clas - sification , moreover , is unprofitable in that it admits much which is not properly lyric at all -LRB- such as the ballad of `` King
John	PERSON	and the Abbot '' -RRB- , and that it secures the inclusion of many pieces because of the interest of their subject-matter ; whereas in the lyric proper , motive and form and style , and not subject-matter , are the all - important things .

		A selection of quite a different character , '' The Golden Pomp , a Procession of English Lyrics from
Surrey	LOCATION	to Shirley '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , has been made by Mr.
A. T. Quiller Couch	PERSON	.

		The lover of the Elizabethan lyric now begins to feel overwhelmed with an em - barrassment of riches , and will find it hard to make a choice between the various anthologies :
Bullen	PERSON	's ,
Schelling	PERSON	's ,
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's u Seventeenth Century Lyrics , '' and '' The Golden Pomp . ''

		To complete the roll , a volume of selections from '' The English Poets of the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	from
Donne	PERSON	to
Dryden	PERSON	, '' by Professor
Briggs	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, is in preparation for the '' Athenaeum Press Series , '' while Professor
Gummere	PERSON	is engaged in editing a selection of Middle English Lyrics .

		Of the three hundred and sixty-one pieces in Mr.
Quiller Couch	PERSON	's volume , it is interesting to note that seventy are also found in
Palgrave	LOCATION	, and some one hundred and twenty in
Schelling	LOCATION	; a fact significant not only of the richness of the field drawn upon , but also of the tendency among critics to agree upon a certain num - ber of the older lyrics as recognized classics of their kind .

		Schelling 's contains only two hundred and fifty-eight selections in all , so that nearly one-half of his number , it will be seen , are agreed upon by both editors .

		The plan of Mr.
Quiller Couch	PERSON	's vol - ume is somewhat more popular than that of Pro- fessor
Schelling	PERSON	's , while its range also is slightly longer , including as Elizabethans all authors born during the reign of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		Schelling gives no selections from
Herrick	PERSON	,
Herbert	PERSON	, and other lyrists contemporary with these accomplished singers .

		Mr.
Quiller Couch	PERSON	's arrangement is ingenious and satis - factory for the general reader , following a natural but elastic grouping by motives and topics , which begins with
spring	DATE	, youth , love , and pastoral peace , proceeds through flower-motives , evanescence , ab - sence , carpe diem , melancholy , lullabies , dirges , and all the other familiar and charming themes of our older lyrics , and ends with winter and farewell .

		A happy effect of subtle harmony results for the reader who follows the course of the volume from begin - ning to finish .

		Where in literature can the
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan lyric at its best be matched for perfume , grace , fervor , and artlessly artful melody ?

		In his volume on '' Rhythm and Har - mony in Poetry and Music '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , to which is added an essay on '' Music as a Representative Art , '' Professor Ray - mond continues the series of aesthetic studies , the succeeding volumes of which have been noted in THE DIAL .

		In the first essay in the present volume we have a continuation of `` The Genesis of Art Essays in ^ Esthetics .

		Form '' ; in the second , a companion to '' Poetry as a Representative Art . ''

		Like its predecessors , this volume is an interesting work ; careful and grate - fully systematic in its plan , although somewhat hard reading .

		Like them , it is the product of much thought and observation ; and it is thoroughly and well illustrated .

		For ourselves , we always fail to find in Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's theory that stimulat - ing and suggestive quality which is usually a note of those speculations that really open to us a valu - able truth , and we sometimes fail to find a certain closeness of argument which might be desired .

		In the space at hand we can give but the slightest illus - trations of these views , and we will confine ourselves to the essay on '' Music as a Representative Art . ''

		As to this question we are much inclined to inquire , What of it all ?

		Such generalities as music can rep - resent are hardly enough to enable us to think of it as we do of painting .

		It is representative , but as a rule , we can not tell what it represents , until we are informed .

		And there still remains so much in music that is not representative , that , even accept - ing Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's showing , it seems a little futile to lay much weight upon that which is .

		But everyone will not accept Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's show - ing .

		He is of the view , for instance , that variation of pitch is representative in music as in language .

		Now variation of pitch is representative in language , but in different languages it represents very differ - ent things .

		Professor
Raymond	PERSON	speaks entirely of pitch in
England	LOCATION	.

		But pitch in the South German dialects is a very different matter , and in the Scan - dinavian dialects it is different still ; and so in French and
Welsh	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , in almost every lan - guage the variation of pitch has some particular sig - nification .

		With which of these will music agree ?

		Professor
Raymond	PERSON	finds an analogy with English , which seems to show that foreign composers are very complaisant .

		But the analogy of language is not the sole basis of the theory .

		The author consid - ers many musical passages , and points out the sig - nificance of many musical effects .

		In some cases we think Professor
Raymond	PERSON	imaginative .

		In many cases the music really does have the meaning as - cribed to it , after the meaning has been suggested .

		Such examples , however , do not amount to proof .

		A single case in which a certain effect had not a certain significance would play havoc with a score in which it had .

		For such reasons as these one can rarely accept Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's books without reserve , although they are such as always to com - mand interest and attention .

		The small black peoples of the world .

		The second volume of Messrs. Ap - pletons ' '' Anthropological Series '' is a translation , by Prof.
Frederick Starr	PERSON	, the editor of the series , of M. de Quatre - fages ' work on '' The Pygmies . ''

		It is an interest - ing popular account of the small black peoples of the world , their history , migrations , affinities , and present distribution .

		The ancients were acquainted more or less fully with five small black populations , 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, two in
Asia	LOCATION	, a third toward the sources of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, a fourth a little to the east of the preceding , and a fifth far to the southwest .

		These peoples they called '' Pygmies . ''

		Some of these tribes , much diminished in numbers , are still found near the regions which they formerly occupied .

		All of these small black peoples M. de Quatrefages considers as '' fragments of two human races , well characterized as blacks , oc - cupying , the one in

Africa	LOCATION	, a con - siderable area , and both of them including not only tribes or distinct peoples , but even sub-races . ''

		These two races are called the Negritos , including the small black peoples of
Asia	LOCATION	, of
Malaysia	LOCATION	, and of Melan - esia ; and the
Negrillos	LOCATION	, including the small black tribes of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The
Eastern Pygmies	ORGANIZATION	, or Negritos , are divided into two geographical groups , the con - tinental and the insular .

		Traces of them are found in
Japan	LOCATION	,
Formosa	ORGANIZATION	, the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	,
Borneo	LOCATION	,
New Guinea	LOCATION	, and numerous other islands ; possibly also in
Australia	LOCATION	.

		On the mainland they inhabited parts of the Malay peninsula , of
Indo-China	LOCATION	, and of
India	LOCATION	.

		The Negrillos , or Pygmies of
Africa	LOCATION	, the second of the two races , are represented to-day by the Hottentots and Bushmen .

		It is hardly neces - sary to say that M. de Quatrefages ' book is a thor - ough and scientific ethnological study .

		It will prove interesting , not to the scientific student alone , but to every intelligent reader .

		Memoirs of
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have an aide-de-camp done good service in issuing in a of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		8 i n gl e compact volume , entitled `` An Aide-de-Camp of Napoleon , '' the personal and an - ecdotal portion of Count
Philippe de Segur	PERSON	's vol - uminous '' History , Memoirs , and
Miscellanea	PERSON	, '' pub - lished in
1873	DATE	.

		The memoir is one of the most charming and graphic as well as most instructive records of Napoleonic times the work of a brave and honorable gentleman of the old regime , who , breaking perforce with the traditions of his ances - tors , bowed to the new conditions and served
France	LOCATION	as loyally under
Bonaparte	PERSON	as he would have served her under a Capet .

		General of division , Peer of
France	LOCATION	, and Academician , Count de Se ` gur lived for the greater part of a century , making a brilliant fig - ure in war , politics , and letters , and serving through - out the Imperial wars mainly on the Emperor 's staff .

		The present volume forms a dramatic per - sonal record , and is replete with pen-sketches of
Napoleon	PERSON	and of the writer 's companions in arms .

		In the introduction the author pays an eloquent tribute to the memory of his father , the celebi-ated ambassador to the Court of
Catherine	PERSON	of
Russia	LOCATION	, and he recounts also the first years of his own im - poverished and proscribed childhood , in the midst of the whirlwind of the Revolution .

		Count de Se ` gur unhesitatingly fixes upon
Danton	PERSON	the respon - sibility of that grim political invention , the Reign of Terror .

		Danton himself , he avers , boldly as - sumed it ; and he quotes him as replying , '' with his too well-known cynicism , '' to his -LRB- M. Se ` gur 's -RRB- father , when challenged as to his share in the Sep - tember massacres : '' Sir , you forget to whom you are speaking ; you forget that we are the riffraff , that we have issued from the gutter ; that with your opinions we should soon fall back into it , and that we can only govern by the law of fear . ''

		The vol - ume is a presentable one outwardly , and Mr.
H. A. Patchett-Martin	PERSON	's translation is smooth and grace - ful .

		The frontispiece portrait of Napoleon indi - cates the trend of the narrative .

		A delightful edition of Spenser 's '' Faerie edition of the Queene , '' now issuing in monthly `` Faerie Queene . ''

		partg f rom the
London	LOCATION	press of Mr.
George Allen	PERSON	, and obtainable in this country from
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is one of the most beauti - ful examples of modern bookmaking imaginable , and the impecunious book-lover may well envy the for - tunate persons who become possessors of the thou - sand copies to which the work is limited .

		In stating this number , we do not take into account the twenty-seven additional copies on Japanese vellum , which only millionaires can hope to acquire .

		The work will be completed in nineteen parts , six of which , containing Books I. and II. , have already been received by us .

		The text is a result of care - ful collation of several early editions , made by the loving care of Mr.
Thomas J. Wise	PERSON	.

		Each part has illustrations in the shape of decorative canto - headings and tail-pieces , besides several full-page designs , all from the facile and sympathetic pencil of Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	.

		The pagination of the work is consecutive , although each Book is intended to form a distinct volume , and has a title-page of its own .

		The parts vary from eighty to one hundred and twelve pages each , and are exquisitely printed on unbleached handmade paper .

		Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	is no novice in collecting Irish Fairy and f o lkJ ore nor J s his volume of '' Tales Ghost tales .

Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- his first contribu - tion of Irish tales .

		This volume , however , differs from any of his earlier work in character .

		In it he presents the present belief in fairies and ghosts .

		Ten per cent of the population of
Southwest Mun	LOCATION	- ster , where these tales were gathered , are to-day firm believers in fairies and uneasy spirits , and a large proportion of the remainder have a more or less definite fear that such beings exist .

		The Irish fai - ries and ghosts appear to be kin ; and in his intro - duction to the book Mr.
Nutt	PERSON	just hints the question whether fairy belief has not sprung from ancestor worship .

		The '' good people '' of Munster belief are generally malicious , and do little good to com - mon people unless they have already received some important help from these .

		One interesting feature of the tales is the way in which events are narrated of people still alive , or but recently dead , and known to the hearers .

		Yet the stories in some cases must have been told the same in incident long , long ago .

		It will do anyone good to read here of '' fairy forts '' and '' fairy stroke , '' of fairy infants need -

		Apart from the amusement in the reading , one gets from this book a glimpse of a veritable ancient religion .

		We heartily wish the `` Letters of S '' : ^ L e , Cd ia Thaxte f -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- might fall into the hands or every Amer - ican woman .

		The dainty book , with its enforced graces and dignities of phrase and sentiment , is re - plete with the fine and gentle spirit of true woman - liness old-fashioned womanliness , which we firmly believe -LRB- with all deference to '' new and improved '' ideals -RRB- to be humanity 's moral crown and jewel , and the tap-root and original of the social virtues .

		A fine and true verse is that of the Koran : '' A son wins paradise at his mother 's knees . ''

		The letters range from
1856	DATE	-LRB- when the writer was in her twenty-first year -RRB- to
1894	DATE	, the year of her death ; and they form a true index to the character of the mistress of '' Appledore '' and the unique life she led in her island home .

		The letters are tastefully mounted , and there are five portraits of Mrs.
Thax	PERSON	- ter , together with an appreciative introductory sketch by the editors ,
A. F.	ORGANIZATION	and R. L .

		Mr.
Walter Cranston	PERSON	Lamed de - scribes his '' Churches and Castles of Mediaeval
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as a `` record of a traveller 's impressions . ''

		The book is more than this modest -LRB- and nowadays rather unpromising -RRB- expression implies .

		Mr.
Lamed	PERSON	has interwoven his descriptions with enough historical fact to enable general readers to see in the struct - ures noted something more than mere specimens of mediaeval architecture , as well as to appreciate the spirit of the French nation in assuming the enor - mous outlay required for restoring and preserving them .

		The vandalism of the Revolution has been generously atoned for by such works , for instance , as the restoration of
Carcassonne	LOCATION	at an expense thus far of about
$ 700,000	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Larned	PERSON	writes simply and concisely , and his book is , we should say , pre - cisely the one needed by the average visitor to the places described .

		The volume contains twenty-four full-page photographic plates .

		Mr.
P. H. Ditchfield	PERSON	's little treatise on '' Books Fatal to their Authors '' -LRB- Book-Lover 's Library :
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- concerns itself chiefly with the lives of literary mar - tyrs in the more literal sense authors , that is , who expiated their candor or their temerity by the cell , the rack , or the faggot , rather than the mere vic - tims of criticism or of public neglect .

		Mr.
Ditch	PERSON	- field 's list is a long one , and it is mainly a roll of honor , being studded with such names as
Huss	PERSON	,
Tyndale	LOCATION	,
Savonarola	LOCATION	,
Bruno	PERSON	,
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	,
Sidney	PERSON	,
Sarpi	LOCATION	,
Prynne	LOCATION	, etc. .

		A chapter is included on ''
Booksell	PERSON	- ers and Publishers , '' a class whose misfortunes might well form a special subject of inquiry .

		Alto - gether , the little volume contains a good deal of cu - rious and suggestive matter .

		Literary Martyrs .

		* .

		, , , marck in a thousand large pages .

		He has now given us the cream of that work in two hundred and fifty small pages , under the same title , `` Prince Bismarck '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In the new work the author has the advantage of treating his hero 's career as a completed whole , and of such new ma - terials and such corrections as ten years have brought .

		His many years of residence as a news - paper correspondent in the different countries of
Europe	LOCATION	have furnished an admirable preparation for his task , both in intimate knowledge of peoples and politics , and in skill in putting things effectively .

		The book furnishes a vivid picture of the greatest of modem statesmen , and a trustworthy narrative of his career , allowing somewhat for an author 's bias in his hero 's favor .

		We believe that his esti - mate of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's work will be ratified by the judgment of impartial history .

		No man living has enjoyed better A life-study opportunities for studying the polit - of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	.

Gladstone	PERSON	than has Mr.
Henry W. Lucy	PERSON	, whose par - liamentary diaries , extending from
1874	DATE	to
1892	DATE	, are well known to the public .

		We expect to find in his recent book , ''
Gladstone	PERSON	: A Study from Life '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , a sketch of that marvellous career as vivid as a practised literary skill , an intimate knowl - edge , and a sympathetic appreciation can make it ; and we are not disappointed .

		Though the narrow limits of a small volume preclude a detailed survey of the sixty-two years of incessant and beneficent activity , the author brings out more clearly the im - portant achievements and salient points of the states - man 's splendid career .

		His position as eye-witness of the scenes he describes enables him to give reality and vividness to his account by the interesting de - tails and touches he constantly adds .

		The quali - ties that go to make a good soldier , the attractions and hardships and disappointments of the soldier 's life , are well brought out in the story .

		The Complete Poetical Works of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, '' as now published by
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, form a single volume of 770 double-columned pages , printed in readable type on good but thin paper .

		The '' Complete Geography '' of Mr.
A. E. Frye	PERSON	-LRB- Ginn -RRB- impresses us as an exceedingly well-considered and carefully-planned text-book .

		Commercial relations are emphasized and illustrated by an admirable series of special maps .

		Indeed , the work is exceptionally rich in maps of all sorts , including a 24-page supplement of maps alone , which in itself would make a very satisfac - tory family atlas .

		Relief maps also abound , telling their complex story at a glance .

		The many illustrations are both well-chosen and well-engraved .

		Such a manual as this offers a marked contrast to the poverty-stricken '' geographies '' of twenty or thirty years ago . ''

		The Constitutional Antiquities of
Sparta	LOCATION	and

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a translation , by Messrs.
E. J. Brooks	PERSON	and
T. Nieklin	PERSON	, of the first volume of Dr.
Gus	PERSON	- tav Gilbert 's '' Handbuch der
Griechischen Staatsalter	PERSON	- thiimer . ''

		A few English references are supplied but no substantial departure from the original has been at - tempted .

		Dr.
J. E. Sandys	PERSON	contributes an introductory note to the translation , speaking in high terms of the usefulness and accuracy of the work , and of its popu - larity as a text-book .

		The volume is one of 463 pages , each of which is about half text and about half footnote .

		The compiler of '' What Shall I Play ? ''

		-LRB-
Gladstone Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has requested a large number of mu - sicians and teachers of the piano and organ to supply him with brief lists of pleasing and attractive compo - sitions , classified according to the difficulties they offer , and accompanied by whatever brief comment seems nec - essary .

		These lists , to the number of something like a hundred , are printed in the book of which the title has been quoted .

		In the list of contributors we find a few well-known names , such as those of Biilow , Mr.
Arthur Foote	PERSON	, Dr.
Robert Goldbeck	PERSON	, and Mr.
W. H. Sherwood	PERSON	.

		Most of the contributors have avoided the classical compositions likely to occur to anybody , and rather sought to give titles taken from the less familiar and more modern repertory .

		The book ought to prove very helpful to both professionals and amateurs .

		XiITERARY NOTES .

		The three parts of ''
Henry VI.	PERSON	, '' in as many volumes , are the latest additions to the charming '' Temple ''

Thomas Mun	PERSON	's treatise -LRB- published posthumously in
1664	DATE	-RRB- on ''
England	LOCATION	's Treasure by Forraign Trade . ''

		Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	is now on the way to this coun - try , having accepted the invitation of
Harvard Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity to address the Law School upon the occasion of its annual Commencement .


John Gait	PERSON	's '' Annals of the Parish '' and '' The Ayr - shire Legatees , '' with an introduction by
Canon Ainger	ORGANIZATION	, is the latest volume in the acceptable
Macmillan	PERSON	series of reprints of the popular fiction of a past generation .

		No. 56 of the Old South Leaflets '' is timely indeed , being a reprint of the Message in which President Mon - roe enunciated the Doctrine which has gone by his name ever since .

		The pamphlet ought to be brought to the attention of the brilliant young men who conduct our foreign policy through the medium of the news - papers which they serve as reporters .

		Our recent remarks upon the high plane of the work done at the
Plymouth School of Applied Ethics	ORGANIZATION	are am - ply borne out by the programme for the coming season -LRB-
July 7 August 9	DATE	-RRB- , which offers fare even more attrac - tive and substantial than has been supplied in previous years .

		Miss
Emily Faithfull	PERSON	, news of whose death came on the
third of this month	DATE	, had many American friends , made during three visits to the
United States	LOCATION	, and her loss will be keenly felt on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		She did much effective work in many good causes , and her several books represent but a small fraction of her life-long activity . ''

		The Bachelor of Arts '' is the title of the new col - lege monthly edited by Mr.
John Seymour Wood	PERSON	, with the collaboration of Messrs.
Walter Camp	PERSON	and
Edward S. Martin	PERSON	.

		The first number , dated
May 1	DATE	, has appeared , and is beautifully printed , although the narrow format is not exactly pleasing .

		The contents , if we except Mrs.
Todd	PERSON	's paper on the letters of
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	and Mr.
John Corbin	PERSON	's notes on college life at
Oxford	LOCATION	, .

		im - press us as rather sophomorical , and hardly what were to be expected in a magazine started under such prom - ising auspices .

		Southern
California	LOCATION	's young and agreeable literary periodical , '' The Land of Sunshine '' -LRB- published at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	-RRB- , celebrates the beginning of its second year by assuming a more distinctively magazine form and donning a new and striking cover , in its issue for
June	DATE	.

		The illustrations of the number are unexpectedly good , and the reading matter is varied and attractive .

		The '' local color '' of course predominates , both in text and pictures ; and this , we fancy , will be to most readers the chief charm of the bright little perodical , for the '' local color '' of
Southern California	LOCATION	is something that its lovers can hardly have too much of .

		The
London	LOCATION	correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Critic '' recently attended a dinner of the
Omar Khayyam Club	PERSON	, and gives some interesting particulars concerning the customs of that organization : '' The followers of Omar are expected to present themselves at the board , wear - ing the red rose of their poet : the guests assume a white rose in distinction .

		Such members as neglect the badge are summoned for an explanation by the Presi - dent early in the proceedings , and have each in turn to make such excuses as they may have at their disposal .

		Unless the President 's special leave is secured , it is ex - pected that members will drink red wine .

		The first toast upon the list is the immortal memory of Omar , which is drunk in silence , all standing . ''

		Some years ago , a paragraph went the rounds of the newspapers to the effect that
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, in the opin - ion of Humboldt , '' had traveled farther and seen less than any man he ever knew . ''

		Mr.
C. V. Nye	PERSON	, writing to '' The Book Buyer , '' thus tells the story of the origin of that fabrication : '' A certain litterateur -LRB- no longer living in any sense -RRB- wrote to Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	, asking him to give him a set of his works .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	knew no reason why he should do so , and simply referred the request to his publisher , who declined to send the books .

		Thereupon the man , through sheer malice , invented the remark which he put into Humboldt 's mouth , embodied it in the paragraph , and inserted it in a column which he was making up for a popular weekly . ''
