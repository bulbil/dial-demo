		29 THE LITERARY YEAR IN RETROSPECT .

		Literature has suffered some severe losses | during the year just ended , although the record is less disastrous than that for
1892	DATE	.

		The most serious loss came early in the year with the death of
Taine	LOCATION	.

		Occurring , as it did , only a few months after the death of Renan , the sympathies of the world were naturally directed towards the country that had , within so brief a space , been bereft of its two greatest men .

		The death , in midsummer , of
Maupassant	LOCATION	, again made
France	LOCATION	the poorer , although that brilliant writer was held in more of admiration than of affection , and although the circumstances un - der which a continuance of existence seemed possible for him were of such a nature as to make the tidings of his decease a relief rather than a sorrow .

		Turning from
France	LOCATION	to En - gland , we are met by the names of
Symonds	LOCATION	,
Jowett	PERSON	, and
Tyndall	PERSON	, each a master in his chosen field of scholarship , and each sincerely mourned by the host of those whom he had in - spired and helped .

		To the letters of our own country the death of
Parkman	PERSON	has been the loss that overshadows all others , although the names of
Brooks	PERSON	and Booth and
Lucy Larcom	PERSON	must not go unmentioned .

		We should also signalize the loss suffered by the art of music in the deaths of Gounod and Tschaikowsky , indisputably the greatest , respectively , among French and Russian composers of the present day .

		We now turn to the very difficult task of selecting , from the thousands of volumes pub - lished during
1893	DATE	, the few tljat seem of the most importance and enduring value .

		From this enumeration we shall doubtless omit many works that some of our readers would think deserving of mention ; but we can at least give the assurance that our list includes only publi - cations of substantial importance in their re - spective departments .

		Beginning with poetry , we find little that deserves mention .

		Our chronicle for
1892	DATE	in - cluded the names of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	, Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, and Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	; our list for
1893	DATE	includes no names more important THE DIAJL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, than those of Mr.
R. W. Gilder	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	, Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	, Mr.
Norman Gale	PERSON	, Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	, Professor
C. G. D. Roberts	PERSON	,
Miss Thomas	LOCATION	,
Miss Guiney	PERSON	, and
Madame Darmesteter	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each of these writers has published a creditable volume ; but all are minor poets , and the contrast between
1893	DATE	and
1892	DATE	is marked .

		The novelists have been as busy as ever during the past year , but nothing very startling is to be found among their productions .

		Among our own writers of fiction , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has published '' The World of Chance '' and `` The Coast of
Bohemia	LOCATION	'' a poor novel and a good one .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has also given us two stories , one of which , `` Pietro Ghisleri , '' is among the better of his books .

		Mr.
Henry Fuller	PERSON	's '' The Cliff Dwell - ers , '' Mr.
Frederic	PERSON	's '' The Copperhead , '' Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	's `` The White Islander , '' and Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's volume of stories , ''
Sally Dows	PERSON	, '' are among the more notable books of fiction .

		Among English novels , '' The Heavenly Twins '' and `` Dodo '' perhaps head the list in point of popularity ; while Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's ''
David Balfour	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Doyle	PERSON	's `` The Refugees , '' Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's '' A Gentleman of
France	LOCATION	, '' and Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's `` Many Inventions '' are close followers , and ef more real importance .

		The translator of fiction has given us M. Bourget 's ''
Cosmopolis	LOCATION	, '' and two works by
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	`` Without Dogma '' and '' Pan Michael '' - so different in manner that we find it difficult to attribute them to the same pen , but both highly noteworthy .

		The department of biography and letters -LRB- in the literal sense -RRB- is the richest in the chron - icles of the year .

		What may , indeed , be called the two books of the year come within this cat - egory .

		The appearance of the letters of
Scott	PERSON	and of
Lowell	LOCATION	are events of capital importance .

		The letters of
Asay Gray	ORGANIZATION	are of more limited interest , but their publication is also an event .

		Among biographies we find the important lives of Mr.
Ruskin ^ Wagner	PERSON	,
Pusey	PERSON	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and
Alcott	PERSON	, the completion of the Sumner upon which Mr.
Pierce	PERSON	has been for so many years engaged , and Mr.
Bridge	PERSON	's recollections of Haw - thorne .

		In autobiography , we have Mr.
Le	PERSON	- land 's extremely entertaining memoirs ; '' The Story of My Life , '' by Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	; '' Further Recollections of a Happy Life , '' by Miss North ; and the first volume of the Pasquier memoirs .

		In literary history and criticism the foremost books relate to Greek literature , be - ing Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's '' Plato and Platonism , '' Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's '' Homer and the Epic , '' and Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's '' The Growth and Influence of Clas - sical Greek Poetry . ''

		The new edition of Sy - monds 's '' Greek Poets '' must also be men - tioned here .

		In English literary history , the most important of the books published is the sketch of '' Early English Literature , '' by the Rev.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	.

		History , political science and economics dis - play great activity at the present time in all the more civilized countries , and have received many important contributions during the year .

		Among * these we may mention Captain Ma - han 's '' Influence of
Sea Power	ORGANIZATION	upon the French Revolution and Empire , '' a work that has met with extraordinary favor in this coun - try and abroad ; '' Fifty Years of Australian History , '' by Sir
Henry Parkes	PERSON	; '' The Cam - paign of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
John C. Ropes	PERSON	; '' The Dawn of Italian Independence , '' by Mr.
W. R. Thayer	PERSON	: `` The Empire of the Tsars and the Russians , '' by M. Leroy-Beaulieu ; '' The
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	; '' Comparative Administrative Law , '' by Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	; '' The Church in the Roman Empire , '' by Mr.
W. M. Ramsay	PERSON	; the new volume of '' English Economic History and Theory , '' by Professor
Ashley	PERSON	; the new edition of Professor
Bryce	PERSON	's '' American Com - monwealth '' ; and many other works that we have not space to mention .

		A few other publications of exceptional im - portance , not comprised within the above cat - egories , are the following : '' Drawing and En - graving , '' by Mr.
P. G. Hamerton	PERSON	; '' The Art of Music , '' by Dr.
Parry	PERSON	; ''
Pablo de Segovia	PERSON	, '' with the Vierge illustrations ; '' The Mummy , '' by Dr.
E. A. W. Budge	PERSON	; the completion of Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's '' Principles of Ethics '' ; a vol - ume of philosophical essays , by Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	; Mr.
H. F. Brown	PERSON	's ''
Venice	LOCATION	'' ; '' The Ruined Cities of
Mashonaland	LOCATION	, '' by Mr. The - odore Bent ; a treatise on evolutionary ethics , by
Miss C. M. Williams	PERSON	; Professor
Weiss	PERSON	- man 's work on '' The Germ-Plasm '' ; Dr.
Nan	PERSON	- sen 's '' Eskimo Life '' ;
M. E. Michel	PERSON	's '' Rem - brandt '' ; `` Socialism and the
American Spirit	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
N. P. Gilman	PERSON	; and a posthumous vol - ume of essays by
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	.

		A few important new editions are the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	of Dr.
Coues	PERSON	, the
Coleridge	PERSON	of Mr.
J. D. Campbell	PERSON	, and the Fielding of Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	.

		The publications of the year , taken as a whole , seem to have an importance beyond the average of most years , in spite of the weakness of a few departments .

		It is also noticeable
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL that the commercial depression of the past six months has had no appreciable effect upon the business of publishing , if we may judge from the quality and the .

		variety of the autumn out - put .

		THE TAX ON KNOWLEDGE .

		We have received a number of communications from persons interested in the removal of the ob - noxious duty upon English books which has so long disgraced our tariff legislation , and , for some mys - terious reason , has been embodied in the
Wilson Bill	PERSON	, greatly to its disfigurement .

		We believe that the friends of education have it in their power to bring to bear upon the members of our
National Legislature	ORGANIZATION	a degree of pressure sufficient to result in the removal of a duty which protects nobody , which brings little revenue to the government , and which is chiefly fruitful in petty annoyances to the scholar .

		But whatever is done must be done with - out delay .

		The
Wilson Bill	PERSON	will come up for dis - cussion at once , and is likely to be rushed through the
House	ORGANIZATION	in three or four weeks .

		As a help to concerted action we suggest the form of petition given below , to be sent , with as many signatures as possible , through as many Members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as possible , at as early a date as possible .

		A PETITION FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE DUTY ON BOOKS PRINTED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE .

		To the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and
House	ORGANIZATION	of Representatives of the
United States of America	LOCATION	, in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	assembled : We , the undersigned , believing that an import duty on books printed in tbe English language , as provided both by the existing and the proposed Tariff Laws , is wrong in principle , being a tax upon knowledge and a hindrance to the growth of intelligence among the people , while it is at the same time insignificant as a source of revenue ; and believing that the continuance of such a duty is unworthy of a free and enlightened people , Do respectfully petition your honorable body to place all books and other publications printed in the English language upon the list of those articles which may be imported into the
United States	LOCATION	without the payment of duty .

		And your petitioners will ever pray .

		We have prepared this petition in a form ready for receiving signatures , and will mail copies of it free of charge to all persons who may apply for them .

		A STUDY IN LITERARY AMENITY .

		The
December	DATE	issue of '' The Nineteenth Cen - tury '' contains a reminiscent article by Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne upon the late Master of Balliol .

		The author knew
Jowett	PERSON	intimately , and his personal recollec - tions are of the highest interest .

		But the article is disfigured by a number of those '' flings '' which Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	so frequently interjects into his prose papers , and which are usually characterized by both irrelevancy and bad taste .

		Some readers will re - member his characterization of
Emerson	LOCATION	, a few years ago , as `` a foul-mouthed Yankee philosoph - aster , '' as well as some other things equally deplor - able .

		In this particular case ,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Mark Patti	PERSON	- son , and
J. A. Symonds	PERSON	are the objects of his vitu - perative assault .

		Hence , and in spite of our ad - miration for the genius of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	when he is his better self , we have witnessed with no little satis - faction the castigation dealt him by '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' upon the present occasion .

		It is no less de - served than severe , and we have much pleasure in reproducing the article , which bears ''
Nineteenth Century Manners	ORGANIZATION	'' for a title . ''

		It is high time that the Editor of the '
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	' should be made to understand that there is a limit to the offences against good manners in which the writers in his magazine can be permitted to indulge .

		During the past twelvemonth certain things have been included in the '
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	' which are dis - tasteful , and even painful , to many readers .

		In the
November	DATE	number we thought that the climax had come .

		We did not suppose that anything could exceed the nauseating tittle-tattle about Miss Clairmont in - dulged in by an American interviewer .

		We were mis - taken ; an article in the
December	DATE	number , in which Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	disports himself among his deceased contemporaries , under the pretence of writing ' recol - lections of Professor
Jowett	PERSON	, ' goes further still .

		We say , and with all gravity , that in the very least respon - sible journalism of this generation we have never met with anything quite so ill-bred as one or two paragraphs in Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's article .

		They do small credit to the Editor of the review . '

		But that 's not much . '

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	is a very different person , and we propose to ourselves , at last , to speak the truth very plainly to that illustrious poet .

		When he writes so casually of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's ' hideous and Boeotian jests , ' when he de - scribes the amiability of a respected and valued man of letters as ' instinctive time-serving and obsequious sub - missiveness , ' when he talks of Euripides as < the clum - siest of botchers that ever floundered through his work as a dramatist , ' he discredits himself by his foolish vio - lence indeed ; but when he goes on to call the late Rector of Lincoln ' a typical and unmistakable ape of the Dead Sea , ' and when he insults the memory of the late Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	with a string of vile epithets , he simply writes as no gentleman should write .

		It is time that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	should grow up .

		He has played for nearly half a century the role of the dear little naughty darling who must not be punished because he is so clever and so young .

		Years and years ago , when Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	first began to write , this plea was brought forward and accepted .

		< Is n't he clever ? '

		peo - ple said ; ' and so young . '

		There was something in the excuse .

		He was daring and brilliant , and much was to be forgiven him .

		He said very rude things about Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	and Mr.
Furnivall	PERSON	, and looked at some mi - nute contemporaries under the microscope .

		Nobody cared : they were fair game ; and so the habit of being rude grew on Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		It was an evil day when he was allowed a naughty little boy of thirty odd summers to call Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	a hoary and now tooth - less ape . '

		-LRB- To differ from Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	turns any one by that mere act into an ape . -RRB-

		He should have been well snubbed on that occasion , but then he was so THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, young , and so clever .

		And he has gone on from bad to worse , increasing the shrill falsetto of his abuse , pour - ing it upon more and more distinguished reputations , until now we are waking up to perceive that Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne has not yet got over faults in manner which only extreme youth can excuse . ''

		What makes it peculiarly painful to us to have to say this is that we admire the genius of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, and that we are not often out of sympathy with the aversions that he expresses .

		But who can admire the violence of his diction , the absence of anything like mod - eration in his utterances ?

		We hold no brief here for Mr.
Mark Pattison	PERSON	, who , perhaps , had shortcomings ; but if anything would make us his fervent apologists , it would be Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	yelling and snarling at him as an ` ape of the Dead Sea . '

		We were no admirers of the too morbid tendency of certain of the writings of Mr.
Symouds	PERSON	, but we said so while he was alive , and we did not wait , as Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has done , until he is dead , and it is quite safe to insult him .

		But Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne is such a preux chevalier . ''

		One last word to Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		No man of let - ters of our generation has been treated so tenderly , indulged so much , or forgiven so often as he has been .

		His genius is unquestionable , and on the score of it he has been pardoned faults for which any other writer would be ostracised .

		But the public patience may be - come exhausted .

		And literature has a long memory . ''

		The '' long memory '' here ascribed to literature may possibly be sharpened , for the writer in '' The Sat - urday Review , '' by recollection of a little passage at arms between that journal and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	just ten years ago .

		When the
Poet Laureate of England	ORGANIZATION	was made a peer , some
Saturday	DATE	reviewer , to a certain extent justifiably exasperated by the senseless cackle of those who made haste to express the opinion that the acceptance of the honor was unworthy of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, penned the following mem - orable words : '' As a matter of fact , no man liv - ing , or who ever lived not
Caesar	PERSON	or Pericles , not
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	or
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, could confer honor more than he took on entering the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	promptly took up the gauntlet thus thrown , and , characterizing the remark as `` clumsy and shallow snobbery , '' dashed off '' The Conserv - ative Journalist 's Anthem , '' a sonnet neither com - plimentary to the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	nor to its over - zealous journalistic champion .

		The '' long memory '' of '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' is clearly illustrated by the article we have reprinted .

		As for the son - net , our readers may be interested in having their attention recalled to it . ''

		Lords our Gods , beneficent , sublime , In the
evening	TIME	, and before the morning flames , We praise , we bless , we magnify your names .

		The slave is he that serves not ; his the crime And shame , who hails not as the crown of
Time That House	ORGANIZATION	wherein the all-envious world acclaims Such glory that the reflex of it shames All crowns bestowed of men for prose or rhyme .

		The serf , the cur , the sycophant is he Who feels no cringing motion twitch his knee When from a height too high for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	nods The wearer of a higher than
Milton	PERSON	's crown .

		Stoop ,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, stoop :
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	, bow down : These have no parts with you , Lords our Gods . ''

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		TYNDALL AND SPONTANEOUS GENERATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your article on
John Tyndall	PERSON	, in the current num - ber of THE DIAL , you leave the impression upon the mind of the reader that this great and wise teacher held and taught the doctrine of the spontaneous gener - ation of life .

		I would be glad to have you indicate from Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	's works the basis on which such a representation of his position upon this important mat - ter rests .

		When and where did he announce any change of opinion from that given in '' The
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' page 507 ,
1878	DATE	, where he says that , while he wishes the evidence were the other way , he is constrained to '' affirm that no shred of trustworthy experimental testimony exists to prove that life in our day has ever appeared independent of antecedent life '' ?

		My mind is entirely hospitable to all the new science , truly so-called ; and this is largely because I find no necessary conflict between it and a rationally scriptural theistic conception of the world .

		If
Harvey	PERSON	's maxim , '' Omne vivum ex ovo '' as amended by
Charles Robin	PERSON	, '' Omne vivum ex vivo '' is a discredited doctrine , such a position is of difficult if not impossible entertain - ment .

		But my reading has led me to believe that , as Professor Huxley declares in his '' Critiques and Ad - dresses , '' this doctrine remains '' victorious along the whole line at the present day . ''

		After building up any system of religious and scientific truth into comfortable harmony , based upon the conclusions I have judged to be reached by such teachers as
Tyndall	LOCATION	,
Huxley	LOCATION	, Wal - lace , Le
Conte	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
William Thomson	PERSON	,
Laycock	PERSON	,
Tait	PERSON	, and a host of others , it comes to me as something of a shock to have THE DIAL suggest so radical a change of opin - ion on the part of a leading authority as that above re - ferred to .

		No doubt there are many others who would like the information for which I ask .

		DWIGHT P. BREED .

		Wyandotte ,
Mick.	LOCATION	,
Dec. 23 , 1893	DATE	.

		-LSB- That spontaneous generation has occurred , some - how , somewhere , in the history of the world , is a conclusion irresistibly forced upon the thorough - going evolutionist .

		If
Tyndall	PERSON	's frequently quoted words about '' the promise and the potency '' mean anything at all , they mean that .

		But spontaneous generation as a necessary link in the evolutionary chain is one thing , and spontaneous generation as an experimental demonstration is quite another .

		Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	's polemic on the subject was di - rected mainly against the alleged results of one man 's experiments , and proved merely that spon - taneous generation could not have occurred in Dr.
Bastian	PERSON	's laboratory under the conditions specified .

		If our correspondent will turn to page 269 in the volume of '' The Nineteenth Century '' already re - ferred to , he will find a fair statement of the way in which spontaneous generation , as a logical postulate , is regarded by the leading biologists of the century .

		One can only escape their conclusion by recourse to some such hypothesis as that of
Lord Kelvin	PERSON	, who suggested that a meteoric body might have brought the first protoplasm to this planet .

		But this is an obvious evasion of the difficulty , and few ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL if any , will take seriously so improbable and inad - equate an explanation .

		We must say in conclusion , that a religious faith whose '' comfortable harmony '' is capable of being upset by any possible result of biological investigation seems to us in a bad way .

		THE TARIFF ON BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Attracted by your timely comment on the tariff on books in the proposed revision of the tariff law , I have begun circulating the following petition here : '' To -LSB- name of Representative in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- .

		We , the undersigned , believing that a tax on knowledge is con - sistent with neither the idea of a protective tariff nor with that of true liberty , earnestly urge you to exert your influence toward abolishing the duty on imported books and other publications not covered by copyright . ''

		I have also written letters to a dozen friends in other colleges , urging them to begin a similar movement in their Congressional districts .

		By prompt and concerted action among the friends of free knowledge , the con - tinuance of this deplorable tax may be averted .

		The intelligence of their death reached me in

		A CLASSICAL `` SOLECISM . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In parting , as employed in '' the parting guest , '' there is a survival of a sense that formerly was one of the commonest meanings of part when used intransitively ,
viz.	LOCATION	, depart , set out , go away .

		This archaic sense of part is seen in the lines below : '' Before man parted for this earthly strand , While yet upon the verge of heaven he stood . ''

		-LRB-
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, Poems , `` Revolutions . '' -RRB-

		The employment of part in this way was extremely fre - quent in the seventeenth and the latter part of the six - teenth century . ''

		... she told him the truth , with all circumstances ; how being parted alone -LSB- how having set out alone -RSB- , meaning to die in some solitary place ... '' -LRB- Sir

		Part from , or merely part , was used with hence and similar adverbs . ''

		-LRB-
Milton	LOCATION	, ``
Sampson Agonistes	PERSON	, '' 1 .

		1481 . -RRB-

		I have said that depart is an archaic meaning of part .

		Yet there is considerable evidence that this sense , in certain connections , at least , is in common use .

		For instance , in
Webster	PERSON	's
International Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, the sec - ond definition of part v. i. is '' to go away , to depart , to take leave , '' etc. ; and one of the illustrative quotations cited is this : `` He owned he had parted from the duke only a few hours before . ''

		-LRB-
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Similar defi - nitions , without characterization or comment , are found in other dictionaries .

		But , if this sense of part is not really archaic , how does it happen that the historic dif - ference between part from and part with is so often over - looked by scholarly people when they are moved to cau - tion the unlearned against a supposed misuse of part with f Here is an example : '' So , though we still say ' I parted with a house , ' or ' with a servant ' -LRB- considered as a chattel , -LSB- ! -RSB-

Ireland	LOCATION	.

		In saying '' when you parted with the King , '' Shake - speare observed a distinction that was usually observed at that time between part from and part with , but which at the present day is generally disregarded .

		If the older meaning of part from had not sunk into the ob - 8 THE DIAL -LSB-

		To part with once had three meanings : -LRB- 1 -RRB- To depart with . ''

		-LRB- '' The Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	, '' Act III. , sc .

		i. -RRB- We have to do here with the third meaning of part with , and to observe that it differed from the common meaning of part from .

		The widest divergence in the employment of the two phrases would be seen where somebody parted with a friend making or about to make a journey , and where an offended or unfriendly person parted from another unceremoniously . ''

		Nay , with your favour let him stay a little ; I would part with him too , because he is Your companion ; and I '11 begin with him . ''

		He parted frowning from me , as if ruin Leap 'd from his eyes . ''

Henry VIII.	PERSON	, '' Act III. , sc .

		ii . -RRB-

		In the former of these two quotations evidently the prominent idea belonging to part with is the observance of the friendly courtesies that usually are exchanged when friends or acquaintances separate .

		But it is likely that when there was no occasion for accentuating the dif - ferences in sense between part with and part from that the two phrases were sometimes used interchangeably .

		It is not clear , for instance , that either would be distinctly more appropriate than the other in the next quotation . ''

		Before I part with this

Venice	LOCATION	, '' ed .

		1651 , p. 44 . -RRB-

		Here the courteous dismissal or surrender of the ''
May	DATE	- den City '' may be the idea uppermost in the mind of the writer .

		Whether the distinction between part from and part with , pointed out above , has lasted to the present day , I am uncertain ; for , notwithstanding that the distinc - tion is disregarded by the many , it may , perhaps , be observed by the few .

		But , anyhow , a misconception of the real difference between the two phrases has grown up , so that people who are ambitious to speak and write the best schoolmaster 's English substitute part from for part with in cases where , if the two phrases do not mean the same thing , part with is , in fact , more appropriate .

		It is to be regretted that this pedagogic affectation is countenanced by Dr.
Fitzedward Hall	PERSON	's high authority .

		In `` Recent Exemplifications of False Philology '' -LRB- pp. 103-6 -RRB- , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, citing examples of '' solecisms '' found in the writings of

Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, italicises with in the following passage quoted -LRB- p. 106 -RRB- from The Autocrat of the Breakfast-table '' : `` I remember a young wife who had to part with her husband for a time . ''

		In the index , we are told that , at page 106 , part wilh is for part from .

		But part with , as there employed by Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, has been classical English for three centuries .

		To the ex - amples previously given I will add the following : '' ... To avoid seeing people that I love well enough to be very much mortified when I think I am going to part with them for ever . ''

		* In turning over the leaves of Mr.
Leland	PERSON	's vivacious , if rather chaotic , Memoirs , one is im - pelled to exclaim with Mr.
Wackford Squeers	PERSON	, '' Here 's richness ! ''

		Mr.
Leland	PERSON	really seems to have been a little of everything , seen a little of everything , done a little of everything , and read a little of everything ; yet in spite of his multifarious experiences he sees fit to make the following modest disclaimer in his preface : '' As some of my readers will find these volumes wanting in personal adventure and lively variety of ex - periences , and perhaps dull as regards ' incidents , ' I would remind them that it is , after all , only the life of a mere literary man and quiet , humble scholar , and that such existences are seldom very dramatic . ''

		Were the writer any other than Mr.
Leland	PERSON	whom all men know as the pink of modesty and candor , one might reply , quoting Soc - rates , '' I see your vanity ,
Antisthenes	LOCATION	, peep - ing through the holes in your cloak . ''

		What may be Mr.
Leland	PERSON	's notion of a really active and stirring life , we know not ; but his readers will scarcely accept as a literary recluse and * ' quiet , humble scholar '' one who has been by turns a roistering BurscJi at
Heidelberg	LOCATION	and
Munich	LOCATION	, a chimes-at-midnight reveller of the
Latin Quarter	LOCATION	, a barricade hero in a
Paris	LOCATION	revolution , a bon ami of
Lola Montez	PERSON	and a pupil of
A. Bronson Alcott	PERSON	, a managing editor under
P. T. Barnum	PERSON	and
John W. Forney	PERSON	, a man , in short , whose career seems to have been -LRB- at least so far as it is treated in the pres - ent volume -RRB- about as serene and scholastic as the finale of a certain famous '' barty . ''

		Mr.
Leland	PERSON	's life has had , of course , its sporadic intervals of comparative quiet ; but we note the above phases lest the prospective reader of the Memoirs be turned from his purpose by the author 's hint of the very last quality to be predi - cated of it dryness .

		Mr.
Leland	PERSON	says that his book was written , not directly for publication , but with the idea that '' a certain friend '' might use it at the proper time as a source whence to form a life .

		`` Therefore , '' he adds , `` I wrote , as fully and honestly as I could , everything which I could remember which had made me what I am . ''

Europe	LOCATION	down to the year
1870	DATE	.

		It will be seen even from this meagre synopsis that the author 's idea of the career of a '' quiet , humble scholar '' differs somewhat from the conventional one .

		Without attempting to fol - low Mr.
Leland	PERSON	's sprightly recital in detail or in the order of narration , we shall select there - from a few random extracts that may serve in a general way to indicate its quality .

		After a laborious course of jurisprudence , tobacco , met - aphysics ,
Rheinwein	LOCATION	, Natur-philosophie , lager , `` und leider auch Theologie , '' at
Heidelberg	LOCATION	and
Munich	LOCATION	, our quiet scholar reached
Paris	LOCATION	-LRB- 1847 -RRB- , and here his exploits , as a student of the
Latin Quarter	LOCATION	, seem to have been largely of the sort boasted of by
Robert Shallow	ORGANIZATION	,
Esquire	ORGANIZATION	.

		To cite a very mild instance : '' It happened one night at
Bobinot	ORGANIZATION	's that I sat in the front row of the stage-box , and by me a very pretty , modest , and respectable young girl , with her elder re - lations or friends .

		How it happened I do not know , but they all went out , leaving the young lady by me , and I did not speak to her .

		Which ' point ' was at once seized by the house .

		The pit , as if moved by one dia - bolical inspiration , began to roar , ` II Vem brassera ! '

		-LRB- He will kiss her -RRB- , to which the gallery replied , ` II ne I 'em brassera pas I ' -LRB- He wo n't -RRB- .

		So they kept it up and down alternately like see-sawing , to an intonation ... I saw that something must be done ; so , rising , I waved my glove , and there was dead silence .

		Then I began at the top of my voice , in impassioned style , in German , an address about matters and things in general , inter - mingled with insane quotations from
Latin	LOCATION	,
Slavonian	LOCATION	, anything .

		A change came o'er the spirit of the dream of my auditors , till at last they ` took , ' and gave me three cheers .

		I had sold the house . ''

		Soon after reaching
Paris	LOCATION	Mr.
Leland	PERSON	took lodgings in a house in the Rue de la Harpe called the Hotel de
Luxembourg	LOCATION	, a nest , as it proved , of rather doubtful and desperate char - acters .

		In the same establishment dwelt a small actress or two , and divers students , or men who were extremely busy all winter in plotting the revolution which presently broke out : 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, '' At last the ball opened ... The great storm - bell of
Notre Dame	LOCATION	rang all night long .

		The next morn - ing I rose , and telling
Leonard Field	PERSON	, who lived in the same hotel with me , that I was going to work in
earnest	LOCATION	, loaded a pair of duelling-pistols , tied a sash round my waist , en revolutionnaire , and with him went forth to business .

		First I went to the
Cafe * Rotonde	ORGANIZATION	, hard by , and got my breakfast .

		Then I sallied forth , and found in the Rue de la Harpe a gang of fifty insurgents , who had arms and a crowbar , but who wanted a leader .

		Seeing that I was one of them , one said to me , ' Sir , where shall we make a barricade ? '

		I replied that there was one already to the right and another farther down , but that a third close at hand was open .

		Without a word they handed me the crowbar , and I prized up the stones out of the pavement while they undertook the harder work of piling them up .

		In a few minutes we had a solid wall eight feet ffigh .

		Then remembering that there was a defenceless spot somewhere else , 1 marched my troop thither , and built another barricade all in grim earnest without talking ... There was a garc.on named
Edouard	ORGANIZATION	, who always waited on me in the Cafe '' Rotonde .

		While I was working for life afrmy second barricade , he came out holding a napkin , and ex - amining my labor critically , waved it , exclaimed approv - ingly , ' Tres Men ,
Citoyen Charles	PERSON	tres bien ! '

		It was his little joke for some days after to call me Citoyen Charles . ''

		`` Citoyen Charles 's '' republican enthusiasm was not , it seems , shared by all his compatriots in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		One day , he relates , there came sprawl - ing over the barricades '' A tall ungainly red-haired Yankee , a student of med - icine , whom I had met before , and who began to ques - tion me as to what I was doing .

		To which I replied , ' What the devil do you want here anyhow ? '

		not be - ing in a mood to be trifled with .

		To which he replied , '
Nawthin	PERSON	' , only a kinder lookin ' reound .

		But what on airth ' But are you for us or against ? '

		I cried . '

		Wall , I ai n't on no side . ' '

		See here , ' I cried in a rage , ' those who are not for us are against us .

		Any one of those fellows you see round here would shoot you at once if I told him to , and if you do n't clear out in double quick time , by God I will ! ' ''

		Evidently , the once humble scholar was fast ripening into a Marat or a St. Just , and might have inaugurated a new Reign of Terror had not the revolution speedily ended .

		He gives the following graphic picture of the denouement : '' All at once we heard a terrible outcry down the street .

		There was a tremendous massing of soldiers there , and to defend that barricade meant death to all defenders .

		I confess that I hesitated one instant , and then rushed headlong to join the fight .

		Merciful God !

		the troops had fraternized with us , and they were hand - ing their muskets over to the mob , who were firing them in the air .

		The scene was terribly moving .

		My men , who a minute before had expected to be shot , rushed up , embraced and kissed the soldiers , wept like children in short , everybody kissed and embraced everybody else , and all my warriors got guns , and therewith I dismissed them , for I knew that the war was now at an end / ' We have spoken of Mr.
Leland	PERSON	's acquaint - ance with
Lola Montez	PERSON	in
1847	DATE	a tremendous celebrity in
Munich	LOCATION	, and the King 's last fav - orite .


Ludwig	PERSON	, bye-the-bye , had had all his mistresses painted , one by one , and in the spirit of a true king and liberal art-patron had thrown the gallery open to the public .

		Lola 's portrait was the last , but the royal foresight had left space for a few more . ''

		I thought , '' says the author , '' that about twenty-five would complete the collection . ''

		Mr.
Leland	PERSON	describes
Lola	PERSON	as very small , pale , and thin , or frele , with fine blue eyes and curly black hair a typical beauty , with a face full of character , and a person of great and varied reading .

		Men generally were madly fascinated with her , then as suddenly disenchanted , '' and then detracted from her in every way . ''

		It was in later years , in
America	LOCATION	, that Mr.
Leland	PERSON	knew
Lola Montez	PERSON	when he was in no danger of the royal bow - string , and the '' space for a few more '' in the Paphian gallery had perceptibly dwindled .

		Once , he says , '' She proposed to me to make a bolt with her to
Europe	LOCATION	, which I declined ... An intimate of both of us who was present when this friendly proposal was made re - marked with some astonishment , ' But ,
Madame	ORGANIZATION	, by what means can you two live ? ' '

		Oh , ' replied
Lola	LOCATION	in - nocently and confidingly , ' people like us ' -LRB- or ' who know as much as we ' -RRB- ' can get a living anywhere . '

		And she rolled us each a cigarette , with one for herself .

		I could tell a number of amusing tales of this Queen of Bohe - mia , but Space , the Kantean god , forbids me more . ''

		From Mr.
Leland	PERSON	's lively account of his '' soldiering '' during the Civil War we shall allow ourselves two extracts .

		It was shortly before
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, when the North had risen en masse at the news of
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's advance .

		Mr.
Leland	PERSON	was put on guard , when , he says , '' There came shambling to me an odd figure .

		There had been some slight attempt by him to look like a sol - dier he had a feather in his hat but he carried his rifle as if after deer or raccoons , and as if he were used to it . '

		Say , Cap ! '

		he exclaimed , ' Kin you tell me where a chap could git some ammynition ? ' '

		Go to your quartermaster , ' I replied .

		< Ai n't got no quar - termaster . ' '

		Well , then to your commanding officer to your regiment . '

		` Ai n't got no commanding offi - cer nowher ' this side o ' God , ner no regiment . ' '

		Then who the devil are you , and where do you belong ? '

		< Do n't belong nowher ' .

		I ' 1 jest tell you , Cap , how it is .

		I live in the south line of
New York State	ORGANIZATION	, and when I heard that the rebs had got inter
Pennsylvany	LOCATION	, forty of us held a meetin ' and ` pinted me Cap'n .

		So we came down here ` cross country , and ` rived this a ` fer - noon , and find in ' fightin ' goin ' on , went straight fer the bush .

		And gittin ' cover , we shot the darndest lot of rebels you ever did see .

		And now all our ammynition is out , I 've come to town for more , for there 's some of 'em left who want killiu ' badly . '

		` See here , my friend , ' I replied , ' you do n't know it , but you 're noth - ing but a bushwhacker , and anybody has a right to shoot you out of hand .

		Do you see that great square 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 tent ? '

		Here I pointed to the general 's marquee . '

		Go in there and get yourself enrolled . '

		And the last I saw of him he was stumbling over the sticks in the right direction . ''

		For our second extract , we select this : '' For bringing out the art of taking care of yourself , a camp in time of war is superior even to ' sleeping about in the markets , ' as recommended by Mr.
Weller	PERSON	.

		Other talents may be limited , but the amount of ' devil ' which can be developed out of a ' smart ' boy as a sol - dier is absolutely infinite .

		College is a Sunday-school to it .

		One of these youths had ' obtained ' a horse somewhere which he contrived to carry along .

		Many of our infantry regiments gradually converted them - selves into cavalry by this process of ' obtaining ' steeds ; and as the officers found that their men could walk bet - ter on horses ' legs they permitted it .

		This promising youngster was one day seated on a caisson or ammuni - tion wagon full of shells , etc. , when it blew up .

		By a miracle he rose in the air , fell on the ground unhurt , and marching immediately up to the lieutenant and touching his hat , exclaimed , ' Please sir , caisson No .

		Two is blown to hell ; please appoint me to another ! '

		That oath was not recorded .

		Poor boy !

		he died in the war . ''

		We had not left port , '' he says , '' before a droll in - cident occurred . '' ''

		On the table in the smoking-room lay a copy of the ' Ballads of
Hans Breitmann	PERSON	. '

		A fellow-passenger asked me , ' Is that your book ? '

		I innocently replied ' Yes . ' '

		Excuse me , sir , ' cried another , ' it is mine . ' '

		I beg your pardon , ' I replied , < but it is really mine . '

		` Sir , I bought it . '

		I do n't care if you did , ' I replied , ' it is mine for I wrote it . '

		There was a roar of laughter , and we all became acquainted at once . ''

		Relating his experiences at

		I have spoken of having met Mr.

		He was from

		The next day after my arrival I found among the names of the departed , `
Signore Wright	PERSON	- Kilkes , from
Barre	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	. '

		This reminded me of the An - glo-American who was astonished at
Rome	LOCATION	at receiving invitations and circulars addressed to him as '
Illustris	PERSON	- simo Varanti Solezer . '

		It turned out that an assistant , reading aloud to the clerk the names from the trunks , had mistaken a very large ' Warranted Sole Leather ' for the name of the owner . ''

		The author 's closing chapter , headed '' En - gland , '' contains some piquant gossip touching literary and other notabilities ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Lewes	LOCATION	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Lord Lytton	LOCATION	,
Lord Houghton	LOCATION	,
Dorc	PERSON	,
George Borrow	PERSON	, etc. , from which we may select the following account of an encounter with
Carlyle	PERSON	as a fitting finale .

		Mr.
Leland	PERSON	met the inflammable sage at the
Chelsea	LOCATION	house , and he seems to have fairly given him a Roland for his Oliver .

		He says : '' I can only remember that for the first twenty or thirty minutes Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	talked such a lot of skimble - skamble stuff and rubbish , which sounded like the very debris and lees of his ' Latter-Day Pamphlets , ' that I began to suspect he was quizzing me , or that this was the manner in which he ladled out Carlyleism to visitors who came to be Carlyled and acted unto . ''

		It was pretty evident that the philosopher was out of humor and that a row was imminent .

		It quickly came about .

		After preliminary spar - ring -LRB- in ring parlance -RRB- , Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	let fall something to the effect that '' we had done noth - ing in
America	LOCATION	since
Cromwell	PERSON	's Revolution of any importance . ''

		Then , says Mr.
Leland	PERSON	, '' A great rage came over me , and I remember very dis - tinctly that there flashed through my mind in a second the reflection , ' Now if I have to call you a d d old fool for saying that , I will ; but I 'll be even with you . '

		When as quickly the following inspiration came , which I uttered , and I suspect somewhat energetically : ` Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	, I think that niy brother ,
Henry Leland	PERSON	, who got the wound from which he died standing by my side in the war of the rebellion , fighting against slavery , was worth ten of my old Puritan ancestors ; at least he died in a ten times better cause .

		And allow ` me to say , Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	, that I think that in all matters of historical criticism you are principally influenced by the merely melodramatic and theatrical . '

		Here Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	, look - ing utterly amazed and startled , though not at all an - gry , said , for the first time , in broad Scotch ' Whot 's that ye say ? ' '

		I say , Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	, ' I exclaimed with rising wrath , ` that I consider that in all historical judg - ments you are influenced only by the melodramatic and theatrical . '

		A grim smile as of admiration came over the stern old face .

		Whether he really felt the justice of the hit I know not , but he was evidently pleased at the manner in which it was delivered , and it was with a deeply reflective and not displeased air that he re - plied ' Na , na , I 'm nae that . '

		It was the terrier that had ferociously attacked the lion , and the lion was charmed .

		From that instant he was courteous , com - panionable , and affable , and talked as if we had been long acquainted , and as if he liked me . ''

		But we have already poached enough on Mr.
Leland	PERSON	's preserves to tempt the reader thither - ward .

		The volume is outwardly attractive , and it contains a fair portrait of the author .

Goodnow	PERSON	's two volumes on `` Com - parative Administrative Law '' are a part of the comprehensive study of comparative politics planned by members of the faculty of

		* COMPARATIVE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW .

		An Analysis of the
Administrative Systems	ORGANIZATION	, national and local , of the
United States	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		By
Frank J. Good	PERSON	- now ,
A.M.	LOCATION	, LL.B. , Professor of Administrative Law in the
University Faculty of Political Science	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, The plan is in the line of present thinking on the subject of political science in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		We have long been dominated by En - glish ideas .

		We shall doubtless always find in those ideas the norm of our political insti - tutions .

		And yet many things that have come to us as a heritage of English histoi-y , hard won , sometimes , by English struggles for pop - ular liberties , are now in point of fact quite obsolete .

		Take for instance the right of peti - tion .

		It is one of the sacred privileges of an American citizen , embedded in our Constitu - tion among those other rights so precious to Anglo-Saxon freemen .

		And yet this choice guarantee of freedom is in fact as dead as
Julius Ca3sar	PERSON	.

		It is utterly useless .

		Other ways of securing action and protecting rights have been devised , more in harmony with our modern methods .

		It is forgotten that petition to the crown was originally the only means by which the commonalty could initiate English legisla - tion calculated to redress grievances .

		But that custom has , centuries since , passed into obliv - ion , and now there is no popular demand which can not readily be brought before
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the shape of a bill .

		Indeed , the few laws that come from our various legislative bodies are but a scanty survival of the swarm of meas - ures that have died in one house or the other .

		The problem now is , not how to secure consider - ation for a scheme of legislation , but how to pre - vent the enactment of the most of them .

		And to that end our bi-cameral system is certainly a blessing .

		It produces an extensive mortality among bills .

		And so our legislators do quite right in receiving petitions perfunctorily and then quietly depositing them in the legislative waste-basket .

		The world is nearer together than it was a century since .

		The social problems to be solved are not so different , after all , whether wrought out by Frenchman or Englishman or American .

		And we need all the fruit of all the experi - ence that civilized brains have worried through .

		Comparative politics recognizes this essential unity at least of European races .

		Perhaps the legal systems of people in the moon might be lit - tle more to us than a curiosity .

		But German and French institutions are merely Aryan ways of meeting difficulties and we are Aryans .

		With this broadening of human sympathies , then , our American isolation is lessening .

		We can learn from what others have done .

		And we may be sure that our learning is very in - complete if we limit it to Anglo-Saxon doings .

		The field of Administrative Law is not a small one .

		We have not been in the habit of con - sidering it by itself in
America	LOCATION	, though in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope it has long been a recognized branch of legal science .

		Our conception of the relation of the courts to administrative officials is dif - ferent .

		A dispute between officials , or a griev - ance of a citizen against an official , is brought before the same courts that take cognizance of ordinary civil cases .

		We do not think of any sacredness hedging about the administrative hierarchy that would keep its members from submitting to the usual jurisdictions .

		In
France	LOCATION	, however , administrative cases come before spe - cial courts , created ad hoc .

		The same consid - erations that keep one supreme court from considering political acts of the national legisla - ture , in the French view apply to all adminis - trative acts .

		In other words , the executive and judicial branches in that country are more really separate than with us .

		And this has perhaps with them helped widen the distinction between the two bodies of law .

		We have not heretofore made much of that distinction .

		However , our administrative system is very extensive and complex , and is growing more so with the development of the republic .

		We make much of our local self-government .

		And yet our various commonwealths States , we are pleased to call them are really highly centralized .

		Local communities have their affairs managed through agencies devised and modified and entirely revolutionized quite at the will of the central authorities .

		And local officials are usually the agents of the common - wealths for many purposes .

		At the same time , the central control is very weak in actual ad - ministration .

		The municipal treasurer is an officer of the state as well as of the city , and yet the state has only a weak hold on him .

		Further , our desire that the people shall be in close touch with the administrative system has led to a multiplication of offices with little or no salary attached .

		We secure popular govern - ment , but at the sacrifice too often of efficiency .

		Thus we have really a curious jumble in our system of managing the public business ad - ministrative centralization and local independ - ence all tangled together .

		It is clear enough that our whole machinery needs overhauling and improving .

		And to do that with success we need to know definitely just what legal relations have grown up among us , and how the other great nations manage the same things .

		To this end Professor Good - now 's study in comparative politics is a valuable contribution .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 The first of the two volumes details the or - ganization of the administrative systems in
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	, the same four nations se - lected by Professor
Burgess	PERSON	for his '' Compar - ative Constitutional Law . ''

		This seems rather a large proportion of the work to devote to a preliminary analysis .

		And yet perhaps less could hardly have been done in the present state of political science .

		The basis of this part of the work is Professor
Burgess	PERSON	's book , with that of Howard on the '' Local Constitutional History of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		These are sup - plemented in a scholarly way by researches of others , and by ample investigation of judicial de - cisions .

		The analysis is a very clear one , and has a value quite independent of its relation to what follows .

		One who desires a good idea of the working system of administering government among the great nations can do no better than to read Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	's first volume .

		In general , the statements of facts are very accu - rate .

		Perhaps exception might be taken to a remark on page 76 .

		In speaking of the ap - pointing power in the State of
New York	LOCATION	, and of the old
Council of Appointment	ORGANIZATION	, the author says : '' Here the Governor had the power to appoint most officers in the commonwealth , but was subject in the exercise of the power to the necessity of obtaining the consent of the
Council of Appointment	ORGANIZATION	formed of mem - bers of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	elected by the Assembly .

		In
1801	DATE	, however , the power was given to each member of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	to nominate for appointment . ''

		This is true , and perhaps all that is essential for the purposes intended .

		Still , it is calcu - lated to mislead one as to the facts .

		The
New York	LOCATION	constitution of
1777	DATE	provided -LRB- Art .

		XXIII . -RRB-

		for the choice of a Council of Ap - pointment , as follows : `` The Assembly shall , once in every year , openly nominate and appoint one of the Senators from each great district , * which Senators shall form a council for the appointment of the said officers , of which the Gov - ernor ... shall be president and have a casting voice , but no other vote ; and with the advice and consent of the said council , shall appoint all the said officers ; and that a majority of the said council be a quorum . ''

		The construction given this clause in the early years of the constitution vested in the governor the exclusive right to nominate , and restricted the councillors to voting , thus giving '' advice and consent '' on such nominations .

		But in
1794	DATE	the Federalists chose three of the four councillors , and this majority insisted that under the constitution they had a right of nom - inating concurrently with the governor .

		As * There were four great districts in the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		the governor ,
George Clinton	PERSON	, was a Repub - lican , it was obvious that this new construction would enable the Federalists to control all the appointments .

		They insisted on their point , against the protest of Governor
Clinton	PERSON	, and thus secured the appointment of a
Federalist as Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	judge .

		The following year -LRB- 1795 -RRB- a Federalist governor ,
John Jay	PERSON	, was elected , and for several years there was no oc - casion for a difference of opinion in the coun - cil .

		But in
1800	DATE	the Republicans again secured the state legislature , and of course a majority in the
Council of Appointment	ORGANIZATION	; and so the tables were turned .

		It was now the Repub - licans who insisted that the constitution meant to give the members of the council a concur - rent right of nomination with the governor , and the Federalists who bitterly opposed .

		This collision resulted in an act of the legislature recommending a constitutional convention , which should have as one purpose to determine the true construction of the twenty-third arti - cle of the constitution .

		This convention was held accordingly , and adopted as its fifth arti - cle the following : '' And this convention do further ... ordain , de - termine , and declare , that by the true construction of the twenty-third article of the constitution of this state the right to nominate all officers ... is vested con - currently in the person administering the government of this state for the time being and in each of the mem - bers of the council of appointment . ''

		Thus the action of this convention was not the addition of a new power to those held by the council , but merely the judicial construc - tion of its powers under the constitution as it stood .

		It must be admitted , however , that the construction thus given was rather a violent one , and probably not at all what was intended by the framers of the constitution of
1777	DATE	.

		Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	-LRB- page 98 -RRB- takes the usual ground that the English crown has lost the veto power .

		He is certainly safer in this view than his colleague , Professor
Burgess	PERSON	, who has an ingenious but rather nebulous theory that the power might still be exercised .

		Perhaps it might .

		But as it is fairly certain that it never will be , the hypothesis can hardly be called a working one in practical politics .

		Attention is called by a passing remark -LRB- page 204 -RRB- to the fact that '' the courts of sev - eral of the commonwealths -LSB- of the
United States	LOCATION	-RSB- have held that the preservation of the peace is not a municipal function . ''

		The time will come when this truth will have wider rec - ognition .

		A local police , managed by local politicians too often directly dependent on the 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, criminal classes , can hardly be expected to be independent of local influences .

		The mainte - nance of order should have its source in a jurisdiction wider than any city or any county .

		We shall come to this in time .

		Volume II .

		treats of '' Legal Relations . ''

		In other words , this is the treatise on
Administra	LOCATION	- tive Law for which the first volume merely clears the way .

		The three divisions are , '' The Law of Officers , '' '' The Administration in Ac - tion , '' and '' The Control over the
Administra	LOCATION	- tion . ''

		The last division is treated the most co - piously , as is natural .

		The American student of politics will find no greater interest than in the chapter on '' The Administrative
Jurisdic	PERSON	- tion in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		The principles of
Montesquieu	LOCATION	relating to the separation of pqwers have no - where else been carried to their logical end as they have in
France	LOCATION	.

		The French administra - tive courts that have resulted are well worth our study .

		The machinery of government in the
United States	LOCATION	is far from perfect .

		It needs overhaul - ing at many points , as has been said .

		And to do that intelligently there must be general knowledge of other methods , as well as of our own .

		As a contribution to this knowledge , Pro- fessor
Goodnow	PERSON	's book will be cordially wel - comed .

		HARRY
PRATT JUDSON	ORGANIZATION	.

		A PONDEROUS BIOGRAPHY .

		* It is a good deal to devote two volumes , of about five hundred closely-printed pages each , to the first half of anybody 's life .

		Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	's career was interesting and important , but he was hardly one of those salient historic person - alities whose every word and deed should be permanently recorded .

		With all his abund - ant gifts ,
Canon Liddon	ORGANIZATION	has lacked a sense of proportion .

		Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	loomed before him a little larger than he really was .

		Not every scrap from his pen was precious .

		Canon Lid - don died before the final revision of this work , yet there is no reason to think that its scale had been diminished had he lived himself to issue it .

		The result is somewhat excessive .

		Accumulated details do not always add to the impression .

		We can not help thinking that this is one of the instances which Hesiod antici - pated when he said that the half had been more than the whole .

		* THE LIFE OF
EDWARD BOUVERIE PUSEY	PERSON	.

		By
Henry Parry Liddon	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hitherto the Tractarian movement has been singularly happy in those who have portrayed it .


Mozley	PERSON	's Reminiscences are as lively gossip as
Pepys	PERSON	's Diary .

		Dean
Burgon	PERSON	's Twelve Good Men were not evaporated and desiccated saints , but a round dozen of characters , brim-full of human nature .

		Ward 's life ` by his son is a striking portraiture of an extraordinary person a `` freak '' or '' sport '' in the ecclesiastical garden .

		Newman 's '' Apologia '' is almost an English classic .

		Dean Church 's review of the
Oxford Movement	ORGANIZATION	is rich in delightful matter .

		But
Liddon	PERSON	's life of
Pusey	LOCATION	, while it may stand on the same shelf with Church and
Ward	ORGANIZATION	and
Burgon	PERSON	and
Mozley	PERSON	and
Newman	PERSON	, will not share their longevity .

		We seem to hear Bur - gon whisper to
Mozley	PERSON	, behind
Newman	PERSON	's back , '' Not altogether a work of inspiration , and per - haps slightly protracted eh ? ''

		and if departed shades are still capable of critical estimates ,
Dean Church	ORGANIZATION	may be seen to smile in genial acquiescence .

		Yet this is the life of one placed in the central current of a great religious move - ment , a movement which has influenced for good or ill perhaps for good and ill the Anglican Communion for a half century .

		It is strange that of the three chiefs of Tractarian - ism no one should have had a striking biog - raphy , neither
Keble	ORGANIZATION	nor
Newman	PERSON	, nor , as now , Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	.

		There are all sorts of memoirs .

		There are those that seize the very man and transfer him bodily to the printed page .

		So
Johnson	PERSON	lives in
Boswell	LOCATION	, and
Scott	PERSON	in
Lockhart	LOCATION	, and Ma - caulay in
Trevelyan	LOCATION	.

		Others distil the finer essence of the man , yet the work lacks body .

		So certain delicate artists manage to miss the outward features of their sitter while yet elic - iting his soul .

		Thus
Maurice	PERSON	's life by his son may be called a memoir of a disembodied spirit .

		The prophet , as his disciples loved to call him , is there ; but the man who paid taxes , and went to market , and had his little tempers and ab - surdities , hardly comes to the surface .

		And there are memoirs like
Masson	PERSON	's life of Mil - ton , where you lose the figure in the landscape , the person in the period , and are rather sur - prised when from time to time he emerges .

		As writers differ , so subjects differ .

		There are men who lend themselves naturally to vivid presentation , who suggest lines of caricature to their enemies , and photographic sharpness of light and shadow to their friends ; whose hu - mors are representative , who are very like themselves and very much of their own opin - ion ; men whom you love or detest , but can not
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 easily ignore or forget ; men of caprice and quaintness like Lamb , of robust sense and non - sense like Montaigne , men of mingled contra - dictions like Swift or
Carlyle	LOCATION	, men of blood and iron like
Cromwell	PERSON	or
Bismarck	PERSON	, men of genius interwrought with goodness and humor like
Scott	PERSON	or
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		And there are other men , who , in whatever glare of publicity they may be standing , whatever cause they are forward - ing , however they may seem to be leading , yet somehow evade scrutiny , lack distinction , puz - zle observation ; men who may be even great in a sort , yet are always a little tiring in their greatness ; who , clad in every virtue , are after all but half visible .

		Those who are not of their inner circle are tempted to describe them as '' good men in the worst acceptation of the word . ''

		You may esteem and reverence them , but can go no farther .

		For your life , you can - not approach them with any familiar liking .

		Alone on a desert island you might be grateful for their company , but with inward hesitancies and reservations .

		Somewhat of this latter sort must have been the late Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	.

		One of his disciples speaks of him as `` so awful a person . ''

		This is not at all the view which Dr.
Liddon	PERSON	meant to give of him , but it is the impression left on read - ing these volumes of his biography .

		They portray not so much a man as an ecclesiastic , a schoolman , a body of divinity .

		He has hardly personal traits ; rather , he is marked by theo - logical tendencies .

		He has a subtle if not always a lucid intellect , a fervid rather than a luminous power of expression , an energetic and imperative conscience , a positive and tenacious will , a warm affection for a few persons , and an ardent passion for several abstract ideas ; but there seems not very much flesh and blood to him .

		He has a defined outline , but you doubt his possession of the usual three dimen - sions .

		You might sketch him in pen-and-ink , or bite him in with acid on copper ; but you could hardly model him all round in clay , or paint him with a full pallette in body color .

		You wonder if you tickle him would he laugh if you prick him would he bleed ?

		The very supposition seems incongruous .

		Nor was any such lack of vitality in the sub - ject likely to be made good by a superabund - ance of vitality in the painter .

		The art of Lid - don is not that of Rubens or of Tintoret .

		It is academic always , like that of the
Caracci	ORGANIZATION	.

		While he was undoubtedly an able man , a learned and devout man , a man of eloquence and enthusiasm , a fervid rhetorician , he was not at all a fresh or suggestive man .

		His mind , however richly stored , was of a dry and scho - lastic cast , dwelling in the atmosphere of school divinity and ecclesiasticism , rather than of phil - osophic thought or spiritual intuition .

		The soil is highly cultivated , but not originally fertile .

		There is not a touch of saving humor or pen - etrative imagination in either biographer or subject of the biography .

		In all these thou - sand pages one hardly comes upon a striking illustration , a revealing anecdote , or a quotable passage .

		The reader 's mind is kept on an un - broken level .

		The tone is that of intense se - riousness , unrelieved by any momentary play of thought .

		No one , it is said , was ever so wise as Lord
Thurlow	PERSON	looked .

		Was anyone , it may be asked , ever so undeviatingly solemn as Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	is made to appear throughout these pon - derous volumes ?

		When his children enter the drawing-room after dinner , it is
Newman	PERSON	who frolics with them and tells them quaint stories ; it is not
Pusey	PERSON	.

		One is compelled to wonder if he never encountered his fellow
Tractarian Ward	PERSON	, or caught a twinkle in the eye of Moz - ley ?

		Was he always in such deadly earnest ?

		Could not even the irony of events extort from him a smile ?

		Was '' The Great Man '' always so impressed with the consciousness of his part on the stage of church history , his immediate responsibility for the safe conduct of his pe - riod , as never to unbend ?

		That title which in
Greek Newman	ORGANIZATION	bestowed upon
Pusey	PERSON	,
Henry Wilberforce	PERSON	had already more fittingly be - stowed upon
Newman	PERSON	.

		Perhaps when he went over to the Roman Communion he desired to beque * ath it to his successor in the Tractarian leadership .

		Certainly
Pusey	PERSON	had one element of greatness the steady head which could let him stand on the very edge of a precipice and look fondly over , without the final leap or plunge .

		On the whole , there are those who could say of Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	that he was not great so much as weighty a word conveying at once two ideas : influential and ponderous , neither quite inapplicable to the subject of this memoir .

		Why was he so widely influential ?

		It is not an easy matter from this biography to dis - cover .

		It was probably due to several com - bining conditions .

		He was a man of high so - cial position , with family connection with the nobility ; a man of large means and large muni - ficence , of saintly devotion , of ascetic habit , of rare intensity of purpose , of special aptitude for business , and of a certain very English moderation in judgment .

		He could hold ex - treme views , yet be content without pushing 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, them to extreme consequences .

		The logic of his intellect did not override the caution of his procedure .

		When more brilliant and more logical minds flashed out of Anglicanism , whose foundations no longer seemed to them trust - worthy , into the Roman Communion towards which their growing convictions pointed them , Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	could admit their premises without accepting their conclusion , could skim over thin ice without recognizing its insufficiency to sup - port him , could rest on foundations which he himself had helped to undermine , as if they were of bedded adamant .

		When
Ward	ORGANIZATION	and
Newman	PERSON	and
Oakley	PERSON	and
Manning	PERSON	discovered that what they held most precious lay upon the farther side of the line that marked the boun - dary between
Rome	LOCATION	and
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	could remain in the English Church and pre - pare Roman manuals for Anglican use with placid imperturbability .

		He suffered , but kept his composure .

		So , after the loss of Werter ,
Charlotte	LOCATION	went on cutting bread and butter .

		Where logic called for suicide , Saxon sense preferred serviceableness .

		Nothing is so con - genial to the British mind as a logical contra - diction practically justified and disregarded .

		In our mother church and island to hold that two and two makes four , and to decline to take any further steps in that arithmetical pro- gression , is always regarded as wisdom and dis - cretion .

		It stamps upon its holder the imprint of sound and safe and sober .

		Such men be - come influential by force of their very limita - tions .

		Such a delicate and able equilibrium of eager courage and patient caution , of pro- found convictions and suspended application of them , is always interesting , and nowhere more successful in the conduct of life than among English churchmen .

		Perhaps another secret of Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	's lead - ership was his entire absorption in ecclesias - tical and theological interests .

		Unless Dr. Lid - don has done him strange injustice , he was always '' clasped like a missal '' against all the outside light or dust that might penetrate his cloister .

		Here is a life whose course was syn - chronous with the dawn of modern science and the revival of modern literature ; yet in the copious correspondence with close friends throughout these volumes , from early child - hood to middle life , but for a reference to Byron as an injurious element in his youth , and an oc - casional reference to
Keble	LOCATION	and that more to the theological than to the poetic value of '' The Christian Year , '' there is hardly a suggestion that
Pusey	PERSON	ever read other than theological treatises or controversial pamphlets .

		Scholar as he was , there is no hint of his delight in the classics , whether Greek or Latin .

		He was careless of graces of style .

		He was indifferent to the charms of literature .

		He was unobservant of the march of science .

		He was unconcerned with the development of art or music .

		He built churches , but displays no taste for architecture .

		The one thing that interested him was patris - tic theology in its impress upon the institu - tion of which he was a part , the Church of
England	LOCATION	.

		That sort of concentration is always power .

		It gives force and intensity in a nar - row track .

		Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	, though more of a man , had been less of a leader , if his mind had coursed over a wider field .

		He would have seen ideas in truer proportions , but he had been less the centre and head of Tractarian influence than he was for a generation from the day that
John Henry Newman	PERSON	, after long hesitancy , finally passed over to
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Liddon	PERSON	well describes Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	's long life , which began on
August 22 , 1800	DATE	, and lasted until
September 16 , 1882	DATE	, as '' singularly uneventful , a continuous stream of lectures , sermons , letters , interviews . ''

		The interviews have left no trace save in the characters and lives of those whom they influenced .

		The let - ters are not sprightly , graphic , nor luminous .

		For the outpouring of an energetic mind , in free communication with familiar friends , they are remarkably formal and uninteresting .

		You feel with what justice their author could say of himself , referring to his personal temperament and Walloon ancestry , '' You know I am phleg - matic , and , indeed , Dutch . ''

Lowell	PERSON	could not relish them , though their highly - wrought rhetoric may pos - sibly be less valued when the present genera - tion passes from the stage and the glamour of their author 's personality has been dissipated .

		But
Pusey	PERSON	's sermons and lectures are already obsolescent .

		There is a certain beauty of holi - ness , a tender sweetness , about his first volume of parochial discourses .

		The substance of the lectures , as contained in the volumes on

		Yet it is in the Tractarian school that Dr.

		THE DIAL 17 day for such intensity of controversy in the church arena is happily ended .

		Men as op - posed as
Newman	PERSON	and
Arnold	LOCATION	, as
Hampden	LOCATION	and
Pusey	PERSON	, have learned to set less store on the things wherein they differ .

		On public plat - forms and in church newspapers , they may fling about the old vituperations ; but they do it from force of bad habit , and mean very little by them .

		Their sting has been blunted and their virus neutralized .

		For the most part , people respect one another 's liberty and toler - ate their mutual diversities .

		Yet in one re - spect , perhaps , we have degenerated .

		It was once a battle of scholars and thinkers in the region of convictions and ideas .

		It is now a commotion on a lower level .

		The Tract - arian is departed , and the Ritualist is with us .

		Now a tract is not an imposing weapon , but it is of more weight than a ceremonial .

		What to believe is a serious concern .

		How to behave in the chancel is a histrionic controversy .

		Per - haps the day is at hand when good men will remember with shame that once such trifles were magnified , that what has been admirably called the mere '' etiquette of religion '' once divided those who should be brethren .

		* The ability to see things in a foreign land as they really are , and not as they are distorted by the blinding pride of race or religion , is a rare gift .

		It implies intelligent and sympa - thetic appreciation of the qualities which , in spite of outward differences , make '' the whole world kin . ''

		The possession of this ability in a marked degree by the author of '' A
Japan	LOCATION	- ese Interior '' lends distinction to the series of letters in which she relates her experiences during a year 's residence in
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		Their freedom from bias is indeed remarkable .

		As one of the teachers in a school for girls of no - ble birth , under the management of the Impe - rial
Household Department	ORGANIZATION	and the personal patronage of the Empress ,
Miss Bacon	LOCATION	had unusual opportunities .

		Of these she made ex - cellent use .

		Her life in
Tokyo	LOCATION	was spent almost entirely among the Japanese and apart from the foreign colony .

		The letters , which do not appear to have been written with a view to pub - lication , testify to a desire to accommodate her - * A JAPANESE INTERIOR .

& Co.	ORGANIZATION	~ self in every way to the manners and customs of the people about her , so far as this could be done without the sacrifice of her own individ - uality .

		Etiquette among the upper classes in
Japan	LOCATION	demands familiarity with many conven - tional observances and calls for much deferen - tial bowing .

		How Miss
Bacon	PERSON	regarded this is shown by a characteristic incident , her ac - count of which is worth repeating .

		Having received an invitation to see the feast of dolls at the house of one of the Tokugawa daimios one of the few places in
Tokyo	LOCATION	where the old - time etiquette is still kept up she felt it in - cumbent to prepare herself beforehand . ''

		Mind gave me a little instruction in the art of get - ting down on my knees and putting my forehead to the floor , but the present style of American dress makes it very hard to do the thing gracefully , and my joints are a good deal too stiff to allow me to be comfortable dur - ing the process .

		However , I did it after a fashion , and felt very much like a fool in doing it , but it seemed ne - cessary for me to show my appreciation of the kindness that had been shown me by being polite in some man - ner that my entertainers could recognize .

		Our good manners are so undemonstrative that only a few for - eignized Japanese can discover that we have any at all , and the usual result of an effort here in
Japan	LOCATION	to copy foreign manners is a complete disregard of all rules of politeness , whether Japanese or foreign . ''

		Miss
Bacon	PERSON	's sojourn in
Japan	LOCATION	was not ex - tended enough to enable her to become thor - oughly familiar with all the intricacies of Jap - anese etiquette , but her observations in regard to it are nevertheless interesting .

		Toward the end of her stay she writes : '' It is rather a curious experience for me out here , that in my associations with those about me I am ' neither fish , flesh , fowl , nor good red herring . '

		I am too Japanese for the foreigners , and too foreign for the Japanese ; too worldly for the missionaries , and not worldly enough for the rest of the foreign colony ; and so , with the exception of my intimate Japanese friends , there is no one in
Tokyo	LOCATION	who does not seem to regard me as rather out of their line . ''

		Although the author states in the preface that her book is '' not intended as an authority on
Japan	LOCATION	in general , or on any particular phase of life there , '' no better or more reliable account of the things that came within her observation has yet been - written .

		It does not pretend to be more than a daily chronicle of events , sights , and impressions , a record of passing thoughts rather than the result of mature deliberation .

		As such , however , it is a delightful book , writ - ten in a simple style and free from affectation .

		While a longer residence in the country would doubtless have caused some of the comments to be modified , they are for the most part well - considered .

		Occasionally she makes an over -
18	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, statement , as when she says of the Japanese laborer that he has his aesthetic nature '' fully '' developed .

		Neither in
Japan	LOCATION	nor
Europe	LOCATION	nor
America	LOCATION	is this literally true of any but the very few .

		As compared with the similar class elsewhere , however , the Japanese laborer is in this respect immeasurably in advance .

		Miss
Bacon	PERSON	's remarks upon this point are so singu - larly just that we can not forbear quoting them : '' With him , < life is more than meat , ' it is beauty as well ; and this love of beauty has upon him such a civ - ilizing effect that some people are led to think that the lower classes in
Japan	LOCATION	do not need Christianity .

		But when one comes to study them , they are not more moral than our lower classes ; they are not as moral ; they are only more gentle , more contented , more civilized I should say , except that the word ' civilization ' is so dif - ficult to define and to understand that I do not know what it means now as well as I did when I left home .

		occasion , of christening a book '' That Beautiful Wretch , '' for which offence it would take more than one `` Daughter of Heth '' or `` Princess of
Thule	LOCATION	'' to atone .

		Most of Mr.
Black	PERSON	's novels belong to the class that are produced by merely shuffling the well-worn cards of the game , and the one now at hand offers no exceptions to this rule .

		Its master - cards are the
Jean Valjean	PERSON	story of self-effacement in the interests of a beloved daughter , and the Mar - guerite
Duval	PERSON	story of the austere parent 's plea to spare a cherished son the degradation of stepping down a rung or two upon the social ladder .

		Let us add that the descent contemplated is not deep enough to be tragic , and that the hero has manli - ness enough to make it .

		Here we are for an instant minded of '' A Princess of
Thule	LOCATION	, '' but marriage does not , in this case , change a gentleman into a cad .

		The story is rather more pleasing than most of Mr.
Black	PERSON	's recent ventures ; it is well provided with incident , dramatic upon occasion , sparkling in the flow of its narrative .

		It is pathetic without be - ing emotional , and its tone is cultivated without be - ing priggish .

		Some time ago the newspapers were busily in - forming the public that Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	had gone to
Mexico	LOCATION	to collect the materials for a new story .

		The story is now published , is called `` Mon - tezuma 's Daughter , '' and justifies the pains taken by the author in making his observations on the spot .

		We have no doubt that he could have made nearly as good a story out of
Prescott	PERSON	and the other books , but there are numerous chapters in which his personal experience stands him in good stead , and the story is both graphic and exciting , although it has no style worth speaking of , and although its conception of plot is about on the level of that dis - played by Captain
Mayne Reid	PERSON	in his numerous romances .

		More than once , in fact , Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	reminds us of a
Mayne	ORGANIZATION	Reid redivivus , although he seems to have had
Kingsley	PERSON	's `` Westward Ho ! ''

		in sight during the composition of the book .

		The story is mostly Mexican , and tells of the invasion of Cortes ; but there are antecedent passages in
England	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	, for the hero is an English ad - venturer who finds his way through
Spain	LOCATION	to Mex - ico on a vengeful quest .

		The vengeance is certainly satisfactory when it comes , but is not reached until the hero has had as surprising a series of perils and escapes as even the fertile imagination of the author ever devised .

		The spelling of Aztec names has been considerably shortened for the infant mind , and '' Popocatapetl '' is reduced to `` Popo . ''

		But does not Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	know that the infant mind , bent upon geographical lore , simply delights in the name of
Popocatapetl	LOCATION	, and would not for a wilder - ness of monkeys have it abbreviated ?

		``
Richard Escott	PERSON	'' is both the title of a story and the name of the preposterous villain about whom it centres .

		He is the son of a noble lord and cabinet minister , but is likewise a blackleg , a cardsharper , and an unspeakable cad .

		His operations are mostly 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 carried on in
Paris	LOCATION	, where he plays with his friends a queer game called '' poker , '' in which you can draw to a hand at least twice , `` rise '' your opponents at pleasure , and use the deuce of spades as a `` joker . ''

		The record of
Escott	ORGANIZATION	's villainies is dreary and un - relieved , and the story is put together with but slight constructive art .

		The death of the hero is a relief , both because it satisfies the moral sense and because the book has to end with it . '

		A Gentleman of
France	LOCATION	'' is a historical romance of the times of
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its action is placed in the period when the last of the Valois kings has taken refuge at
Blois	LOCATION	, and ends with his assassination .

		The two Henrys figure conspicuously in the narrative , which is as full of stirring adven - tures as a Christmas pudding of plums , and quite as good as
Dumas	PERSON	.

		The hero is a reduced but very valiant gentleman , and the heroine is a young gen - tlewoman who at first spurns him as Enid spurned
Geraint	PERSON	, but whose pride melts into love when the proper time comes , and who is altogether fascinat - ing .

		Like Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	's ' The White Company '' and '' The Refugees , '' which it much resembles , Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's story makes extremely vivid the chapter of French history with which it deals .

		Such books show clearly that
Scott	PERSON	is still a power in English fiction , and that the analysts and realists are not to have things entirely their own way .


Diana Tempest	PERSON	is the daughter of Colonel Tem - pest , a spendthrift guardsman who would have suc - ceeded his brother in the Overleigh estate had it not been for
John Tempest	PERSON	, that brother 's reputed son , upon whom the estate devolved .

		In point of fact ,
John	PERSON	is an illegitimate son , and the fact is known to all concerned excepting the child himself .

		Whereupon the uncle brings an action against the estate , but is , of course , defeated .

		He then listens to the promptings of an evil genius named
Swayne	PERSON	, and lays ten wagers , each of a thousand pounds to a sovereign , that he will never succeed to Overleigh .

		Presently ,
Colonel Tempest	ORGANIZATION	is sorry for what he has done , and feels something like remorse .

		But at this juncture
Swayne	PERSON	most inopportunely dies , and his partner in crime then discovers that the ten bets have been transferred to as many persons , and is unable to trace them and take them up .

		At this point the reader has the fascinating prospect of ten mysterious attempts to murder
John	PERSON	, and at least nine hairbreadth escapes .

		But these reason - able anticipations are not fulfilled , for , after four of the unknown takers of the wager have failed to '' remove '' their victim and win the
Colonel	ORGANIZATION	's money , the Colonel concludes to take his , own life and thus deprive the other six -LRB- whoever they may be -RRB- of their occupation .

		The readers of the story will all agree with the balked assassins that to do this was to take a mean advantage of them .

		In the mean - while ,
John	PERSON	has grown up , unsuspicious of the dan - gers surrounding him -LRB- although mildly surprised at the frequency of the accidents he encounters -RRB- , and has fallen in love with
Diana	PERSON	.

		Presently , he dis - covers his illegitimacy , and , acting upon an absurdly quixotic impulse , determines to surrender the prop - erty which is both legally and morally his .

		This foolish proceeding is averted by the death of the Colonel and his scapegrace son , , thus leaving the question to be settled by
Diana	PERSON	and
John	PERSON	, which is not a difficult matter .

		It will be seen from this outline that the story is both ingenious and exciting ; we should add that the author has an incisive style and handles her materials with ease .

		A story that keeps the reader puzzled concerning its principal characters , and leaves him in the end uncertain as to what he shall think of them , is clearly lacking in one of the essentials of artistic work .

		Such a story is '' What Necessity Knows , '' by
Miss Dougall	PERSON	, whose `` Beggars All '' we reviewed about a year ago .

		Yet the book is made interesting by its divergence from the beaten path , and by a cer - tain force and delicacy which , although crudely em - bodied , are evident and unmistakable .

		An episode in the Millerite craze of
1843	DATE	is the central situa - tion , and this unpromising material is worked up with considerable insight .

		The scene is laid in
Canada	LOCATION	, and the characters are , for the most part , English settlers in that country .

		There are a great number of prosy pages that might profitably have been condensed or left out altogether .

		Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	's second novel is a distinct advance upon his first .

		In construction , in charac - ter delineation , and in grasp of its materials , it of - fers a marked improvement upon its predecessor , and may fairly claim to be taken seriously , a claim that was hardly to be made in behalf of '' With Edge Tools . ''

		There are faults , of course , and marks of the prentice hand .

		The writer 's style is very defective , and calls for a closer attention than he has given it as yet .

		Obscure , ill-balanced , and slip-shod sentences are of frequent occurrence .

		Sev - eral of the characters exhibit inconsistencies that produce a patch-work effect , and the hero , on at least one occasion , carries frankness to the point of naivete and even beyond , producing an impression clearly different from anything that could have been in the author 's intention .

		But the merits of the book are considerable .

		It holds the interest from first to last , and many of the episodes are exceed - ingly well managed .

		The conversations consist largely of small talk and repartee , but they are sel - dom unnatural and nearly always clever .

		Some - times they are very clever indeed . ''

		The English life depicted in the story is a somewhat superficial sketch , '' the writer remarks in his preface .

		This is undoubtedly true , but it is also true that superfi - cial sketches of life have their value , and that this one , which makes no unwarranted pretensions , needs no apologetic introduction .

		It was not a bad idea for the writer , having safely landed his hero and heroine upon English soil , to take them the rounds of social life , to crushes and house-parties and `` meets , '' to
Henley	PERSON	and
Goodwood	LOCATION	, as a device for providing his story with a pleasing variety of 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, scenes .

		In spite of the attractiveness of this shift - ing background , the human relations woven into the story are of paramount interest , and the characters have considerable reality , although they appear , for the most part , in an artificial environment .

		We should add that the sentiment of the story is dis - tinctly wholesome .

		The '' Coign of Vantage '' from which Mr.
Wood	PERSON	's harum-scarum story is told is an old Roman tower in the
Valais	LOCATION	, inhabited , for a few days , by a small party of tourists , bent upon a lark .

		It goes without saying that they are Americans , and that great is the surprise not to say consternation of inn - keeper and village folk when our tourists propose to divert the tower from its time-honored uses as a sight to be seen to an abode to be lived in .

		Installed in their romantic quarters , our tourists find their existence enlivened by a series of unexpected inci - dents , and soon become actors in a comedy of errors the scenes whereof are developed with slight regard to the probabilities or the conventionalities .

		The story has the usual matrimonial outcome , and is told not without cleverness and point .

		`` In the Dwellings of Silence '' is a romance of
Russia	LOCATION	and Siberian exile .

		As the treatment is no less hackneyed than the material , and as the book is rather carelessly written , comment is hardly called for .

		The horrors with which '' Stepniak '' and Mr.
Kennan	PERSON	have made us acquainted are retailed in slightly intensified form , and we follow our political prisoners from
Petropavlovsk	LOCATION	to
Kara	PERSON	, feeling all the time that we know just what will happen to them next .

		The story of their escape is ingeniously man - aged , and is much the most interesting part of the book .

		But the whole subject ought either to be shelved , or at least left to writers who have more than a hearsay knowledge of what Siberian exile means . ''


Tom Sylvester	PERSON	, '' Mr.
T. R. Sullivan	PERSON	's first ven - ture in full-grown fiction , shows an intimate acquaint - ance with two things the home life of the
New England	LOCATION	town , and the social life of the American resident in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The boyhood of the hero is so naturally and so sympathetically described that he reminds us not a little of another '' Tom '' the typical
New England	LOCATION	youngster of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's thinly disguised autobiography .

		Mr.
Sullivan	PERSON	's hero , when he grows up , goes forth to see the world as it wags in the French capital , and acquires a fund of valuable experience .

		Presently he returns to his native village , marries an old-time playmate , and the rest is silence .

		The moral of the tale possibly a trifle forced is that
America	LOCATION	is the proper place for Americans , and that self-expatriation is mainly useful in helping one to appreciate what has been left behind .

		The book is as wholesome as it is interesting , and is an excellent repast to set before young not too young readers .

		Our collection of novels includes a group of four that are based , to a certain extent , upon the literary history of
England	LOCATION	, and derive no little of their interest from the well-known characters that figure in their pages .

		The first of these novels to which we will call attention is called '' The Days of Lamb and
Coleridge	PERSON	. ''

		The truth in this story much out - weighs the fiction , for nearly all the incidents were actual occurrences in the lives of this famous literary pair .

		The letters are printed verbatim , and even the conversations are to a certain extent pieced out from reported utterances .

		The Shelleys ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and other writers are brought into the story , some - what irrelevantly .

		It is a pleasant performance , albeit an amateurish one .

		Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	is the hero of ''
Penshurst Castle	ORGANIZATION	, '' a story by Mrs.
Marshall	PERSON	, who is not un - known to readers of historical fiction .

		There is good stuff for romance in the life of
Sidney	LOCATION	, but the writer has idealized him almost out of all sem - blance of reality .

		The hero of Zutphen figures , in consequence , as a rather priggish sort of person , doubtless the last effect intended by his enthusiastic delineator .

		There is some history , dilute but accu - rate , in the narrative ; the Countess of Pembroke appears conspicuously , and we catch sight now and then of other well-known characters , including the
Virgin Queen	PERSON	, the
Earl of Leicester	ORGANIZATION	, and Sir
Fulke Greville	PERSON	.

		The author 's style walks upon stilts , but does not thereby escape from commonplace . ''

		The Bailiff of Tewkesbury '' is a romance of Elizabethan times , and no less a person than
William Shakespeare	PERSON	figures among the characters .

		In the opening chapters we read of the midnight raid upon the Lucy preserves , and the haling of the young poacher before outraged magistracy .

		At this point , we wonder if the authors would be audacious enough to emulate Landor , and attempt once more what he did once for all .

		But the episode is passed lightly over , and the poet sets out for
London	LOCATION	, to appear henceforth but at momentary intervals upon the scene .

		The ostensible hero is one
William Helpes	PERSON	, and the heroine is a niece of Sir
Thomas Lucy	PERSON	.

		This Helpes is represented as the mysterious '' W. H. '' of the sonnets , and to him , as their '' only begetter , '' are a number of them sent , and thus deftly woven into the pretty tale .

		The last book of our literary-historical group is ''
Garrick	PERSON	's Pupil , '' a translation from the French .

		The central episode of the work is furnished by the
Gordon Riots	PERSON	, and the adventures of a young actress , persecuted by a dissolute nobleman , provide the story with its main theme .

		Among the famous men to whom we are introduced may be mentioned Rey - nolds ,
Burke	PERSON	,
Gibbon	PERSON	,
Johnson	PERSON	, and
Boswell	PERSON	.

		The story is an admirable picture of the times singu - larly so when considered as the work of a foreigner but is not oppressively historical .

		The translation is fair , but not always idiomatic .

		We read , for ex - ample , that a certain pickpocket '' failed to relieve ''
Prince Orloff	PERSON	of a valuable snuff-box .

		This is easily recognized as a mistranslation offailli .

		On the same page we find bete noir , a common but inexcusable blunder .


Frau von Hillern	PERSON	's '' On the Cross '' seeks to con - struct a romance with the
Oberammergau Passion Play	ORGANIZATION	as its leading motive .

		A woman of the
Ba	ORGANIZATION	-
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 varian aristocracy , who is at heart a worldling , but who persuades herself for a time into being a most schwdrmerisch idealist , witnesses the play , is fasci - nated by the actor who represents the Christ , secretly marries him , and takes him to her country estate , where he nominally lives as her steward .

		She soon tires of the relation , and resumes her society life , playing fast and loose with a nobleman who has long been her lover .

		The husband , in the meanwhile , after ten years of almost solitary life , ended by a scene of passionate upbraiding , returns to
Ammer	PERSON	- gau , resumes his old part , but is soon brought to the point of death by the exhaustion that comes from a decade of spiritual suffering .

		At the very end , his wife comes to tardy recognition of her duty towards him , abandons society , and does her best to atone to him for her sin .

		This is the outline of a story which makes a distinctly unpleasant impression .

		It is emotional , and even hysterical ; it abounds in un - natural contrasts between different phases of the same character ; its morality comes dangerously near being sophistical ; and its blending of the religious with the sensual is , at its worst , fairly nauseating .

		As a depiction of the spirit in which the peasants of old Ammergau entered into their sacred work , it will be scoffed at by the cynic ; yet , in this regard , the work is probably more faithful to fact than in any other .

		With the publication of '' Pan
Michael	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Cur	PERSON	- tin has completed his English translation of the great historical trilogy which we owe to the genius of
Hen	ORGANIZATION	- ryk
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	.

		The other divisions of this work , `` With Fire and Sword '' and `` The Deluge , '' were reviewed by us at the time of their appearance , and we are now called upon to say a few words of their sequel .

		The Pan
Michael	PERSON	of the title is , of course , the valiant little knight ,
Volodyovski	PERSON	, who figures conspicuously in the whole series .

		His further deeds of bravery are recounted in the present volume , which culminates in his heroic defence of Kamenyets and his death upon the ruins of that stronghold when treachery has finally given it into the hands of the pagan invader .

		Our old friend
Zagloba	LOCATION	, now past ninety , but as great a master as ever of wit and wordy valor , remains in view to the end .

		We have also occasional glimpses of other heroes of the pre - ceding volumes ; but many new figures crowd the canvas , and hold the attention in their turn .

		The greatest of these , historically , is that of John So - bieski , whose infrequent appearances upon the scene are managed with much impressiveness , although the most glorious episode in his career , his repulse of the Turks at
Vienna	LOCATION	, still lies ten years in the future at the time when this narrative closes .

		The struggle of the Polish Commonwealth with the Cos - sacks was the theme of `` With Fire and Sword '' ; the struggle with the Swedish invader was the theme of '' The Deluge . '' ''

		Pan
Michael	PERSON	'' has for its theme the terrible Turkish war which made a king of So - bieski and of his name one of the greatest of histor - ical memories .

		The interest of the trilogy , both historical and romantic , is splendidly sustained in '' Pan
Michael	PERSON	, '' although the work contains fewer than its predecessors of those episodes like that of Zagloba in the loft or that of Skshetuski in the marshes at Zbaraj which no one that has once read can ever forget .

		Nor is its culminating episode of the siege of Kamenyets quite equal in impressive - ness to the magnificent account of the siege of Chen - stohova given us in '' The Deluge . '' ''

		Here ends this series of books , written in the course of a number of years and with no little toil , for the strengthening of hearts , '' says the author at the close of his epilogue .

		`` This series of books '' fills , in its English form , nearly twenty-six hundred large pages , and means an amount of writing about equal to half a dozen full-sized '' Waverley '' novels , or to the eleven volumes in which
Dumas	PERSON	chron - icled the adventures of his moiisquetaires .

		It often happens that the amount of writing in a book is inversely proportional to its literary value , and this is particularly apt to be true of historical romance , as many German , and some English and American , examples testify .

		It is even true , to a certain extent , of the master achievement of
Dumas	PERSON	; but it is not true of
Scott	PERSON	, and it is not true of the present author .

		From every point of view , this Polish trilogy de - serves to be ranked among the greatest of all works of historical fiction .

		It covers a period of only twenty-five years the
third quarter	DATE	of the seven - teenth century ; but it gives us of that period for the Polish Commonwealth a picture of unsurpassed vigor , fidelity , and interest .

		From the artistic stand - point , to have created the character of
Zagloba	LOCATION	was a feat comparable with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's creation of Falstaff and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's creation of Mephistopheles .

		The other heroes of the trilogy include several of the clearest-cut types , faithful to the traits of their respective races Pole , Tartar , and
Cossack	ORGANIZATION	to be found anywhere in literature ; while in the delinea - tion of his heroines the author has shown equal skill discernment , and sympathy .

		We must look to the great masters for a gallery of equally noble and lov - able women .

		It seems , indeed , incongruous to dis - cuss a work of this sort in connection with a review of current fiction , so unmistakably does it detach itself from the multitude of ephemeral productions .

		The best of ordinary heroes seem but carpet-knights in comparison with these valiant warriors of Old
Poland	LOCATION	, as the best of ordinary heroines seem but boudoir or hot-house creations in comparison with the adorable women who make radiant these pages .

		The real secret of the Polish novelist 's power is that he penetrates beneath the conventional surface of life whereupon most novelists find their element , and shows us men and women swayed by the primal im - pulses of the human soul .

		Love , patriotism , and reli - gion : these always have been and always will be the controlling motives , of sane and healthy humanity ; and these motives , heightened by the writer 's artistic instinct , are given unchecked play in the work now happily completed .

		It is indeed , a work '' for the strengthening of hearts . ''

		Prof.
Huxley	PERSON	's `` Methods and Residti . ''

		Professor
Huxley	PERSON	has set himself to re-arrange his miscellaneous papers of the last quarter-century into an edition of '' Collected Essays '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , to be completed in nine volumes , one of which will be the `` Hume '' in the ' - English Men of Letters '' series .

		The first of these volumes , entitled '' Method and Results , '' has just appeared .

		It includes his essay of
1870	DATE	on
Descartes	PERSON	and his '' Discours de la M - thode , '' the famous essay of
1868	DATE	on '' The Physical Basis of Life , '' a group of recent political discussions , and a few others .

		What gives peculiar interest to the volume is the fact that these essays are prefaced by a brief autobiography , published a few years ago , but not , we think , generally known to the public . ''

		Why I was christened
Thomas Henry	PERSON	I do not know , '' says Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	, '' but it is a curious chance that my parents should have fixed for my usual de - nomination upon the name of that particular Apostle with whom I have always felt most sympathy . ''

		The manner of this sentence is characteristic of the entire sketch , which is genial and much too brief .

		It is difficult to realize that the writer has been a hypo - chondriacal dyspeptic nearly all his life , but such , he assures us , is the fact .

		Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	, as all his readers know , is fond of posing as a plain blunt man , and this amusing affectation appears in the sketch before us .

		He is no orator , as
Brutus	LOCATION	is , and he often assures us that he is not .

		But we fancy that both he and
Antony	PERSON	winked when they said it .

		The following is one of the closing passages : '' The last thing that it would be proper for me to do would be to speak of the work of my life , or to say at the end of the day whether I think I have earned my wages or not .

		Men are said to be partial judges of them - selves .

		Young men may be , I doubt if old men are .

		Life seems terribly foreshortened as they look back , and the mountain they set themselves to climb in youth turns out to be a mere spur of immeasurably higher ranges , when , with failing breath , they reach the top .

		But if I may speak of the objects 1 have had more or less definitely in view since I began the ascent of my hillock , they are briefly these : To promote the increase of natural knowledge and to forward the application of scientific methods of investigation to all the problems of life to the best of my ability , in the conviction , which has grown with my growth and strengthened with my strength , that there is no alleviation for the sufferings of man - kind except veracity of thought and of action , and the resolute facing of the world as it is when the garment of make-believe by which pious hands have hidden its uglier features is stripped off .

Thomas Hazard	PERSON	-LRB-
1720	DATE	-
1798	DATE	-RRB- , a rich
Narragansett	ORGANIZATION	gentleman-farmer , the anti-slavery pioneer in his state ; and the present memoir is written and compiled by his grandson 's granddaughter , Miss
Caroline Hazard	PERSON	.


Thomas Hazard	PERSON	owed his sobriquet to the fact that he spent several terms at
New Haven College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first two - thirds of the present volume consist of a rapid narra - tive of his after-life and transactions , in which the writer sticks as closely as possible to original records , many of which are given in fac-simile .

		Chief of them is '' College
Tom	PERSON	's '' account-book a folio volume of two hundred pages , with entries -LRB- 1750-1790 -RRB- cov - ering the most active period of the diarist 's life .

		The jottings are fairly regular and minute , and they are supplemented here and there by notes pinned to the written pages , the whole affording a very good idea of the home life and economy of a
Narragan	LOCATION	- sett planter .

		Inferentially , we are shown some of the beauties and advantages of '' fiat '' money - which seems , however , in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, to have proved anything but a panacea for the ills it was meant to alleviate .


Rhode Island	LOCATION	issued paper money first in
1710	DATE	, and six other issues followed between that date and
1740	DATE	, when the outstanding bills of those dates began to be called '' old tenor . ''

		Naturally , in the existing state of things , the credit - money depreciated with amazing rapidity and to a ludicrous degree , and the alarming prices in '' Col - lege Tom 's '' account-book must be discounted ac - cordingly .

		In a memorandum of a horse-trade , for instance , we learn that one of the parties -LRB- combat - ants is the better word , perhaps -RRB- was to pay the other fifty-five pounds '' to boot . ''

		This seems pretty extravagant even in a horse-trade , until one learns that in
1740	DATE	one silver shilling meant twelve and a half paper shillings ; a fact that reduces the fifty - five pounds '' old tenor '' to the modest sum of four pounds eight shillings .

		Miss Hazard has given us an altogether capital book , full of solid information , and very readable withal .

		There are some instruc - tive cuts of old documents , bank-bills , etc. , and an appendix of one hundred pages , containing literal selections from `` College Tom 's '' papers .

		The superb typography calls for special mention .

		* the Arts and Crafts socialists , Messrs.
William Morris	PERSON	Exhibition Society .

		an -LRB- J
Walter Crane	PERSON	, haye organ ized their Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society to some purpose .

		If we mistake not , the first exhibition was opened in
1888	DATE	, at which time Mr.
Crane	PERSON	read his essay on '' The revival of Design and
Handi	PERSON	- craft , '' wherein is set forth the aims of the society .

		Since the organization of the society the members have held several exhibitions , at which , among oth - ers , the following papers have been read : ''
Tex	PERSON	- tiles , '' by
William Morris	PERSON	; '' Of Decorative Paint - ing and Design , '' by
Walter Crane	PERSON	; '' Stone and Wood Cauving , '' by
Somers Clarke	PERSON	; `` Furniture , '' by
Stephen Webb	PERSON	; Of Wall Papers , '' by
Walter Crane	PERSON	; `` Printing , '' by
William Morris	PERSON	and

		THE DIAL 23 Embroidery , '' by
May Morris	ORGANIZATION	; `` Of Book
Illustra	ORGANIZATION	- tion and Book Decoration , '' by
Reginald Blomfield	PERSON	; and '' On Designing for the Art of Embroidery , '' by
Selwyn Image	ORGANIZATION	.

		Believing that the time had come when the designer and craftsman should make known their identity , which had usually been con - cealed behind the firm of So-and-So and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, these exhibitions were opened that the real workers might be brought into touch with each other and with the public .

		It was thought that in this way the artist and the craftsman could more freely compare notes for their mutual improvement , and gain that recog - nition from their employers and the public which was their due .

		By the aid of new mechanical de - vices , and by that obnoxious commercial system called '' competition , '' the artisan had been reduced to a very unimportant personage ; art and art man - ufacture had been cheapened , while the consumer had come to look upon the whole matter in the light of a purely business proposition , and made price rather than quality his object .

		To quote a para - graph from Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's essay , this movement '' is a protest against that so-called industrial progress which produces shoddy wares , the cheapness of which is paid for by the lives of their producers and the degradation of their users . ''

		Each of the thirty-five essays that now make up the volume en - titled `` Arts and Crafts Essays '' is , as may be noted from those named , prepared by a specialist .

		Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	provides an introduction ; and from the appearance of the book , which is imported for the American market by Messrs.
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons , we must infer that to him also is due a large share of the credit for its excellent paper and typography , and its outside dress of Irish linen .

		A very graphic and entertaining , and withal informing , book is '' Aspects of Modern Oxford '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author does not give his name , but he rather affectedly styles himself `` A mere Don '' a piece of mock humility that reads very much as if he had written himself '' a mere Kaiser '' sr '' a mere Arch - bishop . ''

		When an
Oxford Fellow	ORGANIZATION	speaks thus lightly of his dignity it may be put down as morally certain that he would be the last man of his corps to allow others to do it .

		The little book contains 135 pages ; and in this modest space is contained a capital ac - count of the lighter phases of current life at the centre of `` port and prejudice , '' as
Gibbon	PERSON	styled his quon - dam
Alma Mater	PERSON	, written in a style savoring more of the brisk journalistic than the staid academic .

		The following extract from a chapter on '' Under - graduates '' may serve as a sample : '' Of the hun - dreds of boys who are shot on the
G. W. R.	PERSON	platform every
October	DATE	to be caressed or kicked by
Alma Mater	PERSON	, and returned in due time full or empty , it is only an insignificant minority who come up with the ostensible purpose of learning .

		Their reasons are as many as the colors of their portmanteaus .

		Brown has come up because he is in the sixth form at school , and was sent in for a scholarship by a

		head-master desiring an advertisement ; Jones , be - cause it is thought by his friends that he might get into the ` Varsity eleven ;
Robinson	PERSON	, because his father considers a university career to be a stepping - stone to the professions which it fortunately is not as yet .

		Mr.
Sangazur	PERSON	is going to
St. Boniface	LOCATION	be - cause his father was there ; and Mr.
J. Sangazur Smith	PERSON	well , probably because Ms father was n't .

		Altogether , they are a motley crew , and it is not the least achievement of the
University	ORGANIZATION	that she does somehow or other manage to impress a certain stamp on so many different kinds of metal '' a certain indefinable stamp , it may be added , of culture , or polish , or good-breeding , or whatever you choose to call it , that the grudging Philister resents , scolds at , sneers at , and even makes a feint of laughing at ; but which he , in fact , secretly chafes at and envies .

		The book is liberally and capitally illus - trated , and its tasteful typography merits special mention .

		Two little volumes of '' Studies of Studies of Travel Trave i -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by the late Pro- fa /
E. A. Freeman	PERSON	.

		\ , lessor Jfc 1 reeman are devoted , respect - ively , to ''
Greece	LOCATION	'' and ''
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		Their contents consist of short papers , written from ten to fifteen years ago , and contributed mainly to '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review . ''

		Miss
Florence Freeman	PERSON	has edited the collections , which are illustrated by a portrait of the author , and a pretty photogravure of the
Parthenon	LOCATION	.

		The volume on
Greece	LOCATION	takes us to
Athens	LOCATION	,
Marathon	ORGANIZATION	,
Tiryns	LOCATION	,
Argos	LOCATION	,
Mycenae	LOCATION	,
Corinth	LOCATION	,
Olympia	LOCATION	, and a few other places .

		The volume on
Italy	LOCATION	has to do mostly with spots rarely visited by the tourist , but of great historical or archaeological interest , such as Veil ,
Ostia	LOCATION	,
Norba	ORGANIZATION	, and
Segni	PERSON	.

		An ''
Iter	ORGANIZATION	ad
Brun	PERSON	- disium '' closes the volume .

		One 's first impression , especially in reading the Italian sketches , is that they are mostly about walls .

		Freeman 's architec - tural training gave him a peculiar interest in such things , and for finding sermons in stones he had probably no equal among his contemporaries .

		These sketches impress us with the immense extent of his knowledge of ancient history , written , as they were , impromptu and without books of reference .

		His fondness for
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's `` Lays '' also appears at many points .

		For one contemplating a journey in his footsteps , these compact little tomes will be found a guide of the utmost value , while the student of classical history may receive from them many a help - ful suggestion , as well as many a lesson in the art of compressing a whole chapter of knowledge within the limits of a paragraph .

		To the practical engineer 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, or to the man of science a
Life of Werner	ORGANIZATION	von
Siemens	ORGANIZATION	needs nothing in the way of justification or introduction .

		To the lay reader it may be said that the hook is not the ordinarily tedious life-record of a recluse of the laboratory or the lecture-room .

		In Dr. von
Siemens	ORGANIZATION	, the student and the inventor were supplemented by the man of action ; and his laurels , therefore , were largely won in grappling with practical difficulties .

		His narrative reads like a book of adventure .

		In his Introduction , Dr. von
Siemens	ORGANIZATION	expresses the hope that his book may prove instructive and stimulating to the coming generation , in that it shows how '' a young man , without inher - ited resources and influential supporters , nay , even without proper preliminary culture , may , solely through his own industry , rise , and do something useful in the world . ''

		The book is , all in all , one of the most notable productions of the past year ; and it goes without saying that no one interested in the progress of electrical science and of its practical application can afford to leave it unread .

		There is a fine frontispiece portrait of the author , whose face betokens in every line the true German Thdtigkeit , and is certainly not wanting in indications of true German Schroffheit a quality which Dr.
Siemens	ORGANIZATION	confessedly admired in others .

		Mr.
W. C. Coup	PERSON	- land 's translation is generally acceptable ; but it is not free from Germanisms .

		Mechanically , the vol - ume is a fine piece of bookmaking .

G. S. Merriam	PERSON	and published by Messrs.

Yale	ORGANIZATION	man , at least , should leave it unread .

		The different periods and phases of President
Porter	PERSON	's life are severally treated by writers chosen each for his or her special fitness for the topic .

		Miss
Sarah Porter	PERSON	writes of Dr.
Porter	PERSON	's '' Ancestry and Youth , '' Rev.
W. W. Andrews	PERSON	of his student-life at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, Prof.
G. P. Fisher	PERSON	of his '' Theological Opinions , '' President
Franklin Carter	PERSON	of his career as '' President of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, '' and so on .

		Two concise expository chapters , '' Dr.
Porter	PERSON	as a Philosopher '' and '' Dr.
Porter	PERSON	's Theory of Morals , '' are furnished by Prof.
George M. Duncan	PERSON	and Dr.
Rikizo Nakashima	PERSON	, respectively ; and there is a co - pious '' Bibliography '' by Mr.
J. Sumner Smith	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Porter	PERSON	was an estimable character , a man of much learning and of little originality , an acute reasoner on supplied premises , and the clearest of expositors .

		From the anecdotal portion of the memoir we may quote the following sketch of
George Eliot	PERSON	, whom Dr.
Porter	PERSON	met in
London	LOCATION	in
1853	DATE	: '' At that time she was thirty-five years old , with plain but inter - esting features , of a little above medium size , of a very quiet and almost timid bearing , most noticeable for her singularly refined voice , her clear thoughts , her choice yet by no means stilted diction , and above all for her fervid yet unaffected sensibility .

		She was free and affable with the family and guests , but unmistakably wore the air of a person preocupied with many engagements , and living apart in her own world of elevated thoughts and intense feeling . ''

		The volume contains two portraits of Dr.
Porter	PERSON	, and it ought to have an index .

		Glimpses of In llis '' ub - Coelum : A Sky-built an insubstantial Human World '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
A. P. Russell	PERSON	, author of `` A Club of One , '' `` Library Notes , '' etc. , has strayed -LRB- not alto - gether prosperously , we think -RRB- from his usual lit - erary province .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's sketch of an ideal society is not a logical development of an a priori theory of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, like the '' Republic '' of Plato , nor is it a compact piece of allegorizing fiction , like More 's `` Utopia . ''

		The society he describes strikes us .

		on the whole , as a rather valetudinarian affair , adjusted to the requirements of people with shaky nerves and east-wind susceptibilities .

		Sub-Ccelumite '' nerves and sympathies being too precious to be wasted , heads of fowls were lopped off by ingen - iously contrived guillotines . ''

		At table , '' The skilled carver , as he cut away the succulent flakes , was ex - pected deftly to show them in such light as would display their translucency and lustre . ''

		`` In Sub - Cffilum the people did not snore .

		They had trained themselves to avoid the disagreeable act '' though not , it seems , by the wearing of nocturnal clothes - pins .

		At the `` Retreats for Convalescents , '' among other soothing devices for promoting recovery . ''

		In - telligent monkeys climbed about in the trees , and suspended themselves by their tails . ''

		The style of the book is sententious to a fault , and there is a too - palpable effort at quaintness .

		We notice , too , occa - sional lapses not at all in accord with the usual fin - icalness of Sub-Ccelum standards ; for example , we learn that at banquets , when the chef appeared , `` Pledges were drank , and wine poured out in his honor . ''

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	says some clever things , how - ever , and his book is fairly readable ; but we prefer him in his '' Club Corner . ''

		The '' Essays Speculative and Sug - S estive '' o
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	have been reissued in a single hand - some volume by his English publishers , and the work is imported for sale in this country by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		This is probably the most important of the author 's several collections of mis - cellanea , and one can not re-read its contents without a renewed sense of the loss sustained by English letters at the time of his death .

		In this age of the specialist we need such men more than ever before ; we need them to preserve the tradition of general culture that we are in danger of losing altogether .

		Few men have ever so successfully lived in '' the whole , the good , and the beautiful '' as the English historian of the Italian Renaissance , who was at the same time the critic of so many phases of art and life .

		The work before us exhibits his critical faculty at its best , his trained judgment at its ripest .

		The group of essays on Style contain some of the best
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 25 writing upon that subject that has ever been done , and the essay on Realism and Idealism comes near saying the last word upon that vexed theme .

		The author 's eager and sympathetic grasp of the latest results of science are well illustrated in this volume , as well as his catholic appreciation of the newer tendencies of literature .

		The work is one to keep at hand and to ponder over ; it is suggestive in the sense of being a stimulus even more than a guide ; it is a treasure-house of critical comment and prin - ciple not easily to be exhausted .

		We have always thought Mr.
Henry ESSST	PERSON	''
James	PERSON	?

		.

		better essa y ist than novelist - The critical and analytical habit of mind with which he is so richly endowed have proved too self-assertive for the purpose of the story-teller .

		But the qualities of expression developed by this habit , although out of their proper place when used for the purposes of fiction , belong to the essay , and bestow upon it substance and value .

		The u Essays in
London	LOCATION	and Elsewhere , '' just published -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , form a volume rich in subtle observations and deli - cate critical shadings .

		The contents are a little ill - assorted , for they include sketches of foreign life , personal reminiscences , and literary criticism ; but each essay by itself -LRB- excepting a few too brief to be adequate -RRB- is a little masterpiece .

		The paper on
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	is one of the most lifelike presenta - tions of a spiritual personality to be found .

		The essay on
Lowell	LOCATION	, which combines the personal note with the note of objective criticism , is perhaps the finest appreciation we have of the finest of our latter-day Americans .

		The group of French writ - ers Flaubert , the Goncourt brothers , and '' Loti '' are handled with sure sympathy and real penetra - tion .

		Perhaps the Flaubert essay is the most notable of all .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	understands
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's passion for style , and helps others to understand how absorb - ing and masterful a thing it was .

		No one has , to our thinking , better than Mr.
James	PERSON	interpreted for English readers the leading aspects of recent French literary art .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		As We Go '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a volume of very brief essays by Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	.

		They deal mostly with the phases of human intercourse , and em - body many a bit of social criticism that strikes deeper than would at first appear .

		For instance , among the subjects that the author so lightly touches is that of the growing culture of women as contrasted with the indif - ference to culture on the part of men .

		The phenomenon has made a distinct impression upon Mr.
Warner	PERSON	as well it might and he recurs to its discussion more than once .

		For reading that is at once easy and suggestive , we commend these genial talks . ''

		The Out-Door World '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is the name given to a handbook for young collectors in natural history , the work of Mr.
W. Furneaux	PERSON	.

		The work is richly illustrated with sixteen colored plates and over five hundred cuts .

		The colored plates are very well done , and upon each of them a number of species are crowded .

		The work is one of the best of the sort that we have seen , but the species described are British , and hence in most cases the American boy or girl would search for them in vain .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	deserve hearty thanks for their tasteful library edition of the novels of
Alex	PERSON	- andre
Dumas	PERSON	.

		For many years , the only American editions of the great French novelist were so offensive in their appearance that lovers of books could with dif - ficulty be persuaded to take them into their hands .

		A translation of '' Olympe de Cleves , '' in two volumes , has just been added to the new edition .

		The publishers claim that it is the first publication of this particular romance in che English language , but this , we believe , is a mistake .

		The new edition of Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	's verses -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is neatly printed , includes all the hitherto published poems -LRB- except '' The Eloping Angels , '' which no one will miss -RRB- , and gives a portrait of the author .

		The poems have been rearranged , and are now headed by the noble group of elegies that commemorate Words - worth ,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	. ''

		The Prince 's Quest '' makes up a good third of the volume .

		We have praised Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's work more than once in these pages , and will now merely express a hope that no one will be deterred from making his acquaintance by the extravagant eulogies which injudicious friends of the poet contrived to get printed a few months ago .


Elizabeth Sheppard	PERSON	's '' Rumour , '' in two volumes , has been added to
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's reprints of that writer 's principal novels .

		Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	contributes a sympathetic introduction to the new edition , which also has frontispiece portraits of Beethoven and save the mark !


Louis Napoleon	PERSON	.

		Thackeray 's '' English Humorists '' and
Carlyle	PERSON	's ''
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- tor Resartus '' come to us from the same publishers , in a style that commends itself to quiet tastes .

		University extensionists and other teachers will find profit in an examination of Dr.
Andrew Stephenson	PERSON	's '' Syllabus of Lectures in European History from the Fall of the
Western Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	to the Death of Napoleon . ''

		The book is published by the author , at
Middletown	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	.

		The analysis of the subject is phil - osophical , and the divisions are well supplied with re - ferences .

		Indeed , the individual student , seeking to work up European history without the aid of an in - structor , could not easily find a better outline guide than this little work .

		Dr.
W. D. Halliburtou	PERSON	's `` The Essentials of Chem - ical Physiology '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is a text-book for the use of students , and is upon the plan of Professor
Schaefer	PERSON	's '' Essentials of Histology . ''

		The work includes an ele - mentary and an advanced course , and its pages bear the class-room stamp .

		Each lesson is provided with labora - tory exercises and demonstrations , and the work has many wood-cut illustrations .

		The title-page of a recent work published by Messrs.
Joel Munsell	PERSON	's Sons is so comprehensively descriptive of the book itself that we reprint it without comment .

		`` Journal of Colonel
George Washington	PERSON	, commanding a detachment of

Robert Din	PERSON	- widdie , Lieutenant-Governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	, across the

Ohio	LOCATION	.

		It comprises the history of marches , campings , and events , a skirmish with the French , and the death of their leader , de Junonville .

		The Journal fell into the hands of the enemy , who , in
1756	DATE	, printed 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, a version of it in French ; a new translation of this into English is here given in the absence of the original .

		To complete the history of the Expedition an appendix is added in the form of a diary , supplying an account of the battle of the
Great Meadows	LOCATION	and the capitulation of
Fort Necessity	ORGANIZATION	; the retreat of the army ; with copies of original muster and pay-rolls of the
Virginia	LOCATION	regi - ment , and other documents connected with this Expe - dition . ''

J. M. Toner	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Samuel Adams Drake	PERSON	, in '' The Making of Vir - ginia and the Middle Colonies , 1578-1701 '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , has constructed a volume intermediate between the school text-book and the history for the general reader .

		He has sought to fill out the bare outlines of the narra - tive so '' as to give the pupil something more than the dry bones '' and so to condense the tale '' as to put its essence without loss of vitality , in a few words , '' in which aims , seemingly so antagonistic , he seems to have been measurably successful .

		The book has many wood - cuts .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
December 25 , 1893	DATE	.

		The annual dinner of the
New England Society	ORGANIZATION	of this city has just taken place , with even more than the usual success from a popular point of view .

		The care - fully prepared speeches were given a page or more in several of the newspapers , the proceedings were re - ported in full , ` and portraits of the speakers have been displayed for our satisfaction , although perhaps to the chagrin of their alleged originals .

		These
New England	LOCATION	dinners are admirable things in their way .

		They also are interesting as showing how absolute perfection can be attained in the management of the reportorial side of an entertainment .

		In marked contrast with this af - fair was the complimentary dinner tendered to
Brander Matthews	PERSON	some two nights before by fifty of his asso - ciates in the world of letters and art , of which no re - port whatever has appeared in the daily newspapers .

		Yet I do not think any event of equal and similar im - portance has taken place here this season .

		Doubtless a large constituency of the press would have been in - terested in an account of the proceedings , but those concerned in the management of the dinner seem to have been indifferent about getting it reported , and so , quite characteristically of this great city , it was not re - ported .

		Ever since Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	accepted a professorship in literature at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	there has been a feel - ing among those familiar with his private as well as his public services to the cause of letters that some special recognition of these services should be made .

		This feel - ing culminated in a plan for the dinner just given .

		A committee was formed , composed of friends of Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	connected with each of his varied interests .

		For literature , Mr.
Warner	PERSON	, Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	, Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	, Mr.
Bunner	PERSON	, Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	, and Mr.
Bur	PERSON	- lingame , of the authors and editors , and Mr.
J. Henry Harper	PERSON	and Mr.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	, of the publishers , were called in .

		President Low of
Columbia	LOCATION	, Prof.
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	of
Harvard , Prof. Lounsbury of Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and Prof.
Sloane	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	, stood for education .

		Mr.
Joseph Jef	PERSON	- ferson , Mr.
Francis Wilson	PERSON	, Mr.
A. M. Palmer	PERSON	, and Mr.
Daniel Frohman	PERSON	represented the stage .

		Mr.
F. D. Mil	PERSON	- let , Mr.
J. Carroll Beckwith	PERSON	, and Mr.
Stanford White	PERSON	represented art ; while Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry Cabot	PERSON	Lodge appeared on the list as exponents of that Americanism for which Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	himself is so justly celebrated .

		These gentlemen and many others gathered around an immense table at
Sherry	ORGANIZATION	's , and made and listened to warm and well-deserved tri - butes to the character and achievements of their friend .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	presided and gave the opening address , to which Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	responded in a brief but very graceful , modest , and witty speech .

		Then followed speeches in order from Messrs.
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	, How - ells , Low ,
Clemens	PERSON	,
Gilder	PERSON	,
Sloane	PERSON	,
Frohman	PERSON	, and
Bram Stoker	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Bunner	PERSON	read a poem written for the oc - casion .

		The speakers appeared at their best , and ap - plause and laughter were constant .

		A souvenir of the occasion has been signed by all present , worded as fol - lows : `` To
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, by a few of the friends he has made , a few of the friends he has helped , and a few of the friends he has helped to make . ''

		Another event of considerable interest to the writing guild is the publication of the much talked of '' Liber Scriptorum '' or `` Book of the Author 's Club . ''

		The
Author 's Club	ORGANIZATION	celebrated its decennial
last winter	DATE	, and is in a most flourishing condition , but up to date it has been obliged to hire rooms for its meetings .

		To obtain a nucleus for a building fund , Mr.
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	suggested that the members of the club jointly write a book , sign their articles in each copy printed , and dis - pose of the edition at a fair profit above cost .

		After many experiences , some amusing and some quite pro- voking , the book is at last completed .

		There are two hundred and fifty-one copies printed , one of which re - mains the property of the club .

		The others are to be sold .

		In fact , most of them are already subscribed for .

		One hundred and nine members of the club have con - tributed poems or articles to the ''
Liber Scriptorum	PERSON	, '' and each contributor has signed his name at the end of his article in every copy of the boon .

		The articles will not be printed elsewhere , and no further editions of the vol - ume will be published .

		All the original manuscripts have been preserved , and as they are written on differ - ent sizes of paper , they are now being inlaid in uniform sheets , and will be bound up in volumes .

		They will then be sold to the highest bidder .

		The book itself is extremely interesting .

		The authors have not considered the necessities of any publication or market in writing their contributions .

		One readily sees , ~ in turning over the broad leaves , that for once they have written to please themselves .

		Hence all sorts of hobbies crop out , and especially is your funny man inclined to grow pa - thetic and your serious fellow to indulge in light humor .

		Novelists become poets , and vice versa .

		The printing has been done by Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	, himself a member of the club , on handmade paper bearing the club 's name as a water-mark .

		The binding has been specially de - vised for the book ; and head and tail pieces , vignettes , etc. , have been drawn by Mr.
Louis J. Rhead	PERSON	.

		Alto - gether '' Liber Scriptorum '' is unique .

		The past week has also been notable for the publica - tion of the first volume of Messrs. Funk & WagnalFs '' Standard Dictionary of the English Language . ''

		Orig - inally intended to be in one volume , the development of the work has made two necessary .

		It is now hoped to complete this undertaking by
May	DATE	of next year .

		A visit to the working-rooms of the dictionary , where a small army of editors and assistants are daily occupied , is quite interesting .

		All the processes of making a dic - tionary , from the first preparation of '' copy , '' through
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		ten or twelve proofs , may be observed seriatim .

		First and last , several hundred editors , specialists , and read - ers have been engaged upon the dictionary , which will contain , I am told , about seventy thousand more words than any work of the kind yet completed .

		Dr.
Funk	PERSON	is editor-in-chief , Prof.
Francis A. March	PERSON	consulting editor , Dr.
D. S. Gregory	PERSON	managing editor , and Messrs.
Bostwick	PERSON	,
Champlin	LOCATION	, and
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	associate ed - itors a staff which ensures faithful and accurate work .

		President
William R. Harper	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	supervises the department of '' Biblical Terms . ''

		The third edition of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's '' Life and Art of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	'' is now being printed by
Messrs. Mac - millan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A still more interesting announcement is that Mr.
Winter	PERSON	has commenced work on a '' Life '' of
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	, to be published by the same firm .

		A more congenial subject for author and public could not well be devised .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	also an - nounce '' The Dawn of Astronomy : A Study of the As - tronomy and
Temple	ORGANIZATION	Worship of the Ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	- ians , '' by
J. Norman Lockwood	PERSON	, F.R.S. .

		Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	, it will be remembered , is editor of `` Nature . ''

		This most fascinating subject has been treated in a thorough yet simple way , and an examination of the sheets leads me to believe that the book will rival Prof.
Charles A. Young	PERSON	's '' The Sun '' in popularity .

		It is likely to prove the most interesting contribution to astronomical science in several years .

		The author of '' The Captain of the Janizaries , '' Dr.
James M. Ludlow	PERSON	, is pastor of a church at Orange ,
N. J.	PERSON	, but is often seen in
New York	LOCATION	, where he belongs to some of the literary clubs .

		The recent charges of plagiarism made against the writer of a similar and more recently published historical romance have not been countenanced by Dr.
Ludlow	PERSON	, as I have reason to know , nor has he sought to '' advertise '' his book in this way . ''

		The Cap - tain of the Janizaries , a Story of the Times of Scander - beg and the Fall of
Constantinople	LOCATION	, '' was published in
1886	DATE	, and was an immediate success .

		The thousands who read and enjoyed this brilliant romance at that time , or who have read it since , will be loth to believe that any such advertising is in the slightest degree necessary .

		Dr.
Ludlow	PERSON	covered the field in his own fashion , and covered ic well .

		Signora
Duse	PERSON	has just appeared in
Berlin	LOCATION	as

		A collection of letters written by
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	to
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	has recently come into the possession of Mr.
Bentley	PERSON	, the
London	LOCATION	publisher .

		We hope they may soon see the light .

		An
International Congress of Journalists	ORGANIZATION	is expected to be held next year at
Antwerp	LOCATION	, where a meeting has just been had in reference to the matter , and a com - mittee to carry out the project has been named .

		The third session of the
Plymouth School of Applied Ethics	ORGANIZATION	is announced for
July	DATE	and
August	DATE	of this year .

		There will be the usual courses of lectures in the three departments of ethics , economics , and the history of re - ligions .

		Professor
Max Miiller	PERSON	has received from the
King of Siam	ORGANIZATION	an offer of sufficient funds to guarantee the con - tinuance of `` The Sacred Books of the East . ''

		The money will be used , in the first place , for printing a translation of the remaining portions of the
Buddhist Tripitaka	ORGANIZATION	.

		We make the following clipping from an exchange : '' It is reported that a leading Bostonian and a lover of solid literature has only with difficulty been prevailed upon to omit from his will a clause prohibiting his first heir from inheriting the bulk of his property if the said heir ' habitually reads newspapers . ' ''

		The new edition of the
Correspondence of Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, which Mr.
W. Aldis Wright	PERSON	has in hand , will , it is said , contain something like fifty new letters ; and Mr.
Edward Clodd	PERSON	has also been entrusted with some hitherto unpublished letters of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	for a magazine article .

		An English publisher will soon begin a new and com - plete translation of Tourgue ` nieff .

		There will be about ten or twelve volumes , including his novels and tales , '' The Memoirs of a Sportsman , '' '' Senilia , '' etc. .

		The translations are to be entirely new , and due to Mrs.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	.

		Introductions and notes are to be supplied .

		According to the
Paris	LOCATION	'' Figaro '' M. Daudet considers ''
Numa Roumestan	PERSON	'' his best novel .

		Other authors who have expressed a preference for their works are M. Cher - buliez for ''
Meta Holdenis	PERSON	, ''
M. Hale	PERSON	` vy for '' La Fam - ille `` Cardinal , '' and
M. Loti	PERSON	for '' De la Pitie ' et de la Mort . ''

		M. Zola says he has no preference except for certain pages in each of his books . ''

		After I have com - pleted a book , '' he says , '' it no longer exists for me .

		My books are like the graves of relatives and friends once very dear to me . ''

		In bequeathing to Balliol the copyright of his writ - ings , the late Professor
Jowett	PERSON	said : `` I desire that they may be republished from time to time as may seem expedient , and that the profits , if any , arising from the republication of them shall be invested from time to time , and the income thence accruing applied , in the first place , to the improvement or correction 6f them ; secondly , to the making of new translations or editions of great authors , or in any way assisting or advancing the study of Greek literature , and otherwise for the ad - vancement of learning . ''

		At
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, about a month ago ,
Congregation	ORGANIZATION	, by a large majority , passed a resolution declaring the estab -
28	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, lisbment of a final honor examination in English litera - ture and language .

		As to the main lines on which the new examination should be framed there seems to be a fairly general agreement .

		It may be safely predicted that care will be taken to award equal weight to litera - ture and language that a general knowledge of both will be required of all candidates , but that within these limits those who read for the school will be left free to devote themselves specially to one or the other of these two subjects .

		Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, in issuing the fourth edi - tion of his work on the
United States	LOCATION	, adds a new pref - ace from which we take the following : '' The writer can not send this fourth edition of his work to press without specially acknowledging the kindness of his American readers and reviewers , whose reception of a book which in some things contravenes cherished tra - ditions is a proof of American candor and liberality .

		Perhaps they have discerned , beneath the British critic of American history , the Anglo-Saxon who , to the Re - public which he regards as the grandest achievement of his race , desires to offer no homage less pure or noble than the truth . ''

		Seven books of the '' Anabasis '' are included in the edition , just published , by President
W. R. Harper	PERSON	and Dr.
James Wallace	PERSON	-LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work is done upon the familiar '' inductive '' plan of its pre - decessors in this series of classical text-books , and the presentation is very attractive , mechanically and other - wise .

		The same publishers send us a new edition of Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	's `` Latin Prose Compositions , '' revised by Mr.
J. E. Mulholland	PERSON	.

		From
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have ''
Livy	PERSON	, '' Books XXI .

		and XXII. , edited by Profes - sors
J. B. Greenough	PERSON	and
Tracy Peck	PERSON	; and '' The Be - ginner 's Greek Composition , '' by Messrs.
W. C. Collar	PERSON	and
W. G. Daniell	PERSON	. ''

		Poet-Lore , '' upon the occasion of its fifth anniver - sary , which comes with the beginning of the year , sends us a '' new-year 's greeting '' which gives a sketch of its career , its aims , and its successes .

		It makes some interesting promises for the coming year , including unpublished letters of
George Eliot	PERSON	, translations from
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and
Strindberg	LOCATION	, and a '' School of Litera - ture '' for the help of clubs and classes .

		The magazine is a little too obtrusive in its Browningism , and informs us that the special attention '' always accorded to Shake - speare and
Browning	PERSON	is a habit in which it will persist '' ; T > nt this one little fad may be forgiven a periodical that stands so steadfastly , and on the whole so sensibly , for good literature , and for the value of poetry in all the walks of life .

		Messrs.
Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	, in announcing their limited edition of
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' House of Life , '' send us the fol - lowing explanatory note : `` The one hundred and three sonnets and eleven lyrics with which
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	chose to build his
House	ORGANIZATION	of Life , are here set forth according to their obvious design .

		Those used in the volume of MDCCCLXX .

		are reproduced as they then appeared , not as they have appeared since in the volume of MDCCCLXXXI .

		The deplorable circum - stance is well known which led to the too sensitive with - drawal of one of the sequence and to the revision of others : a mistaken sacrifice of beauty to a mistakenly imposed ideal .

		The makers of this edition revert by choice to the poet 's original plan of work .

		As
The House of Life	ORGANIZATION	stood in
Rossetti	PERSON	's mind , so it stands , once again , in its innocence and perfection . ''

		We quote from '' The Athenaeum '' the following par - ticulars of two recent literary '' finds '' in
Germany	LOCATION	: '' The important ' Luther find ' made some time ago in the Rathsschulbibliothek at
Zwickau	LOCATION	moved the author - ities of the town to commission the discoverer of the
Lutherana	LOCATION	to explore and arrange the manuscript treas - ures of their library .

		No fewer than 3,000 letters of the Reformation period have been discovered .

		They are now catalogued and described , and can be consulted by historical students .

		The richness of the collection may be imagined from the fact that the letters are by 391 writers : 224 are from printers , 295 from ecclesias - tics and theologians , 349 from scholars , and 192 deal with mining .

		Nearly the whole of these letters were addressed to
Stephan Roch	PERSON	, the town clerk of
Zwickau	LOCATION	, who died in
1546	DATE	.

		The manuscript containing a large number of Meistergedichte , which was discovered in the
Town Library of Nuremberg	ORGANIZATION	, proves to be a genuine production of
Hans Sachs	PERSON	.

		The volume comprises four - teen hitherto unknown Meistergesdnge of the famous Meistersinger .

		BOOKS AND MAGAZINES AS BRIC-A-BRAC .

		A propos to the familiar question , What do `` society '' people read ?

		the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' presents some amusing information derived from a recent discus - sion of the subject in the '' Home and Society '' columns of a paper which circulates largely among the refined and educated classes of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	metropolis . ''

		From what was said there of the views and practices of those classes , it would appear that literature is mainly a thing to be ' arranged . ' '

		The arrangement of current litera - ture is indicative of the culture and social position of a modern household , ' and very naturally , therefore , ' a fashionable woman , who is in touch with the world , ' can - not be too careful in training her < parlor-maid or foot - man to arrange the small tables containing periodicals and magazines and the talked-of books of the hour . '

		We can not go into all the nice points relating to the ex - act minute of the day when the morning papers are to be replaced , in ' their own special resting place , ' by the evening journals , and the way in which the ' bits of light literature which are more or less discussed ' are to be placed ' one overlapping the other , leaving the titles free to be read . '

		It should be noted , however , that ' it looks well to have the Revue des Deux Mondes and some clever German publication -LSB- we suggest the Archiv fiir
Eisen	PERSON	- bahnweseri -RSB- added to the collection . '

		There was nowhere any suggestion that anything was ever to be actually - read , the chief end of books and magazines being to take their place becomingly among other bric-k-brac .

		We did not need to be assured that < even children brought vip in such an atmosphere ' are different from those who have never had the advantage of a correct arrangement of literature .

		That we coiild have believed on a-priori grounds . ''

		PROCEEDINGS OF THE AUXILIARY CONGRESSES .

		The proceedings of sevei-al of
last summer	DATE	's Congresses are finding their way into print , pending the decision of the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	to provide for their com - plete publication .

		The work of the
Religious Congress	ORGANIZATION	is now appearing and promises to be a commercially successful venture .

		The proceedings of the
Congress of Representative Women	ORGANIZATION	are announced for early pub - lication in two large volumes .

		The Educational and Philological proceedings will appear under the auspices of the societies having them in charge .

		Meanwhile the officers of the World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	have circu - lated an appeal for the aid of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, giving a
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 29 number of good reasons why the work should be under - taken at public expense .

		The last and most cogent of these reasons is thus stated : '' The true international character of these Congresses , and the direct and active participation of the Government of the
United States	LOCATION	in convening them , has given them a character far above and beyond any private or local enterprise .

		The ex - pectation that the proceedings would be printed and distributed by this
Government	ORGANIZATION	to the other nations which have participated in the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	was expressed in some of the earlier publications rela - tive to this work sent to foreign countries by the De - partment of
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is therefore deemed eminently proper to ask the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	to pro- vide for the printing of the proceedings of the several Congresses as public documents , to be sent to the libraries of the different States and
Nations	ORGANIZATION	, and their leading colleges , universities and other public institutions , where they would be accessible to students of human progress in all its various departments , and would be reproduced in a multitude of forms for the information of the peo - ple of our own and other lands . ''

		A SUMMARY OF TYNDALI/S CHARACTER . ''

		The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' thus sums up the character of Professor Tyndall : '' A headlong temperament , however , is by no means always , or perhaps often , a temperament that can be called disagreeable ; and Dr.
Tyndall	PERSON	was both liked and loved by a very large circle of friends .

		His close asso - ciation for many years with
Carlyle	PERSON	was not likely to have the result of moderating his language , and in his fam - ous controversy with the
Commissioners of Irish Lights	ORGANIZATION	a softer and wilier tongue would have made more cer - tain of the victory .

		He has been blamed because he erected a screen on his property at Hindhead .

		But if which is quite conceivable he found the screen not so ugly as the people and the sights it shut out , who shall blame him ?

		And for the last seven years he had been in the habit of saying things about Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	which caused Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's followers to exhibit the convulsions of fish just extracted from the water .

		Per - haps some of these things were not said with perfect wisdom ; but , as has been observed , it was impossible for Dr.
Tyndall	PERSON	to be mealy-mouthed .

		And when , as an Irishman , as a scientific observer accustomed to con - nect cause and effect , and as one who felt in common with the vast majority of men of brains and education , he saw a statesman endeavoring to damage , if not to ruin , his country he said so . ''

		Thus in many ways Dr.
Tyndall	PERSON	was one of the most characteristic figures of his time , even if he some - times represented its foible as well as its forte .

		A man of wide knowledge and wide interest , a hard player as well as a hard worker , poles asunder from the popular conception of a savant as a recluse who only leaves his study to take a walk in the goloshes on the pavement , he took , at least as long as health was granted , most things ' with a frolic welcome , ' and those which he could not welcome in a hearty posture of fight .

		Others in dif - ferent classes , or even in his own class , may have had deeper or subtler intellectual insight , a purer style , a greater knowledge of literature and other non-scientific things .

		But few had a healthier , a more vigorous , or a kindlier spirit , and very few indeed had such a gift of easily understanded exposition in a day when all things are supposed to be capable of being expounded to the people . ''

		61 THE REPOET ON SECONDARY EDUCATION .

		To at least one class of thoughtful persons the advent of the new year brings much encour - agement .

		The publication , by the
United States Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, of the Report of the Com - mittee on
Secondary School Studies	ORGANIZATION	, appointed by
the National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	at the annual meeting held in the
summer of 1892	DATE	, is an event of capital importance to educators , and brings with it the promise of many long - needed reforms .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	in question , consisting of ten members , with President
Eliot	PERSON	as chairman , undertook to consider the entire subject of secondary education , for the pur - pose of pointing out the defects in our existing systems of instruction , and of indicating the needed reforms .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, in pursu - ance of this aim , determined to organize Con - ferences , of ten members each , upon the follow - ing subjects : 1 ,
Latin	LOCATION	; 2 ,
Greek	LOCATION	; 3 , English ; 4 , Other Modern Languages ; 5 , Mathematics ; 6 , Physics ,
Astronomy	LOCATION	, and
Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	; 7 ,
Natural History	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Biology , including Botany , Zoology , and Physiology -RRB- ; 8 , History ,
Ci \ jil Government	ORGANIZATION	, and Political Economy ; 9 ,
Geog	PERSON	- raphy -LRB- Physical Geography , Geology , and Me - teorology -RRB- .

		Having made a selection of ninety experienced educators for these Conferences , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	prepared for their consideration a list of questions and topics for discussion , covering all the vital points of both theory and practice .

		Their work thus outlined , the Con - ferences met , a little over a year ago , and held sessions of three days each .

		From these ses - sions reports were drawn up and submitted to the
Committee of Ten	ORGANIZATION	.

		This
Committee	ORGANIZATION	then met , digested and summarized the nine reports , and prepared its own report from the materials thus furnished .

		The publication now before us includes the Report of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	and the nine reports of the Conferences .

		It rep - resents the best judgment of a hundred picked educators upon a great variety of subjects , and thus bears an authority beyond that which has ever before attached to an educational docu - ment published in this country and dealing with our own educational problems .

		By far the most striking feature of these re - ports is the unanimity with which their main conclusions were reached .

		Two of the Con - ferences presented minority reports , and one member of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	felt constrained to do likewise ; but these dissentient opinions re - late to a few points only , and leave the general agreement but little impaired .

		When we con - sider the great differences in practice that ob - tain in different sections of the country , it was 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, to be expected that the opinions expressed in the Conferences would exhibit many an irree - oncileable divergence .

		Instead of this -LRB- to quote from the document -RRB- '' the nine reports are characterized by an amount of agreement which quite surpasses the most sanguine anticipa - tions . ''

		One important and far-reaching illus - tration of this agreement may be given .

		It is a view commonly held by persons of consider - able intelligence that fitting for college is one thing , and general education quite another .

		Consequently , a large proportion of high-school programmes provide distinct courses for these two objects , courses distinct not only in sub - ject-matter -LRB- which they probably should be -RRB- but in the methods of instruction employed .

		To get an expression of opinion upon this point , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	put the following question to the Conferences : '' Should the subject be treated differently for pupils who are going to college , for those who are going to a scientific school , and for those who , presumably , are go - ing to neither ? ''

		The answer came in no un - certain accents , being an absolutely unanimous negative .

		In other words , '' ninety-eight teach - ers , intimately concerned either with the actual work of American secondary schools , or with the results of that work as they appear in stu - dents who come to college , unanimously declare that every subject which is taught at all in a secondary school should be taught in the same way and to the same extent to every pupil so long as he pursues it , no matter what the prob - able destination of the pupil may be , or at what point his education is to cease . ''

		The signifi - cance of this statement needs no explanation .

		It should once for all upset a superstition that has operated , and still operates , to complicate school programmes , and to provide one set of students with a training inferior to that re - ceived by others , in the mistaken hope of being helpful to them .

		Of course , this decision is only another way of saying that education is the business of the educator ; but even so ob - vious a truth as that , while admitted in the ab - stract , is often denied in the concrete by the well-meaning but misguided persons who prate about what they call '' practical '' education .

		The moderation of the demands made by the Conferences is another noteworthy feature of this report .

		Educators are apt to attach so much importance to their several specialties as to make for them claims impossible to meet in the aggregate .

		It was feared by many that so much would be asked as to make reform seem impracticable .

		But , so far from this being the case , it is found , upon tabulation of the results , that to concede all the demands of all the Con - ferences would burden the high-school course with but fifty per cent more work than it can be expected to undertake .

		This being the case , it is obviously easy to compress the revised course within working limits by slightly reduc - ing the demands of the Conferences , and by allowing the elective principle to have some play .

		How easily this may be done , without seriously impairing the value of the recom - mendations , is clearly shown by the specimen courses formulated in the Report of the Com - mittee .

		But to accomplish the much-needed reforms , one thing is absolutely essential .

		Much of the work now done in the high schools must be put into the elementary years , and place must be made for it by a more rational treatment of the elementary subjects .

		Unless school boards and superintendents are prepared to do this , they might as well attempt to do nothing .

		The glaring fact in our elementary education is that the American child , as com - pared with the French or German child , loses two years somewhere between the ages of six and fourteen .

		These two years are mainly wasted upon arithmetic and formal grammar ; and our report indicates very accurately the points at which the knife must be applied .

		By suitable excisions , joined with scientific meth - ods of instruction , those two years may be saved to the child .

		The Report also shows very distinctly what should be done with them .

		Work in elementary science , the beginnings of algebra and geometry , ancient history , and the introduction of Latin or a modern language at the age of twelve , are the suggestions made ; and without the courage to adopt them there is little hope of accomplishing much in the way of reform .

		We have admitted that the elective princi - ple may possibly be allowed some play in the high school .

		But we believe that it should be accepted with great caution , and closely guarded against abuse .

		In this respect we think that the tendency of the Report is to countenance a dangerous latitude .

		It is suggested , for ex - ample , that the colleges might accept as a qual - ification for admission a stated amount of work done in a specified number of subjects , with lit - tle or no regard to the selection of those sub - jects .

		Thus , '' every youth who entered college would have spent four years in studying a few subjects thoroughly ; and , on the theory that all the subjects are to be considered equivalent in educational rank for the purposes of admis -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 sion to college , it would make no difference which subjects he had chosen from the pro- gramme he would have had four years of strong and effective mental training . ''

		We are glad that one member of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	dis - sented so strongly from this arid similar pas - sages that he felt bound to make a minority report . ''

		All such statements , '' says this dis - senter , '' are based upon the theory that , for the purposes of general education , one study is as good as another , a theory which appears to me to ignore philosophy , psychology , and the science of education .

		It is a theory which makes education formal , and does not consider the nature and value of the content . ''

		Some studies , such as the ancient or modern lan - guages , the English language and literature , mathematics , and physical science , must be treated as absolutely essential , and the courses must be so framed that no student , by any sort of election or substitution , can escape them .

		In this matter the position of the minority re - port seems to us impregnable .

		The document now under discusssion is so carefully considered and so rich in suggestions that many pages of THE DIAL would be re - quired to do it justice .

		We can , at present , only note in the briefest way a few of its special features .

		At every possible point it places em - phasis upon the fact that without competent teachers the best of systems is valueless .

		There is no doubt that the schools of this country need good teachers much more than they need good courses or anything else .

		That the studies in - cluded in a course should work together , and that each subject should contribute to the others , are points frequently urged in this Report , and can not be urged too often .

		History and liter - ature and natural science should go hand in hand , and all should give training in the use of the English language .

		Especially should this latter aim be furthered by all foreign language work .

		Good English , spoken and written , should be demanded upon all occasions .

		As for translation into English , the following , from the report of the Latin Conference , is the law and the prophets : '' The student should be taught to regard translation , not as a means of finding out what his author has said , but as , on the one hand , a way of making it clear to his instructor that he has understood , and , on the other , an exercise in expression , a literary exercise , in his own tongue . ''

		In modern no less than in classical language work , the ability to read is , of course , the main object ; and this is emphatically proclaimed by the Conference upon that subject .

		Much stress is laid upon the necessity of laboratory work in all science instruction , but no countenance is given to the notion that pupils in the laboratory are `` en - gaged in rediscovering the laws of Nature . ''

		It is pregnantly suggested that not science alone , but history and other subjects , need ap - paratus and the introduction of methods akin to those used in the laboratory .

		No provision is made for drawing as a separate study ; but this is with the understanding that drawing is , like writing , to be early begun , and used freely in all the stages of education .

		The suggestion that the study of civil government should be comparative is wise , as is also the suggestion that physiology should be studied at a very late period in the course .

		It is also far better to devote a full year -LRB- as recommended -RRB- to either botany or zoology -LRB- the former being preferable -RRB- than to give a half-year to each , as is so fre - quently done .

		We might go on indefinitely approving of the specific recommendations of the Report , but enough has been said to show how comprehensive and practical a document it is , and how thoroughly it stands for the accepted principles of scientific pedagogics .

		On the other hand , we are compelled to single out two or three features of the Report for ad - verse criticism .

		The English Conference , for example , almost ignores the historical study of English literature .

		While it is true enough that '' the mechanical use of ' manuals of liter - ature ' should be avoided , and the committing to memory of names and dates should not be mistaken for culture , '' it is also true , in our opinion , that the following suggestion does not offer an adequate treatment of the subject : '' In the fourth year , however , an attempt may be made , by means of lectures or otherwise , to give the pupil a view of our literature as a whole , and to acquaint him with the relations between periods . ''

		We can not concur with the recom - mendation of the Conference on history to omit economics from the high-school course .

		The incidental instruction in economic topics pro- posed as a substitute will not do .

		No science whose scope and subject-matter are as strictly defined as are those of economics can possibly be imparted by such haphazard and desultory instruction .

		And there is absolutely nothing more important for the graduate of an Ameri - can high school to know than the elements of a science of which the practical problems will confront him at every period of his life , and of which ignorance will cost him dear both as a man and a citizen .

		The Conference on physics , 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, .

		chemistry , and astronomy includes in its report one resolution which we believe to be indefens - ible .

		Chemistry is made to precede physics , although it is admitted that this order '' is plainly not the logical one . ''

		The only reason given for the resolution is that physics should have the benefit of as much mathematics as possible , and for this reason should come late in the course .

		Fortunately , we have in this case a minority report which might have been made more forcible than it is , and which will convince most readers that the position of the majority is untenable .

		Fortunately , also , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	has , in the construction of its tenta - tive programmes , ignored this unhappy recom - mendation , and restored physics to its proper place as a necessary preparation for the study of chemistry .

		On the whole , much good may be expected to result from the work of the Conferences .

		The Report is printed as a Government docu - ment , and , as such , will be freely circulated .

		It should get into the hands of every serious teacher in the country .

		Its recommendations will , if generally carried out , result in a system combining uniformity and elasticity in happy proportions .

		They make for good teaching in the essentials , and they do not make for rigidity .

		It is probably fortunate that local initiative in educational matters counts with us for so much as it does .

		Centralization has its advantages , but it has also its evils .

		When it operates to reduce a system to a condition of mechanical uniformity , regulating the activity of its teach - ers in the minutest detail , prescribing for them methods and imposing upon them text-books , it becomes a curse rather than a blessing , for it suppresses the individuality of the teacher , and thus strikes at the root of all vital effort towards the inculcation of knowledge .

		The Report of the
Committee of Ten	ORGANIZATION	has no such ob - ject in view .

		It seeks to stimulate rather than to repress endeavor ; it is meant to be followed in the spirit rather than in the letter .

		It can - not well fail to exert a far-reaching and an enduring influence upon American education .

		THE `` STAR '' SYSTEM IN PERIODICALS .

		Even an unobservant reader must have noticed a change which in the last few years has come over the spirit of that form of periodical generally known as the Review .

		Two successive steps have helped to transform the dignified , impersonal review of thirty years ago into the decidedly personal , wide - awake , not to say flippant , magazine of to-day .

		The first innovation substituted signed for unsigned articles .

		The second introduced the system of so - licited contributions , or what might be called the aggregation of great names on the title-page .

		The editor , nowadays , scans with a journalistic eye the horizon of passing events , and , sending direct to the chief hero in each day 's drama , requests him to tell the world what he has done , through the medium of his review , whose check he begs to enclose .

		Thirty years ago , we read an anonymous review by
John Smith	PERSON	on
General Jones	ORGANIZATION	's famous march to the .

		sea .

		Ten years ago , we read
John Smith	PERSON	's signed article on the same subject .

		To-day we read
General Jones	ORGANIZATION	's article , '' How I Marched to the Sea . ''

		As the new departure seems to be a financial suc - cess , nothing more need be said to justify it from the publisher 's point of view .

		It can not be denied that the interest of the majority of people to-day is centred in the newspaper : their talk is about men of newspaper fame partisan leaders , popular preach - ers , socialists , reformers , or society stars .

		It only required a shrewd business man to see that that mag - azine would be most popular which should treat only of those topics that fill the papers , in articles writ - ten by the very men of whom the papers are talking .

		By making itself over , as it were , into a bright , crisp , superior sort of monthly newspaper , the re - view assures itself of a reading public .

		Nor is the benefit all on the publisher 's side .

		It is most plausibly asserted , that what this bustling world of readers wants is , not a long , exhaustive , and exhausting essay , by an outsider , but a short , clear , telling summary of events to date , by the man who knows most about them .

		As the review editor skilfully puts it , Which is better reading , the description of a political contest written by a bystander , or a vivid account of the encounter from the participants inside the ring ?

		a correspondent 's description of a battle , or the commanding gen - eral 's ?

		In short , is it better to get your informa - tion second-hand , or straight from the the fountain - head ?

		Yet this argument is specious .

		By degrees the reader becomes conscious of certain drawbacks among the many advantages of the new system .

		Its two marked features are that the articles are solicited , and that many of the authors are not writers .

		Each of these brings about results not altogether pleasing .

		In the first place , if contributions are solicited , they have to be published .

		Under the old regime , .

		an editor 's chief duty was rejection ; and rejections he sometimes made with a high and mighty hand .

		But if one , by immense exertion , secures the pro- mise of an article from the Sultan of
Turkey	LOCATION	on '' What I know about Harems , '' and announces its publication in the blackest of headlines , one can scarcely refuse to print it when received , or ask its
august	DATE	author to revise .

		An adroit editor would probably find for himself some loop-hole of escape , did the noble author know more about harems than ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 could well appear on the pages of an American mag - azine .

		But we may be sure that the article would never be rejected , or amended , simply because its author chose to know nothing about harems , or knew only what was trite and tiresome .

		It may often happen , too .

		that an article is asked for at a time when a great man has other things to do , and that accordingly we do not get his best , however flattered he may be at being recognized as the spokesman of his party .

		We may be sure that the author of a new Tariff Bill cares more for its passage than he does to explain it in six maga - zine pages .

		Else why should some of these much advertised articles be as tasteless and formal as a school-boy 's essay ?

		unless , indeed , that other pain - ful suggestion be true , that they are from the facile pens of private secretaries , and only signed with the great name .

		But , beside these difficulties inherent in the so - licited contribution , the striking fact remains that the majority of the writers , made up of the prom - inent men of the time , are not writers at all , either by profession or experience .

		For the odds always are , that the man accustomed to handle men and things will not be able to handle words as well .

		To be sure , the theory is advanced that he who has anything worth the telling will find a way to tell it ; and there are some conspicuous examples , like
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, to prove it .

		Nevertheless there is something called literary art ; and a very brave man , one finds , may tell a very poor story .

		That Workingman Jones organized , and carried to a suc - cessful close , the renowned and picturesque strike on the
Arizona	LOCATION	Central Railroad is no proof that he will not make a lamentable failure in trying to tell us how he did it .

		Aside from this lack of literary skill , for which a man eager to impart information may be pardoned , there is another difficulty lying across his path .

		The leading men of any calling have their attention so completely absorbed by its countless details , that for them to give a clear and concise description of it is almost impossible .

		They live too much in the in - tense , white light of their subject to see its proper proportions , and relation to the surrounding objects .

		To the distinguished Professor Pterodactyl , by far the most interesting and important detail of
Paleon	LOCATION	- tology is the discussion now waging between him and Professor Trilobite , as to what animal once owned the second toe , which has just been found in the Lower Miocene of
Wyoming	LOCATION	.

		To us , the unlearned `` general readers , '' the only interesting things in Paleontology are a few general principles which to Professor Pterodactyl are but the a , b , c 's of his science , and worthy of mention only in primers .

		The writer who is primarily something else , is too apt to assume that his readers understand those de - tails which to him are a matter of course , and expends his energy on such points of special importance as at the time happen to be of immediate concern to himself .

		Notwithstanding all this , it would seem that from these new writers we ought to get a freshness of information , a spiciness of authentic gossip , else - where unattainable .

		From the men who are mak - ing history , may we not expect the most informing glimpses of how it is made ?

		And yet the candid reader must confess , it is seldom that we get it .

		When one comes to think about the matter , how - ever , it becomes plain that the man in authority , the man most deeply interested in any affair , is just the one who can not reveal secrets , or lay bare the idiosyncracies of his associates .

		If he is deeply in - terested , he can not be non-partisan .

		If he be the Silver King or the Gold Bug , his opinions must have that proper metallic ring which his followers expect .

		If the Democratic Senator from
Alaska	LOCATION	gives us an article on the '' Leaders of the Demo - cratic Party , '' he may be a mine of exactly such in - formation as the public is longing for such as , how his worthy colleague has lately lost his political grip in the
State of Alaska	ORGANIZATION	, and with it his once brilliant chances for the Presidency ; and yet he can not tell us all this , both because he knows his colleague per - sonally , and because he has political ambitions of his own .

		A freedom of speech , such as would be al - lowed the most obscure newspaper reporter , would involve the great leader in a network of criticism , and hand him over helpless to his enemies .

		So he must remain tongue-tied on those very subjects of which he knows more than anyone else .

		This , indeed , must be the reason why so many of these much-heralded special articles have the effect of a mere official report , from which everything per - sonal or interesting has been cut out , leaving only such items as the managers think it wise the public should know .

		After all , we are forced to admit that a title-page , though it includes the Master of the Knights of Labor , the Chairman of the
Senate Committee	ORGANIZATION	on the Tariff , the Leader of the French Radicals , the General of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	, and Queen
Liliuok	PERSON	- alani , may , like some gaudy circus-posters , promise much and produce little .

		JAPANESE METAPHOR AND SIMILE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the course of an article in the
December	DATE	''
Atlan	PERSON	- tic '' on `` The Eternal Feminine , '' relating chiefly to Japanese art and Japanese women , the author , Mr.
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	, gives his readers to understand , with circumstance and citation , that metaphors and allegories are practically unknown to the Japanese language , and -LRB- quoting Professor
Chamberlain	PERSON	-RRB- , '' incapable of so much as explanation to Far-Easte .

		rn minds . ''

		This is cer - tainly a little staggering to those of us who are familiar with current theories as to the part that metaphor plays in the formation of language .

		How are we to reconcile these discordancies ?

		I have before me a pamphlet , distributed as a tract among the members of the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	of 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, the recent World 's Fair , entitled '' Outlines of the Ma - hayana as taught by Buddha , '' purporting to be written by a Japanese in Japanese , and to be translated by others of the same nation into English , and the trans - lation is a quaint and graceful piece of English , too .

		The imprimatur , also in Japanese , is ''
Asaknsa	LOCATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, 26th Year of Meiji -LRB- 1893 -RRB- . ''

		A hasty reading reveals more than a dozen formal similes in the thirty odd pages of this little composition .

		Two theories , I suppose , may be advanced to explain away the presence of these similes : one , that the trans - lators put them there to please the vulgar
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	taste ; the other , that the author put them there for much the same reason .

		Otherwise we must infer that the Japanese mind also delights in analogy , especially when it is formal and conscious .

		But is there , then , a race that knows not the penetrative imagination ?

		And is there a language that always inserts the term of com - parison , in which simile never deepens to metaphor ?

		Perhaps Professor
Chamberlain	PERSON	and Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	wish us to understand that only metaphors involving some degree of personification are banished from
Japan	LOCATION	.

		I am struck with the wholesomely objective air of most of the similes in the pamphlet to which I have referred .

		Each is a picture in itself . ''

		The sound of a large bell reaches far and wide , but the bell must be rung ; the doctrines of a great sage are by no means restricted to a small district , but opportunities for their propagation must be utilized . ''

		`` This ... fallacious view ... may be likened to the effort of binding the moon upon the water with the hair of tortoises . ''

		Another heresy is << likened to the attempt of making a ship sail on a plain . ''

		Another '' may be compared to the action of the ignorant monkey that tries to catch the image of the moon upon water . ''

		`` Heaven and hell are but waves in the great sea of the universe . ''

		A language void of personification would be the happy concomitant of an objective and purely naturalistic art , and of a race seeking Anatman non-individuality . ''

		DIALECTAL SURVIVALS FROM SPENSER .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As a student of language , I have always been inter - ested in observing provincialisms and dialectal peculiar - ities .

		It is a fact long since pointed out that many of these peculiarities are survivals from earlier periods of our literature .

		I once took occasion to compare some of our modern dialect writers with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and in a short time found examples of parallels for about forty words and expressions not now in good use .

		In read - ing the first two books of Spenser 's '' Faery Queene '' not long since , I jotted down the following examples : Kilt , as the participle of kill , rhyming with guilt and spilt .

		His chosen people purg 'd from sinful guilt With pretious blood , which cruelly was spilt On cursed tree , of that unspotted
Lam	PERSON	, That for the sinnes of al the world was kilt . ''

		Chaw , in its three forms , occurs in the two quotations next given : '' And next to him malicious Envy rode Upon a ravenous wolfe , and still did chaw Between his cankred teeth a venomous tode , That all the poison ran about his chaw ; But inwardly he chawed his owne maw . ''

		And the line : `` And chawing vengeaunce all the way I went . ''

		Chaw was in good use much later than
Spenser	PERSON	.

		In the fourth line quoted above , chaw is the noun which is modified through the influence of the French joue into jaw .

		Fift and sixl , still common with ignorant people , oc - cur in the tenth canto of the first book : '' The fift had charge sick persons to attend ... The sixt had charge of them now being dead . ''

		Of course the h does not occur in the Anglo-Saxon form of these words .

		Pore , a pronunciation of poor often heard , is found in these lines : '' Whose welth was want , whose plenty made him pore , Who had enough , yet wished ever more . ''

		This spelling of the word is found frequently in ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	. ''

		It is a shortened form of the Old French povre , which becomes in Modern French pauvre .

		Ketch for catch occurs in this line : '' To ketch him at a vauntage in his snares . ''

		In another passage , ketch of the first edition -LRB- rhyming with wretch -RRB- is supplanted by light upon in the second .

		Divelish , in the expression '' divelish yron engin , '' can be matched in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		Examples of afeard , with a variety of spellings , can be given from
Langland	LOCATION	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and Shake - speare .

		Here is one from the eleventh canto of the first book of `` The Faery Queene '' : '' A flake of fire , that , flashing in his beard , Him all amazed , and almost made afeard : The scorching flame sore swinged all his face . ''

		I do not doubt that the influence of the \ rordfear has been great in retaining this pronunciation of afraid among uneducated people .

		The quotation last given contains another word that must be noticed swinged .

		Swinge for singe is still heard .

		An additional d occurs in vild in : '' And sold thy selfe to serve Duessa vild . ''

		The adjective vylde and the adverb vildly are found in * the third canto of the first book .

		This excrescent d is - not uncommon after I in words like alder , Anglo-Saxon air , and after n in words like sound , French son , Latin sonus .

		In the following line the metre requires contrary to > be accented on the second syllable : `` To be contrary to the worke which ye intend . ''

		As it is also in '' Hamlet '' : '' Our wills and fates do so contrary run . ''

		And Milton : '' And with contrary blast proclaims most deeds . ''

		And the old nursery rhyme : ``
Mary	PERSON	,
Mary	PERSON	, quite contrary . ' ''

		ART AND ETHICS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read , in your issue of
Dec. 1	DATE	, a very pleasing and suggestive paper on Art and Ethics by Prof.
John G. Dow	PERSON	; and it is with no desire to criticize that writer that I would try to indicate more clearly a distinction at which he , perhaps from a lack of space , hardly more than hinted .

		Ethics , as I understand the matter , has two points
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 of relationship with Art .

		The first relationship is that with the single work poem , painting , statue , or mu - sical composition ; the second is that with many pic - tures , poems , musical compositions , or statues .

		In the first relationship , the office of Ethics is merely that of determining whether or not the work of art produces pleasant feelings ; in the second , it is that of determin - ing whether or not the effect of the aesthetic feelings in the formation of character is good .

		The first question involves methods and results proximate in character ; the second , methods and results remote in effect .

		A work of art is complete in itself .

		It needs noth - ing to interpret it or make its effects greater .

		It is unlike a machine or a work of science ; the dis - tinction between these and works of art being that whereas the work of art has for its aim the production of one single pleasurable feeling or state of conscious - ness , and that immediately and directly , the machine aims at indirectly and remotely serving in the produc - tion of pleasures .

		If we compare a work of art with a didactic work we shall discover the same difference : one directly causes emotions of the highest order , the other remotely serves some utilitarian end .

		The meth - ods show a similar difference .

		The aim of art being that of directly causing a pleasurable feeling or emotion to come into consciousness , it would be impossible for a work of art to produce an unpleasant feeling as the to - tality of its effect ; but the machine or didactic work may produce unpleasant or even painful feelings , and yet the ends will justify the means .

		By this law technique becomes the work of the arti - san ; the selecting and grouping , the work of the artist .

		This would in no way make technique any the less nec - essary , or the demand for technical perfection any the less distinct ; it would only serve to emphasize the fact that technique and art are not to be confounded .

		Tech - nique is but the handmaid of art ; it is , and must be , mechanical , for it is the means to an end ; but the more perfect the means , other things being equal , the better is the end attained .

		To be a master of technique in verse , to be able to put ideas into beautiful forms , can by no means make poets of even the best of versifiers ; for with the mastery of words and images there is lack - ing in their work the complete harmonious concept of beauty , the concept which as a whole is capable of pro- ducing aesthetic feeling .

		The more nearly they embody such a concept in their works , the more nearly they be - come poets ; and where such a concept is so embodied we have the aesthetically pleasant feeling and the poem .

		On the other hand , given beautiful ideas , poetical ideas , with imperfect technique , and the ideas will not appeal to the mind with the force in which they should .

		The aesthetic effect is lessened by the faults of technique , of expression .

		Those who exalt technique , fine-word hunt - ing , beautiful single sayings or ideas , concepts , to the position of true art , must ever feel that there is a some - thing higher .

		They exalt harmony of sound and of single themes to the scale in perfection held by a
Chopin Mazurka	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the finger of Apollo without Apollo ; the eye of the eagle without the soaring wings .

		The other point of relationship of Ethics and Art is in the educational element . ''

		Those who have dreamed will dream ; those who have drunk will drink , '' says Hugo ; and those who have had aesthetic feelings from works of art will think and dream in art as those works make them think and dream .

		Art can not make use of unpleasant feelings except by shrouding them in those that are pleasant ; and the height of the pleasure is to be measured by the height of the feeling induced .

		The higher aesthetic feelings are made more possible by the previous experience of those almost as high .

		They are more easily brought into existence the more often the mind has felt either them or those similar to them .

		Ethics has merely to determine whether or not the whole tendency of aesthetic experience is toward higher and more pleasurable feelings or tends to stasis or de - terioration .

		If the tendency is to higher ideas and keener delight , it is good ; if not , it is not good .

		A photograph of a friend may be a cause of more pleas - ure than a picture of the
Madonna	LOCATION	; but art takes but little or no cognizance of the individual , turning all its attention to the universal .

		Ethically , it must do so ; aes - thetically , not so of necessity .

		Yet the distinction be - tween greatness and the other extreme is to be meas - ured by the degree of universality of the feeling caused in the auditors or beholders .

		The
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	will put - last the photograph , even as the world outlasts the in - dividual .

		And likewise that which has value because of its power to arouse feelings that are eternal will out - last the temporal because this embodies only that which passes away .

		The didactic is but temporary ; prejudice is temporary as temporary as is the truthfulness or usefulness of the teaching , or the existence of the causes - of the prejudice .

		Science may be unceasingly correct - ing itself ; but true art never corrects .

		And the reason is that true art embodies the highest of emotions , emo - tions that are as permanent as human character love , sympathy , feelings of beauty in nature .

		These are as permanent as the associations of man ; they will exist when and where our theories of morals are extinct , where our religion has no force , when universal broth - erhood has succeeded international war .

		To be able to call into existence the eternal pleasurable feelings of the highest of universal minds , is the office of art ; and ethics approves such , as it approves all things that are good , stamping as better those that give the highest of pleasurable emotions , and as lower those that less ably serve to do so .

		Technique may enhance the power of the work or-the height of the feeling , but can never alone create the work or the feeling .

		And hence it is that those who master style and not ideas have nothing - that can lay claim to artistic excellence or permanence .

		Style may be acquired , but artistic ideas come only from large education , large power of feeling , a large mind .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, THE OLD REGIME ix FRAXCE .

		* The first instalment of the `` Memoirs of Chancellor Pasquier '' is not likely to disap - point readers whose anticipations are based on a knowledge of the author 's career and of his social and political affiliations .

		What such knowledge justifies one in expecting , he gives us in abundance ; and his book is therefore , its field and standpoint considered , a notable ad - dition to the literature of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods .

		The Chancellor was not , in the quality of his political equipment , a Tur - got or a Mirabeau , nor indeed did statesman - ship then , as now , necessarily imply a minute and accurate acquaintance with the condition of the people .

		With the class of facts that constitute the staple of the great works of De Tocqueville and of Tainef Chancellor Pasquier seems to have been , from the modern view , strangely unfamiliar .

		What , for instance , must be the surprise of the student of De Tocque - ville to find this quondam Chancellor of
France	LOCATION	and Minister of the
Interior	ORGANIZATION	assigning as a re - sult of the Revolution a fact which was cer - tainly not the least among its contributory causes the partition of landed property ! ''

		It is , '' says De Tocqueville , '' a vulgar error to suppose that the subdivision of property in
France	LOCATION	dates from the Revolution , '' an event which did not divide , but freed land .

		Twenty years before the outbreak we find agricultural societies deploring the cutting-up of farm lands ; and a few years later
Necker	ORGANIZATION	observed that the number of small rural properties had become '' immense . ''

		This extensive passing of landed property from the hands of a thriftless and needy noblesse * whose original function of hold - ing and defending it vi et armis had long lapsed , into the hands of a frugal peasantry who con - tinued to dwell upon it and to till it , in fact her - alded the new order of things in
France	LOCATION	.

		It brought into full relief the abuses and anomalies of an outworn system , rendering them doubly odious and more plainly unjustifiable .

		t We take pleasure in commending , as an excellent popular substitute for the rather formidable works on the Old Regime by these two writers , Mr.
E. J. Lowell	PERSON	's `` The Eve of the French Revolution '' - a succinct treatise full of suggestive facts and acute comment .

		his tenants were counterpoised by extensive obli - gations .

		By the middle of the eighteenth cen - tury these obligations had entirely passed to the central government , but the seigniorial rights , in great part , remained ; and French - men , growing sensitive as they grew indepen - dent , began to resent the anomaly .

		Why , they argued , should the farmer pay taxes , not to the government , but to certain neighbors , who , al - beit titled or privileged , have no more public authority and no more to do with public bus - iness than he ?

		These neighbors met and im - peded the harassed proprietor at every turn .

		They compelled him to work on their land on set days without pay ; they prevented him from killing the game which ravaged his crops ; if he crossed the river he must pay them toll ; if he took his produce to market he must pay them for the right to sell it ; he must grind his corn at the seigniorial mill , bake his bread at the seigniorial oven , press his grapes at the seigniorial wine-press .

		In some seigniories there was even a prescriptive seigniorial bull .

		In a letter written shortly before the Revolution , by a peasant to an Intendant , we learn that , '' The whole country is infected with rents .

		Most of the farm-lands pay every year a seventh of a bushel of wheat per acre , others wine ; one pays the seignior a fourth of all fruits , another a fifth , another a twelfth , another a thirteenth the tithes being always paid on the gross .

		These rights are so singular that they vary from a fourth part of the produce to a fortieth .

		What must be thought of the rents in kind in vegetables , poultry , labor , wood , fruit , candles ?

		I am acquainted with rents which are paid in bread , in wax , in eggs , in headless pigs , in rose shoulder-knots , in bouquets of vio - lets , in golden spurs , etc. ; and there are a host of seign - iorial dues besides these . ''

		What we are to bear in mind is that for these rents and dues there was , in most cases , abso - lutely nothing rendered in return .

		Reciprocity of service , the original bond between lord and tenant , between the local defender of the land and its cultivator , had gradually disappeared with the growth of the monarchy .

		To rid ac - quired estates of the burden of irredeemable feudal rents and services whose raison d'etre had vanished , to sweep away privileges founded in feudalistic caste distinctions , was , primarily , the object of the French Revolution .

		It will be well when the special attention of students of that great movement shall be turned from its melodramatic and exterior aspects to its ra - tionale ; when they shall be taught that its use - ful and all-important facts are not the date and circumstances of this or that battle , insurrection or festival , of the cutting-off of this or that head ; and when teachers shall postpone to issues more

		THE DIAL 43 searching the stock debates as to whether this and that royal or noble personage who paid for the sins of their order on the Place de la Rev - olution did , by '' dying game , '' thereby win the crown of martyrdom and the halo of sainthood .

		Despite his leaven of enlightened liberalism , Chancellor
Pasquier	PERSON	was and remained essen - tially a man of the Old Regime , a statist with whom politics was a game to be played by and primarily for the privileged orders .

		He plainly detects a taint of heresy in the thesis of the Abbe Sieyes , that it were unjust to postpone longer the interests of the twenty-five millions of Frenchmen whose function in the State was production , in favor of the one and one-half millions of Frenchmen whose function was con - sumption .

		Touching the condition of the most numerous grade of these twenty-five millions of producing Frenchmen , he seems to have held some vague optimistic notions , tinged , perhaps , to the last by the ideas current in his youth , when polished society , inspired by the gospel according to
Jean Jacques	PERSON	, conceived the peas - ant as the amiable swain , the gentle shepherd of the pipe and the crook , affectionate , grate - ful , right-minded , easily led a mild
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	in short , tuneful and stomachless , and a charm - ing accessory to the landscape .

		Who has not smiled at the description so characteristic of the period of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	, in frock of white muslin , gauze neckerchief , and straw hat , with the daintiest of crooks , tending her be - ribboned sheep on the slopes at the Little Tria - non !

		Such was the fashionable ideal of '' the farmer 's wife , '' the paysanne remote enough , certainly , from the squalid reality : from , say , La Bruyere 's '' savage-looking beings , black , livid , and sunburnt , '' digging and grubbing at the soil from sunrise to sunset '' with invincible stubbornness , '' and retiring at night '' into their dens , where they live on black bread , water , and roots '' ; or from
Arthur Young	PERSON	's peasant - women of
Normandy	LOCATION	, '' in reality walking dung - hills , '' obscene objects which , happily , '' it is not in the power of an English imagination to figure . ''

		It is not easy , in the light of induc - tive sociology , to view the social vagaries of Rousseauism seriously ; to realize that men en - dowed with eyes to see and with ears to hear , and standing , as it were , within a stone 's - throw of the fact , actually believed in the idyllic
Jacques Bonhomme	PERSON	, legislated for him , and framed schemes of government deduced from his virtues .

		Perhaps the wish was father to the belief .

		It was so much pleasanter -LRB- the grim tradition of the Jacquerie still haunting the seigniorial pillow -RRB- to view the rustic in the pages of
Marmontel	LOCATION	,
Floriau	LOCATION	, Bitaube , or in the drawing-room idyls , than to face the sordid and menacing reality .

		We are not , however , to conclude from the general condition of the French peasant in the eighteenth century that the feudal burden laid on him was heavier than that borne by his neighbors in other parts of the continent .

		De Tocqueville has pointed out the paradoxical fact that the revolt against feudal institutions broke out precisely in the country where the burden of those institutions , though still onerous enough , was lightest .

		At the close of the century serf - dom prevailed , for instance , over the greater part of
Germany	LOCATION	, the peasant still forming , as in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, virtually part of the stock on lands .

		The soldiers in the armies of Maria The - resa and of
Frederick	PERSON	were mostly absolute serfs .

		Nothing of the kind had existed for many years in
France	LOCATION	.

		One may readily see , however , how -LRB- as we have already tried to point out -RRB- the de - struction of a part of the feudal system , followed by a measure of popular enlightenment , must have rendered the remainder a hundred-fold more hateful than the whole had ever appeared .

		The Frenchman , dimly descrying Liberty on his political horizon , grew sensible of his tram - mels .

		The prime cause of his misery was , of course , taxation ; and to the spoliations of the nobility and the clergy were added those of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Enormous sums were needed by
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		for his wars , and by Louis XV .

		for his orgies , his pare aux cerfs and kindred unspeak - abilities ; and recourse was had to the class least able to furnish them .

		An able statistician has calculated that the peasant in many parts of
France	LOCATION	paid away four-fifths of his income to the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, the seignior , and the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, retaining out of every hundred francs he earned little more than eighteen francs himself .

		No poor man escaped the tax-gatherer .

		Says Taine : '' The garret and the hut , as well as the farm and the farm-house , know the collector , the constable , and the bailiff ; no hovel escapes the detestable brood .

		The peo - ple sow , harvest their crops , work , and undergo privation for their benefit ; and , should the farthings so painfully saved each week amount , at the end of the year , to a piece of silver , the mouth of their pouch closes over it . ''

		The unprivileged Frenchman , then , in this golden age of the old noblesse , was , according to unimpeachable evidence , literally taxed to the verge of the grave and often beyond it ; and yet we find Chancellor Pasquier compla - cently alluding to the happy general condition of the country under '' the regime which pre - ceded

		an infamous character who squan - dered on a single strumpet three millions ster - ling wrung from the neediest of his subjects , and the literal record of whose private life would beggar the pen of a Rabelais .

		Let us glance briefly at a few facts recorded of this ' * halcyon '' pre-revolutionary period .

		In
1725	DATE	, says St.
Simon	PERSON	, '' the people in
Normandy	LOCATION	live on the grass of the fields .

		The first king in
Europe	LOCATION	is great simply by turning his kingdom into a vast hospital of dying people from whom their all is taken without a murmur . ''

		In the most prosperous days of Fleury and in the finest region in
France	LOCATION	, the peasant hides '' his wine on account of the excise and his bread on account of the faille , convinced that he is a lost man if any doubt exists of his dying of starvation . ''

		In
1739	DATE	, D'Argenson writes , in the canton of Touraine , '' men have been eating herbage more than a year '' ; while in the bish - opric of
Chartres	LOCATION	'' the famine and the mor - tality were such that men ate grass like sheep and died like so many flies . ''

		Reading these records one apprehends better the symbolism of that ghastly street - spectacle of the
Paris	LOCATION	mob bearing aloft on a pike the gory head of Officer
Foulon	PERSON	, the mouth filled with grass the food he had commended to the starving wretches who applied to him for assistance .

		In
1840	DATE	Massillon wrote to Fleury : '' The people of the rural districts are living in fright - ful destitution , without beds , without furniture ; the majority , for half the year , even lack barley and oat bread , their sole food , and which they are compelled to take out of their own and their children 's mouths to pay the taxes . ''

		In the same year , at Chatellerault , he says : '' The poor outnumber those able to live without beg - ging ... while prosecutions for unpaid dues are car - ried on with unexampled rigor .

		The clothes of the poor are seized , and their last measure of flour , the latches on their doors , '' etc. .

		Ten years later the evil is greater .

		D'Argen - son writes : '' In the country around me , ten leagues from
Paris	LOCATION	, I find increased privation and constant complaints .

		What must it be in our wretched provinces in the in - terior ... where the collectors with their officers , accompanied by locksmiths , force open the doors and carry off and sell furniture for one-quarter of its value .

		... I see poor people dying of destitution .

		... An assessor , on coming to the village where I have my country-house , states that the faille this year will be much increased ; he noticed that the peasants here were fatter than elsewhere ; that they had chicken-feathers before their doors , etc. ... Some of the seigniors of Touraine inform me that , being desirous of setting the inhabitants to work by the day , they found very few of them , and these so weak that they were unable to use their arms . ''

		Even at
Paris	LOCATION	one finds that , in
1753	DATE	, in the faubourg St.
Antoine	PERSON	, over eight hundred per - sons died of privation in a single month ; that '' the poor expire with cold and hunger in their garrets , without any possible relief . ''

		As to the last thirty years preceding the Revolution , it is enough to say that during that time the popular condition was no whit mended .

		The effect upon French agriculture of a system under which the least sign of prosperity sufficed to bring down upon the hapless cultivator a swarm of fiscal harpies , may be imagined .

		Countless farms in the fairest provinces of
France	LOCATION	were abandoned .

		Not even the guillotine could have compelled men -LRB- as was shown , later , to the abundant sat - isfaction of the zealots of the Terror -RRB- to sow where they might not reap , to weave where they might not wear .

		In
Auvergne	LOCATION	, we learn , '' the country is depopulated daily . ''

		In
Comminges	LOCATION	, at the outbreak of the Revolution , certain com - munities threatened to abandon their possessions should they obtain no relief . ''

		It is a well-known fact , '' says the Assembly of Haute-Guyenne , in
1784	DATE	, `` that the lot of the most severely taxed communities is so rigorous as to have led their proprietors frequently to abandon their prop - erty . ''

		In
Gascony	LOCATION	the spectacle is '' heart - rending . ''

		About 1760 , according to the best observers , `` one-quarter of the soil of
France	LOCATION	is absolutely lying waste ; ... hundreds and hundreds of arpents of heath and moor form extensive deserts . '' ''

		Let a person traverse
Anjou	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	,
Brittany	PERSON	,
Poitou	LOCATION	,
Limousin	LOCATION	, la
Marche	LOCATION	,
Berry	PERSON	,
Nivernaise	ORGANIZATION	,
Bourbonnais	PERSON	, and
Auvergne	LOCATION	, and he finds one-half of these prov - inces in heaths , forming immense plains , all of which might be cultivated . ''

		In short , the re - gime invented by
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- and viewed not unfavorably by Chancellor Pasquier -RRB- had pro- duced its effect ; French soil was reverting to a wild state .

		`` Thus abandoned , '' says
Taine	PERSON	, '' by the spade and the plough , a vast portion of the soil ceases to feed man , while the rest , poorly cultivated , scarcely provides the simplest necessities . ''

		To a recital of the abuses of the Old Order it is always fair to add that , immediately be - fore the Revolution , there was a general , if be - lated , tendency on the part of the class that had profited by them to assist in their removal .

		But the wind had been sown , and it remained to reap the whirlwind .

		The spirit of radi - calism , though not predominant , was astir in
France	LOCATION	, and it had at its beck and call a law - less and relentless horde of social pariahs , the very existence of which is the gravest count

		45 in the indictment against the
Anclen Regime	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the Assembly that met at
Versailles	LOCATION	to dis - cuss reforms sat not only men like Cazales , D'Espremenil ,
Mounier	PERSON	,
Mirabeau	LOCATION	, the La - meths ; but the Potions and the Robespierres , at heart root-and-branch men , and the germ of that alert , organized , and determined minority who were , despite their benign democratic ideals , soon to rule
France	LOCATION	with a despotism never before parallelled , and under which the ruled could not even establish their right to live .

		To such men surgery , a cutting-away of parts corrupt or inert , was the true cure for the diseased body politic ; and a suitable instru - ment was -LRB- thanks to Dr.
Guillotin	PERSON	-RRB- soon ready to their hand .

		The crimes and follies of
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Louis XV	ORGANIZATION	.

		were to be atoned for by
Louis XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		an amiable , well-intentioned man who might , had he lived and applied himself , have made an indifferent locksmith .

		Certainly , the sickle of the guillotine reaped away few heads less deserving than his of such a fate .

		Chancel - lor Pasquier was present , involuntarily , at the
King	ORGANIZATION	's execution ; and he describes the scene , not minutely , but with the shuddering reluct - ance of an unwilling eye-witness that lends force to his words : '' It remains for me to say that I saw the tragedy which was enacted on the 21st of
January	DATE	.

		I lived in a house which faced on the boulevard , at the corner of the church of the Madeleine .

		My father and I sat op - posite each other all morning , buried in our grief and unable to utter a word .

		We knew that the fatal pro- cession was wending its way by the boulevards .

		Sud - denly a somewhat loud clamor made itself heard .

		I rushed out under the idea that perhaps an attempt was being made to rescue the king .

		How could I do other - wise than cherish such a hope to the very last ?

		On reaching the goal I discovered that what I had heard was merely the howling of the raving madmen who sur - rounded the vehicle .

		I found myself sucked in by the crowd which followed it , and was dragged away by it , and , so to speak , carried and set down by the scaffold 's side .

		So it was that I endured the horror of this awful spectacle .

		Hardly had the crime been consummated when a cry of ' Long live the Nation ! '

		arose from the foot of the scaffold , and , repeated from man to man , was taken up by the whole of the vast concourse of peo - ple .

		This cry was followed by the deepest and most gloomy silence .

		Shame , horror , and terror were now hovering over the vast locality . ''

		Later , another execution was witnessed by the Chancellor this time not so reluctantly : '' Fate led me to the
Palais de Justice	ORGANIZATION	on one of the days of
Fouquier-Tinville	ORGANIZATION	's trial .

		I was unable to re - sist the desire of seeing with my own eyes this great act of divine justice , so I went in .

		... In that room had sat the revolutionary tribunal .

		Into it had come , as prisoners , the Queen , Mme.
Elizabeth	PERSON	, M. de Male - sherbes , the members of the
Paris Parlement	ORGANIZATION	, and lastly my father .

		Thence , all of them had started for the scaffold , in company of so many more .

		And it was in that place that I saw sitting in the dock , into which he had so long brought his victims , the monster the men - tion of whose name had so often made me shudder ... I certainly did not think I was to see that man again , yet fate had it in store for me that certain business should take me to the
Hotel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	the day of his ex - ecution , and I saw his head fall .

		He struggled against his doom like the coward that he was . ''

		Before closing , let us glance at Chancellor
Pasquier	PERSON	's account of the fall of the
Bastille	LOCATION	, an event which , however important symbolic - ally , seems to have been in itself , if we are to believe the Chancellor , little more than an ex - aggerated street row .

		It may be instructive to compare the following pallid report of an eye - witness with Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	's dithyrambic version : '' I was present at the taking of the
Bastille	LOCATION	.

		What has been styled the fight was not serious , for there was absolutely no resistance shown .

		Within the hold 's walls were neither provisions nor ammunition .

		It was not even necessary to invest it .

		The regiment of gardes franpaises which led the attack presented itself under the walls on the rue Saint-Antoine side , opposite the main entrance , which was barred by a drawbridge .

		There was a discharge of a few musket-shots , to which no reply was made , and then four or five discharges from a cannon .

		It has been claimed that the latter broke the chains of the drawbridge .

		I did not notice this , and yet I was standing close to the point of attack .

		What I did see plainly was the action of the soldiers , invalides , or others , grouped on the platform of the high tower , holding their muskets stock in air , and ex - pressing by all means employed under similar circum - stances their desire of surrendering ... The truth is , that this great fight did not for a moment frighten the numerous spectators who had flocked to witness its re - sult .

		Among them were many women of fashion , who , in order to be closer to the scene , had left their carriages some distance away ... By my side stood Mile .

		Con - tat , of the Come ` die-Franc .

		aise .

		We stayed together till the very end , and then I gave her my arm back to her carriage , which had waited in the place Royale . ''

		It is hard to reconcile the writer 's '' abso - lutely no resistance shown '' with the historical one hundred or more dead besiegers , with the subsequent fury of the mob , and the massacre of De
Launay	PERSON	and six of the garrison .

		Perhaps the well-born Chancellor looked grudgingly on events which seemed to startled
Europe	LOCATION	to ring out the old and ring in the new ; events which even dispassionate
Immanuel Kant	PERSON	in distant
Konigsberg	PERSON	, foreseeing a new Golden Age , hailed with tears of joy , saying to his friends , '' I can now say , like Simeon : ' Lord , let thy servant depart in peace , for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation . ' ''

		Unhappily , the too-sanguine philosopher lived to see the crowning of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon
Bonaparte	PERSON	.

1810	DATE	, from the eve of the Revolution to the departure of

		Aside from its graver historical tenor the book is a thoroughly charming addition to the literature of portrait - ure and personal reminiscence .

		We shall await the second instalment with interest .

		E. G. J. MODERN PSYCHOLOGY AND DAILY LIFE .

		* A most welcome sign of the tendency of mod - ern psychology to develop along lines of real and natural interest is to be found in the va - rious applications of psychological principles to education , to history , to the treatment of the defective classes , to the origin of illusion and error , and to countless experiences in daily life .

		The conception of the psychologist as one who deals in abstract and out-of-the-way mental en - tities , classifying with ever-increasing refine - ment his peculiar collection of specimens and ever disputing with his colleagues over their proper labels , a conception warranted by a perusal of text-books published not many dec - ades ago , must give way to a far different view , in which the psychologist appears at every point in close touch with the vital problems of science and of life .

		He still finds it necessary to analyze closely , to draw fine distinctions , and to use technical language ; but he never forgets the end for which such accessories , like the technicalities of physics or of chemistry , have been adopted .

		It is as an example of the application of psy - chology to history that Dr.
Ireland	LOCATION	's work , '' The Blot upon the Brain , '' now appearing in a sec - ond edition , deserves especial mention .

		The thesis which the major portion of these essays illustrates is that a correct view of the charac - ters and actions of many of the important per - * THE BLOT UPON THE BRAIN : Studies in History and Psychology .

		sonages of history can be obtained only from an understanding of certain psychological prin - ciples , and in particular from a careful analysis of what is meant by insanity , delusions , and the various forms of extravagance in thought and deed .

		Mere abnormality , a divergence from the common average , is of course not in - sanity ; it is in such deviation from tfie standard of the hoi polloi that genius and madness find one point of alliance .

		And apart from any de - sire to reach a practical definition of insanity , it must be remembered that a class of actions and beliefs which a few centuries ago would have passed unnoticed , would to-day render one liable to examination for mental unsoundness ; and again , the manifestations that under a dif - ferent psychology subjected the unfortunate possessed one to persecutions and tortures , or under other circumstances were interpreted as divine inspirations , are to-day treated in the sheltering care of an asylum .

		Although a su - perficial survey is thus sufficient to accent the necessity of interpreting conduct with full ref - erence to its historical environment , there yet remains abundant opportunity for an inquiry regarding the share of conduct in certain types of greatness that is due to unusual ability and the share that must be ascribed to developments of character differing perhaps in degree , but not in kind , from those that characterize in - sanity . ''

		In ancient times , and amongst half - civilized nations , things were done in the name of religion which none but men of the weakest mental structure would now do ; but the rule we would apply to the one time will not hold good for the other . ''

		Dr.
Ireland	LOCATION	finds in the lives of Mohammed and Luther and
Joan	PERSON	of Arc the-best illustra - tions of historically important events springing from and guided by semi-morbid tendencies .

		It would be an abuse of language to call Mo - hammed insane , and to attempt to interpret the religion to which he gave rise as the accidental adoption , as inspired , of his hallucinations and ravings .

		`` We do not seek to explain the na - ture or success of Mohammed 's mission by his epilepsy .

		These lie in the character of the man and the circumstances of the times ; but we think that the starting-point of his hallucina - tions came through the nervous disorder which affected him and of which the epileptiform fits were the visible proof .

		It was this which held before his eyes and made to sound in his ears the hallucinations which led him to believe that he had a message from God .

		Without this , no amount of religious fervor or abstract mon -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 otheism would have made him take such a view . ''

		When we consider the frequency with which religious devotion is a marked symptom of epi - lepsy , that Mohammed began his revela - tions only in his forty-second year , and that the attacks were probably not frequent enough to undermine his mental strength , we obtain at least a partial solution of the wonderfully suc - cessful and active career associated with such peculiar characteristics of person and times .

		In the case of Luther , the hallucinations played no part in his religious life , the reference of all untoward happenings to a personal devil arising naturally from the dominant conceptions of the time .

		How far
Joan	PERSON	of Arc was insane , it is difficult to determine ; her remarkable career contains such a curious mixture of cre - dulity , extravagance , and sporadic ability , that the psychologist as well as the historian is left in doubt .

		And yet a knowledge of the nervous conditions prompting such actions has been in - fluential in creating a rational view of her place and character .

		Although Dr.
Ireland	LOCATION	must content himself with the statement , '' I do not know any insane person who was like her , but she was not quite sane , '' yet the analysis upon which this conclusion is reached is suggestive of the close relation between her nervous con - dition and her historical importance .

		The '' insanity of power '' is the name given to the wild excesses of powerful tyrants who seem to act with perverted instincts and an absence of moral sense .

		The education of restraint has been absent in their training , and the result may be viewed as a reversion to a more savage state , characterized by a love of cruelty that comes as a symptom at certain periods of childhood , but is outgrown by normal individuals .

		The Claudian-Julian family , reaching a climax in the extravagances of Nero , forms the most striking instance of this malady ; while the his - tories of Mohammed Toghlak , and Ivan the Terrible show similar tendencies in other royal dynasties .

		The hereditary element in such dis - ease is its most awful factor , and is well por - trayed by Dr.
Ireland	LOCATION	in his chapter on the neurosis of the royal family in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		In all these cases , the influence upon historical events that may arise from perverted forms of mental action appears in a striking way .

		Dr.
Ireland	LOCATION	's volume contains other essays on a variety of topics interesting to the student of unusual mental phenomena .

		The nature of illusions and hallucinations is well set forth in the opening chapter of the volume .

		Fixed ideas which enslave the unfortunate victim , pro- duce irrational hopes and fears , prevent the accomplishment of the simplest actions or en - courage most extravagant ones , form the sub - ject of another chapter ; while the peculiarly contagious character of certain forms of insan - ity and unconscious cerebration furnish the material for other interesting discussions .

		Left - handedness and righthandedness is discussed in its relations to the nervous system .

		The question of the duality of the brain that is , the independent action of the two halves of the brain is a related topic ; and the curious mir - ror-writing , which occurs spontaneously in chil - dren , and seems also related to lefthandedness , offers a puzzling but important problem in the same field .

		Of quite special value is the essay upon the relation of thought to words .

		The evidence for the existence of thought without words is forcibly stated , and offers a welcome example of the illuminating power of psycholog - ical analysis upon a problem on which much inconclusive philological speculation has been expended .

		The knowledge of the physical basis of language that we derive from the study of the various forms of aphasia is also well set forth , as a contribution from the student of mental disease to the psychologist a contri - bution which has been termed '' the most bril - liant jewel in Physiology . ''

		Dr.
Ireland	LOCATION	's collection of papers may be recommended as an interesting approach to many problems in practical psychology , an approach that suggests the wide extent of the domain to be entered upon , and the hopeful - ness of this mode of access ; an approach , too , that brings the field into close and vital rela - tions with a variety of intellectual and prac - tical interests .

Jan. 16	DATE	, from the military point of view only , with no further discussion of social or personal charac - teristics than is necessary in presenting the man as a commander .

		The impetuosity of
Alexander	PERSON	- and the cool , calculated daring of
Caesar	PERSON	are essential parts of their characters as generals .

		Nor does
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	offer a judgment in the famous case of
The Roman Republic	ORGANIZATION	vs.
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, wherein Cassius and
Brutus	PERSON	did execution without trial .

		He does say , what no one who condemns
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's assumption of power can deny , that in the existing circumstances the actions of the Pompeian party and the official acts of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	were substantially a declara - tion of war . ''

		Either rival was right in oppos - ing the sole exercise of authority by the other ; but we must judge mainly from the facts and from the other authorities , and not from the statements of
Cassar	PERSON	, which was least to blame for the war that for years decimated the repub - lic '' -LRB- p. 409 -RRB- .

		But this judgment upon poli - tics is merely incidental : he is portraying
Caesar	PERSON	the general , Caesar the man that made the gen - eral , not Caesar the politician nor Caesar the statesman .

		Only at the end of the book does he sum up his character in a strong chapter on '' The Man and Soldier . ''

		I .

		In viewing this book the reader constantly refers , and is by the author referred , to the two previous volumes .

		They are connected both by these references and by the author 's plan , which is to sketch the growth of the science and of the art of war , from earliest history down to
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		Our review will therefore include in some measure the volumes on Alexander and Hannibal .

		Of the first volume , one-fourth , amounting to one hundred and eighty pages , is filled with discussions of wars and of military affairs before
Alexander	PERSON	, including fifty-six pages on
Philip	PERSON	and his military work .

		Here are reviewed
Ori	PERSON	- ental arms and armies ; the wars of Cyrus and
Darius	PERSON	; Spartan and other Greek armies ; Mil - tiades and
Marathon	LOCATION	;
Brasidas	LOCATION	,
Xenophon	PERSON	,
Agesilaus	PERSON	, and Epaminondas .

		The author 's judgments upon the generals commend them - selves to us ; but we are amazed to see the merest imaginations and romantic stories of the Greeks spread upon the pages of the book , and even improved upon by
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's skill in narration .

		A full description of the battle of Thymbra is given -LRB- pp. 48-50 -RRB- , with com - ments upon the tactics of Cyrus .

		This story is from
Xenophon	PERSON	's '' Cyropsedia , '' a work 110 more worthy of quotation as an authority than
Scott	PERSON	's '' Ivanhoe '' or Flaubert 's '' Salammbo . ''

		It is well described by
Mahaffy	PERSON	as '' a very dif - fuse political novel , '' '' the most theoretical and fanciful of
Xenophon	PERSON	's works , '' of which Pro- fessor M. says : '' It is idle to attempt to sift out the particles of history from the mass of fiction . ''

		Colonel
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	says it has been sug - gested that
Xenophon	PERSON	improved upon the actual manoeuvres , but that at least it shows what
Xenophon	PERSON	knew how to do .

		Let him then pre - sent it , as Colonel
Chesney	PERSON	gave us '' the Battle of Dorking , '' as a clear excursus of the imagi - nation ; let it be
Xenophon	PERSON	's and not
Cyrus	PERSON	's battle .

		But Colonel Dodge repeatedly quotes the '' Cyropaedia '' as if it were history .

		Again , he narrates the Scythian campaign of Darius -LRB- pp. 53-55 -RRB- , accepting the fantastic details of
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	, and imputing to the scat - tered and utterly barbarous tribes north of the Danube a marvellous strategy .

		`` These acts were not done in an irrational manner , but with the greatest forethought . ''

		Why did he not notice the criticisms upon Ctesias and Hero - dotus to be found in
Grote	LOCATION	?

		Colonel Dodge often cites
Grote	PERSON	.


Grote	PERSON	says : '' That
Darius	PERSON	actually marched into the country , there can be no doubt .

		Nothing else is certain , except his ignominious retreat out of it to the
Danube	LOCATION	.

		... But as to all which happened between his crossing and recrossing the
Danube	LOCATION	, we find nothing approaching to authentic statements , nor even what we can set forth as the probable basis of truth on which exaggerating fancy has been at work . ''

		But our author gravely com - pares it to the Russian campaign of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		We have found that
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	brings to his work that useful element of the ability of a narrator , an active imagination ; but this , coupled with poor judgment as to facts and authorities , leads him sometimes astray .

		We are forced to distrust and to watch him .

		Another example of extravagance is found in the state - ment twice given -LRB- '' Alexander , '' p. 20 ; '' Han - nibal , '' p. 21 -RRB- , that in the Jewish army of the time of the Judges there was a body of slingers who '' could cut a hair hung up as a target . ''

		How could an intelligent man fail to see that the words of the Bible '' every one could sling stones at an hair-breadth and not miss '' were an orientalism , a hyperbolic statement of accu - racy of aim ?

		And how far from the hair tar - get can the slinger stand and see his mark ?

		It is no orientalism to reply , not a hair 's breadth beyond the length of his arm and of his sling .

		Again , how can any man who has practical acquaintance with affairs , and who witnessed the failure of our armies in attempts to divert

		Cyrus was not such an utter fool . ' ''

		The canal which Sesostris had dug '' must fail with the fable of Sesostris ; while the credibility of the diversion of the Euphrates hinges at last upon the supposed paving of a part of the bed of the river by the imaginary Nitocris .

		The Trojan War , too , which may have been mythical only , and certainly is not historical , is dated and discussed as a fact ; while it is really doubtful whether the Homeric descriptions of battles , which were principally duels between the mythic heroes , represent warfare as it actu - ally occurred at any time prior to the Middle Ages and Knighthood .

		Little errors occur frequently , showing want of an accurate habit .

		We are told that
Themis	PERSON	- tocles commanded the centre at
Marathon	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is known that
Aristides	PERSON	was general of his tribe : it is not known that
Themistocles	PERSON	held any com - mand ; and the stories that show his character at that time make it evidently improbable . ''

		The Spartans marched to

		But at the end of their three days ' march they had reached
Athens	LOCATION	only , and were twenty-two miles from the battle-field , which they visited on the fourth day .

		Caesar 's wife is called Julia : she was
Cornelia	LOCATION	; and before he married
Calpurnia	LOCATION	he had divorced the second wife ,
Pompeia	LOCATION	.

		In `` Caesar '' -LRB- p. 21 -RRB- , a statement is made of the .

		In '' Caesar '' -LRB- p. 143 -RRB- the description of

		The Sesos - tridae -LRB- `` Alexander , '' pp. 21 and 23 -RRB- can hardly be historical , since Sesostris is the product of a Greek imagination stirred by Egyptian fables of the conquests of their kings .

		But we leave this discussion of errors with the remark that the publishers ought to put upon such books a proof-reader who would not allow Carducians for Carduchians , Cindus for Cnidus , agyras - pids for argy rasp ids , or synapism -LRB- sadly sug - gestive of a mustard plaster -RRB- for synaspism -LRB- the arrangement of soldiers in close order -RRB- .

		Nor should he have allowed the author 's inat - tention to leave in the text many errors like illy for ill ; in petto , meaning secretly , for en petit , in miniature ; and , to crown all , this extraordi - nary statement -LRB- `` Hannibal , '' p. 24 -RRB- : `` Like our own broncos or the Cossack horses , their little nags were wonderful for endurance and activity , and throve on food which would kill a civilized horse .

		On the other hand , they were cruel , reckless , and noted for plundering and rapac - ity . ''

		To offset this dispraise , we are glad to say that
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	shows many good qualities as an author .

		If he sins against rhetoric , he is never tedious in discourse .

		He narrates well .

		He makes a non-military reader under - stand military matters , though he says there are some pages too technical for the general reader .

		His occasional errors of expression do not take from him the characteristics of a clear thinker .

		He studies the works of other authors , but does not follow them where his own research leads to different conclusions .

		To qualify himself for writing the '' Hannibal '' and the ''
Caesar	PERSON	, '' he visited the fields of their exploits .

		He claims that he is the only writer upon
Caesar	PERSON	's cam - paigns , except Colonel
Stoffel	PERSON	, `` who has fol - lowed Caesar entirely around the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	basin . ''

		With
Livy	PERSON	and
Polybius	PERSON	in hand , he examined all the passes of the Alps and fol - lowed the track of the Lion of
Carthage	LOCATION	over all his marches and battle-fields , before he wrote of him .

		With such preparation he detects mil - itary and topographical errors in even the best histories of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The '' Caesar '' has but few illustrations ; the '' Alexander '' has many .

		Of these many are modern , adapted from the an - tique , often with an added touch of the pictur - esque in attitude .

		It is necessary of ten to discard the conventionality of the antique , especially in illustrations from coins and from the Egyptian and the Assyrian sources .

		Figures on vases and the like were evidently drawn for artistic purposes rather than for exact representation .

		But we venture the surmise that some figures as , for instance , those of Hebrew soldiers in the '' Alexander , '' pp.
19-21	DATE	are without au - thority .

		50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	,
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	knows the value of maps , and gives them liberally ; many are mere sketchy diagrams , but they fully answer the purpose , since accuracy by a scale is not needed so much as a general idea of relations .

		He can afford to give these in abundance , where elaborate maps must be fewer ; and these are at hand in the text , and not on the library shelf , when wanted .

		Hence the books are wonderfully con - venient .

		Another excellence is the full digest of the contents of each chapter , not given in the form of mere catchwords , but in complete sentences .

		We quote one below .

		Colonel
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	says they show the reader what to skip ; after reading every , page , we find them useful for review .

		Of his judgments upon
Alexander	PERSON	,
Hanni	PERSON	- bal , and
Caesar	PERSON	, we must say that he has a very hearty spirit of hero-worship , and sets their achievements in the best lights .

		With respect to
Alexander	PERSON	, it seems to us that he far over - states his case .

		He says : `` The life-work of
Philip	LOCATION	had been transcendent .

		That of
Alex	PERSON	- ander surpasses anything in history .

		Words fail to describe the attributes of this monarch as a soldier . ''

		Such laudation as this does sur - pass anything in history , and lands us in the realm of imagination at once .

		His praise of
Philip	LOCATION	is deserved , though probably rather strong ; but without the preparation of
Philip	LOCATION	there could have been no career of Alexander .

		He started with an immense advantage .

		And what did he do ?

		He fought with an enemy intrinsically weak and destitute of strategic skill .

		After Marathon it was not difficult to defeat a Persian army .

		Miltiades began the series ;
Pausanias	PERSON	followed ; Cimon carried on the work ; Clearchus and Cyrus the younger marched with thirteen thousand soldiers and an auxiliary rabble into the heart of
Persia	LOCATION	, and the soldiers marched out again ; Agesilaus saw that the Corinthian War called him from pros - pects of vast success against the Oriental troops ; Epaminondas could have beaten Medes and Sacians easier than he overcame the Spartan phalanxes .

		We may almost ask , who could n't beat
Persia	LOCATION	?

		At least some of the ancients had a similar view ; for they report that
Alexander	PERSON	of
Epirus	LOCATION	, upon encountering the Samnites and Lucanians , struck with their soldierly qualities , said that he wished his nephew , Alexander the Great , had come over to
Italy	LOCATION	, where he would have found antagonists worth fighting with , in - stead of unskilful barbarians .

		Merivale , in his '' General History '' of
Rome	LOCATION	, raises this objec - tion to
Alexander	PERSON	's fame , and thinks he would have failed had he started into
Italy	LOCATION	with his thirty thousand , and had met a Roman army , which would have been joined by the other Ital - ians .

		We think it is Colonel
Chesney	PERSON	who sug - gests that the prestige and success of
Napoleon	PERSON	was greatly enhanced by his meeting in his first campaign troops so inferior as the Austrians then were .

		Colonel
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	says that the cour - age and discipline of the Macedonian soldier was much higher than that of the rest of
Greece	LOCATION	, '' immeasurably higher than that of the soldier of
Persia	LOCATION	. ''

		If so ,
Alexander	PERSON	was the eagle in the dove-cote , and his glory is factitious to a great extent .

		He never had an effective oppo - sition , except at the siege of Tyre .

		Numbers without discipline these made the Persian armies .

		And what did the opposition of a few mountaineers like the
Mardi	LOCATION	amount to ?

		What the hosts of Porus ?

		The excessive admiration of Alexander makes the author unjust to other generals .

		He says no one but
Alexander	PERSON	knew how to follow up a victory swiftly .

		But his army was never dis - organized by battle with the Oriental hordes , and his cavalry was superior in quality by his father 's discipline .

		Take in contrast
Caesar	PERSON	's first great battle with the Helvetians .

		His troops fought with men their superiors in num - bers , in impetuosity , and in motives that nerve men to fight ; their equals in courage and tena - city ; their inferiors only in advantages of posi - tion , in arms , in discipline , and in leadership .

		And as the Roman armies were not always well provided with cavalry ,
Caesar	PERSON	had only the un - reliable Gallic horse under Dumnorix .

		Re - membering the saying of
Wellington	LOCATION	-LRB- was it not ? -RRB-

		that to an army the misfortune next to a great defeat is a great victory , - was it a mark of inferior generalship that
Caesar	PERSON	spent three days before he followed up his beaten foe ?

		Although the language of eulogy was well - nigh exhausted upon
Alexander	PERSON	, the career of Hannibal elicits high praise from our au - thor : '' In the galaxy of great captains the stars are equal .

		Many claim for Hannibal a lustre beyond the others .

		Measuring his task and resources by those of any sol - dier of history , he may be not untruthfully said to be primus inter pares . ''

		-LRB- `` Hannibal , '' pp. 614 -RRB- . ''

		Hannibal 's organizing ability was unmatched .

		Out of the most ragged material he could speedily produce a disciplined army '' -LRB- p. 626 -RRB- . ''

		The energy , skill , intelligence and determination with which he carried out his plan -LSB- of movement from
Spain	LOCATION	to
Cisalpine Gaul	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- would have made him one of the greatest leaders if he had never advanced beyond the Po .

		But this was only a first step in
Hannibal	LOCATION	's military career '' -LRB- p. 638 -RRB- .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 And in this sentence he places the crown on Hannibal 's head : '' Guaged by the work he had to do , the resistance he encountered , and the means at his command ,
Hanni	PERSON	- bal outranks any general of history '' -LRB- p. 642 -RRB- .

		The '' Caesar '' opens with a short sketch of the work of
Marius	PERSON	, a great fighter , but not a strat - egist ; famous as the Savior of
Rome	LOCATION	in the great Cimbrian War .

		He made his mark upon Roman military affairs by his new organization of the armies , by which he made the legions what they were when
Caesar	PERSON	began to be a sol - dier , different from the earlier republican le - gions in material , in organization of cohorts , and in arrangements for battle .

		Caesar 's earlier career , his adventure with the pirates , his serv - ice in the Mithridatic War , and his short ca - reer as praetor in
Spain	LOCATION	, are briefly sketched , so that by the fiftieth page the author begins his history of the Gallic War , which fills , with its explanations of military affairs , 350 pages none too much for its importance , both as a development of
Caesar	PERSON	and as an incident in the world 's history .

		Its development of Caesar fixed the fate of the Roman state ; as an inci - dent in history , it secured
Italy	LOCATION	for centuries from barbarian invasion , and laid the founda - tion of that which became
France	LOCATION	, the greatest of the Romance or Romanized lands .

		His campaigns are analyzed and criticised in detail .

		Colonel Dodge suggests a curious but unanswerable question .

		After giving the brief account of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's one campaign in
Spain	LOCATION	, he says : `` When he attacked the Gallic question , he showed that he was familiar with war , but not with the man - agement of its greater problems .

		Gaul was his school in the grand operations of war .

		It is to be regretted that we do not know how he had learned what unques - tionably he knew of the art previous to his first cam - paign in
Gaul	LOCATION	.

		He had manifestly covered an immense territory ; but we know naught of his method '' -LRB- p. 47 -RRB- .

		Caesar showed his great ability at once .

		Alex - ander came to command in a great campaign at twenty-two years of age , but he had had a military training , and able generals accompan - ied him .

		Hannibal was commander-in-chief at twenty-six , with training and aid like
Alexan	PERSON	- der 's .

		Napoleon came to the army of
Italy	LOCATION	in his twenty - seventh year , having had the train - ing of a military school , followed by full ten years of subordinate service and observation .

		Caesar , with slight exceptions , had been a civil - ian only , until he was forty years of age ; and then he conducted two great campaigns in a single year , with an army of new levies in part , and with fickle , uncertain auxiliaries ; and to succeed at all , it was necessary first to win the confidence of his men .

		Had he lacked this , his campaign against Ariovistus would have been a miserable failure .

		This first year is an illus - tration of the power of that wonderful element called genius , which in
Caesar	LOCATION	was more remark - able than in any other man in all history for its versatility .

		The variety of his abilities is the most wonderful thing in this '' foremost man of all the world . ''

		It was inevitable that he should make mistakes ; and not a few of them came from that self-confidence shown in the phrase ''
Caesar	PERSON	and his fortunes . ''

		Colonel Dodge points these out as they appear in the light of experience .

		His fearful battle with the
Nervii	PERSON	was like our
Shiloh	LOCATION	; a disaster of surprise , because of insufficient exploration by scouts .

		His invasion of
Britain	LOCATION	was really impolitic , needless , and useless , and came near ending in ruin to
Caesar	LOCATION	.

		His campaign at Dyrrachium was ridiculously inadequate and apparently inexcusable , though one may say that he knew his opponent ,
Pompey	LOCATION	, too well to fear him .

		By the way , how could General
Napier	PERSON	write such a judgment of
Pompey	LOCATION	as he gave Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	?

		He wrote : '' Tell Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	to be - ware of falling into the error of
Pompey	LOCATION	being a bad general ; he was a very great one per - haps , in a purely military sense , greater than
Caesar	PERSON	. ''

		Most writers agree with our author , whose opinion of
Pompey	ORGANIZATION	is given on pages
24-26	DATE	, from which we quote : ''
Pompey	PERSON	was perhaps the lightest weight of all the characters who have enacted a giant 's role on the stage of life .

		No -LSB- other -RSB- man won the title of Great on such slender merit .

		No -LSB- other -RSB- man ever wielded such vast power with so little to back it up .

		... He was unable to plan a good campaign or assume a sudden strategic or tactical risk .

		... In council he was slow ; and to a habit of silence which came from a not over-quick com - prehension , was referred , as it often is , a judgment he did not profess .

		Pompey was but an ordmary man of good abilities .

		He had not the first glint of genius .

		Greatness was thrust upon him , if it ever was upon any man .

		He was the very reverse of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	.

		Circum - stances made Pompey : Csesar made circumstances .

		Pompey was cold , passionless , and slow at making reso - lutions . ''

		The whole passage is a fine sketch and summing up of
Pompey	LOCATION	's career and character .

		But we must leave these interesting subjects , commend - ing this book and the whole series -LRB- judging the volumes to come by those we have -RRB- to all stu - dents , and closing with this summary prefixed to chapter XIV. : `` Alexander had the most beauty : we think of him as the Homeric youth ; of Hannibal and Csesar as in sober maturity of years .

		In all his qualities , Ca3sar is the most splendid man of antiquity ; as a soldier , he equals the 52 THE DIAL -LSB-

		He has now revised and enlarged these pamphlets , and united them , in English , in one book , which appropriately bears the names of that noble expanse of the St. Law - rence known as

		With like care , and masterly use of old documents and records , he has gone over the history of the whole island , and fixed the sites of its ancient forts and the scenes of the stirring events in its history .

		He has re-told and made very vivid the story of the terrible war with the Iroquois from
1689	DATE	, the year of the frightful massacre at
Lachine	LOCATION	, to
1698	DATE	, during which the parish burial regis - ters show that deaths from natural causes were the exception and those at savage hands the rule , and which '' created so profound an im - pression that the lapse of two centuries has failed to obliterate it in the memory of pos - terity , while the dying chants of the victims have been handed down by tradition to find a place among the popular songs of the country . ''


Montreal Island	LOCATION	was for so many years the headquarters of all the expeditions for explor - ation and commerce to the West and
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, that much of its local history has associations with our own .

		From its little villages and from among its inhabitants went forth many of the hardy voyageurs who traversed our streams and prairies , and some of the bold soldiers who com - manded the frontier posts within our bounda - ries in the very early day .

		The lists of those whose ancestry and family homes Mr.

		RECENT STUDIES IN CURRENCY AND FINANCE .

		* The exceptional character of our financial expe - riences during recent years , and the marked revival of general interest in the study of monetary prob - lems , seem likely to leave behind them some more or less permanent record in the fresh crop of finan - cial literature that has been brought forth .

		All of these new books are professedly of popular interest , though some of them possess no inconsiderable de - gree of scientific merit .

		All of them , moreover , mark a notable and welcome step in advance of the currency discussions of a decade ago , in their less dogmatic and doctrinaire tone ; in their clearer rec - ognition of the importance of special forces and cir - cumstances in modifying the operation of general principles ; and , above all , in their keen appreciation of the manner and extent of the subtle influence exercised by purchasing power in the form of credit , in a community where banking facilities have reached so high a point of development as in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Of all these discussions , the most noteworthy , on account both of its timeliness and the sound judg - ment and logical acumen displayed by the writer , is Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's monograph on `` The Silver Situation in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		It is altogether the most satisfactory treatment of the events and condi - tions bearing upon the solution of the silver ques - tion in this country , and is a contribution of some importance to certain minor points in the theory of money .

		The 135 pages of this essay are divided into two parts .

		The first part gives a clear and in - teresting account of the various conditions affecting the fluctuations in the circulation of the silver cur - rency since the Bland Act of
1878	DATE	.

		The second part is an examination of the questions of policy involved in the currency controversy , and , more particularly , an investigation of that part of the bimetallist argument which reasons from the fall of prices to the need for more money .

		This is the least satisfactory part of the essay , and mainly so because the author has shrunk from the important but difficult task of defining what the necessary re - quirements of an equitable standard of value are .

Taussig	PERSON	.

		Hardly less timely than the essay just noticed is Mr.
Kinley	PERSON	's volume on the history , organization , and influence of '' The
Independent Treasury	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Kinley	PERSON	seeks to make out a case against the present Sub-treasury system , by showing the pernicious and disturbing influence of the irregular collections and disbursements of the government on the money supply .

		The
Federal Treasury	ORGANIZATION	is now the largest single manipulator of money in this country , and , as a result of its posi - tion of commanding influence , the business commu - nity has been reduced to a forced dependence on its daily policy .

		An element of instability is thus in - troduced into all business , and this is unavoidable under a system of treasury deposits which requires that the government shall be the actual custodian of the public money .

		The Sub-treasury system was devised to secure the safety of the public money , but it has done this at the cost of elasticity of the currency .

		The present problem is to secure elas - ticity without sacrificing safety ; and for this pur - pose Mr.
Kinley	PERSON	proposes a reorganization of the national banking system , adding greatly to the func - tions of the banks as financial agents of the govern - ment .

		Such , in brief , is the burden of the writer 's argument .

		In working out his position , Mr.
Kin	PERSON	- ley has produced a book of decided interest , even for those who are unwilling to go his length in de - preciation of an institution which has been so pro- ductive of good as the
Independent Treasury	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book , in its descriptive parts , will be found a most useful repository of information regarding some of the important influences constantly at work in our money market .

		Under the title of '' A
Brief History of Panics	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Thorn	PERSON	has published an English version of so much of
M. Juglar	ORGANIZATION	's well - known work on '' Commercial Crises '' as related to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It may be well questioned whether this translation was worth the effort .

		There is cei ' - tainly place for a good history of American crises , but the gap is too large to be filled by
M. Juglar	PERSON	's fragmentary and superficial treatment of the sub - ject .

		The present volume tells nothing new and omits much that is included in other books .

		And whatever merits the work in its French form pos - sessed are largely diminished in the English trans - lation , through inaccurate renderings and not infre - quent misprints .

		Both teachers and readers of political economy in
America	LOCATION	have long felt the need of a treatise containing a full , but clear and simple , popular ex - position of the principles of money a book that should do much the same service for American read - ers as the late
Stanley Jevons	PERSON	did for English readers in his admirable '' Money and the Mechanism of Ex - change . ''

		Several attempts have been made in this direction , the last in the series being Mr.
Tren	PERSON	- holm 's '' The People 's Money . ''

		The judgment of the reading public must decide whether Mr.
Trenholm	PERSON	has succeeded in producing a book that will at once stimulate and satisfy the interest for instruction in this subject .

		He certainly shows some excellent qualifications for his task , but he lacks the power of vivid description , of clear and simple statement , of making pointed analogies and concise summaries , all of which are so needful in popular exposi - tions .

		His literary style is , we venture to think , too dignified and impassive to appeal to the aver - age mind .

		Less fault may , however , be found with the contents of this manual .

		Its general trend may be conjectured from the imprint the upper cover bears of the gold double-eagle .

		Bimetallism is only incidentally discussed , but much space is given to the banking question .

		The writer is a warm friend of bank-currency , but he insufficiently estimates the extent and importance of bank-issues in the form of '' deposits '' as distinguished from notes .

		No cur - rency lesson needs to be so thoroughly taught to the American public at this critical juncture as that , not gold and silver , not greenbacks nor bank-notes , but credits , in the shape of bank deposits , are the most important constituent of our circulation that one upon which the general level of prices , in the end , depends .

		Occasionally Mr.
Trenholm	PERSON	falls into time-honored superstition ; as when , in his zeal - ous argument for banks , he writes : '' It is certainly true that the increase of bank-note issues tends to reduce the rate of interest on commercial loans . ''

		This is not only a false but a dangerous doctrine to teach ; for , were it as true as Mr.
Trenholm	PERSON	's lan - guage implies , it would go a long way toward jus - tifying the popular demand for more money .

		It is not unusual , in these days when the pride of authorship has taken hold of so many young minds , to meet with books for whose publication it is hard to discover any adequate reason .

		Of this character is Mr.
Sidney Sherwood	PERSON	's `` History and Theory of Money . ''

		The volume is made up of a number of
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	- lectures extem - poraneously delivered to a popular
Philadelphia	LOCATION	audience , with a verbatim report of the class dis - cussion which followed .

		Whatever excuse may exist for the mode of education of which Mr.
Sher	PERSON	- wood 's book is a product , it is sincerely to be hoped that , if publication in the present form is an essen - tial ingredient of the process , some method may speedily be devised for sparing the reading public a recurrence of such shocks to its sense of literary propriety as come from the perusal of such a vol - ume as this .

		The author 's plea for publication '' the more scholarly education of practical men and the more practical education of scholars '' im - plies a gratuitous assumption of ignorance on the part of both classes of readers .

		It would be painful to believe that either our '' practical men '' or our '' scholars '' had become reduced to the sad necessity of looking to such a work for either in - spiration or guidance .

		And certainly any true

		THE DIAL 55 friend of the
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	movement has a right to complain at the use of its good name as a shield for such immature effort .

		In his excellent monograph on `` Special Assess - ments , '' Mr.
Victor Rosewater	PERSON	has given us an in - teresting , original , and adequate discussion of an important but hitherto neglected topic in municipal finance .

		Special assessments are a peculiarly Amer - ican form of taxation , being a method of defraying the cost of local expenditures to property , under - taken , to be sure , in the public interest , but inuring to the particular advantage of the owner .

		The sys - tem originated in
New York	LOCATION	in the seventeenth century , and gradually spread , until now it has been adopted by all but four States of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Spe - cial assessments are everywhere regarded as an ex - ercise of the taxing power , but they are to be dis - tinguished from taxes proper .

		Hence the rule that taxation should be proportional to ability does not apply to special assessments ; the universally recog - nized principle of our law is that they must always be proportional to benefits received .

		Mr.
William Ripley	PERSON	has made a very interesting contribution to the history of colonial finance in his `` Financial History of
Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		Indirect taxes , as in all young communities , were the principal re - source of the colony , and the main burden rested upon tobacco , the staple product of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		An export duty was imposed on tobacco , but it is un - likely that it was paid by the foreign consumer ; it amounted , in fact , to a disguised land-tax on the colonial grower .

		The other financial expedients of the colony were of the same primitive character , and were gradually rejected as sounder ideas in tax - ation began to prevail .

		Professor
Scott	PERSON	's `` Repudiation of State Debts '' is a thorough discussion of one of the strangest phe - nomena in the history of American finance .

		Twelve of the States have , at one time or another , taken advantage of their quasi-sovereign rights to '' scale '' or repudiate their debts .

		As the law stands to-day , the holder of a repudiated bond has no legal means of enforcing the payment of the obligation .

		Dr.
Scott	PERSON	carefully examines the acts of repudiation passed by the various States , and gives an analysis of the causes that have led to the use of so violent a financial expedient .

		Repudiation has seldom been resorted to except under circumstances of heavy financial pressure , and when the people believed that it had been betrayed by an unscrupulous legis - lature .

		Most of the States have tried to prevent the recurrence of similar abuses by limiting the amount of debt that may be contracted by the legis - lature .

		This is , however , a plainly unsatisfactory remedy ; and Dr.
Scott	PERSON	proposes the institution of State courts , with power to adjudicate cases involv - ing the validity of bonds , and with power to issue writs of mandamus compelling the tax-officers to include in their assessments an amount sufficient to cover the debts adjudged valid .

		Impressions of
America	LOCATION	.

		Prince
Serge Wolkonsky	PERSON	, after spend - ing the
summer	DATE	at the World 's Fair , has beat a retreat , letting fly two Par - thian arrows on the way .

		In other words , he has col - lected his occasional '' Addresses , '' made during the
summer	DATE	, into one booklet , and jotted down his '' Im - pressions '' in another -LRB-
Unity Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The addresses are kindly in feeling , but rhetorical and diffuse in style , evidently not prepared to be printed .

		They have a great deal to say about religious unity and the brotherhood of man , and incidentally sug - gest that the Midway Plaisance might have been made an excellent `` school for teaching human brotherhood . ''

		Of that characteristic feature of the Fair he further says : '' For me it is the most sad thing I know , because it is human life exposed as a show ; human beings deprived of their feelings , and reduced to the state of a catalogued exhibit , a mov - ing panorama of empty human forms . ''

		Prince Wolkonsky 's impressions are in many chapters upon as many subjects .

		The chapter on '' Politicians '' is a gem : '' Thank God , I have not known one of them ! ''

		This is all , but what more need be said ?

		He has a little fun at the expense of the amiable people who thought that he , as a Russian , must be a nihilist , and that
Russia	LOCATION	was an uncivilized country .

		One interlocutor even wanted to know if the
Bible	LOCATION	had been translated into Russian .

		The same gentleman remarked : `` I think your music is much too good for such a nation as yours . ''

		The urbanity of the reply is in charming contrast with the ill-breeding displayed by the remark that occasioned it .

		`` I thought American music was much too bad for such a great nation as they are . ''

		Our impressionist de - fines a reception as '' a social entertainment intended to kill all sociability by depressing and levelling all individuality . ''

		And he adds : '' Oh , deliver us from those entertainments where we say to ourselves , ' Oh , what a bore ! '

		and to others , ' I am so glad to meet you ! ' ''

		The impressions of '' Woman '' take the form of an imaginary interview upon the writer 's return home .

		He cheerfully answers the questions put to him .

		until someone inquires about the Amer - ican female voice .

		The answer is evasive : '' You are very little civilized if you do n't know how it sounds .

		American voices are too well known all over
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		That Prince Wolkonsky has read our newspapers to some purpose is evident from the passages we have selected for final quotation . ''

		You will seldom find in the daily press a serious critique .

		If you have missed a lecture or a concert , you can - not learn from the papers of the following morning whether you lost or gained by not having gone ; you will find a minute description of the lecturer 's physique , his dress , the number of people present , a list of names -LRB- always the same ones , oh , not much variety in that , but people like to see their names reported , and others find a sort of painful delight in reading them over and over -RRB- .

		in having for his biographer a man thoroughly in sympathy with his art and intimately acquainted with his life ; consequently in Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
Winter	DATE	's '' Life and Art of Edwin Booth '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- we have a work of high value in the history of dramatic art during the generation that is just passing away .

		For many years Booth stood at the head of his profession .

		Never until Mr.
Irv	PERSON	- ing appeared did Booth meet with a rival .

		He had eclipsed Forrest .

		He had nothing to fear from
Davenport	LOCATION	,
Brooke	PERSON	,
Murdoch	LOCATION	,
Adams	PERSON	,
Dillon	PERSON	, Mar - shall ,
Wallack	PERSON	,
Fechter	PERSON	,
Barrett	PERSON	, or
McCullough	PERSON	.

		Not till Mr.
Irving	PERSON	came to
America	LOCATION	did Booth ever have reason to understand that his star had passed its meridian and was beginning to descend .

		He did not believe in the new school .

		To the end he stood fast by the old-fashioned standard of poetic tragedy , the grand manner , the elocutionary not less than the mimetic art .

		But he recognized that there is an inevitable fate in such changes ; and one of the sweet - est of his characteristics was the gentle patience , the cheerful resignation , with which he accepted the new order of things , although he could not defer to the new lights of art .

		The chief public work of Booth 's life was his effort to establish a great theatre , to be conducted in a high and liberal spirit and to be de - voted to all that is grand and fine in dramatic lit - erature and art .

		He built and for more than four years managed a theatre according to these high ideals .

		But being better as an actor than as man - ager and financier , his health suffered under the strain of care , and forced him to abandon the under - taking .

		These and other interesting incidents are fully detailed in Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's
Life of Booth	ORGANIZATION	, which occupies the first 150 pages of his work .

		Part II. , of about the same length , is devoted to `` The Art of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, '' and includes descriptions of all his leading roles , seventeen in number , mostly Shake - spearian .

		The volume concludes with a large num - ber of memorials , in verse and prose , offered at the time of his death , last
June	DATE	.

		There was no lack of books in the .

		Professor
Oliver J. Thatcher	PERSON	, of the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago , for his literary labors resulting in '' A Sketch of the History of the Apostolic Church '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , but whatever other merit his book may have it is probably the most readable of them all .

		A brief note of acknowledgment of assistance ren - dered by two of his colleagues in preparing it for publication is all that the book has by way of pref - ace .

		The exceedingly terse dedication , `` To my Teacher , Prof.
Adolf Harnack	PERSON	, '' supplies the defi - ciency , however , and suggests whence the author derives the materials for his treatment of his sub - ject .

		Even under such a thorough teacher our au - thor 's study has been obviously partial , and he seems to infer that what is a new discovery to him must be new to his readers .

		He makes many assertions , therefore , with the air of one who is about to sur - prise his readers ; whereas there is little in the book that is new , unless it be some of the author 's deduc - tions .

		There are cases where he is rather too free with the expression `` no one knows , '' where an ad - mission of his own ignorance would have been suf - ficient .

		The most conspicuous purpose of the book appears to be to controvert all known theories of church polity derived from Apostolic times .

		The
Apostolic Church	ORGANIZATION	, as Professor
Thatcher	PERSON	is at pains to picture it , exists now neither in its polity nor in its doctrine .

		A volume of sketches in
New Mex	LOCATION	- * co re ji ces i n tne cabalistic title `` The Land of Poco Tiempo '' -LRB-

		The author is Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	, and the following preamble to the opening paper ena - bles us , in a way , to read his title clear : '' Sun , silence , and adobe , that is

		If a fourth were to be added , it need be only to clinch the three .

		It is the
Great American Mystery the National Rip Van Winkle	ORGANIZATION	the

New Mexico	LOCATION	'' the anomaly of the Republic , '' he calls it , of its mot - ley populace , its antiquities , its curious survivals of pre-Columbian rites and customs , its ancient walled cities , etc. , is decidedly interesting .

		A unique chap - ter is devoted to '' New Mexican Folk-Songs , '' a number of which are given , with the notes .

		The volume is liberally illustrated with photographic plates .

		The volume in whichjthe late Dr.
Wil	PERSON	- helm
Moeller	PERSON	,
Professor of Church History	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Kiel	ORGANIZATION	, set forth , as viewed from his standpoint , the '' His - tory of the Christian Church '' for the first six centuries , was reviewed in THE DIAL for

		The second volume of the series contemplated by its learned author is now before us , translated from the German , as was the first , by Mr.
Andrew Ruth	PERSON	- erfurd ,
B.D.	LOCATION	, and comprising an octavo volume of 553 pages -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It carries the narrative through the Middle Ages ; that is to say , from the beginning of the seventh to the
end of the fifteenth century	DATE	.

		These nine centuries are as fruitful in picturesque incidents and heroic characters as any , yet the author and translator between them have succeeded in divesting the narrative of every parti - cle of the picturesque , and in reducing it to the driest possible recital of events .

		That the details of history are conscientiously set forth we doubt not and , as in the previous volume , the bibliography The Christian Church in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		is complete .

		The book is , therefore , invaluable for reference and as a historical directory .

		But the typography is of a very complex character , and reading is thereby made exceedingly laborious .

		Even in a theological school , the book could not be used as a text-book except at the risk of disgusting the students with this very important branch of theological culture .

		A very pleasing relic of our Puritan forefathers is the volume called '' Some Old Puritan Love-Letters '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		They comprise a portion of the correspondence -LRB- fifty-eight letters -RRB- between
John Winthrop	PERSON	, first Governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and his wife ,
Margaret Tyndal Winthrop	PERSON	, between the years
1618	DATE	and
1653	DATE	.

		These letters are far from being models of the epistolary art ; they are barren of lit - erary reference and almost entirely lacking in men - tion of contemporary events ; their charm -LRB- and it is not slight -RRB- is in their antique flavor and in their ten - der yet formal tone , in such marked contrast with the more familiar manner of the letter-writing of the present .

		Another characteristic of the time ap - pears in their devout and religious atmosphere .

		The Governor addresses his wife in phrases like this : '' I salute thee hearty lye , giving thanks to God who bestowed thee upon me and hath continued thee unto me , '' etc. .

		Nor is the wife less piously minded : `` My good husban , I thanke you for putinge me in minde to be cheerful , and to put my trust in my good God who hath never fayled me in time of nede .

		I be - seech him to continue his mercy still to me and grant that my sinnes may not provoke his anger against me . ''

		This quaint and unstudied correspondence is a delightful means of coming close to the domestic life of our
New England	LOCATION	ancestors .

		The little volume is made up of nine - teen `` Nature Sketches , '' largely the fruit of per - sonal observation , and it is well freighted with the lighter lore of the woods and fields , ponds and streams , hedgerows and coppices of
Old England	LOCATION	.

		The style of the book recalls
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	, but there is more literary allusion , and the author has evidently looked at nature through spectacles more scientific than poetical .

		The little essays are pleas - antly written , and are well adapted to stimulate young readers to a systematic study of Nature .

		The one hundred and thirty-eight woodcuts are nicely done , and add to the educative value of the text .

		The second volume of Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's The Writings of edition of the Writings of
Thomas Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	.

		_ x ,
Jefferson	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- covers the years 1776-1781 , years of activity in resisting the efforts of
Great Britain	LOCATION	to subdue the rebellious Colonies , during which
Jefferson	PERSON	displayed those qualities of statesmanship which won the confidence of Wash - ington and secured for him the office of Secretary of State in the new government .

		Whether as mem - ber of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or of the
Virginia Assembly	LOCATION	, or as Governor of that
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, he strengthened the Colonial cause and liberalized the government .

		The correspondence and papers in this volume show how thoroughly
Jefferson	PERSON	gave himself to his coun - try during this trying period .

		Of course the most interesting of the contents of this volume a docu - ment in itself of sufficient importance to secure im - mortality to any man is the Declaration of Inde - pendence .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	has given in parallel columns the first draft from the copy in the writing of
John Adams	PERSON	, the draft reported by the committee which is taken from
Jefferson	LOCATION	's rough draft reproduced here in fac-simile from the original in the Depart - ment of
State	ORGANIZATION	, and the engrossed copy .

		The useful Itinerary and Chronology begun in the first volume is continued in the second .

		A belated holiday publication , and A new version i / - ^ of George Sand 's one of unusual merit , is George Sand 's `` Fadette '' -LRB- the original of '' Fanchon the Cricket '' -RRB- , translated by Miss
Jane Minot Sedgwick	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. George H. Richmond & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		An etched frontispiece by
E. Abot	ORGANIZATION	, printed in
Paris	LOCATION	, hand - made paper with rough edges , careful press - work , and a novel binding of gray paper boards and muslin joints , give finish and symmetry to the dainty volume , which must appeal alike to the ad - mirers of George Sand and the lovers of handsome books .

		Fortunately for the little volume , its sale does not depend upon the holiday trade , and it will doubtless find its way into the possession of collec - tors until the limited issue is exhausted .

		We should add that the `` brief , rich , melancholy sentences '' of
George Sand	PERSON	, as rendered into English by
Miss Sedgwick	PERSON	, have not a little of the charm which their originals had for
Thackeray	PERSON	, to whom they seemed '' like the sound of country bells , provoking I do n't know what vein of music and meditation , and fall - ing sweetly and sadly on the ear . ''

		These are described in a popular way , from the standpoint of both the spec - tator and the player .

		The book is evidently in - tended chiefly for beginners ; though in parts nota - bly in the chapters on foot-ball and base-ball the writer has gone more into detail on the points of science and skill , and has thus made the book val - uable to advanced students of these games .

		The schoolboy will find in it much useful information concerning the organization and training of teams , as well as explanations on points of skill .

		58 THE DIAL -LSB-

		An amusing col - lection of Bulls and Blunders .

		The drift of Mr.
Marshall Brown	PERSON	's collection of '' Bulls and Blunders '' -LRB-
Griggs	PERSON	-RRB- is sufficiently indicated in the title .

		The contents of the book are drawn from many sources , and it is not without educative value in that the '' blunders '' quoted are largely solecisms arising from loose syntax .

		The '' bulls , '' as may be expected , are chiefly furnished by the cheerful sons of
Hibernia	ORGANIZATION	who , whatever their failings , have certainly contributed freely to the gayety of nations .

		We subjoin a specimen of tribunal eloquence quoted from
M. Taine	PERSON	's '' French Revolution '' : `` I would , '' roared an orator in one of the sections , `` take my own head by the hair , cut it off , and , presenting it to the despot , would say to him , ' Tyrant , behold the act of a free man ! ' '

		This is almost as good as Sir
Boyle Roche	PERSON	's plaint : '' The progress of the times , Mr.
Speaker	PERSON	, is such that little children who can neither walk nor talk may be seen running about the streets cursing their Maker . ''

Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	is always a charming writer .

		His `` Old Town by the Sea , '' which forms the subject of his latest volume in prose -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is of course Ports - mouth , which , under the name of `` Rivermouth , '' has become so familiar to us through his stories , and was his boyhood 's home .

		In this volume Mr.
Aid	PERSON	- rich has collected the history , traditions , and descrip - tion of the old
New Hampshire	LOCATION	town , from its first settlement in
1623	DATE	until the present .

		In themselves these stories and events are no more picturesque or fascinating than those of the average
New England	LOCATION	town ; but for the same reason that the `` Bad Boy '' won our love and admiration when his deeds were related by the sinner himself , so these trifles become delightful through the magic touch of their historian and lover .

		The characters in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays never cease to furnish attractive lit - erary themes .

		`` The Trial of Sir
John Falstaff	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
A. M. F. Randolph	PERSON	, has for its second title '' Wherein the fat knight is permitted to answer for himself concerning the charges laid against him , and to attorney his own case . ''

		The author , evidently a lawyer , makes skilful citations from the Falstaffian portions of the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	text and strings them together adroitly .

		Various other matters , not strictly collateral , are introduced , such as speculations on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life , criti - cal comments on his genius , an amusing thrust at Mr.

		It is historical , descriptive , and technical enough for actual guidance .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
January 9 , 1894	DATE	.

		The author of '' Dodo , '' Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	, has re - cently been taking a trip through the Continent .

		He has just written a letter to a friend in this country , deal - ing with the apparent publication here of two author - ized editions of his well-known novel .

		The letter is dated
December 19	DATE	, at
Athens	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and in it he says : '' I published this year in
England	LOCATION	a novel called ' Dodo , ' but as it was not published in
America	LOCATION	I lost copyright there .

		A few months later Messrs. D. Ap - pleton & Company offered me terms for publication in
America	LOCATION	, which I accepted . ''

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	then goes on to say that he afterward received a proposition from another American publisher , which , naturally , he declined .

		He complains that the second publisher pro- ceeded with his edition , and copyrighted it under his own name , although the book itself was not entitled to American copyright .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	thinks that this was made possible by the substitution of intentional mis - prints in the text .

		In conclusion he writes : `` I should like to state directly that the edition published by
Messrs. Appleton & Company	ORGANIZATION	is the authorized edition , and that the other edition has been issued contrary to and in spite of my expressed wishes . ''

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's letter seems to raise an important point in the copyright question , namely : whether or not copyright can be se - cured in an uncopyrighted book by an unauthorized per - son through changes in the text of the book .

		The publication of the late
Herman Melville	PERSON	's works , which was carried on for a short time through an '' ar - rangement with the
United States Book Company	ORGANIZATION	by another firm , has now been resumed by one of the co - ordinate firms which make up the Book Company .

		It has been a great satisfaction to all concerned in the re - issue of
Melville	LOCATION	's works to observe the fresh interest which the public has taken in them .

		They have sold well , and copyright returns have accrued to Mr.
Mel	PERSON	- ville 's family .

		An interesting feature connected with their publication is that when editions of the American sheets of '' Typee '' and Omoo '' were placed on the English market by the
London	LOCATION	branch of a
New York	LOCATION	house , it was found that the former
London	LOCATION	publisher of '' Typee '' and '' Omoo , '' having purchased the copy - right of those books outright from Mr.
Melville	PERSON	for a comparatively small sum , still held the English rights .

		He allowed the small American edition imported to be sold , but declined to permit any further importations , on the ground that the American edition was no im - provement on his own .

		This English publisher has now reprinted these books from the plates made many years ago , inserting some illustrations of
South Sea	LOCATION	life and scenery , and is meeting with a good deal of criti - cism for doing so , one paper saying : '' We regret to add they -LSB- the books -RSB- have been printed from very old and worn plates . ''

		As Mr.
Melville	PERSON	's family is paid a roy - alty on all copies sold by the
United States Book Company	ORGANIZATION	, and as these English plates were in such a battered condition , it seems a pity that the English pub - lisher could not have assented to some equitable ar - rangement in the matter .

		The new editions of volumes by members of the En - glish pre-Raphaelite group are gradually appearing .

		I have been especially interested in the new and enlarged edition of '' Goblin Market , '' by Miss
Christina G. Ros	PERSON	- setti , with illustrations by
Laurence Housman	PERSON	.

		The large paper copies are very attractively gotten up .

		Mr.
Hous	PERSON	- man has , in his designs , followed the theme set by
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	in the two illustrations made for the first edi - tion of the book .

		Another volume by
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	, also published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Company	ORGANIZATION	, is `` Sing Song : A Nursery Rhyme Book , '' with over one hundred illustrations by
Arthur Hughes	PERSON	, one of the younger members of the pre-Raphaelite group .

		Unless I am mistaken , this is a compilation of several smaller volumes written and illustrated by
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	and Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	.

		It is well to have all the latter 's designs under one cover .

		Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	who is thought by some author - ities to be the leading minor poet of
England	LOCATION	at first published his verse only in limited privately-printed edi - tions .

		These very esthetic-looking volumes were issued from the press of
H. Daniel	PERSON	, of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first of them , called simply '' Poems , '' was published , and pur - chased by a few Americans , at six shillings .

		Copies are now held by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons and by
William Evarts Benjamin	PERSON	, of this city , at
$ 25.00	MONEY	.

		An - other volume , `` The Feast of Bacchus , '' published in
1889	DATE	, is now held by the same booksellers at
$ 35.00	MONEY	. ''

		The Growth of Love , '' issued in
1890	DATE	, is now quoted at
$ 20.00	MONEY	.

		More recently Mr. Bridges seems to have overcome his objection to publishing in the regular way , as the issuing of his '' Humors of the Court : A Com - edy , and Other Poems , '' by
Messrs. Macmillan	PERSON	, would indicate .

		Of the limited editions just mentioned , from a hundred to a hundred and fifty copies only were printed .

		It is said that Mr.
Edward Fuller	PERSON	, author of '' The Complaining Millions of Men , '' a novel in which some prominent Bostonians are introduced as characters un - der faintly disguised names , has a new work of fiction in hand .

		J. S. Van der
Poorsen Schwarz	PERSON	, otherwise ``
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	, '' has prefixed to his new novel , '' The Greater Glory ; a Story of High Life , '' which Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	& 60 -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	,
Co.	ORGANIZATION	are just about to publish , the following emphatic Note : ''
Holland	PERSON	is a small country , and it is difficult to step out in it without treading on somebody 's toes .

		I there - fore wish to declare , once for all , and most emphatically , that my books contain no allusions , covert or overt , to any real persons , living or dead .

		I am aware that great masters of fiction have thought fit to work from models ; that method must therefore possess its advantages : it is not mine .

		... I describe manners and morals , not individual men . ''

		The appearance of '' God 's Fool '' by ''
Maarteu Maartens	PERSON	'' led many people to believe that a new '' master of fiction '' had arisen in the Dutch '' sen - sitivist . ''

		The present work is likely to provoke con - siderable discussion .

		There is a mystical '' argument '' or parable at the opening of the book , which is a scorch - ing arraignment of the life depicted in the novel .

		Mr.
Schwarz	PERSON	, as is now pretty generally known , is a Dutch country gentleman , with a home at
Neerlangbrock	LOCATION	, Hol - land ; but he has adopted
England	LOCATION	, writes in English , and spends much time in
London	LOCATION	, where the Authors ' Society gave him a large dinner last year .

Francis Parkman	PERSON	will be prepared as soon as circumstances permit . ''

		To-day , '' a monthly magazine in the interests of the

		The price of the work to subscribers will be

		The Magazine of Poetry '' becomes , with its .


January	DATE	issue , a monthly .

		This issue is devoted to the Poets of
Buffalo	LOCATION	, among whom figure Bishop
Coxe	PERSON	, Mrs.
Rohlfs	PERSON	, Miss
Amanda T. Jones	PERSON	-LRB- whom we have always reckoned among
Chicago	LOCATION	poets -RRB- , Dr.
Frederick Peterson	PERSON	, and Pro- fessor
Henry A. Beers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The rest , numbering about two score , are unknown to other than local fame .

		We make this amusing extract from the printed pro- ceedings of
the Association of American Authors	ORGANIZATION	: `` A stirring letter from Col.
Richard Henry Savage	PERSON	was read in reference to a most uncalled-for and unjust criticism upon one of his late novels .

		His just indignation was warranted by the criticism , and the letter was placed on file to swell the volume of authors ' grievances . ''

		According to the
Bayreuth	LOCATION	'' Taschen-Kalender , '' the number of performances of
Wagner	PERSON	's works in the Ger - man language amounted in the year ending
June	DATE	last to 1,047 , an increase of 227 on the previous year .

		The later music dramas are now rapidly growing in favor , the representations of '' Das Rheingold , '' '' Siegfried , '' and '' Gotterdammerung '' having nearly doubled .

		`` The Psychological Review , '' to be published bi - monthly by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has just issued its first part .

		The contents include President
G. T. Ladd	PERSON	's address of last
December	DATE	before the
American Psycho	ORGANIZATION	- logical Association ; a study of
John Bunyan	PERSON	, from the pathological standpoint , by Professor
Royce	PERSON	; a group of studies from the
Harvard Psychological Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	, mainly by Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	, and a number of brief contributions , discussions , and reviews .

		It is evident that experimental psychology is to have much of the attention of this Review , although the editorial forces include several men who will doubtless see to it that the laboratory psychologists do not have things entirely their own way .

		The periodical is handsomely printed , and presents a dignified appearance .

		The
Winter Convocation of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	was signalized by the dedication of the
Kent Chemical Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	, and an address by Professor
Ira Remsen	PERSON	, of the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Laboratory , which is one of the most beautiful of the
University	ORGANIZATION	buildings , was the gift of Mr.
Sidney A. Kent	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and was erected and equipped by him at a cost of
$ 235,000	MONEY	.

		In his address on the present condition of
the University	ORGANIZATION	, President
Harper	PERSON	reported an enrolment of 773 students , an increase over last year of twenty-five per cent .

		The President also took occasion to state that the
University	ORGANIZATION	had no connection with a student periodical recently issued under circumstances calculated to mislead the public , and to add that the
University	ORGANIZATION	has never had the slightest intention of publishing a literary magazine of any sort .

		The report , based upon a fabrication of one of the
Chicago	LOCATION	newspapers , that such a step was contem - plated , has received wide circulation and credence , and has proved very mortifying to the
University	ORGANIZATION	authorities .

		Among the new appointments announced by the Pres - ident , we note with peculiar satisfaction that of Mr.
S. W. Burnham	PERSON	to a professorship of practical astronomy .

		The Very Rev.
Charles Merivale	PERSON	,
Dean of Ely	ORGANIZATION	, died on the twenty-seventh of
last month	DATE	, at the age of eighty - five .

		He was educated at
Harrow	LOCATION	,
Haileybury	LOCATION	, and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and was a preacher and lecturer at the Uni - versity of
Cambridge	LOCATION	at various periods between
1838	DATE	and
1865	DATE	.

		From
1848	DATE	to
1869	DATE	he was rector of Law - ford ,
Essex	LOCATION	, becoming
Dean of Ely	ORGANIZATION	in J869 .

		His '' His - tory of the Romans under the Empire '' was written during his
Lawford	PERSON	period , and the volumes , seven in number , appeared at intervals from
1850	DATE	to
1862	DATE	.

		In
1869	DATE	h published a rhymed translation of the `` Iliad . ''

		Other published works include the
Boyle	PERSON	lectures of
1864	DATE	and
1865	DATE	, entitled `` The Conversion of the Roman Empire '' and '' The Conversion of the Northern Na - tions '' ; a `` General History of
Rome	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1865 -RRB- ; `` The Roman Triumvirates '' -LRB- 1876 -RRB- ; '' Lectures on Early Church History '' -LRB- 1879 -RRB- ; and `` The Contrast Between Pagan and Christian Society '' -LRB- 1880 -RRB- .

		His great work was , of course , the '' History of the Romans under the Empire , '' which exactly fits into the gap between Momm - sen and
Gibbon	PERSON	, and which is one of the best-written and most picturesque historical works in the English lan - guage .

		Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	includes these notes on
Jokai	PERSON	and
Heine	PERSON	in a recent letter from
Europe	LOCATION	: '' It is im - possible not to contrast the imperial honors being show - ered from
Vienna	LOCATION	and all
Hungary	LOCATION	on
Moritz Jokai	PERSON	, who was a revolutionist in
1848	DATE	, and a banished exile a long time after , with the cold neglect and even the hos -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 61 tility which official
Germany	LOCATION	still shows the memory of
Heinrich Heine	PERSON	.

		The Hungarian author , during all the fifty years of writing , the completion of which was cel - ebrated to-day , never produced anything to stand for a moment in the world 's balance with the best of
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		Yet only a few years ago the
Berlin	LOCATION	police , in - heriting the stupid Prussian traditions of
1848	DATE	, confis - cated a whole new edition of his books , and still more recently the municipal authorities of
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's native
Dusseldorf	LOCATION	declined to allow a statue of its most famous son to be erected in the town .

		To avenge this , a Dus - seldorfer , who is an official in the service of the
Congo State	ORGANIZATION	, writes home that he has erected a stone monu - ment to
Heine	LOCATION	in the wilds of
Central Africa	LOCATION	, with a poetic inscription saying that the savages of
Ethiopia	LOCATION	are more tolerant than the citizens of the Rhenish seat of the Arb . ''

		A case to which we referred some time ago has come up again iu the French courts , on appeal , and the judg - ment formerly rendered has been confirmed in principle .

		The original suit was brought by the
Comte de Sesmai	ORGANIZATION	- sons , formerly French minister to
Hayti	LOCATION	, against the
Paris	LOCATION	branch of the publishing house of
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	, for damages for the sale of a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper which contained an article which the plaintiff alleged to be libellous .

		The court condemned Messrs.
Brentano	PERSON	to pay a fine of 100 francs and 5,000 francs costs .

		This is the first case of the kind that has come up , and the decision seems to be in plain accordance with article 42 of the law on the press , which allows the prosecution of simple vendors '' in default '' of managers , authors , or printers .

		The court held that the proprietors , publisher , and editor of the
New York	LOCATION	paper , being foreigners , were out of the reach of French law , and that , therefore , Messrs.
Brentano	PERSON	were amenable .

		Any foreign booksellers in
Paris	LOCATION	, therefore , may be prosecuted if they have in stock any book , pamphlet , or newspaper which contains any - thing libellous against any Frenchman named therein .

		The only satisfaction obtained from the appeal was a reduction of the costs to a nominal sum .

		BURNS 8 BIRTHDAY .

		In celebration of the approaching anniversary of the birth of
Burns	PERSON	-LRB-
January 25	DATE	-RRB- , a true Scotch lover of the poet inscribes the following lines '' To a brother
Scot on Burns	PERSON	's Birthday '' : Ho !

Jan. 16 , 1894	DATE	.

		THE DIAL-ITS WORK AND INFLUENCE .

		A guide and aid in In the flood of books pouring from Current Literature .

		t ne p re ss , there is so much to choose from that no person can , unaided , judge what is to be read and what left unread .

		Hence a journal that may be steadily relied upon as a safe and agreeable guide to the character , the contents , the merits and demerits of the important new books , is obviously of the greatest value to anyone of literary inclination or pursuits , and ought to be upon the table of every individual and fam - ily possessing or desiring literary culture .

		Such a journal THE DIAL has long been known to be .

		Estab - lished for fourteen years , it is approved by high author - ities as `` The leading literary journal of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		In its pages all books are described and discussed upon their merits , and without fear or favor .

		Some knowl - edge of the literature of the time is indispensable to all enlightened people , and there is no medium through which such knowledge may be better gained , and literary tastes be more easily acquired and gratified .

		Literary affairs
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	has a very definite aim in general .

		and scope , though by no means a narrow one .

		By concerning itself not with Books alone but with Literature in the largest sense , following the best models of the older countries in which the pros - perity and standing of journals of its type measure the current civilization , it makes itself distinctive in Amer - ica .

		It is preeminently '' A Journal of Literary Criti - cism , Discussion , and Information . ''

		In addition to its treatment of Books , it discusses literary movements and tendencies , gives information about literary people and events , and includes whatever pertains to literary affairs and related subjects of higher intellectual concern .

		Literature Foremost among such subjects is Ed - and Education .

		ucation , especially in its relations to literary culture .

		Believing that the study of literature , and the formation and encouragement of literary tastes , are of prime importance in education , THE DIAL will Published on the 1st and 16th of each month , at publish during
1894	DATE	-LRB- beginning with an early number -RRB- a series of articles and communications on the Teaching of English at
American Colleges and Universities	ORGANIZATION	, writ - ten by Professors at these institutions , and giving an ac - count of the practical work done and the advantages and disadvantages of particular methods and courses of study .

		93 THE PROTECTION OF IGNORANCE .

		Whatever one 's attitude may be towards the economic policy of protection , it will hardly be claimed that ignorance is among the na - tional industries that tariff legislation should seek to shelter .

		Yet any legislation that places obstacles in the way of our communication with the thought of other countries must be con - strued as imposing a tax upon enlightenment , and as tending to put ignorance at a premium .

		Actuated by a profound conviction that the logic of this position is unassailable , THE DIAL has sought -LRB- with a measure of success yet to be fully determined -RRB- to enlist the services of the friends of culture , irrespective of party , in an effort to secure the removal from our tariff laws of the duty upon books printed in the En - glish language .

		The response to our appeal has been very gratifying , and a large number of the blank petitions distributed by us have been filled with signatures , and presented by different members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work would have been undertaken more systematically , and at an earlier date , had we not taken for granted that the removal of this obnoxious duty would be one of the first things provided for in any in - telligent revision of the tariff .

		It would be difficult to devise a more stupid duty than this tax of twenty-five per cent upon the implements indispensable to the profession of the intellectual worker .

		As a means of pro- ducing revenue , its results are insignificant .

		And a very little examination will serve to show that it does not , that it can not , operate as a protective measure .

		The man who wants a pocket-knife , or a watch , or a suit of clothes , will take the article of American manufacture if a protective tax makes the corresponding ar - ticles of foreign manufacture too costly for his means .

		But the man who wants the poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, or the essays of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, or the political writings of Professor
Bryce	PERSON	, finds no corresponding American books that will do about as well .

		His purpose will not be suited by the poems of
Longfellow	LOCATION	, or the es - says of
Emerson	LOCATION	, or the political writings of Professor
Fiske	PERSON	.

		The suggestion that , as a good American , he ought to be contented with the latter works is too puerile to be taken seri -
68	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, ously .

		A man wants a book for some specific purpose , and no other book will do .

		If he can - not afford to purchase it , he must go without .

		And his disgust with the law that wantonly places the book beyond his reach will not help to make him a better American .

		It must be added , lest some of our readers should have for - gotten the fact , that the case of English books copyrighted in this country is covered by the Copyright Law itself , which requires their man - ufacture here , and does not merely tax , but pro- hibits , the importation of the English edition .

		The amount of the tax by no means meas - ures the annoyance that it occasions the pur - chaser .

		If he gets an English book from the bookseller , he finds that the tax has in some mysterious way become doubled , trebled , or even quadrupled -LRB- after the fashion of all indi - rect taxes -RRB- when he comes to pay it .

		The av - erage English book published at one pound is sold to the trade for about fourteen shillings , and upon this sum the duty is paid .

		But the American bookseller charges at least seven , and frequently eight , dollars for the book .

		Without the duty , he could sell it he would be forced by competition to sell it for five dol - lars or less , and he would realize upon it the profit now realized upon the sale of an aver - age American publication .

		But a still graver charge must be brought against the duty on English books .

		Dutiable articles are excluded from the mails by the regulations of our pos - tal service .

		It is true that these regulations are not enforced with absolute strictness , but they operate to make the American intellectual worker hesitate to avail himself of the simplest and most natural means of getting the books he wants , that of ordering them sent direct by post .

		If he happens to reside at a port of en - try , he may get his book by going to the cus - tom house and paying a sum estimated by some illiterate official whose notion of the value of books is about as accurate as his acquaint - ance with the dead languages .

		If , as is more likely to be the case , our seeker after knowl - edge does not live at a port of entry , he runs a more than fair chance of not getting his book at all .

		The amount of irritation produced by these conditions is not easily calculable .

		Those who conscientiously advocate the principles of a protective tariff should realize that it is the extreme of unwisdom to make their policy re - sponsible for a law that bears only a remote relation to that principle , that is chiefly pro- ductive of exasperation in the minds of intelli - gent people , and that gives our government the unenviable credit of seeking to impede the progress of culture .

		It is in every sense an unenlightened application of the protective prin - ciple , and one that the intelligent men of all parties should hasten to repudiate .

		Any opposition to the removal of this tax upon knowledge must come from the book - sellers and the publishers .

		In the case of the former , it is evident that a few of them the very few who have considerable stocks of En - glish books upon which duty has already been paid might be compelled to sell those books at a lowered profit .

		It would mean a marking down of prices to the extent of not more than
four cents	MONEY	to the shilling .

		In the case of the publishers , there could result no pressure of increased competition except in the case of re - cent reprints or new editions of old standard works .

		On the other hand , every one of the army of ill - paid teachers in our schools and colleges , every clergyman , physician , lawyer , or other professional worker , every student or investigator in whatever department of thought , every private individual accumulating a collec - tion of books for the purpose of self-culture , would be benefited by the removal of the tax , not only in pocket , but , as we have already pointed out , in increased facility of access to the storehouse of contemporary thought .

		How is it possible for anyone to urge that these vastly greater interests should be ignored from fear that their recognition might temporarily dis - turb the trade adjustments of a few purveyors of manufactured literature ?

		What is most needful at the present time is that the question should be considered seriously by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pressure of other subjects upon the attention of that body is so great that a duty which involves a question of principle rather than of large material interests is likely to receive scant consideration .

		The perpetua - tion of the impost upon books may follow from mere negligence ; it can hardly be the result of a deliberate and rational discussion .

		Fortu - nately , the text of the book section in the orig - inal draft of the
Wilson Bill	PERSON	is so faulty that it can hardly be adopted in the form reported .

		The clause exempting from the tax all books which contain the results of scientific observa - tions means nothing at all , and might , if adopted as it stands , lead to some extraordinary rulings .

		It might fairly be held , for example , to cover the Rougon-Macquart novels of
M. Zola	ORGANIZATION	, which would probably surprise the statesmen by whom it was framed .

		For the sake of clearness alone , the section must be in some way rewritten , and

EDR	ORGANIZATION	.

		DIAL . -RSB-

		According to the Catalogue ,
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	, or the
Academical Department of Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, has this year 1,086 students .

		There are four men to do the work in English , two full professors , Prof.
Henry A. Beers	PERSON	and myself , and two instructors , Dr.
W. L. Phelps	PERSON	and Dr.
A. W. Colton	PERSON	.

		Fifteen hours a week of English are offered , a three-hour course to Sophomores , two two-hour courses to Jun - iors , two two-hour courses to Seniors , and two two - hour courses to Juniors and Seniors alike .

		Elim - inating duplicates , 550 men avail themselves of the offer of English instruction , being rather more than one-half the number of students in the College .

		Of these , 283 , or all but three members of the class , are Sophomores ; the rest are Juniors and Seniors .

		One hour a week of English in the Freshman year , or , rather , three hours a week for twelve weeks , is laid down in the Catalogue , but , for laqjc of teach - ers -LRB- the lamented
McLaughlin	PERSON	having died in the
summer	DATE	vacation -RRB- , is not given during the current Academic year .

		None of the students at present in the
University	ORGANIZATION	has been required to pass an en - trance examination in English , though such a re - quirement goes into effect with the beginning of the next Academic year .

		All the Junior and Sen - ior work is elective ; the Sophomores choose five out of six prescribed subjects , these being Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, Modern Languages , Mathematics , English Literature , and Physics .

		As was seen above , all but three Sophomores elect English this year .

		In the
Sheffield Scientific School of Yale Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity there are 559 undergraduates .

		For this number two English teachers are provided , a full professor , Prof.
Thomas R. Lounsbury	PERSON	, and an in - structor , Mr.
H. A. Smith	PERSON	.

		Seven and a half hours of work in English are provided , a required course of one-half an hour per week for Freshmen , con - densed into three hours per week for the last six weeks of the year , a required course of one hour for Juniors , an elective course of three hours for Jun - iors , and an elective course of three hours for Sen - iors .

		The Freshman course is given to 228 men , the Junior required course to 175 , the Junior elect - ive course to 49 , and the Senior elective course to 30 , including two graduates .

		Hitherto , as in the
Academical Department	ORGANIZATION	, there has been no entrance examination in English , but this will be required in
1895	DATE	.

		The Freshman and Sophomore courses in
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	are outlined as follows -LRB- the
Freshman	ORGANIZATION	course was actually given last year -RRB- : ENGLISH .

		The required study of English Literature occupies three hours a week through one-third of Fresh - man year and the whole of Sophomore year .

		In Fresh - man year
Brooke	PERSON	's Primer is read , to give the student a view of the whole field ; three plays of Shakespeare and the minor
Engh	PERSON	` sh poems of
Milton	LOCATION	are read in the class-room .

		In Sophomore year the following authors are read ^ Spenser ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	,

Addison	PERSON	, Swift ,
Pope	LOCATION	, Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and Gray ; and the his - tory of the literature is followed in connection with the authors .

		Practice in composition work is afforded by the preparation of special papers on each author , which i & required of the whole class .

		Frequent preparation of brief papers on assigned topics .

		70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, Old and Middle English .

		-LRB- Two hours , both terms . -RRB-

		An elementary course in the beginnings and earlier development of the English language and literature .

		The first term is devoted to Cook 's '' First Book in Old English . ''

		In the second term this is followed by more difficult Old English texts , and by the reading of selec - tions from Chaucer and other Middle English writers for linguistic purposes .

		Tennyson .

		-LRB- Two hours , first term . -RRB-

		Critical study of selected poems .

		Tennyson 's theory of life , literary art , and place among the poets of this century .

		Comparative readings in other authors , and frequent preparation of brief papers on assigned topics .

		-LRB- Two hours , second term . -RRB-

		Critical study of a few selected plays .

		The
Leopold	PERSON	- edition of Shakespeare ;
Moulton	PERSON	's '' Shakespeare as a Dramatic Artist '' ;
Schmidt	PERSON	's `` Shakespeare-Lexicon '' ; annotated editions of single plays , etc. .

		Frequent pre - paration of brief papers on assigned topics .

		Of these the Catalogue offers the subjoined explan - ation , with one or two modifications necessary to conform the statements more accurately to the exist - ing condition of things : A course in Old and
Middle English	LOCATION	is offered to Jun - iors and Seniors , and is intended as an introduction to a study of the origins of our language and literature .

		A brief survey of the whole field of the History of English Literature is attempted , the aim being to give such a view of the mutual relations of the principal authors and epochs as may enable the student to plan courses of English reading and study with intelligence and judgment .

		Instruction in this course is given by means of
Brooke	PERSON	's Primer of English Literature and other text-books , supplemented by topical study pursued through the medium of papers prepared by the members of the class , which , after being read aloud , are made the subject of discussion .

		Opportunity is afforded for the critical study of a num - ber of individual authors in as many different courses .

		Among those most frequently studied at present are
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, two Elizabethans ,
Bacon	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and two eminent contemporaries of this century ,
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	.

		Stress is laid in these courses upon the distinctive personality and workmanship of the writer in question , but an endeavor is also made to promote the conception of literary masterpieces as wholes , as works of art subject to the laws of inner unity and har - mony , and not merely as texts for verbal study or col - lateral illustration .

		Authoritative statements concerning the courses of the
Sheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	are as follows : ENGLISH .

		The course is designed to give the student acquaintance with the great representative writers of the various epochs .

		A history of the language is one of the studies of the Freshman year ; and after that year the study of the language is made entirely subordinate to that of the literature .

		During the first term of Ju - nior year , however , extracts from Early English authors are read , and Early English Grammar is studied , so as to familiarize the student with the inflections then in use and the distinctions existing between the leading dia - lects .

		It is the aim of this term 's work to give such knowledge of forms , and to some extent of words , that the student will be able to read at sight any Early En - glish author whose writings do not involve special diffi - culties of language or vocabulary .

		With the second term , the regular study of English literature proper begins with Chaucer ; and for the rest of the course till the end of Senior year the following authors are read :
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Pope	LOCATION	, Gray ,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and later writers .

		Those men - tioned in the lists are always studied , but other authors not named are also taken up , the course varying some - what in different years .

		In all cases , complete works of a writer are studied , not extracts ; as , for instance , several of Chaucer 's Tales , and several of the plays of Shakespeare .

		The authors are taken up in chronolog - ical order , and the literary history of the time is like - wise carried on in connection with the great represent - ative writers of each period .

		ENGLISH COMPOSITION .

		This course , required of the entire Junior class , consists of weekly exercises based on selections from the writings of well-known authors , such as
Irving	LOCATION	, DeQuincey , and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		While it intends in the first place to give freedom of expression and the correction of the most obvious faults by practice in writing rapidly the substance of a passage previously assigned , it also aims to direct the attention of the student to qualities of style and meth - ods of composition , to arouse his appreciative interest in the works as literature , and to improve the quality of his writing by improving the quality of his thought .

		To this end occasional discussions of the selections read will occupy a part of the weekly hour .

		The courses of graduate instruction are given un - der the direction of the Philosophical Faculty which is distinct from that of
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	or of the Shef - field Scientific School , though naturally including the principal instructors from both .

		The courses in English are these , besides the undergraduate courses in the History of English Literature , Old and Middle English ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	: The English Literature of the
Fourteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor Beers : English Literature .

		-LRB- One hour , both terms . -RRB-

		The history of English Romanticism from
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	to
Swinburne	PERSON	-LRB- 1726-1890 -RRB- , with incidental study of the parallel movements in
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		The in - struction is given mainly by lectures .

		- Students are re - quired to keep and submit notes of their reading , and to prepare topical papers from time to time .

		Professor Cook : -LSB- The strictly graduate courses offered below will be given according to circumstances and the needs of the graduate students actually in attendance ; but special attention will be given to the supervision of individual research along these and similar lines . -RSB-

		Theories of Poetry .

		-LRB- Two hours , second term . -RRB-

		A course in the theories of poetry in general , and in the principles of criticism applicable to its various de - partments , as the epic , dramatic , and lyric .

		Discussions and papers on the basis of standard works , such as Aris - totle 's '' Poetics , ''
Sidney	PERSON	's '' Defense of Poesy , '' Addi - son 's '' Criticisms on Paradise Lost , ''
Boileau	PERSON	's '' Art of Poetry , ''
Lessing	PERSON	's `` Laokoon , '' and others of similar character .

		Old English Poetry .

		-LRB- One hour , first term . -RRB-

		The texts used are '' Judith '' -LRB-
Cook	ORGANIZATION	's edition -RRB- ,
Elene	PERSON	'' -LRB- Kent 's edition -RRB- , and '' The Battle of Maldon '' -LRB- Sweet 's
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71 Reader -RRB- .

		These are read , their place in literature ex - amined , and questions of authorship , date , and textual criticism discussed .

		Ten
Brink	ORGANIZATION	's and
Wiilcker	ORGANIZATION	's
Histo	PERSON	- ries of Old English Literature are constantly used for reference .

		Old English Grammar .

		-LRB- One hour , second term . -RRB-

		An exhaustive grammatical examination of some prose text is made , on the basis of
Cook	ORGANIZATION	's '' Phonological In - vestigation of Old English '' and edition of
Siever	PERSON	's Grammar for Phonology , of the latter for Inflection , and of
March	DATE	's
Grammar for Syntax	ORGANIZATION	.

		Historical English Prosody .

		-LRB- One hour , first term . -RRB-


Schipper	PERSON	's Englische Metrik '' is adopted as the basis of study , but reference is made to the discrepant views of other authorities .

		Middle English Grammar .

		-LRB- One hour , second term . -RRB-

		An outline of Middle English Phonology and
Inflec	PERSON	- tion is given by means of lectures , and the knowledge thus gained is applied in a grammatical study of Chau - cer , on the basis of
Ten Brink	ORGANIZATION	's `` Chaucers Sprache und Verskunst . ''

		It will be observed that there is at present no systematic instruction in Rhetoric in
Yale Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , and that in
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	composition is taught but incidentally , in connection with the preparation of papers in the literature classes .

		In the
Sheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	, Juniors receive instruction in com - position for an hour a week throughout the year .

		In estimating the amount of work performed by the members of the teaching staff , it must not be overlooked that , because of the size of the classes and the number of divisions , a three-hour course often represents twelve hours of instruction per week , and a two-hour course four or six , and that the professors who give undergraduate instruction are the only ones to offer courses in the
Graduate School	ORGANIZATION	.

		To compare the equipment in English with that in some other departments of the College proper it may be mentioned that this year there have been seven men in
Greek	LOCATION	, four professors , one assist - ant professor , and two instructors ; in Mathematics seven , three professors , two assistant professors , and two tutors ; and in
Latin	LOCATION	six , three professors , one instructor , and two tutors .

		Only one linguistic course in English is offered in
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	, and this is pursued by but three un - dergraduates , though by four or five times that num - ber of graduates .

		This will indicate that the study of English linguistics -LRB- the term philology of course comprises literary study -RRB- has not yet secured a firm foothold in the
College	ORGANIZATION	proper .

		The method of teaching most employed through - out the
College and Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	is a combina - tion of recitation and lecture , or recitations alterna - ting with occasional lectures .

		The combination of recitation and lecture might more accurately be de - scribed as recitation intermingled with discussion , or with informal comments by the instructor .

		The Seminar has not yet been introduced , but I expect to begin a graduate seminary in
Ben Jonson	PERSON	within the next three or four weeks , having , by way of stepping-stone , already organized a Journal Club , which is in successful operation , for reporting on professional periodicals .

		The general purpose of the undergraduate liter - ary instruction in both departments is to foster the love of literature and the development of the crit - ical sense , implying , as the latter does , the fullest appreciation of all excellent qualities .

		Methods vary , as they must , with the individuality of the teacher .

		The writer might formulate the especial object which he proposes to himself as the develop - ment in the student , whether graduate or under - graduate , of insight and power , and indeed he con - ceives this to be the end of all education whatever .

		The imparting of information seems to him quite a secondary object ; and a love for literature is most likely , as he thinks , to be promoted by the acquisi - tion of insight and power .

		Of course these terms must be taken in the broadest sense , so as to include the emotional and aesthetic faculties as well as the purely intellectual , the will and the moral nature no less than the reason .

		To this end no study can be better suited than English , its comprehensive - ness , variety , and richness of content rendering it an ` unsurpassed aliment of the spiritual life , while , by proper methods of instruction , it may be made a most effective instrument of spiritual discipline .


ALBERT S. COOK	PERSON	.


New Haven	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	,
Jan. 25 , 1894	DATE	. ''

		OLE A VE TO THINE ACRE . ''

		My neighbor was a forester , And ranged with bow and spear ; I was a simple gardener , And delved the whole round year .

		Time came when both a-weary were , And both resolved on change ; So he became a gardener , And I the woods did range .

		The seed springs never to the light , He chides the soil , the air !

		The forest genii , in despite , Adrift mine arrows bear !

		Folk say the woods be full of deer , The wild-flowers praise the soil : But flower nor game , the whole round year , Rewards our alien toil .


EDITH M. THOMAS	PERSON	.

		TRANSPLANTED GENIUS . ''

		What can we reason but from what we know ? ''

		While it is well known that to become an art critic one need not be a great painter , and that in literary reviewing one need not follow too closely the motto , '' Let such teach others who themselves excel , '' it is nevertheless an undeniable fact that familiarity with the subject to be treated is essential to that 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, gusto in the writer which is sure to interest the reader .

		Wicked men have written hymns , but never such as could rival those of
Watts	LOCATION	.

		Landsmen have written of the sea , but , with the possible exception of
Barry Cornwall	PERSON	, to very little purpose .

		I think it is safe to hazard the assertion that the true ring is almost always lacking unless the writer speaks of that which is a part of himself , of his experi - ence , of his '' properties '' either of race or of en - vironment .

		Christopher North who as an essayist reminds one of that passage in Ossian , '' Who comes like the strength of rivers when their crowded waters glit - ter to the moon , '' on one occasion makes allusion to the subject of transplanted genius .

		As illustra - tion of the fatefulness of this crucial test , he cites the case of Home , the author of ''
Douglas	PERSON	. ''

		This Highland youth , coming from the land of storm and rock , had produced a drama , the success of which was phenomenal .

		But when beckoning for - tune urged him to repair to
London	LOCATION	, his genius , in
North	LOCATION	's eloquent characterization , `` became Angli - iied , took a consumption , and died . ''

		All that per - tained to the north wind , the heather , or the snow , was property intellectual assets , familiar from childhood , out of which he might construct drama or ballad .

		But when he came among a more conven - tional people , with a tamer civilization , he grew homesick and ill at ease with an apprehension that to the self-contained Sassenach his finest eloquence must seem but tumid rhetoric .

		He was among a people whom he did not know .

		There is nothing in the daily life of
England	LOCATION	which could justify the explanation , '' My name is Norval , '' etc. ; and finally he sees himself confronted with what to his High - land spirit is the most discouraging element of all ridicule .

		Take a more familiar instance .

		Scott has for over half a century held an unassailable position as the great writer of dramatic fiction .

		Nothing is more remarkable in the author of '' Waverley '' than his marvellous versatility .

		How many sub - jects he touched , and with what skill !

		The strug - gle between
Norman and Saxon	PERSON	, in '' Ivanhoe '' ; the ferine tortuousness of Louis the Eleventh , in '' Quentin Durward '' ; the varied scenes from almost every era in Scottish history , how to the life !

		And no wonder ; for he had been an explorer of their dusty archives from his boyhood .

		The men of history he knew , and was of them .

		But when he comes to write of the sea ,
Micawber	PERSON	himself , in seaman 's attire , hitching his trousers and shivering his timbers , is not a more absurd figure .

		The great romancer was ignorant of nautical life , and his imagination could not save him .


Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	was confessedly his inferior in literary attainments , but as a writer he may be considered amphibious .

		Criticism hesitates to choose between those mas - terpieces , the `` Leather-Stocking Tales , '' so redo - lent of the woods and so breathless with peril , and those unsurpassed delineations of sea life , `` The Red Rover , '' `` Wing and Wing , '' `` The Water - Witch , '' '' The Sea-Lion . ''

		The explanation of this versatility is very simple :
Cooper	PERSON	was brought up amid the wilds and forests about
Otsego Lake	PERSON	, and was familiar with frontier life -LRB- of that day -RRB- and Indian tradition ; while his youth and early man - hood were spent at sea as a naval officer .

		But
Cooper	PERSON	, when he wrote `` The Bravo , '' had to do with things unfamiliar , and accordingly the public missed the joyous allure which made his former work so fascinating .

		Certain critics have assumed that
Burns	PERSON	was a poet who could write in two languages , and was not , therefore , limited to his original field ; and they assume this because the same hand that drew the masterpiece '' Tam-o-Shanter '' was also responsible for one of the sweetest idyls in the English lan - guage , '' The
Cotter	PERSON	's
Saturday	DATE
Night	TIME	, '' written in the purest
Saxon	PERSON	and in the Spenserian stanza .

		But ah !

		it was the same
Bobby Burns	PERSON	writing of the same people , and trying to show , for once , that his pathos needed no dialect to give verisimilitude .

		The scenes he describes are everywhere familiar to his boy - hood and throughout his brief manhood ; in short , he never wrote save of what he knew too well .

		So wholly are some authors aware of the neces - sity of personal experience in order to impart vrai - semblance to a narrative , that at times they decline to use invention except for the embellishment of their work ; that is to say , they do not literally write fiction , but apply to fact the '' light that never was . ''

		One day a
London	LOCATION	publisher called upon a little English authoress whose anonymous book had set the world `` murmuring like a hive of bees . ''

		I refer to the author of ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	' 1 a person - ality so shy , so reticent , that the writer 's sex was not revealed by the nom de plume .

		The publisher , adverting to the extraordinary sale of her second book , ''
Shirley	PERSON	, '' urged the continuance of her ef - forts in so successful a field . ''

		I can not , '' she re - plied , demurely , '' at least not for some years .

		I have written all that I know .

		I must live more . ''

		A similar illustration might be drawn from among the writers on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.


Bret Harte	PERSON	, after he had made his greatest successes , was often urged by publishers in
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	to write of scenes more familiar to the
East	LOCATION	, sub - jects less quaintly technical of the frontier than were those of his earlier stories . ''

		No , '' he replied , '' I was many years studying the life and language of the frontier .

		It would take me years to learn a new language to realize another life . ''

		Yet he tried the experiment , with what success , readers of '' Thankful Blossom '' can testify .

		In brief , when the most intelligent and skilful persons venture to write concerning countries or places other than their own either by birth , or adoption , or by residence , so long as to shut out earlier impressions they will seldom write other - wise than as the tourist .

		Madame de Stael wrote beautifully of
Germany	LOCATION	, but it is not the
Germany	LOCATION	that Teutons recognize .

		Longfellow wrote `` Hy - perion , '' a work of pure imagination , faintly tinct -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 tired with such German idiom as may be derived from books .

		Trollope and others have given us an Englishman 's
Italy	LOCATION	.


Frederika Bremer	PERSON	has written of I ' Homes in the New World '' but has not de - scribed them .

		Ccelum non animum qui trans mare currunt .

		We must conclude , however unchange - able may be our '' animum , '' however changeable our `` Coelum , '' we can not hope to describe success - fully any soil , any autocthones , but our own .


S. R. ELLIOTT	PERSON	.

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		`` JAPANESE METAPHOR AND SIMILE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
January 16	DATE	is a communication , un - der the above caption , from Mr.
Frederick Ives Carpen	PERSON	- ter , who discusses Mr.
Lafcadio Ream	PERSON	's and Professor
Chamberlain	PERSON	's statements concerning the use of simile , metaphor , personification , and allegory , among the Jap ^ anese .

		This is , in fact , a much mooted question , with the chances rather in favor of those two thorough stu - dents of `` things Japanese . ''

		And yet Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	cites a number of illustrations to the contrary ; and to these I beg to add a few , gathered in connection with the teaching of English in a government school in the interior of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		Time flies as swiftly as an arrow . '' ''

		When we think about the things of the past , all are like dreams . '' ''

		Of course , this fruit -LSB- the ` honor ' of graduation -RSB- could not be obtained without the flower , our own diligence and energy . ''

		When we consider our positions in a new society , we are like a ship in the broad , limitless ocean .

		We can not move without a compass . ''

		And , instead of arriving at our promised harbor , we shall strike against dreadful rocks and be broken into pieces , or we shall be destroyed by the raging waves . '' ''

		But hap - pily and fortunately we have received a compass with which we can move .

		What is that compass ?

		It is the education which we received in school . '' ''

		If we do not use the knowledge we have already received , we are only Hving book-boxes . ''

		So the Empire is our pa - rent . ''

		These sentences are all taken from a single graduating essay .

		A pupil of the same school once said to the foreign teacher : You are my light and my ship to across the sea of English language . ''

		The study of the etymology of Japanese words often reveals in the language fossil metaphors which are not uninteresting , but of which only a few examples at ran - dom may be cited here .

		The Japanese word for mule '' literally means `` rabbit-horse '' ; an `` animal '' is only a `` hairy thing '' ; the `` Adam 's apple '' is a `` throat - dumpling '' ; a `` glove '' is simply a `` hand-bag '' ; a '' porcupine '' is a `` pin-rat '' ; `` cream `` is the `` milk 's upper skin '' ; a '' dentist '' is , of course , a '' tooth-doctor '' ; the '' gums '' are '' teeth-roots '' ; molasses '' is '' sugar - honey '' ; and subjects '' -LRB- in composition -RRB- are '' seeds of speech . ''

		And yet the contention of Messrs.
Chamberlain	PERSON	,
Hearn	LOCATION	,
Dening	LOCATION	, and others , is in the main correct , at least from a comparative point of view .

		As a rule , the typical Japanese is very practical and matter-of-fact , as some of the fossil metaphors above cited show .

		He cares little for linguistic beauties , idealistic turns of expression , and metaphysical niceties .

		As a `` born '' esthete , he might be expected to enjoy the beauty of ngurative language ; but he is a lover of nature , of the real and the actual more than of the fanciful and the figurative .

		Mr.
Percival Lowell	PERSON	, in '' The Soul of the Far East '' has picturesquely followed out this same idea of the im - personality of Japanese thought as expressed in that language , m which inflectional or formational distinc - tions of gender and number and person are lacking He asserts that `` the idea of supposing sex where there is not even life is altogether too fanciful a notion for the
lar Eastern	ORGANIZATION	mind . ''

		But he is compelled to admit some personification in the deifying of natural phenomena the sun-goddess , the moon-god -LRB- dess ? -RRB-

		, the wind-god the fire-god , the thunder-god , etc. .

		He says , however , ' in respect to this : `` Even such personification of natural forces , simple enough to be self-suggested , quickly dis - appeared . ''

		And one thing at least is certain : that the Japanese , even though in his national childhood he deified the forces of nature , did not generally go so far with his spirit of fancy as , like the Greeks , to people the beau - tiful trees and flowers of his land with fairies .

		He ad - mired , and admires , the beauties of nature just as they are ; he loves a flower as a flower . ''

		A primrose by a river 's brim A yellow primrose was to him , And it was nothing more '' ; except that , as '' nothing more '' than a real flower , it was full of beauty .

		THE `` STAR SYSTEM '' IN PERIODICALS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It was a very apt criticism , when a certain periodical was spoken of by one of our most respectable dailies , a few years ago , as '' Mr.
Blank	PERSON	's sensational monthly newspaper . ''

		It is the great fault of the '' star system , '' discussed by a writer in THE DIAL of
January 16	DATE	, that it has supplanted a valuable type of literature with ma - terial which has its appropriate place -LRB- so much of it , I mean , as deserves any place at all -RRB- in the columns of the daily and weekly press .

		When the '' star '' is a Congressman or a Senator -LRB- the order here is intentional -RRB- the chances are that the '' Congressional Record '' and the morning papers will furnish us material from the same pen better in every respect than that which is se - cured by the '' star '' magazine editor .

		This could be demonstrated again and again by comparing speeches delivered in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	during the past year with articles printed in prominent Reviews from the same men .

		A quarter 's worth of postal-cards to Congressmen will se - cure more literature of that kind than a whole year 's subscription to one of these magazines ; and if Amer - ican thoughtlessness did not once in a while get the bet - ter of American thrift , the people would resort to the cheaper source of supply .

		Is it not within the range of possibilities that a really dignified Review , of the old-fashioned type and tradi - tions , should be produced and maintained in the
United States	LOCATION	?

		Such periodicals as THE DIAL , '' The Nation , '' and '' The Critic '' are doing an admirable work , which no one would be willing to see interfered with ; but their field is entirely different from that in question , and if the latter should be occupied they would be helped , not hindered , in their task .

		MASSACHUSETTS : Ax OBJECT LESSOX .

		* Six years ago , Mr.
Brooks Adams	PERSON	put forth a book entitled : '' The Emancipation of Mas - sachusetts , '' in which he took a very pessimis - tic view of his native State .

		We gave at the time an elaborate review of it in THE DIAL -LRB- Vol .

		VII. , p. 263 -RRB- .

		It was a book of large pretensions , of swaggering assertions , and of very little historical merit .

		The most striking incident concerning it was the fact that it was written by the youngest scion of a family which had been identified for many generations with the proudest annals of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and of the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	, and had furnished two Presidents of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There were callow and dudish symptoms in the style and treatment which almost disarmed criticism , and inspired the hope that the young man , as he matured , would recover the ancestral spirit and gripe , and see much to respect and venerate in the history of his native State , as his ancestors had done .

		In the review named , we spoke , by way of contrast , of the writings of those ancestors which were commendatory of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and of some excellent contributions by the author 's elder brother , Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	.

		We are now sorry to say that this elder brother has just put forth a book on Mas - sachusetts written in the same pessimistic spirit but not with the same feebleness and empty assertion as the one already noticed .

		It has bright and epigrammatic clauses , plausible half - truths , and stinging libels , which may be quoted with effect .

		It is an armory from which the bitter enemies of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and of the
Puri	PERSON	- tan fathers may draw the poisoned arrows they need .

		And this war-material is furnished by a son of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	!

		It was said of
John Adams	PERSON	, more than a century ago : '' If any one predicts what Mr.
Adams	PERSON	will do , it is certain that Mr.
Adams	PERSON	will do something else . ''

		This uncertainty as to `` what Mr.
Adams	PERSON	will do '' is a family characteristic , and honestly survives in the pres - ent generation .

		In drawing party lines , the Adamses were always the unclassified element ; for when it was least expected , they jumped their party traces . ''

		An Object Lesson .

		By
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Hough	PERSON	- ton ,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the title of Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	's book , for it shows what an able man and a vigor - ous writer , who has strong theological preju - dices , with some personal and family idiosyn - crasies , can do , if he tries , in writing about his native
State	ORGANIZATION	, the foundations of which were laid by his own ancestors .

		The work is any - thing but eulogistic ; and , with a few exceptional instances of just and impartial treatment , is cap - tious , narrow , bitter in spirit , and defamatory .

		It evidently was hastily thrown together , made up of old material , and shows slight information on the obscure points of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	history .

		Of the historians of the
State	ORGANIZATION	whom he prom - ised to write about , he says little besides fre - quently characterizing them as '' filio-pietistic writers . ''

		Dr.
Palfrey	PERSON	is the only one he names , and he seems to have for the amiable Doctor a special spite .

		His own father and grand - father and great-grandfather were writers of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	history .

		Would he regard them as '' filio-pietistic , perverting the facts and dis - torting the record '' ?

		By his over - worked expression , `` filio-piet - ism , '' he means '' filial piety '' or '' veneration for one 's ancestors . ''

		The compound word is doubtless his own invention ; for it is bad in construction and in signification , and is not in literature nor the dictionaries . ''

		Pietism '' and '' pietistic '' are English words , and do not have the meaning he assigns to them .

		They are de - rived from and used only in reference to the '' Pietists , '' a sect in
Germany	LOCATION	noted for strong religious feeling rather than intellectual ortho - doxy .

		Nevertheless , with the meaning of '' re - spect for one 's ancestors , '' our author uses them as terms of reproach ; whereas such respect is not only a natural and laudable sentiment , but in oriental countries is regarded as one of the highest virtues , and akin to religion .

		The lit - erary reputation of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	would be im - proved if his writings showed some symptoms of this quality .


John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, our present author 's grandfather , in a historical address delivered in
1843	DATE	, said : '' The primary cause of the various settlements in
New England	LOCATION	was religion .

		It was not the search for gold , nor the pursuit of wealth .

		It was the Christian religion purified and refined from its corruptions by the fires of persecution .

		With that religion was inseparably connected the code of Christian morals in its simplicity and purity a code , above all others , resting upon the fundamental principle of the natural equality of man - kind . ''

		The purpose for which
New England	LOCATION	was settled is thus stated in the preamble of the
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 compact of union made by the Commissioners of the four Colonies , in
1643	DATE	: '' Whereas , we all came into these parts of
America	LOCATION	with one and the same end and aim , namely : to advance the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to enjoy the liberties of the Gospel in purity and peace ; and whereas , '' etc. .

		The grand charge which the grandson brings against the founders of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and their descendants is , that they had too much reli - gion , and had the worst kind of religion .

		They were Calvinists , and believed in eternal punish - ment and hell-fire .

		Theirs , he says , was '' a religious practice or creed which has now be - come abhorent , and is recognized as morbid .

		The simple fact is that the Calvinistic , ortho - dox tenets of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries constituted nothing more nor less than an outrage on human nature . ''

		Such a statement , by an alleged historian of the nine - teenth century , would be comical , if it had not been written in sober earnest , and was not u An Object Lesson '' of the odium theologicum of a narrow and illiberal clique of historical writers which flourishes in our day .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	later shows what sort of religion the forefathers ought to have had .

		The misfortune is that they did not find such religion in the New Tes - tament , and it had not then been invented . ''

		The struggle for equality of man before the law , on the one hand , '' says Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, '' and freedom of conscience -LSB- or full religious tolera - tion , as he elsewhere terms it -RSB- , on the other , constitutes the theme of modern history .

		I propose to study them in our
Massachusetts	LOCATION	history . ''

		Like his theology , his definition of the scope of history is very narrow .

		That of
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	was much broader : '' His - tory is the record of the transactions of human beings associated in communities . ''

		The doc - trine of the equality of man was the offspring of Puritanism .

		That the peasant , in his rights before the law , was equal to the priest and the nobleman , was in the seventeenth century a new and strange theory , and contrary to the tradi - tions and social habits of the English people .

		The peasant was the last to comprehend the fact ; but it was doctrine of the English Com - monwealth .

		On the Restoration of
Charles II	PERSON	.

		the old social inequality came back , and it sur - vives in
England	LOCATION	to this day .

		The good seed of equality had been planted in the
Massachusetts Colony	ORGANIZATION	, and there found a congenial soil and rich fruitage .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	says : '' So far as equality before the law personal civil liberty is concerned , the record of no community seems to me more creditable , more consistent , than that of Mas - sachusetts .

		No other portion of the world was then ready to accept so startling a paradox .

		From the days , of the settlement , through the revolution , down to the fall of slavery , in the principles of civil liberty and human rights ,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	has always been in the front . ''

		The views of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	on this point are historically just and well expressed . ''

		As re - spects religious toleration , '' he says , '' it has been of a character wholly different . ''

		He means that the colonists did not allow inter - lopers and ranting sects to come in and break up their temporal and spiritual paradise .

		This is true , and it was a policy that needs no apol - ogy and scarcely an explanation .

		Self-defense is an instinct of human nature ; and unless the colonists had shut out the swarm of ranting and abusive religious sects which were ready to pounce upon them with the plea of relig - ious toleration , the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	would have been blotted out in less than five years .

		The plant - ers were making a settlement for themselves , where they might enjoy civil and religious freedom in peace and quietude .

		They knew , by the outrages committed by the anarchistic sects that had ravaged
Germany	LOCATION	and the
Neth	LOCATION	- erlands for nearly a century , and by experience with the new crop of fanatics that were then disturbing
England	LOCATION	, what the specious plea of religious toleration meant .

		The term '' tolera - tion '' the colonists hated ; and the sects that used it they dreaded .

		The Anabaptist disturbance began in Ger - many soon after the Reformation under Luther was in progress .

		It grew out of a controversy whether or not infants should be baptized , and whether or not persons baptized in infancy should be re-baptized when they joined their new sects .

		The original subject in dispute was soon lost sight of in the melee that followed ; but it gave a name to the wretched fanaticism .

		The sects that sprang up were very numerous , such as Antinomians , Familists ,
Dippers	ORGANIZATION	,
Waterlanders	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		They opposed alike the Re - formation and the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, demanded full religious toleration , and persecuted every - body else with fire and sword .

		Their head - quarters were at
Miinster	LOCATION	, in
Westphalia	LOCATION	, which they captured , and crowned
John	PERSON	-LRB- a tailor -RRB- of
Leyden	PERSON	as King of
New Zion	LOCATION	, They practiced polygamy ; and every excess of cruelty and im - morality abounded .

		Conservative parties and the civil government organized against them .

		Their leaders were captured , tortured to death with red-hot pincers , and hung up in iron cages as a warning to that sort of people .

		Their operations had extended to
Switzerland	LOCATION	and 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	,
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, and filled the minds of En - glishmen with horror and apprehension .

		When
Massachusetts	LOCATION	was settled ,
England	LOCATION	was filled with malignant , whimsical , heady , and fantastic sects , all holding to religious tolera - tion .

		Their purpose and practice were to make all the disturbance they could ; and they were ready to go to the ends of the earth to do it .

		To
America	LOCATION	they looked as a rich field for their pestering energies .

		Some professed to be in - spired , and to have special revelations from heaven .

		Their conduct in
England	LOCATION	was abusive and disorderly ; they were arrested by the po - lice , and filled the prisons and guard-rooms .

		They assailed churches , disturbed religious as - semblies , fought other sects , and , claiming full toleration , made themselves general nuisances .

		The Quakers now the mildest and most in - offensive of people were one of these disor - derly sects .


George Fox	PERSON	, their founder , spent most of his life in prison as a disturber of the peace , and for offenses which in
Chicago	LOCATION	to - day would send him to the Bridewell .

		A full catalogue and description of these sects and their principles may be read in the following contemporary publications : Heresiography ; or a Description of the Heretics and Sectaries sprung up in these latter times , etc. .

London	LOCATION	,

		These were the sort of advocates of religious toleration whom the founders of
Massachusetts Colony	ORGANIZATION	feared , and intended to keep out ; and their charter from the Crown was so drafted as to give them the right '' At all times hereafter , for their special defense and safety , to encounter , expulse , and resist , by force of arms , as well by sea as by land , and by all fitting ways and means whatsoever , all such person or persons as shall at any time hereafter attempt or enterprise the destruction , invasion , detriment , or annoyance of the said plantation , or inhabitants thereof . ''

		Their Charter , also , gave them in fee-simple the land within the bounds described ; namely , from three miles south of the
Charles	LOCATION	river to three miles north of the Merrimack river , and east and west from ocean to ocean .

		This land was not sold , but was allotted to towns and dis - tributed as a gift to their own people .

		Stran - gers were not allowed a residence , and much less citizenship .

		The colonists were legally a close corporation as much so as a modern land company , having the right to exclude persons whom they deemed undesirable as settlers , and to '' expulse '' those who gave them trouble .

		They put this right into operation as soon as they landed ; and during the first year they sent back to
England	LOCATION	fourteen interlopers and persons immoral or troublesome .

		During the first ten years they banished twenty such per - sons , which served as a warning to a multitude of malignant sectaries who would have come uninvited .

		As it was , they were pestered al - most beyond endurance by straggling fanatics who came in defiance of law and the rights of the colonists .

		What an idiotic policy it had been if they had proclaimed Toleration to all comers , as Mr.
Adams	PERSON	thinks they should have done !

		Fortunately , the founders of the Mas - sachusetts
Colony	ORGANIZATION	were not idiots .

		The world was not ready for Toleration .

		The different re - ligious sects , as a rule , then quarrelled and per - secuted each other as if by instinct .

		When the forefathers talked and wrote so earnestly about the blessings of religious lib - erty , they had in mind no abstract principle of general application ; for such an application was then impossible .

		They meant liberty for themselves the undisturbed opportunity of enjoying the rights of their own consciences , immunity from the errors , formalism , and per - secution of the English churches , and escape from the annoyances of the pestering sects that abounded in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is an old and stale charge , made by malig - nant enemies of the Puritans of whom Mr.
Adams	PERSON	appears to be one that the founders of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	were theorists , and came over to establish universal religious liberty which the said malignants define as general religious Toleration ; and , because it was not done , they heap upon the fathers every term of reproach , and Mr.
Adams	PERSON	styles those who have read and made history aright , '' filio-pietistie writers who have recourse to every form of sophistry to pal - liate or excuse this action . ''

		To the candid student of the early annals , nothing can be more obvious than the original opinions and in - tentions of the first settlers , and that they de - tested no expression more than the word '' Tol - eration . ''

		Their first Synod of
1637	DATE	, and the banishment of
Anne Hutchinson	PERSON	, with
John Wheelwright	PERSON	and their associates the same year , brought out the fact , with startling sig - nificance , that the
Massachusetts Colony	ORGANIZATION	was no place for religious cranks .


Nathaniel Ward	PERSON	, in his '' Simple Cobler of Aggawam , ''
1647	DATE	,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 said : '' My heart hath naturally detested tolera - tions of divers religions '' ; and yet he was the man who six years before had written the '' Body of Liberties of the
Massachusetts Colonie	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1641 -RRB- , the noble preamble of which has the ring of the Declaration of Independence ,
1776	DATE	: '' The free fruition of such liberties , immunities , and privileges as humanity , civility , and Christianity call for , as due to every man in his place and proportion , with - out impeachment and infringement , hath ever been , and will ever be , the tranquility and stability of Churches and Commonwealths ; and the denial ordeprival thereof , the disturbance , if not the ruin , of both . ''


Samuel Willard	PERSON	, in
1661	DATE	, said : '' I perceive they -LSB- the Quakers -RSB- are mistaken in the design of our first planters , whose business was not Tol - eration , but were professed enemies of it .

		Their busi - ness was to settle and secure religion to posterity ac - cording to that way which they believed was of God . ''

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	can not see how the record of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	differs from that of
Spain	LOCATION	under
Philip II.	PERSON	, of
France	LOCATION	under
Louis XIV.	PERSON	, and of
England	LOCATION	under the Stuarts .

		This is too simple a problem to resolve for his benefit at this time .

		He says '' a theological glacier set - tled down upon
Massachusetts	LOCATION	in
1637	DATE	which lasted for nearly a century and a half ; and generations grew up under the benumbing in - fluence of provincial life and teaching . '' ''

		Gla - cier , '' '' ice-period , '' and '' benumbing '' are the favorite and most frequent metaphors in the book .

		For a people under such frigid and be - numbed conditions , they were always vigilant , and at times unusually lively .

		In
1643	DATE	they formed a union , for the purposes of defense , with the other three
New England Colonies	ORGANIZATION	.

		By wise diplomacy and prudent delay , in
1664	DATE	they defeated the schemes of the four royal commissioners sent over to bring away their charter .

		They were not asleep nor hibernat - ing when , about that time , the Quakers came over to persecute them ; but , on the other hand , they made it quite lively for the Quakers .

		They carried on and finished up
King Philip	LOCATION	's War in
1675	DATE	, like good soldiers , and the Indians never discovered they were benumbed .

		By sea they made an expedition against Port Royal in
1690	DATE	, at their own expense ; and by a siege , in
1745	DATE	, captured
Louisburg	LOCATION	from the French .

		In the long French and Indian War which ended in the capture of
Canada	LOCATION	, they bore a conspicuous part .

		In the '' Great Awakening , '' or religious revival , of
1740	DATE	, Mr.
Adams	PERSON	thinks they displayed too much energy .

		How much Toleration was there in
Virginia	LOCATION	during that century and a half ?

		Hening 's
Virginia Statutes	LOCATION	at Large will give the infor - mation .

		The penalty for absence from the En - glish Established Church and no other preach - ing was allowed on a
Sunday	DATE	was a pound of tobacco ; and for a month 's absence fifty pounds .

		In
England	LOCATION	the fine for not attending church was 12d. , and for keeping a servant who did not go to church for a month , XI 0 .

		Were peo - ple in the other American colonies happier and more intelligent than in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	?

		The
Rhode Island Colony	ORGANIZATION	had Toleration , and were its people benefited thereby ?

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	thinks they had too much of this blessing , for it brought them misery , and that continually - He says : '' Anything taken in excess acts as a poison ; no mat - ter how good or healthful it may be in itself and in proper quantities .


Rhode Island	LOCATION	went through this ex - perience in its early days .

		It was the dumping-ground for the surplus intellectual activity of
New England	LOCATION	, The born agitator , the controversialist , the generally otherwise-minded , every type of thinker , whether crude and half-crazy like
Samuel Gorton	PERSON	, or only ad - vanced like
Roger Williams	PERSON	, there found refuge . ''

		This is a fair description of the sort of peo - ple whidh the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	founders tried to keep out ; and Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, while he blames them for so doing , does not hesitate to give the result of the
Rhode Island	LOCATION	experiment , although it is fatal to his theory : '' Thus what was a good and most necessary element in the economy of nature and the progress of human development , was in excess in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	; and the natural result followed , a disordered community .

		It could not have been otherwise ; it was inevitable .

		Mas - sachusetts rejected and expelled whatever it did not -LSB- and could not -RSB- assimilate ; and so did
Spain	LOCATION	.

		They had always before their eyes an object lesson of the most unfortunate character in the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, an object lesson which was made to do active service with the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	theologians then , as it has with its historians since . ''

		Why , pray , should not the confessed failure of Toleration in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	the only exper - iment which was tried be used by historians as an '' object lesson '' ?

		Cotton
Mather	PERSON	said in his '' Magnalia '' : '' If a man had lost his religion , he might find it in the general mus - ter of religious opinions in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	. ''


Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	Mr.
Adams	PERSON	regards as '' a curiosity , a vast glacial boulder , the legiti - mate outcome of orthodoxy , with a powerful and acute intellect , a man of pure life and gentle , kindly nature .

		His God was a horrible fetich , a demon of injustice , vengeance , and wrath , and a cruelty of disposition at once in - finite and insatiable .

		And this frightful night - mare , this access of morbid superstition , he de - duced logically from the Scriptures . ''

		He gives extended extracts from the sermons of
Edwards 78 THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, on the punishment of the wicked , in order to show that the above portrayal of the man and his doctrines is not exaggerated .

		Only one phase , however , of the preaching of
Edwards	ORGANIZATION	is shown in these extracts .

		It is the evident intention of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	to convey the impres - sion that such preaching was peculiar to
New England	LOCATION	; whereas in
Europe	LOCATION	it was common in the Catholic and Protestant churches of that time .

		If his theological reading had been wider , he would have found abundant instances of sim - ilar and even more lurid rhetoric , in the ser - mons of English and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	preachers .

		Here is the title of a sermon by
John Bunyan	PERSON	, '' the sweet dreamer of Bedford jail , '' published in
London	LOCATION	in
1675	DATE	, and treating the subject in his plain and realistic style : '' Sighs from Hell ; or , Groans of a Damned Soul . ''

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	touches very lightly on the witch - craft craze of
1692	DATE	; and he falls into the mis - takes of Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	, who asserts that it '' was simply the natural result of Puritanical teach - ing , '' and that `` during the period of the Com - monwealth , probably more alleged witches per - ished in
England	LOCATION	than in the whole period be - fore and after . ''

		Both writers ought to have known that myriads of victims of the supersti - tion perished before Puritanism was heard of , and that the delusion raged more fearfully in Catholic than in Protestant countries , 30,000 persons having been burned in the British isl - ands , 75,000 in
France	LOCATION	, 100,000 in
Germany	LOCATION	, and untold numbers in
Spain	LOCATION	and southern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Of those executed in
England	LOCATION	, prob - ably not one-thirtieth part of them perished during the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		The statistics and shocking details of witch executions in
England	LOCATION	have not been written up , and have never com - mended themselves as a subject of thorough historical investigation to an English antiquary .

		An Englishman prefers to talk about New -
England	LOCATION	witchcraft , of which much is matter of court record .

		The penal statutes against witchcraft enacted by
James I.	PERSON	were not re - pealed until
1736	DATE	.

		The whole number who suffered in
New England	LOCATION	was only thirty-two ; and English churchmen and American '' liber - als '' still presume to taunt the Puritans of
New England	LOCATION	with being excessively superstitious for men of their time .

		The mild penal code existing in early Mas - sachusetts , by the side of what Mr.
Adams	PERSON	calls `` a most sulphurous theological creed , '' he regards as an historical anomaly .

		In the first code of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	laws , the '' Body of Liberties , ''
1641	DATE	, there were only twelve capi - tal offenses named .

		When Sir
William Black	PERSON	- stone was delivering his law lectures at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	,
115 years later	DATE	, there were 160 capital offenses on the English statute books .

		A statute in the twenty-second year of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		provided that criminals convicted of murder should be boiled to death , and many victims suffered the penalty .

		Other anomalies puzzle Mr.
Adams	PERSON	and plead for explanation , that a people so priest-ridden , so benumbed and under a '' glacial mass of su - perstition and terrorism '' should have made the model Constitution of
1780	DATE	, '' which , '' he says , '' first fixed on philosophical principles the lines and limitations of what is known as the Amer - ican Constitution , and pioneered the way for the Federal Constitution of
1787	DATE	, '' that its minis - ters preached rigid conformity in religion and stubborn independence in politics , that secu - lar education and general intelligence were so fondly and persistently cherished , that from the earliest times the ministers and churches had been a part of the governmental machinery , and '' that , in time , the intellect of
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts , schooled by self-government , did work itself out from under the incubus of supersti - tion , prejudice , and narrow conformity imposed upon it by the first generation of magistrates and ministers . ''

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	discovers a solution of these ano - malies , and ascribes the salvation of
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts to jjolitics .

		Assuming that the glacial period extended to
February , 1761	DATE	, when the revolutionary struggle over the Writs of Assist - ance began , he asserts that politics from that date overshadowed their religious life , and the people emerged from their long benumbed and frigid condition .

		In arriving at this sapient conclusion , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is unmindful of the fact that the Mas - sachusetts colonists were politicians from the start , and never lost sight of their civil state and its stability as a government .

		Religion was a part of their politics , and politics a large part of their religion .

		Under the Stuarts they were in constant danger of losing their charter , and their perpetual controversies with the Crown gave them a training in diplomacy , and a famil - iarity with legal precedents and the rights of Englishmen better even than the Prime Minis - ter possessed .

		Hence they were the most acute diplomatists and politicians of their time .


Anne Hutchinson	PERSON	and
Roger Williams	PERSON	were banished more for their bad politics than for their bad religion .

		The former was a disturber -LRB- ft social order , and the latter challenged the validity of
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	charter .

		The Quakers were a griev - ous nuisance when they disturbed religious meetings , broke glass bottles over ministers ' heads as a sign of emptiness , and when their maidens appeared in church clothed in sack - cloth and ran through the streets without cloth - ing of any sort .

		All this might have been en - dured ; but when they shook their fists in the faces of the magistrates , and shouted in defiant tones , '' Thou hast no government ; thy charter is not worth the skin on which it is written ; no , we will not go back to
Rhode Island	LOCATION	; we came here to die ; thou darst not hang us , '' - short work was made of those four Quakers .

		Of the many instances where the colonists have been blamed for using severe measures , there was probably not one in which politics did not furnish a stronger motive for such treatment than religion .

		With more historical accuracy Mr.
Adams	PERSON	might have said that his forefathers had too much politics .

		His theory that politics resolved a glacial period of a century and a half seems to need confirmation ; and proof is also needed that such a glacial period ever existed .

		The advent of Unitarianism shares with pol - itics the honor , in Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's mind , of having saved
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		It came rather late ; for if
Massachusetts	LOCATION	has been saved , it was saved before
May 5 , 1819	DATE	, when
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	preached the sermon at the ordina - tion of
Jared Sparks	PERSON	at
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		In the
summer	DATE	-LRB-
June	DATE	and
August	DATE	-RRB- of
1837	DATE
Unita	ORGANIZATION	- rianism `` flowered , '' he says , when
Theodore Parker	PERSON	was ordained a minister at
West Rox	LOCATION	- bury , and
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	delivered a Phi Beta Kappa oration at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	regards these as very important dates .

		They have not been so considered by modern historical writers of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, who were all Unitarians ,
Palfrey	PERSON	,
Peabody	ORGANIZATION	,
Bancroft	LOCATION	,
Quincy	PERSON	, Savage ,
Upharn	LOCATION	,
Deane	PERSON	,
Ellis	PERSON	, and
Eliot	PERSON	, and no one of them ever suggested that
Massachusetts	LOCATION	needed salvation .

		The theory that she had fallen from grace , and needed to be brought out of the miry clay by politics and Unitarianism , is an original conception of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	.

		The just and appreciative treatment of In - crease and
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	is a creditable and surprising feature of the book .

		It is surpris - ing , because it has been the fashion of '' lib - eral '' writers to speak of them and their writ - ings in disparaging and abusive terms .

		This tirade of malignity began in
1825	DATE	when
James Savage	PERSON	edited
Winthrop	PERSON	's Journal ; and was kept up , one writer copying another , for nearly fifty years .

		Cotton Mather 's biographer , Mr.
Peabody	PERSON	, wrote in
1840	DATE	: '' The '
Magnalia	PERSON	' has fallen into disrepute with those who read for instruction .

		Its value is not to be esti - mated by its usefulness , but by the more doubt - ful standard of oddity and age .

		His works now sleep in repose where even the antiquary sel - dom disturbs them . ''

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, on the other hand , regards the '' Magnalia '' as one of the pinnacles of Amer - ican literature ; and to-day the writings of the
Mathers	PERSON	are more sought for by collectors and libraries in this country and in
Europe	LOCATION	, and bring higher prices , than those of any other family which has lived in
America	LOCATION	.

		Even so judicious and usually fair writer as Dr.
Palfrey	PERSON	characterized , in
1846	DATE	, the '' Mag - nalia '' as '' a historical medley which is be - neath criticism in any point of view . ''

		In
1869	DATE	, the Doctor , in my presence , apologized for the use of the above expression as being unjust ; '' but , '' he said , '' it was the fashion of the day when it was uttered . ''

		About twenty-five years ago the tide turned , and since then there have been writers who could speak well of the Math - ers .

		No one has spoken for them more justly and effectively than Mr.
Adams	PERSON	.

		He cites the conduct of the
Mathers	PERSON	when innoculation for small-pox was introduced into
Boston	LOCATION	, in
1721	DATE	, by Dr.
Boylston	PERSON	, and the physicians opposed it on theological grounds as impiety and re - sisting the providence of God .

		He says : `` To the everlasting credit of Increase and
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	one the President of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	they rose above the grovelling stage of superstition , and faced the storm of popular odium .

		The excitement was great , and Dr.
Boylston	PERSON	bore witness to the fact that without the great moral support of the
Mathers	ORGANIZATION	, he would have been obliged to succumb .

		As it was , an attempt was made on the life of Cotton Mather ; while his father , then eighty-three years of age , closed his long life of literary activity by writing a pamphlet showing that in - noculation against small-pox was not only scientific , but had been blessed of God . ''

		On the literary merit of their writings , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	says : '' From Cotton Mather to
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	is a long stride ; but there is no immediate stepping-stone .

		The `
Magnalia	ORGANIZATION	' was published in
1702	DATE	, and ` Twice - Told Tales ' in
1837	DATE	the one a boulder , the other a flower and between them is nothing !

		This Haw - thorne himself recognized ; and to the ` Magnalia ' he instinctively went back as to a store-house of material .

		So did
Longfellow	LOCATION	; for , with the possible exception of Dr.
Franklin	PERSON	's Autobiography , the intermediate 135 years of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	history left absolutely nothing to be classified as general literature which posterity has cared to preserve . ''

		With the above sweeping statement as to the dearth of literature in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	from 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1 , 1702	DATE	to
1837	DATE	, 1 do not concur ; but I have not space here to discuss the question .

		To the '' Magnalia , '' however , and its author are as - signed a position in American literature to which they are justly entitled .

		The other four hundred printed books of
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	, and the vast collection of his manuscripts , will some day be explored and give up material as quaint and interesting as that found in the '' Magnalia . ''

		CROSSIXG THE COXTIXEXT .

		* The most influential as well as the most pic - turesque factor in American history has been the steady march of civilization across the con - tinent .

		Columbus opened the way for the pro- cess , and it has been going on ever since .

		But in a bulletin of the Superintendent of the Cen - sus for
1890	DATE	a century after the taking of the first census , four centuries after the discovery of the continent occurs this significant an - nouncement : `` Up to and including
1880	DATE	, the country had a frontier of settlement ; but at present the unsettled area has been so broken into by isolated bodies of settlement that there can hardly be said to be a frontier line . ''

		This marks the close of the first period of American history , and inaugurates a new era .

		The con - tinent is crossed by settlement .

		It is peculiarly appropriate that there should have been given to the world at this time a reprint , in elaborate and sumptuous form , of the history of the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	expedition to the sources of the
Missouri	LOCATION	, across the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, and down the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	to the

		The expedition was the first to cross the continent within the limits of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		ted , was its projector .

		It grew out of plans for the advancement of the fur trade .

		The fur trader had , from the days of Champlain and La Salle , been the path-finder for civiliza - tion .

		In
1786	DATE	, while the
Annapolis	LOCATION	Conven - tion was discussing the navigation of the Poto - mac ,
Jefferson	PERSON	wrote to
Washington	LOCATION	, from
Paris	LOCATION	, inquiring about the best place for a canal be - tween the
Ohio	LOCATION	and the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was in promotion of a project of
Ledyard	LOCATION	, a
Connecticut Yankee	ORGANIZATION	, who was then in
Paris	LOCATION	en - deavoring to interest a wealthy business house there in the fur trade of the far West .

		Sa great an interest did
Jefferson	PERSON	take in the plan that he secured from the house a promise that , if it undertook the scheme , the depot of supply should be at
Alexandria	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		After the failure of the negotiations of
Ledyard	LOCATION	,
Jeffer	PERSON	- son proposed to him to cross
Russia	LOCATION	and take ship to
Nootka Sound	ORGANIZATION	, and thence return to the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast by way of the
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		The plan fell through , and
Ledyard	LOCATION	died while ex - ploring the Nile ; but the project suggested the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	expedition .

		This expedition was instructed to investigate the possibilities of the fur traffic and the feasibility of a trans - continental trading route .

		But before this ex - pedition was planned ,
Jefferson	PERSON	had proposed to the
American Philosophical Society	ORGANIZATION	that a subscription should be raised to enable Captain
Lewis	PERSON	-LRB- afterwards
Jefferson	PERSON	's private secretary -RCB- to cross the continent with a single companion .

		The person selected was
Andre Michaux	PERSON	, a French botanist .

		The expedition failed because of the recall of Michaux by the French minis - ter .

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	suspects that this was due to
Jefferson	PERSON	's suspicions that the botanist was a spy in the secret service of the French govern - ment .

		If the editor had consulted the
Clark	PERSON	Manuscripts , in the Library of the
Wisconsin State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, he would have been able to state from
Michaux	PERSON	's own letters that he was actually intriguing , on behalf of Genet , with General
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	, the conqueror of the
Illinois	LOCATION	country , who desired to expa - triate himself , and who accepted a French com - mission to conquer the mouth of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	from
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	makes no effort to un - tangle the web of conspiracy that was spread over the West at this time ; but surely it is a striking fact that
William Clark	PERSON	, one of the leaders of the expedition whose history Dr.
Coues	PERSON	edits , was brother of the man whose in - trigues with
Michaux	PERSON	aroused
Jefferson	PERSON	's sus - picions , and frustrated this earlier project .

		The personnel of the expedition is of fur -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 ther interest , since its epitomizes the factors of Western advance .

		In the crossing of the continent the buffalo 's trail followed the easiest lines of advance , the Indian followed the buf - falo , the trapper and fur trader followed the Indian , and the backwoods farmers and cattle - raisers followed the trapper .

		Through Cum - berland Gap in the
Alleghenies	LOCATION	, and through South Pass in the Rockies , went the same pro- cession .

		Now , when
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	took their party to the
Pacific	LOCATION	they took with them an Indian woman , a captive from the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, whose services as guide and inter - preter form one of the most picturesque ele - ments of the story ; they took French voya - geurs , or water-men , descendants of that lively adventurous throng whose canoeing songs had echoed along the forest-girt shores of the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	in the days of the old regime ; there were also backwoodsmen , with
William Clark	PERSON	at their head a man of the hardy stock that had won
Kentucky	LOCATION	and ousted the British from the
Illinois	LOCATION	country , and who had himself fought with
Wayne	PERSON	in the campaign that gave the far - mer the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Tidewater
Virginia	LOCATION	was personified in Captain
Lewis	PERSON	; and among the party were
Yankees	ORGANIZATION	from
New Hampshire	LOCATION	and
Vermont	LOCATION	.

		Representatives of the
Middle States	LOCATION	were also there .

		Thus there marched in this company the elements that opened the West , and with them were representatives of those sec - tions that struggled for dominance there ; while in the person of
York	LOCATION	, Captain
Lewis	PERSON	's negro , there passed through
Missouri	LOCATION	, and on to Ore - gon , the herald of many woes the prototype of Dred Scott .

		As the expedition ascended the
Missouri	LOCATION	it passed La Charette creek , the Mis - souri home of
Daniel Boone	PERSON	; and
Clark	PERSON	's map of
1814	DATE	notes
Boone	PERSON	's Salt Works .

		Thus the mind runs back to the history of this famous frontiersman , who in
the first half of the eight	DATE	- eenth century followed the traders from his
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	home along the
Great Valley	LOCATION	to the
Yadkin	LOCATION	in
North Carolina	LOCATION	; next , led by traders ' reports , crossed the Alleghenies and be - came the pioneer of
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and from there had gone to
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		His son was one of the earliest trappers of the
Rocky Mountain	ORGANIZATION	passes , and camped on the site of
Denver	LOCATION	when it was a wilderness ; Kit
Carson	PERSON	's mother was a
Boone	PERSON	.

		In how few names can the history of the crossing of the continent be written !

		When
Clark	PERSON	returned to
Saint Louis	PERSON	, one of his first letters , describing the passes he had discovered , was to his brother
George Rogers	PERSON	, conqueror of the
Illinois	LOCATION	country and intriguer with
France	LOCATION	for the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		Per - haps we can not ask Dr.
Coues	PERSON	to elucidate the broader historical phases of the expedition , but he should have reprinted this letter , so dra - matic in its bearings and so admirable in its resume of the expedition .

		It is to be regretted that the Doctor occasionally indulges himself in such remarkable lucubrations as this com - ment on the fact that the explorers named two streams '' Wisdom '' and '' Philanthrophy '' re - spectively , in commemoration of
Jefferson	LOCATION	's character : '' To complete this system of geographical ethics , they should have discontinued the name of
Jefferson	PERSON	for the main stream , and called this
Paine	PERSON	river , whose main forks should have been Religion and Common Sense ; for
Thomas Paine	PERSON	's soul flowed into
Jefferson	PERSON	's , bearing a precious quality of spiritual reasonableness , which in - formed and filled the mind of the greatest statesman
America	LOCATION	ever produced .

		What we owe to
Jefferson	PERSON	is history what
Jefferson	PERSON	owed to
Paine	PERSON	is the very mystery of godlikeness .

		It is well to keep the reputed paternity of our country before the common people by the name of
Washington	LOCATION	, and uphold
William Tell	PERSON	among the simple Swiss ; but
Washington	LOCATION	's intellect shrinks out of sight before
Jefferson	PERSON	's , and
Jefferson	PERSON	's dwarfs in comparison with
Paine 's	ORGANIZATION	.


Washington	LOCATION	whipped some average British soldiery ;
Jefferson	PERSON	was more than a match for
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	; he gave us more than half our country with a stroke of his pen , without spill - ing a drop of blood ; and the whole of our country has grown up on principles enunciated from the French jail where
Thomas Paine	PERSON	lay languishing , dreaming dreams that we have awakened to realize . ''

		Nevertheless , it must be said that Dr.
Coues	PERSON	has the devotion of an enthusiast , that he sat - isfies all the requirements of a careful bibliog - rapher and a sympathetic and well qualified editor of the geographical and natural history material of the volumes , and that he has given minute and apparently careful study to the manuscript journals which have fallen into his hands .

		The editorial notes , which quote the original words of the explorers , from which Bid - die wrote the narrative here reprinted , afford us glimpses of what Dr.
Coues	PERSON	calls '' an unex - ampled curiosity in literature . ''

		It is certainly to be hoped that Dr.
Coues	PERSON	will at some day reprint the original text of the explorers , and that he will make use of the
William Clark	PERSON	papers in the Library of the
State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		This will enable him to cast additional light on one of the two ex - plorers .

		He has already made a good begin - ning in his memoirs of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	which introduce the volumes .

		The narrative itself contains exciting inci - dents and `` hair-breadth ` scapes . ''

		The tur - bulence of their river highway , the sudden 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, floods , the grizzlies , and the Indians , were often likely to have brought the leaders to an untimely end .

		Aside from the picturesque in - cidents , and the information of value to the geographer and naturalist , the volumes contain pictures of the Indian life of the farthest West that are of value to the student of ethnology and primitive institutions .

		The travellers were experts in Indian management and in knowl - edge of Indian character , and they occupied their winter waits by writing descriptions of the tribes they met .

		It is noteworthy , how - ever , that even in the remotest wilds they met no Indians unmodified by acquaintance with Europeans .

		As early as the beginning of this century , it was too late to study Indian life in its unmodified form .

		Nevertheless these chap - ters are among the permanently valuable fea - tures of the work .

		son .

		Such proclamations have not been uncommon during the past ten years , and the series of New Poets thus heralded , from the late
James Thomp	PERSON	- son to Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	, has included a number of names .

		In almost all the cases , however , these poets have shared the fate of the novae known to astronomers , and their fame has been hardly more that that conferred by the admiration of a coterie .

		We should , indeed , hesitate to admit that a New Poet , in the serious sense of that term , has arisen among men of English speech since
Rossetti	PERSON	, in
1870	DATE	, published $ he contents of that famous disin - terred manuscript .

		That the performance of Mr.
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, whose poems are now somewhat sumptuously put forth , is of such a character as to lift its author above the minor poets that swarm in our day and generation we see no reason to allow .

		In the first place , it exhibits a perversity of man - ner that equals
Browning	PERSON	and Mr.
George Mere	PERSON	- dith at their worst , and that sometimes recalls the more extravagant imaginings of
Blake	PERSON	.

		It is full of puzzles , and it evidently selects wprds -LRB- such as trepidant , purpurate , and thurifer -RRB- for their mere oddity .

		This alone would be an obstacle in the way of general acceptance .

		But this is not all , for the work is weighted with false rhymes -LRB- stir and hair , able and babble -RRB- , bad grammar -LRB- ' must have took , '' '' my hand hath shook '' -RRB- , and cacophonies , of which '' In statelier state thou us ` dst to go '' is one example out of many .

		We quote a charac - teristic stanza : '' Dream-dispensing face of hers !

		Ivory port which loosed upon me Wings , I wist , Whose amethyst Trepidations have forgone me ,
Hesper	PERSON	's filmy traffickers . ''

		This sort of thing is ingenious , but , when its slight meaning has been worked out by the intellect , the heart remains untouched .

		It is the sort of thing that Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	has been doing , in both verse and prose , for many years .

		But we may say per contra that Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	, like Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, has lapses into a more natural manner .

		He can even , upon occasion , sing as simple and sweet a song as '' Daisy , '' from which we must do him the justice to quote : '' Oh , there were flowers in Storrington On the turf and on the spray ; But the sweetest flower on Sussex hills Was the Daisy-flower that day . ''

		Her beauty smoothed earth 's furrowed face !

		She gave me tokens three : A look , a word of her winsome mouth , And a wild raspberry . ''

		A berry red , a guileless look , A still word , strings of sand !

		And yet they made my wild , wild heart Fly down to her little hand . ''

		For standing artless as the air , And candid as the skies , She took the berries with her hand , And the love with her sweet eyes . ''

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 To do Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	entire justice , we must also make an extract from '' A Fallen Yew , '' a poem in which his imaginative powers are at their best , yet wherein expression does not go far beyond what is legitimate . ''

		It seemed corrival of the world 's great prime , Made to un-edge the scythe of
Time	ORGANIZATION	, And last with stateliest rhyme .

		* ' No tender Dryad ever did indue That rigid chiton of rough yew , To fret her white flesh through : '' But some god like to those grim Asgard lords , Who walk the fables of the hordes From Scandinavian fjords , '' Upheaved its stubborn girth , and raised unriven , Against the whirl-blast and the levin , Defiant arms to Heaven . ''

		When doom puffed out the stars , we might have said , It would decline its heavy head , And see the world to bed . ''

		If these two latter extracts were representative , rather than exceptional , it might almost be said of their author that he had in him the making of a New Poet .

		A lyrical utterance finer and truer than may be detected in Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's verse inspires the sheaf of songs just given to the public by Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	.

		His exquisite song of '' Nightingales '' has caught something of the music of the greater poets . ''

		Beautiful must be the mountains whence ye come , And bright in the fruitful valleys the streams wherefrom Ye learn your song : Where are those starry woods ?

		might I wander there Among the flowers , which in that heavenly air Bloom the year long ! ''

		Nay , barren are those mountains and spent the streams : Our song is the voice of desire , that haunts our dreams , A throe of the heart , Whose pining visions dim , forbidden hopes profound , No dying cadence nor long sigh can sound , For all our art . ''

		Alone aloud in the raptured ears of men We pour our dark nocturnal secret ; and then , As night is withdrawn From these sweet-springing meads and bursting boughs of
May	DATE	, Dream while the innumerable choirs of day Welcome the dawn . ''

		This is not quite the careless rapture of the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethans , although others among the songs of Mr. Bridges have nearly caught that .

		And '' The Hu - mours of the Court , '' the play that fills the greater part of his volume , is curiously Elizabethan both in spirit and treatment .

		What memories of
Fletcher	PERSON	or of Massinger are evoked by such a passage as `` Oh , I could sit And sigh beneath that window all the night ; Is there not wondrous softness in the thought , That she one loves is sleeping ? ''

		Mr.
Bridges	PERSON	has based his play upon
Calderon	PERSON	's '' El Secreto d Voces , '' and pieced it out with a scene from
Lope	LOCATION	.

		But the process has been trans - mutation , not translation .

		With increasing frequency , of recent years , the
Canadian Muse	ORGANIZATION	has brought its quota of song to the collections of current verse that we have had occa - sion to pass under review .

		The group of volumes characterized in the present article has also its
Cana	LOCATION	- dian representatives , first among which we may mention '' In
Dreamland	LOCATION	, and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
Thomas O'Hagan	PERSON	.

		Mr.
O'Hagan	PERSON	's allegiance , however , is not wholly given to the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, for
Ireland	LOCATION	, as well as
Canada	LOCATION	, claims his tribute , and the sense of a divided duty is ever with him .

		So we find upon one page such lines as these : '' Dear native land , we are but one From ocean unto ocean ; 1 The sun that tints the Maple Leaf ' Smiles with a like devotion On
Stadacona	PERSON	's fortress height , On Grand Pr4 's storied valley , And that famed tide whose peaceful shore Was rocked in battle sally , My native land ! ''

		While on another is expressed the hope '' That
Ireland	LOCATION	, dear old
Ireland	LOCATION	, Should evermore be free , And her patriot sons in union Drive the
Saxon	LOCATION	o'er the sea . ''

		The effort to '' weave in one garland the Maple and Shamrock '' does not seem to result in a very sat - isfactory sort of patriotism .

		Nor does it result -LRB- which is more to our purpose -RRB- in verses that rise above a low level of the commonplace .

		Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	, although a sojourner in `` these States , '' must be reckoned with the interesting group of Canadian poets , and takes a high place among them .

		We have more than once had occasion to mention Mr.
Carman	PERSON	's work , although his first col - lected volume is now put forth .

		The volume is not entirely representative of the writer for the reason thus stated by him : '' It seemed better to bring to - gether between the same covers only those pieces of work which happened to be in the same key , rather than to publish a larger book of more uncertain aim . ''

		This restraint was perhaps wise , although it makes us miss for the present certain pieces of more enduring value than any here published .

		The note of the present collection is lyrical , and the key is predominantly minor .

		From `` The Vagabonds , '' one of the strongest of these poems , we may make a characteristic selection : '' In the beginning God made man Out of the wandering dust , men say ; And in the end his life shall be A wandering wind and blown away . ''

		We are the vagabonds of time , Willing to let the world go by , With joy supreme , with heart sublime , And valor in the kindling eye . ''

		We have forgotten where we slept , And guess not where we sleep to-night , Whether among the lonely hills In the pale streamer 's ghostly light '' We shall lie down and hear the frost Walk in the dead leaves restlessly , Or somewhere on the iron coast Learn the oblivion of the sea .

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, '' It matters not .

		And yet I dream Of dreams fulfilled and rest somewhere Before this restless heart is stilled And all its fancies blown to air . ''

		Had I my will !

		... The sun burns down And something plucks my garment 's hem ; The robins in their faded brown Would lure me to the south with them . ''

		'T is time for vagabonds to make The nearest inn .

		Far on I hear The voices of the Northern hills Gather the vagrants of the year . ''

		These verses have a haunting quality from which there is no escape .

		They are also felicitous in their choice of epithet and musical in their verbal arrangement , which can not be said of all Mr.
Car	PERSON	- man 's pieces .

		A poem in some respects stronger and more finely imaginative than the one just mentioned is called '' Pulvis et Umbra , '' yet it is not a little marred by words to which a forced employment is given .

		But the author has certainly caught the true poetic accent , although he stammers now and then in its use .

		When at his best , as the above ex - tract shows , he speaks in his own tongue , and from the heart .

		His future work will be awaited with interest by all who concern themselves with the cur - rent development of pure literature . ''

		Behind the Veil '' is a poem found among the manuscripts of the late
James De Mille	PERSON	, and now given to the public by
Professor Archibald Mac	ORGANIZATION	- mechan .

		It appears in rather sumptuous quarto form , with an etched portrait of the author .

		It tells us how the author , in a dream or trance , `` saw the Vision of the World , and all the wonder '' not that should be , but that has been .

		In other words , the scroll of history was rolled back before his gaze .

		We quote one stanza as an example of the form and spirit of the poem . ''

		Golden gleams on fields of azure , Worlds on worlds arose in Space , Numbers more than thought or measure ; There each Sun careering onward held its planets in their place ; Flashed the meteor ; flared the comet ; speeding in its head - long race . ''

		The work is a rhapsody upon a familiar plan , and of doubtful poetic value .

		Mr.
C. H. Crandall	PERSON	publishes a volume of '' Way - side Music '' that is notable for clear technique and reasonably successful accomplishment of modest aims .

		It is marred occasionally by commonplace phrases , by hackneyed rhythmical devices , and by strained expressions -LRB- such as '' yachts of God '' for clouds -RRB- ; but the general impression is pleasing .

		`` The Golden Age '' is a pretty lyric . ''

		My love and I laugh o'er the page .

		That tells the varied story How love ran in the Golden Age We care not for its glory . ''

		Idly we read how earthly maids Entangled Jove , the mighty , Or how Adonis in the glades Played with fair Aphrodite . ''

		Pan the sweet river-nymph may woo ,
Pygmalion	LOCATION	,
Galatea	LOCATION	; Our love is just as sweet and true As theirs by blue - < Egea . ''

		Nor lacks it the enchanting power That blends divine with human ; My love will change at any hour To goddess or to woman ! ''

		Thus love 's eternal heritage Illumes our modern portals .

		Cupid and Psyche know not age , And we , too , are immortals . ''

		Mr.
Crandall	PERSON	, it will be remembered , is the editor of an excellent selection of American sonnets , pre - faced by a historical essay upon the sonnet ; and it is consequently not surprising that the best of hia work should be in that form of verse .

		Better , in our judgment , than '' Waiting '' and ''
Adelaide Neil	PERSON	- son '' the two sonnets selected for his own collec - tion are '' Woman , '' '' Sleep 's Conquest , '' '' The New Year , '' and '' Sunset on the Palisades . ''

		We quote the first of these four : '' Fairer than all the fantasies that dart Adown the dreams of our most favored sleep , Thy lovely form since

		Yet more do we admire thy better part , The spirit strong to smile when others weep ; And well know we who sail life 's ocean deep There is no haven like a woman 's heart . ''

		Thus , often weary ere the victory 's won , Tired with my task , my head I fain would lay In some good lady 's lap as did the Dane , And watch the action of the world go on , Knowing 't is but a play within a play , The fleeting portion of an endless plan . ''

		It is unfortunate that one defective rhyme should have crept into this otherwise admirable poem . ''

		In Various Moods '' is a thin volume of vers de societe with a tendency toward exotic metrical forms .

		Some of them are very pretty , a good example ^ be - ing the roundel '' A Shower of Gold . '' ''

		A shower of gold ?

		Let none declare He would not try to catch and hold Some part , if Fate with him would share A shower of gold .

		`` Not like frail
Danae	PERSON	's of old , But sunlight-clear , divinely fair , A joy and glory to enfold . ''

		For sordid pelf he would not care , Who had the fortune to behold One glimpse of her -LRB- my lady 's -RRB- hair , A shower of gold . ''

		We must not fail to quote a trifle called '' At `` the Flower Show . '' '' '

		Du hist wie eine
Blume	PERSON	, '' 1 I whispered in her ear .

		Say , wilt thou grace my garden , maid , most sweet and dear ? ''

		Full soft and low her answer : ' O reckless youth , beware !

		Alas !

		I 'm not an orchid ; 1 can not live on air ! ' ''

		A sense of rhythm so faulty as to make many of the verses read like prose is the one noticeable de - fect of this volume .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 A second edition has been published of the poems of
Daniel Dawson	PERSON	, and the recent death of the writer makes a few words of characterization ap - propriate at this time .

		His verse is strained , arti - ficial , over-sensuous , and pays tribute to strange gods ; yet it has interludes of musical utterance that seize the attention , and imaginative passages that cause at least a momentary thrill .

		Over it all , however , is the trail of bohemianism , and its pas - sion is more theatrical than real .

		The following stanza is from a piece in which , emulous of
Brown	PERSON	- ing , the writer discourses of
Childe Roland	ORGANIZATION	and the Dark Tower : '' It peers somewhere between the pointed hills , Builded of old by
Merlin	PERSON	in the waste ; The giant there his fateful ward fulfills , Until the chosen of the world shall haste , Through wood and wold , o'er fell and field and fen , To bide the battle for the sons of men . ''

		There is much excellent stuff in
Dawson	PERSON	's work , but it is crudely presented , and the light that falls upon it is garish .

		A selection of the poems of the late
Thomas William Parsons	PERSON	has recently been published , and is one of the most welcome books of the season .

		The original editions have long been out of print , and many of the poems have never before been pub - lished at all in the strict sense , or at least have made but a furtive previous appearance in the col - umns of newspapers or the pages of magazines .

		The new collection is far from complete , but it is representative , and includes most of the author 's best work .

		We should say all , did we not look in vain for '' Saint Peray , '' which should have been included in the scantiest of selections , and the trans - lation of
Manzoni	PERSON	's ''
Cinque Maggio	PERSON	'' ode , which should have accompanied the '' Proem , '' in spite of the rule barring out other than original work .

		Com - paring the collection with the volume of
1854	DATE	-LRB- the only one that was published in this country -RRB- , we find it to contain nearly twice the amount of mat - ter and more than twice the number of pieces .

		There are great inequalities in these poems , and it is astonishing how trivial the poet of ''
Paradisi Gloria	PERSON	'' and the verses '' On a Bust of Dante '' could be at times .

		But
Parsons	PERSON	at his best was a writer not likely to be forgotten .

		He was a poet for poets rather than for the public , and his most finished work has much of the quality that also made Landor appeal rather to the select than to the gen - eral audience . ''

		The hermit thrush of singers '' he is happily styled by the young fellow-poet who has paid a graceful tribute to his memory .

		Besides the comparison with
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, comparisons with Gray and with
Collins	PERSON	have been suggested , and are not without justification .

		Speaking of
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, we note that the '' Epistle '' addressed to that poet is now entitled a '' Letter from
America	LOCATION	to a Friend in
Tuscany	LOCATION	. ''

		We have always been puzzled by this poem , with its familiar '' Dear
Walter	PERSON	, in our Eton days , '' and its statement , '' Since thou and I pursued our mountain way , Twenty Decembers have disrobed the trees . ''

		If this is to be taken literally , the '' mountain way '' in question was pursued by a youth of fifteen and a sexagenarian .

		And even then the Eton puzzle is unexplained .

		A companion volume to the '' Poems , '' and the more precious boon of the two , represents , in the words of a publishers ' note , '' the great poetic pas - sion of the man . ''

		In other words , it gives us the translation by Dr.
Parsons	PERSON	of the
Sacred Song of Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Inferno '' is complete , and the '' Purgatorio '' nearly so , but of the '' Paradiso '' we have only a few fragments .

		The cantos of the sec - ond Canticle have been collected from scattered numbers of '' The Catholic World , '' to which they were from time to time contributed during a long period of years .

		Professor
C. E. Norton	PERSON	provides the volume with a preface , and
Miss Guiney	PERSON	writes a '' Memorial Sketch '' which is sympathetic enough , but stilted in expression .

		It is curious , indeed , that the simple , direct , and almost classical style of the translator should have so appealed to an editor who could write : `` An unrevised life-labor , plucked for the public while yet green upon the bough , bears itself meekly , and hopes for consideration . ''

		But Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's sketch betrays flashes of insight for which we should be grateful ; such , for example , as the following : '' Above all , Dr.
Parsons	PERSON	can be trusted , with a touch so light it is often unsuspected , to dispel a vagueness or insert some little clarifica - tion , and to deal firmly with paraphrase where the prodigious force of the Tuscan idiom is such that the best English threatens to break under it . ''

		As for the translation , which usually has the form of Gray 's '' Elegy '' except for the division into stan - zas , Professor
Norton	PERSON	is safe in saying that '' as a rhymed version in English of the ' Divine Comedy ' it has no superior . ''

		We are inclined to go still further , and to claim for it at least parity with , and possibly superiority over , the best of the unrhymed metrical versions .

		It certainly produces the effect of an English poem , as
Longfellow	LOCATION	's bare transla - tion does not , and this without venturing as far as
Gary	PERSON	in the direction of paraphrase .

		As Professor
Norton	PERSON	says , '' Without knowledge of the original , one may read it with ease and pleasure , and with little sense of any hampering conformities to a for - eign original .

		There are many parts in which the translation reaches so high a level of natural poetry that the reader may readily forget that the English poet is following an Italian model . ''

		As an exquis - ite example of this we may take the meeting with
Beatrice	PERSON	-LRB- Purg .

		XXX. , 67-75 -RRB- : '' Although the veil which from her forehead fell , Girt by that frondage of
Minerva	ORGANIZATION	's tree , Suffered me not to see her features well , Queenly she looked , and yet upbraided me , Continuing thus , with sweet restraint of style As ' t were she kept her warmer words behind : ' Behold me well .

		The one I was erewhile Good sooth I am : I am thy Beatrice !

		So , hast thou deigned then to approach the hill ?

		Didst thou not know man findeth here his bliss . ' ''

		86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, This , beyond a doubt , is good English poetry , but it is not quite
Dante	PERSON	.

		Besides the expansion of the verse ''
Guardami	PERSON	ben ; ben son , ben son Beatrice '' into two , which even the the felicitous '' good sooth '' does not justify , there are , as Professor
Norton	PERSON	says , qualities of essence , of poetic nature , of style , and of tone , that differentiate the version from the original .

		Or , taking one of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's chosen examples of the grand style in
Dante	LOCATION	-LRB- Inf .

		XVI. , 61-3 -RRB- : '' Lascio lo fele , e vo pei dolci pomi Promessi a me per lo verace Duca ; Mafino al centre pria convien ch ` io tomi , '' and turning to read in Parsons : '' Leaving the gall , I seek the pleasant fruit Promised to me by this my faithful Guide ; But to the centre first must sink my foot , '' we are confronted by the same subtle differentia - tion .

		The style of the translation is pleasing , har - monious , and dignified , yet it is not the grand style .

		But we doubt if anyone will ever come nearer than
Parsons	PERSON	did to a reproduction in English of the es - sential qualities of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's manner .

		Mr.
G. A. Greene	PERSON	's volume of translations from the `` Italian Lyrists of To-Day '' is a work of ex - ceptional value , both on account of its biographical and critical notices of thirty-four among the Italian poets now living , and on account of the remarkable faithfulness and high poetic quality of the transla - tions offered .

		The work begins where the '' Modern Italian Poets '' of Mr.
Ho	PERSON	wells leaves off , and there is no name common to the two works .

		Mr.
Greene	PERSON	's lengthy introduction speaks of the decline of Ital - ian literature during the period between
1860	DATE	and
1870	DATE	, and of its remarkable resurgence during the past quarter-century .

		He accounts for the decline by saying that literature had been so long in pol - itics that , after the achievement of national unity , it had lost the power to deal with anything else .

		Romanticism , moreover , had spent its force , and the time was not quite ripe for the classical re - action .

		When that reaction came , with
Signor Carducci	PERSON	as its leader , it had things its own way , and '' saved literature in
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		This poet , of course , more than any other , gets attention in Mr.
Greene	PERSON	's volume , and his revival of classical metres is discussed with much intelligence .

		The matter is so important that we quote Mr.
Greene	PERSON	's quotation from one of
Signor Cavducci	PERSON	's disciples : '' We have no quantity ; but we can render in Italian verse the sound of Latin verses , as it appears to strike our 1 barbarous ' ears .

		That is to say : since we , when reading
Horace	PERSON	, hear in his odes our own five-syl - lable , seven-syllable , nine-syllable , and hendecasyl - labic metres , so we can construct , by means of these metres , strophes which apparently correspond to his .

		For instance : ' Eheu fugaces ,
Postume	LOCATION	,
Postume	LOCATION	, ' sounds to our Italian ears as though it were com - posed of two quinarii , the first simple , the second sdrucciolo ; and therefore for ' Eheu fugaces | Postume , P6stume , '
Carducci	PERSON	writes ' Oh quei fanali 1 c < 5me s ` inse ` guono . ' ''

		These innovations have had to fight their way , and they have won acceptance but for what they really pretend to be -LRB- as explained above -RRB- , not for what their opponents have misrepresented them as claim - ing .

		The proof of the pudding is in the eating , and the proof of the poem is in its effect upon the intel - lectual palate .

		The following is undoubtedly poetry : '' deviata verde solitudine
Lungi	LOCATION	dal rumor degli uomini !

		Qui due con noi divini amici vengono Vino ed amore
Lidia	PERSON	, '' and it remains little less than poetry in Mr.
Greene	PERSON	's '' O now so long desired , thou verdurous solitude , Far from all rumor of mankind !

		Hither we come companioned by two friends divine , By wine and love ,
Lydia	PERSON	. ''

		Here is an example of the translator 's Carduccian sapphics : '' Cypresses solemn stand on
Monte Mario	ORGANIZATION	; Luminous , quiet is the air around them ; They watch the Tiber through the misty meadows Wandering voiceless . ''

		The translation from which we make this extract could not easily be equalled . ''

		Stecchetti '' and the young
Gabriele d'Annunzio	PERSON	are the poets next in importance to the one just discussed , and get a large share of Mr.
Greene	PERSON	's attention .

		His versions of poems by the latter are exquisitely done , and should be reprinted did space permit , as well as the '' Pre - lude '' from `` Stecchetti 's '' '' Postuma , '' `` The Ban - quet '' of
Signor Pascoli	PERSON	, '' and the '' Florentine Mem - ories '' of
Signor Marradi	PERSON	.

		But Mr.
Greene	PERSON	's book must tell the rest of the stoiy .

		Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's `` Bay Leaves '' is a small volume of translations from ten Latin poets ;
Lucretius	LOCATION	,
Catullus	LOCATION	,
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Horace	PERSON	, and Martial get - ting most of the translator 's attention .

		`` The trans - lator of Latin poetry , '' says Professor
Smith	PERSON	, '' has the comfort of knowing that he is separated from his authors by no chasm of thought and sentiment , such as that which separates the translator from Homer , or even from JEschylus . ''

		This is particu - larly true of the Latin poets of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and hardly less true of Lucretius .

		The translations are free , smooth , and tasteful .

		With
Horace	PERSON	, '' whom , for some occult reason , one loves the better the older one grows , '' the translator has been peculiarly hap - py , as in the Otium divos rogat '' For ease the weary seaman prays On the wild ocean , tempest tost , When guiding stars withhold their rays , When pales the moon in cloud-wrack lost . ''

		For ease the Median archers sigh , For ease the Thracian warrior bold ; But ease , my friend , nor gems can bay , Nor purple robes , nor mighty gold . ''

		Two companion volumes , each of twice the thickness of '' Bay Leaves , '' are devoted to the same transla - tor 's experiments with Greek tragedy in English 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 87 blank verse .

		The choruses have , as a rule , been avoided , and a prefatory note displays a curious lack of feeling for the poetic beauty of the lyrical passages in the tragedies .

		One of the volumes gives extracts from JEschylus and Sophocles , `` The Sup - pliants '' being the only play not represented .

		In the other we have scenes from twelve of the plays of Euripides .

		Miss
Swanwick	PERSON	, whose translation of the first part of `` Faust '' was published more than forty years ago , now offers the work to the public in a revised form , changed particularly in the lyrical passages , to many of which the double rhymes have been re - stored .

		The work in its present form is highly creditable , although still inferior to
Taylor	PERSON	's , as may be illustrated by the Chorus , '' Hat der
Begra	PERSON	- bene , '' a crucial test .

		Miss
Swanwick	PERSON	gives us : '' He whom we mourned as dead , Living and glorious , From the dark grave hath fled , O'er death victorious ; Almost creative bliss Waits on his growing powers ; Ah !

		Him on earth we miss ; Sorrow and grief are ours . ''


Taylor	PERSON	did much better when he translated : '' Has He victoriously Burst from the vaulted Grave , and ail-gloriously Now sits exalted .

		Is He , in glow of birth , Rapture creative near ?

		Ah !

		to the woe of earth Still are we native here . ''

		The Retzsch outline illustrations appear with this volume , and are not a happy addition .


Gottfried Kinkel	PERSON	, whose `` Tanagra '' has been put into English verse by Mrs.
Frances Hellman	PERSON	, was one of the more important literary personalities of his time , and has a peculiar interest for Ameri - cans as the friend and fellow-revolutionist of
Herr Carl Schurz	PERSON	.

		Both were combatants on the side of liberty in
1849	DATE	, and both were captured by the Prussians and imprisoned at
Rastatt	LOCATION	.


Herr Schurz	PERSON	made his escape through a sewer soon after his cap - ture , arid fled to
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		Secretly returning in the following year , he aided Kinkel to escape , and both took ship for
England	LOCATION	.

		Kinkel remained in
England	LOCATION	for some fifteen years , visiting the
United States	LOCATION	in
1851	DATE	, and , in
1866	DATE	, accepted a post at Zu - rich , where he lived until his death in
1882	DATE	.

		In an age when
Germany	LOCATION	has produced only minor poets he was one of the most popular of them all , and the list of his productions is lengthy , including not only poems , but stories and contributions to the lit - erature of aesthetics . ''

		Tanagra , '' which is an epic - idyll upon a Greek theme , was the last and the ripest of his poems .

		Mrs.
Hellman	PERSON	's translation , which is in couplets , produces a slightly pedestrian effect , but is pleasing .

		It is published in gift-book guise , with illustrations by Mr.
E. H. Blashfield	PERSON	, in which the artist does not seem to have been at his happiest .

		Of the gift-book type are also the two exquisite booklets which introduce the `` Bibelot '' series to the public .

		One of them , '' Old World Lyrics , '' is a selection of translations , mostly from the French , by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	and others .

		They are trans - lations such as Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's `` Ars Victrix , '' Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's versions of Ronsard , and
Rossetti	PERSON	's render - ing of Villon 's most famous ballad to be read almost as much for their own sake as for that of the originals .

		Two or three of the selections are of such a nature that the book can not well be offered to the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Songs of Adieu '' is the other of these booklets , and proves to be a tasteful selection of valedictory and mortuary lyrics from a wide range of recent English writers .

		One Amer - ican , the late
Paul H. Hayne	PERSON	, figures in the collec - tion .

		The book is particularly acceptable because it brings together a number of charming lyrics other - wise not easily accessible .

		We can not better close this article than with a few words of praise for the new
Cambridge	LOCATION	edition of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's poems .

		The contents of six vol - umes of the Riverside edition -LRB- with some condensa - tion of the notes -RRB- are here put into a single volume of nearly seven hundred pages , and the result , from the mechanical point of view , is a masterpiece even among the publications of the house whence it issues .

		The paper is thin but opaque , the dimensions are excellent , and the cover is in faultless taste .

		The collection has a biography by Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	, more than enough notes for most readers , and a chrono - logical list of the poems .

		It will doubtless remain for many years to come the standard one-volume edition of our most widely-read poet , and his friends could not have wished for his work a more satisfac - tory setting .

		The volume should find its way to every home in the land .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		A new and profound study of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Most writers , in the minds of most people , act as merely external influ - ences , and are , upon reflection , easily to be differentiated as such .

		But a few among the very greatest of writers appeal to the inmost con - sciousness ; their thought becomes incorporated with the very framework of the mental structure , woven in the very warp and woof of its fabric .

		This is particularly true if we make their acquaintance at the early age when introspection does not as yet largely enter into the mental process .

		Afterwards , we do not give these men their due ; their thought has become so indubitably our own that we can not imagine it ever to have been something external to ourselves .

		The assimilation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, for ex - ample , by many generations of English-speaking peo - ple has been so complete that many men will read with mingled wonder and incredulity such a state - ment as that made by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	when he says : 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, '' The intellectual measure of every man since born in the domains of creative thought may be assigned to him according to the degree in which he has been taught by Shakespeare . ''

		An influence almost com - parable with that of Shakespeare has been exerted upon the thought of the present century by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, yet few among those whose thought has been shaped by the author of '' Faust '' and ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' could balance their account with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	off-hand .

		It is the peculiar merit of Mr.
J. R. Seeley	PERSON	's ''
Goethe Reviewed	ORGANIZATION	after Sixty Years '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- that it helps us to realize the magnitude of our intellectual debt to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, that it shows us how startlingly different some of our ideals might now have been had we not felt the contagion of his spirit , directly or indirectly .

		Mr.
Seeley	PERSON	's book is a small one , but its analysis includes all the essentials .

		In this respect it reminds us of his '' Napoleon the First , '' which it equals in weightiness .

		The author strikes deep when , for ex - ample , he says : '' It is the strenuous energy with which
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	enters into the battle of life , and fights there for a victory into which others may enter , that makes him great , that makes him the teacher of these later ages , this , and not some foppish pretension of being above it all , of seeing through it and despising it . ''

		And allied with the above passage is the fol - lowing pregnant suggestion , taken from a discussion of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's struggle for self-culture : '' Here is the refined form of selfishness of which
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	has been so often accused ; and undoubtedly the phrase is one which will bear a selfish interpretation , just as a Christian may be selfish when he devotes himself to the salvation of his soul . ''

		These are words to be seriously weighed before passing judgment upon
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's life , or assuming to set forth its ethical implications .

		It would be difficult sufficiently to praise Mr.
Seeley	PERSON	's essay for its insight , or for its philosophical setting forth of the meaning of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's life and work .

		The use of book-plates , or book - ook-Varks labels , originated with
Hans Igler	PERSON	in
Germany	LOCATION	sometime before the close of the fifteenth century .


Albert Dttrer	PERSON	engraved a book-plate for one Bilibald Pirckheimer in
1524	DATE	.


Elizabeth Pindar	PERSON	was the first English woman to use a book-plate -LRB- 1608 -RRB- , and another English wo - man , a
Miss Jenkins	PERSON	, of Bath -LRB- 1820 -RRB- , is the first known collector of these bibliographical curiosities .

		These particulars are well worth noting , now that the book-plate has arrived at a position of no small dignity .

		In
France	LOCATION	there is an Ex Libris Society , and this society publishes a Journal .

		England also has its Ex Libris Society , and we understand that
America	LOCATION	is threatened with a like invasion .

		It is a harmless mania , this collecting of book-tickets , at least so long as it does not mean the destruc - tion of books .

		Sir
Leicester Warren	PERSON	-LRB- now
Lord de Tabley	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- was the first Englishman to write a book on the subject , we believe , called '' A Guide to the Study of Book Plates . ''

		We now have a work of liberal proportions , written by Mr.
W. J. Hardy	PERSON	, entitled '' Book-Plates , '' and published in the series of '' Books about Books , '' imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		There are '' styles < ' in book-plates , as in furniture and book-bindings ; and to be au fait one should know how to discriminate as between the '' Armorial , '' '' Jacobean , '' '' Chip - pendale , '' and '' Allegoric '' or '' Symbolic . ''

		Some awkward blunders have been made , even in En - gland , in the selection of an armorial design ; as , for instance , when the Countess-Dowager of Bath , being a widow , should have '' borne her arms in a lozenge , '' but did n't .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	tells us he has aimed at giving in his handbook '' an historic sketch , however unpretentious , of the different styles adopted in designing book-plates , from their first introduc - tion '' down to the early years of the present cen - tury , `` after which no distinctive style can be said to exist . ''

		In the work of modern designers he finds only a few noteworthy examples , but these form '' a refreshing oasis in the desert of wild ec - centricity . ''

		The chief merit in an old-style plate , it seems to us , is found when the engraver has hap - pened to be a Dttrer , a
Hogarth	PERSON	, a Vertue , or a Morghen ; but detached examples of the more am - bitious work of these artists are still obtainable , so in place of the English and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	armorial book-plates let us have the `` wild eccentricities . ''

		Examples of these , we believe , are promised in the forthcoming books of Messrs. Castle and
Allen	PERSON	. ''

		Travels in
America	LOCATION	100 Years Ago '' American life .

		p and character -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	s '' Black and White series -RRB- is the record of the American impres - sions of one
Thomas Twining	PERSON	, an intelligent
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Indian who visited the
United States	ORGANIZATION	almost at the beginning of our national existence .

		As Mr.
Twin	PERSON	- ing was , the time and his nationality considered , a singularly liberal and unbiassed observer , his jot - tings are of value .

		Sailing from
Calcutta	LOCATION
Dec. 9 , 1795	DATE	, in the American ship ``
India	LOCATION	, '' of three hun - dred tons burthen , he reached
Philadelphia	LOCATION
April 7	DATE	, where , he records , '' I stepped ashore without even the aid of a plank , '' and was at once greeted with . ''

		How dost thou do , friend ?

		I am glad to see thee . ''

		Mr.
Twining	PERSON	visited the chief cities during his stay , and met many people of note .

		Especially interest - ing is his account of a visit to
General Washington	LOCATION	, who was then living at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	'' in a small red brick house on the left side of High Street , not much higher up than Fourth Street , '' and next door to a hair-dresser 's .

		Mr.
Twining	PERSON	was received by Mrs.
Washington	LOCATION	, '' a middle-sized lady , rather stout ; her manner extremely kind and unaffected . ''

		Presently '' the door opened , and Mrs.
Washington	LOCATION	and myself rising , she said , ' The President , ' and introduced me to him .

		Never did I feel more interest than at this moment , when I saw the tall , upright , venerable figure of this great man advancing to me to take me by the hand .

		There was a seriousness in his man - ner which seemed to contribute to the impressive dignity of his person , without diminishing the con - fidence and ease which the benevolence of his coun -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 tenance and the kindness of his address inspired .

		There are persons in whose appearance one looks in vain for the qualities they are known to possess , but the appearance of General
Washington	LOCATION	harmonized in a singular manner with the dignity and modesty of his public life .

		So completely did he look the great man he really was , that I felt rather respect than awe in his presence , and experienced neither the surprise nor disappointment with which a personal introduction to distinguished individuals is often ac - companied .

		... In person he was tall , well-propor - tioned , and upright .

		His hair was powdered , and tied behind .

		Although his deportment was that of a general , the expression of his features had rather the calm dignity of a legislator than the severity of a soldier . ''

		There is a portrait of the author .

		Shakespeare portrayed in modern comedy .

		The writing of a play with the great - est of all play-writers as its central figure and controlling spirit is cer - tainly a novel and adventurous task .

		This is what has been attempted by Mr.
Harry B. Smith	PERSON	in '' Will Shakspeare , a Comedy , '' published in an elegant private edition in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Writers of historical dramas have usually chosen subjects that afforded them a foundation of attested fact to build upon ; but this advantage has not been enjoyed by the writer of this little play , who has had to pick his material bit by bit from the mass of scraps and fragments , partly biography but more largely tradition and conjecture , that constitute about all we know of Shakespeare outside of his own works .

		Perhaps the meagreness of exact information has in one way been an advantage in this case , as it has left the au - thor greater freedom and independence in following his own insight and working out his own conception of his hero 's character .

		It is to be noted , as a prime merit of this ingenious production , that the author has really succeeded in making
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	real to us as a man and in giving to his character a genu - ine human interest .

		We see him as the roystering young fellow about
Stratford	LOCATION	, joining a party of strolling players and going off with them to Lon - don ; as a boon companion and reveller among the wits of the
Mermaid Tavern	ORGANIZATION	, with
Ben Jonson	PERSON	,
Fletcher	PERSON	,
Burbage	PERSON	, and other choice spirits of that time and place ; and , lastly , as a player at the Globe Theatre on the Bankside , beginning to concern him - self with matters of stage management , and taking the character of Hamlet in the ancient play which he had just re-written for the stage .

		These scenes and episodes are set forth with sympathy and pen - etration , and enlivened with much genuine humor .

		So admirably is the little three-act comedy con - structed , with such dramatic skill and so fine and sure a literary touch that it brings the character and environment of Shakespeare more vividly before us than volumes of mere biography or commentary could do .

		The play has , withal , much vivacity and spirit , with a number of capital situations which can of course be properly estimated only on the stage , to which it manifestly will find its way .

		Within College Walls '' -LRB-
The Baker & Ta y lor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of ten short papers on matters pertaining to the college .

		The author is President
Charles Franklin Thwing	PERSON	, of
Adelbert	LOCATION	.

		The tone of the book is religious and ethical ; its real subject , the college as a Christianizing agency .

		The author is of course right when he dwells on the importance of the college in developing character , on its possi - ble influence in leading to faith and to a sustaining trust in things divine .

		But just as distinctly he seems wrong when he insists that all this is the un - derlying principle and definite purpose of the col - lege 's existence .

		Every college , indeed , stands or should stand for the right ; but its real aim is to assist in the search for truth .

		Its religious and moral influence is a means , not an end .

		This dis - tinction between truth and right as the first aim of an institution of learning is not a verbal quibble .

		Its practical test lies here : build up your college as President Thwing would have it , and you run no end of risks .

		For instance , in engaging a professor , choose a good religious man who does n't know his subject , in preference to a scholar who is less holy but more erudite ; ask this new professor to make character - building his main work in the class - room : will this , or will it not , approximate toward the ideal college ?

		The author thinks it will .

		But the fact is that this plan has been tried disastrously over and over again .

		The scores of small and strug - gling denominational colleges that have followed the scheme contrast pitifully with the no less strug - gling state universities to which the plan was im - possible .

		Could the plan be fairly tried , the relig - ious would at once crowd out the scholarly ; and in the present system of our great universities the scholarly has never once crowded out the ethical .

		Lofty , then , as is the author 's aim , it is the aim of the man who sees but one side of the question , and that , tested by theory and experience , the unsafe side .

		Few besides special students know much about this subject , the manuals of English Litera - ture commonly dismissing it with brief mention , as having but little relation to the more important sec - ular drama by which it was followed .

		Miss
Bates	PERSON	does not so regard it , but considers the Miracle Plays to have been the training school of the ro - mantic drama .

		She finds them , despite crudities , prolixities , and absurdities of detail , to have ren - dered very important service to the Elizabethan drama .

		They not only bequeathed to it scope and freedom , large constructive principles , reality of characterization , and intensity of passion , but they paved the way for its reception and recognition .

		They made
England	LOCATION	a nation of actors and theatre - lovers , who would be content with no such learned and elegant trifling as amused the court and uni - versity , but demanded range , earnestness , life .

Towneley	LOCATION	,
Ches	PERSON	- ter , and
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	remain in completeness , and to the description of these , with some citations and a critical chapter on their dramatic values , the larger portion of Miss
Bates	PERSON	's book is devoted .

		A con - cluding chapter on the Moralities is only less inter - esting because the subject is in itself a dull one .

		Taken as a whole , the subject is treated with fulness and accuracy , and in a style so pleasing and pictur - esque that the volume will find many appreciative readers .

		The mechanical execution of this volume is inferior to that of the sixteen volumes previously issued .

Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.

		Next to nothing is absolutely known of
Saskia	LOCATION	, and Mr.

		His little book is , however , readable enough in its mod - est way , and the copious plates -LRB- mostly portraits and studies , more or less plausibly presumed to be

		NEW YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
January 24 , 1894	DATE	.

		Anyone who observes the work done by illustrators , American and foreign , in the periodicals of the time , can not fail to be impressed with the amount of genius and technical ability which they bring to their task .

		The immense advance in the art of illustrating which has taken place within the past few years has lately been emphasized by the publication of numerous books treat - ing of illustrators and their designs .

		But to me the most significant piece of illustration observed in last year 's periodicals was an instantaneous photographic view of the sinking of
H. M. S. Victoria	PERSON	, reproduced by process in one of the
London	LOCATION	illustrated weeklies .

		This photo - graph was taken by a British officer on board one of the accompanying vessels , and , while small in size and not
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 91 very distinct , conveys a striking impression of the event .

		There can be no question that it was the great and in - creasing interest in amateur photography which made it possible for this officer to have his camera at hand , to understand its use , and to grasp the occasion on the mo - ment .

		Possibly fifty imaginative pictures of this disaster have been drawn for the periodical press , but none of them has appealed so strongly to the imagination as this actual view of the event itself .

		These suggestions came to mind in looking over a copy of Mr.
Alexander Black	PERSON	's '' Photography Indoors and Out , '' just published by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	, and bear - ing for its sub-title `` A Book for Amateurs . ''

		The little volume has met with exceeding favor in the press , and is likely to prove a valuable manual for all beginners in photography .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	has been for some years the literary editor of the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	-LRB- N. Y. -RRB- '' Times . ''

		He devotes a great part of his spare time to the study and practice of photography as a fine art , and frequently lec - tures on the relations of photography to its sister arts .

		The announcement of an article on
Nikola Tesla	PERSON	, by
T. C. Martin	PERSON	, in the
February	DATE	number of `` The Century Magazine , '' calls attention to the fact that
Tesla	ORGANIZATION	is already acknowledged in the electrical world as a sort of junior
Edison	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Martin	PERSON	recently issued a volume entitled '' The Inventions , Researches , and Writings of
Nikola Tesla	PERSON	, '' which contains a description of the inventor 's discoveries and his principal lectures delivered before electrical societies .

		Mr.
Tesla	PERSON	is a native of
Servia	LOCATION	, and has , I believe , received from that country a decoration in recognition of his achievements .

		The article in the last number of THE DIAL entitled '' The Star ' System in Periodicals '' comes very appropri - ately at a time when this system , having been '' worked '' to the furthest possible point , seems to show signs of an early death .

		One amusing phase of the system is its adoption by the advertising fraternity .

		So it caused no great surprise to pick up in some little shop a pamphlet entitled '' The Story of My First Watch : Told by
Emi	ORGANIZATION	- nent Americans . ''

		Surely , thought I , this is the latest venture in the composite-article field ; but on turning over the leaves I found that it was nothing more or less than the advertising device of a shrewd manufacturer of watches , who had induced fifteen or twenty of the public men and women whose names appear most prominently in '' The ' Star ' System in Periodicals '' to write from a quarter to half a page descriptive of how they came in possession of their first watches , the whole made up into a pamphlet , with portraits of the writers , some of whose stories were extremely interesting .

		The advertisers of the day are indeed quick to seize upon new ideas , but it appears to me that their adoption of the '' star system '' in vogue among various periodicals will compel the latter , in turn , to seek for some other novelty .

		Nevertheless , for a while it has seemed as if the great American public was more deeply interested in how our leading authors wrote their first books than in the books themselves an injustice to the books in a majority of cases .

		Mr.
William Young	PERSON	, the poet and dramatist , whose comedy , '' The Rajah , '' made such a successful run at the Old Madison Square Theatre , and whose blank verse tragedies , ''
Pendragon	ORGANIZATION	'' and ''
Ganelon	PERSON	, '' were so artist - ically produced by the late
Lawrence Barrett	PERSON	, is spend - ing the winter in
Washington	LOCATION	, engaged in perfecting arrangements for the production of his new comedy dealing with Revolutionary times .

		He has written for the forthcoming number of '' The Cosmopolitan '' a little poem entitled '' The Beggars , '' which deals with the quarrel between the rich man and the poor man from a socialistic point of view .

		Talking with Dr.
Edward Eggleston	PERSON	the other day , I was interested to learn that the old straw chair in his library at ``
Joshua	PERSON	's Rock , ''
Lake George	PERSON	, was woven by an ex-slave of
John Randolph	PERSON	, when about ninety years of age .

		.

		The chair has been in use for more than twenty years , and in it the Doctor has written all his novels , from '' The Hoosier Schoolmaster '' to '' The Faith Doctor . ''

		The desk in the same room is one that belonged to Dr.
Eggleston	PERSON	's great-grandfather in Co - lonial times .

		Much interest is taken in the authors ' reading , or ma - tine `` e , soon to be given in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The proceeds will be devoted to the relief of the suffering poor .

		The list of patronesses includes both prominent society ladies and ladies prominent in the literary world a combina - tion , perhaps , devoutly to be desired , but not yet con - summated , in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Samuel L. Clemens	PERSON	, Col.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	, Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	, Mrs.
Julia C. R. Dorr	PERSON	, and others have prom - ised to read , and a large sum of money will be obtained for the charitable purposes of those concerned in man - aging the affair .

		From
Boston	LOCATION	also comes news of the death in
Rome	LOCATION	of Mrs.
William Wetmore Story	PERSON	, the wife of the sculptor-poet .

		She was a
Miss Eldredge	LOCATION	, of Bos - ton , and her son , who married
Emma Eames	PERSON	, is Julian Story .

		Mrs. Story , it is said , was a woman of uncom - mon intellectual attainments , of lovely character , of high social distinction , and in her early years was considered a great beauty .

		By the death of Prof.
Edward T. McLaughlin	PERSON	,
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	suffered as great a loss in her professorial staff as she has met with in recent years .

		The univer - sity has always been greatly hampered in its literary department by financial inability to provide a sufficient number of instructors .

		The incumbent professors , with Mr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	, have accomplished what they could , but the latter 's youthful enthusiasm will be greatly missed by them .

		One of his specialties was the study of mediaeval life and literature , and a volume on these subjects , the manuscript of which he had completed , will shortly be published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Mr.
Frederick Douglass	PERSON	has written an introduction for a translation of the life of
Toussaint L'Ouverture	ORGANIZATION	by the late
M. Victor Sehffilcher	PERSON	.

		The translation will be by Mr.

		Renan 's library , we are told , will be sold in a few weeks .

		The catalogue , now in preparation , will contain about 7,000 titles , being the pick of the collection .

		The unimportant books have already been weeded out and disposed of .

		M.
Emile Terquem	PERSON	, who represented the French pub - lishers at the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, sends us a copy of the report made by him to the
Paris	LOCATION	Cercle de la

		He expresses great satisfaction with the success of the exhibit , even from the point of view of sales actually made , since he found it necessary to take back only 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, twenty out of the sixty-five cases of books placed on exhibition .

		Of the very attractive catalogue issued by him
1500	DATE	copies were distributed .

		The following words have a melancholy interest as being the last written for publication by Professor
Tyn	PERSON	- dall , and the fact that they were written as a
Christ	LOCATION	- mas message to his friends in
America	LOCATION	doubles their interest for us on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	: '' I choose the nobler part of
Emerson	LOCATION	, when , after various disen - chantments , he exclaims , ' I covet truth ! '

		The gladness of true heroism visits the heart of him who is really com - petent to say this . ''

		One can not help thinking of the motto veritatem dilexi that Renan desired should be engraved upon his tombstone .

		The report of Commissioner
Harris	PERSON	on the Common Schools of the
United States	LOCATION	shows an enrollment for 1891-92 of over thirteen millions of pupils , the average daily attendance being about eight and a half millions .

		A quarter of a million women and half that number of men were engaged in teaching these children for an av - erage of 137 days in the year .

		The total expenditure was in excess of one hundred and fifty millions .

		The school term is slowly lengthening and the annual expend - iture is increasing .

		The noticeable replacement of men by women as teachers is an unfortunate symptom in view of the great disproportion already existing .

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has recently purchased what is claimed to be the most complete collection in existence of the public documents of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There are from four to five thousand volumes .

		The pur - chase includes , besides nearly three thousand volumes of
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and

		There will be no chronicle of art , literature , music , the drama , contributed by an established staff ; but on all questions of the hour the ' Revue de

		CONSTANCE
FENIMORE WOOLSON	PERSON	.

		By the death of Miss
Constance Fenimore Woolson	PERSON	, which occurred at
Venice	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
January 24	DATE	,
America	LOCATION	lost one of the best of its fiction writers .

		She wrote a great many short stories and sketches , besides a half dozen or so extended novels ; the last of these , ''
Horace Chase	PERSON	, '' was lately published as a serial in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly , '' and will soon appear in book form .

		Miss
Woolson	PERSON	was born at
Claremont	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, in
1845	DATE	, her mother being a niece of
Fenimore Cooper	ORGANIZATION	.

		From an authentic sketch of her life , written by Mr.
Arthur Stedman	PERSON	, and published in '' The Book Buyer '' for Oc - tober ,
1889	DATE	, we make the following extracts : '' While yet a child ,
Miss Woolson	PERSON	was taken by her parents to
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, her father 's business interests having become centred there .

		She was educated at a
Cleveland	LOCATION	young ladies ' seminary and at the famous French school of
Madame Chegaray	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Her summers were chiefly spent , while a girl , on the island of
Mackinac	LOCATION	, in the straits connecting
Lakes Huron	LOCATION	and
Michigan	LOCATION	.

		She often , however , accompanied her father on his business trips to the shores of Lake Superior , through the farming districts of the
Western Reserve	ORGANIZATION	, and up and down the
Ohio Valley	LOCATION	, until she became familiar with a great part of the country that includes the great lakes and the Central States . ''

		Her father 's death , in
1869	DATE	, and the consequent breaking up of the family , cast a shadow on her life , and urged her to serious pursuits .

		She had been brought up strictly in the Episcopal faith , and at this time had published a number of articles in periodicals of that de - nomination ... Her literary field soon extended , and stories , sketches , and poems appeared in profusion in `
Harper	PERSON	's ' and other leading magazines .

		Selected stories relating to the region of the great lakes were published as Miss
Woolson	PERSON	's first book , in
1875	DATE	, with the title , ` Castle Nowhere : Lake-Country Sketches . ' ''

		In the
fall of 1873	DATE	, her mother 's failing health ne - cessitated a trip to
Florida	LOCATION	.

		There , at
St. Augustine	ORGANIZATION	and on an island in the
St. John 's River	LOCATION	, Mrs. and
Miss Woolson	PERSON	remained for five winters , the summers being spent in the mountains of
North Carolina	LOCATION	and
Virginia	LOCATION	, in
South Carolina	LOCATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	, and later with their rel - atives at
Cooperstown	LOCATION	.

		The literary results of this long stay in the South are readily to be discerned . ''

		The death of her mother in
February , 1879	DATE	, caused a complete change in Miss
Woolson	PERSON	's plans , and the same year she sailed for
England	LOCATION	.

		Since then she has been in
America	LOCATION	but once , and for a very short time .

		Her winters have been passed chiefly at
Florence	LOCATION	, though she has resided for long periods at
Rome	LOCATION	and
Sorrento	PERSON	.

		In
summer	DATE	she has lived at
Venice	LOCATION	, and at various re - sorts in
Switzerland	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	... Since the be - ginning of
1887	DATE	Miss
Woolson	PERSON	has lived at the Villa Bricchieri , just outside the Roman gate of
Florence	LOCATION	, the same locality that is mentioned in Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's '
Aurora Leigh	LOCATION	, ' '' ' I found a house at
Florence	LOCATION	on the hill of Bellosguardo . ' ''

		Miss
Woolson	PERSON	is not a rapid composer .

		Her novel ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 93 '
Anne	PERSON	, ' was nearly three years in the writing , a worthy example to novelists of the day .

		Her first book , and the second collection of stories , ` Rodman the Keeper : Southern Sketches , ' published in
1880	DATE	, had attracted attention to the new author , but the appearance of '
Anne	PERSON	' in book form , in
1882	DATE	, placed her at once in the front rank of American prose writers .

		This volume has been followed by ` For the Major ,
1883	DATE	; `
East Angels	LOCATION	, '
1886	DATE	; and ` Jupiter Lights , '
1889	DATE	, the last of which , the '
London	LOCATION	Spectator ' thinks , bids fair to rival '
Anne	PERSON	, ' which it calls ' one of the best novels
America	LOCATION	has produced for the
last quarter	DATE	of a century . '

		Our novelist is intensely American .

		All of these books deal with the life and adventures of Americans in their own country , though of widely differing types , and in Avidely separated districts . ''

		122 THE USES OF BOOKS .

		Those who have written in the praise of books , from
Richard de Bury	ORGANIZATION	and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	to
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Carlyle	PERSON	, have mostly been con - tent with the assumption that books are meant to be read .

		The other use of books , that made by the student , who considers them as the im - plements or apparatus of his work , has been largely ignored by such eloquent panegyrists of literature as those above named .

		In spite of an occasional suggestion , such as that made by
Bacon	PERSON	when he tells us that '' some books are to be read only in parts , '' the second function of literature has been left for the modern bib - liographer fully to recognize , and even he has by no means reached as yet the general con - sciousness of the intelligent public .

		Dr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
Frederick Poole	PERSON	, the veteran librarian , whose faith and works have gone hand in hand for nearly half a century , has done as much as anyone among modern bibliographers to call attention to the uses of books for reference rather than for reading , to their employment as intellectual tools rather than as means of mere gratification .

		The subject has been re - called to us by a little book just published by Dr.
Poole	PERSON	, and a few remarks upon so inter - esting a theme may not be inappropriate .

		Dr.
Poole	PERSON	's book is a university address , and has to do with the relations of the library to educational work .

		Its essential plea is thus stated : '' I wished to show that the study of bibliography and of the scientific methods of using books should have an assured place in the university curriculum ; that a wise and pro- fessional bibliographer should be a member of the faculty and have a part in training all the students ; that the library should be his class - room , and that all who go forth into the world as graduates should have such an intelligent and practical knowledge of books as will aid them in their studies through life , and the use of books be to them a perpetual delight and refresh - ment . ''

		All this is admirably put , and we give it the most cordial assent .

		But possibly the au - thor does not quite realize the extent to which the aims which he thus outlines have already reached fulfilment .

		Although he gives due credit to the bibliographical work done in some half a dozen of our leading universities , he is 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, evidently still haunted by recollections of his own student years , when ''
Yale College Li	ORGANIZATION	- brary might as well have been in
Weathers	LOCATION	- field or
Bridgeport	LOCATION	as in
New Haven	LOCATION	, as far as the students in those days were concerned . ''

		Certainly the state of things in which '' books , outside of the text-books used , had no part in our education '' no longer exists in any Amer - ican college having any standing at all .

		At that time , we read , books '' were never quoted , recommended , nor mentioned by the instruct - ors in the class-room . ''

		To-day , it is safe enough to say that in our higher institutions of a progressive sort , books of reference are men - tioned , quoted , and recommended to an extent that must help compliant students to enter into the feelings of a
Strasburg	LOCATION	goose .

		And in the Seminar , rapidly becoming naturalized in our better universities , the work done is almost wholly of the sort that Dr.
Poole	PERSON	pleads for .

		Yet it would be possible to progress one step further in this direction , and the gist of Dr.
Poole	PERSON	's address may be found in what he says upon this point .

		The class-room lecture , with its frequent references to the literature of the subject dealt with , and the graduate Seminar , which brings the student into actual contact with that literature , and sets him to delving in it , are praiseworthy as far as they go , but their effect -LRB- from the bibliographical stand - point -RRB- remains special , and therefore incom - plete .

		Dr.
Poole	PERSON	dreams of a time when the student may be given the keys , not only of his own subjects , but of all others that he may pos - sibly at some time in the future wish to make his own .

		Not , we are told , '' that he should learn the contents of the most useful books , '' but '' that he should know of their existence , what they treat of , and what they will do for him . ''

		And the author goes on to say : '' He should know what are the most important gen - eral reference books which will answer not only his own questions , but the multitude of inquiries put to him by less-favored associates who regard him as an educated man .

		If a question arises as to the existence , authorship , or subject of a book , an educated man should know the catalogues or bibliographies by which he can readily clear up the doubt .

		The words
Watt	PERSON	,
Larousse	LOCATION	,
Graesse	LOCATION	,
Querard	ORGANIZATION	,
Hoefer	PERSON	,
Kayser	PERSON	,
Hinrichs	PERSON	,
Meyer	PERSON	, Ham , and
Vapereau	PERSON	should not be unmeaning sounds to him .

		He should know the standard writers on a large variety of subjects . ''

		There is no doubt that a certain amount of this sort of knowledge would prove a useful equipment to the educated man , whatever his specialty ; and there is likewise no doubt that the process of getting it for one 's self unaided is a laborious task .

		We believe , with Dr.
Poole	PERSON	, that every university having a library should also have a librarian , and that cata - loguing and custodianship should be but a part of his duties .

		His rank as a member of the faculty of instruction should be undisputed , and he should act not only as a general ad - viser to students , but also as the teacher of his specific subject .

		He should be both a compe - tent professional bibliographer and a man of the broadest general culture , familiar with the outlines of many subjects , and conversant with the literature of the languages of culture .

		From such an instructor the student might get a knowledge of the resources of the general li - brary sure to stand him in good stead upon many occasions , and by such a colleague even the department professor might often be di - rected to sources of information that would have escaped his own search .

		The true func - tion of the university librarian has already been apprehended in some of our higher institutions of learning , but he claims a far more general recognition than has yet been accorded him , and we are glad that Dr.
Poole	PERSON	has given us this opportunity to supplement his own vigor - ous and convincing appeal made in behalf of the bibliographical educator .


MAXIME DUCAMP	PERSON	, member of the French Acad - emy , died in
Paris	LOCATION	on the ninth of this month .

		He was born in
Paris	LOCATION
February 8 , 1822	DATE	.

		When a young man , he made a journey in the
East	LOCATION	, which he de - scribed in his '' Souvenirs et Paysage d'Orient '' -LRB- 1848 -RRB- .

		In the insurrection of
1848	DATE	he fought in the ranks of the
National Guard	ORGANIZATION	and was decorated .

		Sent by the government upon a second
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	journey , which occupied the period 1849-51 , he re - turned to write of his experiences in '' Egypte , Nu - bie , Palestine , et
Syrie	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1852 -RRB- , and Le Nil , Egypte , et Nubie '' -LRB- 1854 -RRB- .

		He devoted the fol - lowing years to the composition of poems and novels .

		In
1860	DATE	, the conservative of
1848	DATE	had become radical enough to take part in the Sicilian expe - dition of
Garibaldi	PERSON	and the Thousand .

		This was written up in his '' Expedition des Deux-Siciles . ''

		Another volume of travel , '' Orient et Italie , '' ap - peared in
1868	DATE	.

		His greatest work , ``
Paris	LOCATION	, Ses Organes , Ses Functions , et Sa Vie '' -LRB- 1869-75 -RRB- fills six volumes .

		Next in importance is `` Les Convul - sions de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' a history of the Commune , in which he again figured as a conservative , and earned the hatred of the radicals .

		He was a realist in art , and as a student of history and society had pronounced affi - liations with

		THE DIAL 101 ENGLISH AT
COLUMBIA COLLEGE	ORGANIZATION	* In a small college a professor of English is called upon to give instruction in three or four distinct subjects , in the use of the English language , ordi - narily termed rhetoric , in the history of the English language , in the history of English literature , and often also -LRB- if he should happen to be ambitious -RRB- in the history of the development of the more im - portant literary forms -LRB- the drama , for example , and the novel -RRB- in other literatures as well as in English .

		In a large college , and in a university where much graduate work is carried on , these four subjects are divided among different professors , each of whom , whatever the title of his chair , in reality gives in - struction in those divisions of the subject in which he takes most interest .

		At
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	we have a Professor of Rhetoric and English Com - position , Mr.
George R. Carpenter	PERSON	, with several as - sistants .

		We have a Professor of English Language and Literature , Mr.
Thomas R. Price	PERSON	, and an Ad - junct Professor of English , Mr.
A. V. Williams Jackson	PERSON	.

		We have also two Professors of Litera - ature , Mr.
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	and myself .

		In the department of rhetoric , Prof.
G. R. Car	PERSON	- penter and his chief assistant , Mr.
Baldwin	PERSON	, lecture to the lower classes on the principles of English composition .

		As the best way to teach students to write is to have them write freely and frequently , they are called upon to express themselves on topics in which they are interested and often of their own choice .

		Their written work for other professors is often submitted also to the instructors in rhetoric .

		These essays are criticised by the instructors in pri - vate talks with every individual student .

		The gen - eral tendency of the instruction is affirmative rather than negative .

		In other words , instead of telling the student what he must not do and of dwelling on the faults he should avoid , the aim of the in - structors is to show him how to express himself easily and vigorously .

		As this is Professor Car - penter 's first year at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, the courses in rhet - oric are not yet fully developed ; next year they will be enlarged and increased .

		Certain courses given by other professors really belong in the de - partment of rhetoric .

		One of these is Professor Price 's course -LRB- two hours a week throughout the year -RRB- on the '' Laws of Prose Composition in En - glish . ''

		Another is my own -LRB- one hour a week through - out the year -RRB- on '' The Art of English Versification , '' an attempt to give practical instruction in metrical composition .

		The instruction in the history of the English lan - guage is as distinct as may be from the instruction in the history of English literature .

		ment of the Germanic languages , of which Prof.
H. H. Boyesen	PERSON	is the head , he and Prof.
W. H. Car	PERSON	- penter offer courses in Icelandic , in
Gothic	LOCATION	, in Mid - dle High German and in Old High German , all of which would be useful to a student of English philology .

		Professor
Jackson	PERSON	has one course -LRB- two hours a week throughout the year -RRB- in '' Anglo-Saxon Language and Historical English Grammar '' ; an - other -LRB- two hours a week , half the year only -RRB- on '' Anglo-Saxon Poetry '' ; a third -LRB- two hours a week , half the year only -RRB- , on '' Early and Middle English from the Twelfth to the
Fifteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Pro- fessor Price has a course -LRB- two hours a week through - out the year -RRB- on '' Anglo-Saxon Prose and Historical English Syntax . ''

		In the history of English literature , Professor Price has three courses -LRB- each two hours a week throughout the year -RRB- , one on `` Shakespeare : lan - guage , versification , and method of dramatic po - etry '' ; another on '' Chaucer : language , versifica - tion , and method of narrative poetry '' ; and a third on `` The Poetry of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, and Mat - thew Arnold . ''

		A course on the '' English drama to the closing of the theatres -LRB- 1640 -RRB- exclusive of Shakespeare '' -LRB- two hours a week throughout the year -RRB- is given conjointly by Professors
Jackson	PERSON	and
Woodberry	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	gives four other courses ; two -LRB- each one hour a week for half the year -RRB- on `` Spenser and the Elizabethan poets , ex - clusive of drama , '' and on ''
Milton	PERSON	and the
Caro	PERSON	- line poets '' ; and two -LRB- each two hours a week through - out the year -RRB- on `` Eighteenth Century Literature '' and on `` Nineteenth Century Literature . ''

		This last course considers only British authors , and therefore it conflicts in no way with my own course -LRB- two hours a week throughout the year -RRB- on '' American Litera - ture . ''

		Perhaps these three divisions , rhetoric , English language , and English literature , include all the courses which can fairly be called English ; but closely allied to the first and to the third of these divisions is literature , literature at large , inde - pendent of any given tongue , just as linguistics is independent of any given language , and going from one tongue to another , just as linguistics goes from one language to another .

		In this sense , the study of literature is the tracing of the evolution of liter - ary form and of the development of criticism as masterpieces came into existence .

		In this depart - ment Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	has two courses , one -LRB- two hours a week throughout the year -RRB- on the `` History and Theory of Criticism ;
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Aris	PERSON	- totle ,
Horace	PERSON	, Quintillian ,
Sidney	PERSON	,
Boileau	PERSON	, Dry - den ,
Lessing	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	'' ; and another , open only to students who have taken the first , on '' The Prac - tice of Criticism , '' a review of the greater works of literature , with specific original inquiries in partic - ular epochs .

		And I have two courses also , one -LRB- two hours a week throughout the year -RRB- on `` The Epochs of the Drama : Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, Spanish , English , French , German '' ; and another -LRB- one hour a week 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, throughout the year -RRB- on '' The Development of the Modern Novel , '' from the
Gesta Romanorum	ORGANIZATION	to
Waverley	LOCATION	.

		SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It would be premature to estimate the influence of the '' Report of the
Committee on Secondary School Studies	ORGANIZATION	, '' discussed editorially in your issue of
January 16	DATE	, but it is not too soon to indicate some of its char - acteristics that justify misgivings .

		Those happy ones who can forget their securom agere cevom long enough to become aware of the total depravity of secondary education , and to conceive a missionary zeal for its sal - vation , should begin by understanding the causes of its present unregenerate condition ; yet these causes are just what the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	and the Conferences ignore .

		Some of us do not agree that '' the most defective part of our education is that of secondary schools '' ; we be - lieve that it is incomparably the most important and the most unmanageable part , and that we who are engaged in it understand its deficiencies and its difficulties far bet - ter than the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	and the Conferences are ever likely to note them ; and we despair of any effectual growth in grace until true causes are recognized and true remedies are applied .

		Our conviction is that , tak - ing into consideration the relative conditions and pro- portionsage , maturity , and training on the pupil 's side , and independence , facilities , control , incentives , on that of the college the result in real education as dis - tinguished from technical skill in any given case is more largely due to the secondary school than to the college a result proceeding from the fact that , in spite of all their peculiar difficulties , from which colleges are exempted , the schools do teach and the colleges do not .

		In this general connection , the Minority Report of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	is very significant as exhibiting the astound - ing theory of educational values accepted by the Com - mittee and as intimating the haste with which such con - clusions were reached .

		More potent than defects of method , lack of coordi - nation , and incompetence of teachers , are the `` evil times '' on which we are fallen .

		An ever-lessening school-year , multiplying holidays , interrupted health of pupils , `` prac - tical '' considerations , social distractions , everything in the air is against the serious work of schools , public as well as private , provincial as well as metropolitan , with of course some difference in degree .

		* Comparisons with the systems of foreign countries are irrelevant and mis - leading , because they are not thorough-going : in fact , as cited they do not necessarily prove their point .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	at present , a forty-weeks ' programme anchored to abstractions is a very different thing from a forty-weeks ' programme dependent on distractions .

		Speaking broadly , and with some exception as to strictly graded schools , secondary education is what col - leges have begotten or adopted : colleges have brought the schools to do , and now they flout them too .

		Some comments and suggestions of the Conferences , whether intentionally or not , imply this recognition ; but the Com - mittee of Ten , who , as auditors and interpreters , might have been expected to collect and organize these hints , weighing their significance and pointing the appropriate moral , are too scientific for '' traces , '' too dignified for innuendo , too blithe for self-reproach ; and we look in vain for the desiderated nos consoles desumus .

		Yet it is absolutely just for schools that have long felt the cramping conditions of college requirements , operating as almost the only definite standards of higher -LRB- as dis - tinguished from '' practical '' or technical -RRB- education , to insist on having their results criticised in accordance with the number and volume and character of those re - quirements as used for examination purposes .

		This accountability of colleges is amply illustrated in this document .

		Of the members of the Conferences , forty-eight were college-men and forty-two were school - men .

		The easy assumption of propriety in this distribu - tion is enough in itself to show that , in the eyes of our Colossi , we must be underlings even in the measure of our authorized aspirations ; but our subserviency is far greater .

		Of the forty r two school-men , almost two - thirds were principals ; so that it is fair to assume that not more than half of the total number of school-men have been actual teachers so recently and so largely , or have otherwise lived in such close and unbroken rela - tions with the real work of teaching , as to be teachers in any true sense .

		The proper ratio would have been far different : there was need of only enough college - men to formulate their special observations from vari - ous points of view of weakness in school-work , their ex - pectations for the proper prosecution of college studies as conceived and designed , their remorse for past igno - rance and indifference as to the work and the embarrass - ments of schools , and their acquiescence in a reasonable adaptation of their own crotchets to the possibilities of secondary education at the present time .

		Decisions and recommendations of practicability should have been left to actual teachers of tried success as such , disposed by education and experiences and sympathy to aspire even when constrained to temporary contentment .

		Teach - ing is a practical matter , with conditions of system and sequence and completeness and repetition and illumina - tion , from one or all of which most college-teachers ' -LRB- though not otherwise as excusable as
Lowell	LOCATION	in
Dante	LOCATION	-RRB- consider themselves exempted by a change of venue never open to actual teachers , who are accountable to tests they can seldom forecast and often consider irra - tional , and who are to a great extent dependent on suc - cess in arbitrary examinations for livelihood and repu - tation .

		`` THE ` STAR ' SYSTEM IN PERIODICALS '' AGAIN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		With the rest of your readers , I greatly enjoyed the article entitled '' The ' Star ' System in Periodicals , '' in your issue of
Jan. 16	DATE	.

		But there is one point waiting to be touched upon , it seems to me ; another abnormal development of the '' star '' system , not referred to in the paper .

		It wittily describes the contributions of the specialist ; but what is to be said when the specialist in one field poaches upon the domain of another ?

		Let the distinguished and erudite Professor Pterodactyl dis - course as profoundly and as prosily as he will upon his chosen subject of Palaeontology ; and let the discussion between himself and the equally distinguished Profes - sor Trilobite wax hot and incomprehensible : there are students of the subject , doubtless , self-disciplined suf - ficiently to follow on , albeit afar off , with some degree of interest and appreciation .

		But , sad to relate , some fatal morning the eminent Pterodactyl receives a flat - tering note from the editor of a prominent Review , con - taining an urgent invitation to contribute to it a paper upon '' The Situation in
Hawaii	LOCATION	, '' with an exposition of his views on annexing the Antipodes , and a few prac - tical suggestions relative to queens and the sugar bounty .

		Upon the self-same evil day the learned Trilobite finds in his morning 's mail a polite letter from the editor of a rival Review requesting that he participate in a sym - posium with three other distinguished gentlemen -LRB- they are , it appears , an M. C. from
Missouri	LOCATION	, a prominent English brewer who happens to be temporarily in this country looking about with an eye to speculation , and a very celebrated major-general who since '' the late un - pleasantness '' has spent most of the time in African travel and exploration -RRB- who are to discuss severally and collectively the present attitude towards Realism in
Fic	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		The editor is certain that the views of such dis - tinguished men upon a subject of so much popular in - terest can not fail to suggest much of value to the great reading public of
America	LOCATION	.

		These two excellent and , up to this time , entirely respectable professors are at first a trifle shocked by these suggestions ; recovering duly , they smile a dreary smile of conscious frailty , ponder , conceive , labor , and are delivered respectively of anom - alous and grotesque monstrosities , which , together with similar hapless productions from other sources , disfigure and obscure the pages of the magazines .

		Now this is very absurd , and should of course be touched upon in any discussion of the '' star '' system .

		Many of our pe - riodicals now advertise the name of their contributors rather than the titles of the articles ; and the competi - tion of editorship is in some quarters largely a smart ri - valry in securing noted names .

		This is legitimate enough when the author and his work may be identified as re - lated ; but to-day , in authorship as in every department of human industry , man 's field is not the world .

		Spec - ulation of course invades the sanctum , and brilliant Na - poleons of editing assure us that there is everything in `` a name . ''

		Is this a phase of development , or is it a f ad ?

		In his recently published letters -LRB- Vol .

		II. , pp. 55 - 56 -RRB- Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	refers to the difficulties of some of his critics in relation to a word occurring in '' The
Cathe	PERSON	- dral , '' - '' ... shocks of surf that clorab and fell , Spume-sliding down the baffled cfectraan , '' and attempts the genealogy of the word , finding it in several Latin writers -LRB- fluctus decumanus * -RRB- , but being unable to name any English author who had used it in this sense . ''

		I think I shall probably come across the word somewhere in English again , '' Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	writes , '' where I no doubt met with it years ago .

		A word that cleaves to the memory is always a good word that 's the way to test them . ''

		It will interest readers of
Lowell	LOCATION	to note that the word decuman , meaning the tenth wave , is given in the new '' Century Dictionary '' with quotations from two minor English writers .

		The locus classicus in English , however , for the discussion of the phenomenon itself , is in that delightful repository of all questions strange and wonderful , the
Pseudodoxia Epidemica	LOCATION	, or Vulgar Er - rors , of Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	.

London	LOCATION	,

		I find elsewhere also a quotation ascribed to Burke : '' At length , tumbling from the Gallic coast , the victorious tenth wave shall ride like the boar over all the rest . ''

		And in
Tennyson	PERSON	-LRB- '' The Coming of Arthur '' -RRB- there is a reference to the ninth wave a variation doubtless due to the two different methods of enumeration , whether inclusive or exclusive : `` And then the two Dropt to the cove , and - watch 'd the great sea
fall	DATE	, Wave after wave , each mightier than the last , Till last , a ninth one , gathering half the deep And full of voices , slowly rose and plunged Roaring , and all the wave was in a flame . ''

		But probably the allusion is not an unusual one in English poetry .

		RECOLLECTIONS AXD SKETCHES OF SOME LITERARY FOLK .

		* Mr.
Francis Espinasse	PERSON	's volume of '' Recol - lections and Sketches '' forms an exceedingly entertaining and valuable collection of literary memorabilia perhaps the freshest and best one , all in all , that has come to our notice of late .

		The author , a Frenchman by blood , a Scot by birth , and a Londoner by adoption , seems to have had a sort of genius for falling in with people who , as Mrs.
Leo Hunter	PERSON	phrased it , '' are celebrated for their works and talents . ''

		Fortunately , a turn for noting and mentally storing up salient personal traits and pungent odds and ends of talk has enabled him to make the most of his Boswellian opportunities in a Boswellian way .

		Nearly two-thirds of the book are devoted to '' The Carlyles and a Segment of their Circle , '' the remaining captions being : '' The British Museum Library Fifty Years Ago , and After , '' '' Concerning the
Organiza	PERSON	- tion of Literature , '' ''
George Henry Lewes	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	, '' ''
James Hannay	PERSON	and his Friends , '' ''
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	and his Second Jour - nal , '' '' Literary Journalism , '' '' Lord Beacons - field and his Minor Biographers , '' etc. .

		The contents of the volume are based on a series of articles , which appeared monthly in `` The Book - man '' during the two years from its commence - ment in
1891	DATE	.

		These have been considerably enlarged ; and the chapters entitled '' Literary Journalism '' and `` Later Edinburgh Memoirs '' are now printed for the first time .

		In his opening chapter , which is devoted to Early Reminiscences , the author recounts his boyish impressions of certain celebrities of a past generation , among them Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	,
Thomas Campbell	PERSON	, and
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Of Sir
Walter	PERSON	he is at least able to say
Virgilium	PERSON	vidi tantum , having enjoyed a fugitive glimpse of the author of '' Waverley '' while a pupil at the Melrose preparatory school : '' One day I was out walking with a governess or other female guardian , when an open carriage , with an elderly gentleman sitting in it reading , and a boy on a pony trotting by its side , was seen coming along a bend in the road , so that we had them in full view . '

		Look , ' said my companion , ' that is Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	and his grandson . '

		Look I did at the author of my favorite ' Tales of a Grandfather , ' and especially at the enviable , boy for whom they were written , to whom they were addressed , and who seemed to me more or less de - formed . ''

		* LITERARY RECOLLECTIONS AND SKETCHES .

		By
Francis Espinasse	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	| Of
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	he obtained a nearer view .

		It was during the poet 's final visit to
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, where , as a distinguished bard and a '' brither
Scot	PERSON	, '' he was much feted and caressed by the higher order of Amphitryons , as well as by members of the
Town Council	ORGANIZATION	and the like '' bit burgher bodies . ''

		One of the latter class , a
Bailie	LOCATION	, having asked
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	to dinner , the author , as a lad of known parts and enthusiasm for poetry and poets , was invited to put in an appearance with the dessert , that he might feast his eyes on the
Bard of Hope	ORGANIZATION	.

		There seems to have been the usual disparity between the young ideal and the actual : '' The guests were chiefly
Edinburgh	LOCATION	ministers of the
Kirk	PERSON	, one of them being the long-headed , pawky Dr.
Lee	PERSON	, then in charge of one of the most important city churches , and afterwards Principal of the
University of Edin	ORGANIZATION	- burgh .

		Among them , and a striking contrast to his fellow-guests , sat the poet , a spruce little gentleman , with finely-cut features , in a gay and talkative mood , which became more so as he made an end of glass upon glass of brandy and water .

		He told amusing story after story , to the great delectation of his listeners .

		Young as I was , I noticed that some of the poet 's anecdotes verged on the improper , and that in these cases , Dr.
Lee	PERSON	's countenance wore an embarassed look , as if , while bound to smile , he as a cleric fell ; it to be his duty to look grave .

		So the evening wore on until
Campbell	PERSON	had told his last story , finished his last glass of brandy and water , and it was time for seniors , much more for juniors , to take their homeward way . ''

		It was during a holiday sojourn at
Kendal	LOCATION	, in the
Lake District	LOCATION	, that Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	en - countered
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		He made the usual pilgrimage to
Rydal Mount	ORGANIZATION	, and was amiably received by the proprietor , whom he describes as being then a man of near seventy , hale and erect , and looking , when he had donned his Tam-o ' - Shauter bonnet and plaid , like a Low - land farmer of the better class .

		Of Words - worth 's features , that which struck the young visitor most was his nose a member massive enough to have captivated Mr.
Walter Shandy	PERSON	himself .

		Altogether , concludes Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	, '' His countenance had not to my mind that refinement which is visible in his portraits ... Before we parted , something that I said may have betrayed a hankering after a literary life .

		At any rate , he warned me against it , and spoke of what he had known of suffering among friends of his drudging for and dependent on ' book - sellers . '

		He advised me to be a ` surgeon . ' ''

		It was in
1841	DATE	that Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	was first drawn , as it were , into the Carlylean orbit .

		He had read with delight the '' French Revo - lution , '' ''
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	, '' and the more mys - tical deliverances on the literature of
Germany	LOCATION	, and had been led thereby into certain mild dab - blings in German philosophy .

		The upshot of it all was that -LRB- despite the ministrations of
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 105 * ' long-headed , pawky Dr. Lee '' of the Kirk -RRB- he became disquieted about his soul .

		The half - digested Hegelism , Fichteism ,
Schellingism	PERSON	, assorting ill with his home-bred Calvinism , brought on a fit of spiritual indigestion , and he determined forthwith to consult Mr.
Car	PERSON	- lyle as the man best fitted to resolve his meta - physical doubts .

		Surely , he perhaps reflected , one who had written so finely and prophetically of '' the Immensities , '' '' the Silences , '' '' the Abysmal Nothingnesses , '' '' the Eternal Vera - cities , '' could say much to the purpose ; so he in - dited a note to the Sage of Ecclefechan asking him plumply '' for a solution of the mystery of existence . ''

		Nor was the oracle silent .


Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	was , perhaps , of all men of his time , the one most profoundly and painfully con - vinced of the hopelessness of the question so artlessly put to him .

		But the confidence shown by his unknown disciple was flattering , not to say touching ; and to the surprise and delight of the petitioner there presently came a letter , kindly and helpful , though scarcely satisfac - tory as a '' solution '' of the '' mystery '' afore - said .

		We subjoin what seems to be the pith of the philosopher 's reply : '' It is many years since I ceased reading German or any other metaphysics , and gradually came to discern that I had happily got done with that matter altogether .

		By what steps , series of books , and other influences such result was brought about , it would now be extremely difficult to say .

		Few books stand prominently with me above the general dimness .

		... I may say further that after all the Fichteisms ,
Schellingisms	LOCATION	,
Hegelisms	LOCATION	, I still understand Kant to be the grand novelty , the prime author of the new spiritual world , of whom all the others are but superficial , transient modifications .

		If you do decide to penetrate into this matter , what bet - ter can you do than vigorously set to the
Kritik	PERSON	der reinen Veznunft , a very attainable book , and resolutely study it and re-study it till you understand it ?

		You will find it actually capable of being understood , rigor - ously sequent , like a book of mathematics ; labor that pays itself ; really one of the best metaphysical studies that I know of .

		Once master of Kant , you have at - tained what I reckon most precious , perhaps alone pre - cious in that multifarious business of German philos - ophy : namely , deliverance from the fatal incubus of Scotch or French philosophy , with its mechanisms and its Atheisms , and be able perhaps to wend on your way leaving both of them behind you ... For the rest , let it be no disappointment if , after all study , you do not learn ' what we are ' ; nay , if you discover that met - aphysics can not by any possibility teach us such a result , or even that metaphysics is a kind of disease , and the inquiry itself a kind of disease .

		We shall never know ' what we are ' ; on the other hand , we can always partly know what beautiful and noble things we are fit to do , and that is the grand inquiry for us .

		The
Hebrew Psalmist	ORGANIZATION	said , I am fearfully and wonderfully made . '

		No
Kant	PERSON	or
Hegel	PERSON	, as I take it , can do much more than say the like , in the wider , complicated dia - lect we now have . ''

		That
Carlyle	PERSON	's estimates of the British men of letters who were his contemporaries did not err on the side of over-appreciation is manifest in Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	's chapter on his '' Literary Table-Talk . ''

		Some of the most popular of them were poets and novelists , and
Carlyle	PERSON	, de - spite his reverence for
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	, and
Jean Paul	PERSON	, waged perpetual war against metre and fiction .

		So far did he carry this dislike -LRB- real or feigned -RRB- that the author heard him one day grumbling because the pleasure he had hoped to derive from a translation of some In - dian drama , by '' a man of strong Hindoo gen - ius , '' had been '' spoilt '' by a metrical render - ing . ''

		Mainly , perhaps , '' shrewdly observes Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	, '' this aversion from poetry and fiction was due not merely to
Carlyle	PERSON	's love of reality , but to his own comparative failure in both . ''


Carlyle	PERSON	did not , it seems , rate
Wordsworth	PERSON	very high as a poet , whatever his opinion of him as a man may have been . ''

		Put ^ iEschy - lus among those hills , '' he exclaimed , '' and he will say something worth listening to ! ''

		Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	surmises that his general depreciation of
Wordsworth	PERSON	was partly the result of a son - net of the poet 's evidently directed against him - self and his '' The French Revolution , '' * for he adds , '' Great as was
Carlyle	PERSON	's intellectual integrity , his es - timates of his contemporaries , literary and unliterary , were often in a perceptible degree colored by personal feeling . ''

		Certainly , however , no inimical feeling of that kind influenced him in his inadequate rat - ing of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's exquisite verse .

		For Ten - nyson , the man , he had a real affection , `` though he liked him as a companion chiefly because , he told me , he found '
Alfred	PERSON	' thus he always spoke of him ' an intelligent listener . ' ' ''

		Pa - tient and much-enduring '' listener '' were per - haps nearer the mark .

		Of the fine '' Princess , ''
Carlyle	PERSON	said curtly that it '' had everything but common-sense '' -LRB- a stricture , by-the-bye , which an eminent Frenchman has since passed on his own '' French Revolution '' -RRB- , and our author found him , one forenoon , `` Deep in the
Acta Sanctorum	PERSON	, and full of the story of the dealings of an early Christian missionary with some Scandinavian and heathen potentate . '

		Alfred , ' he declared , ' would be much better employed in mak - ing such an episode interesting and beautiful than in cobbling his odes , ' the occupation in which , when visit - ing him sometime before ,
Carlyle	PERSON	had found him en - * '' Portentous change !

		when History can appear As the cool Advocate of foul device ; Reckless audacity extol , and jeer At consciences perplexed with scruples nice , '' etc. .

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, it seems , did not take so quietly as Tennyson the philosopher 's rather meddlesome protests against verse-making .

		Having received from him a letter adjuring her to forsake the evil of her poetical ways , she wrote him so touching and sensible a rejoinder that '' I had , ''
Carlyle	PERSON	confessed , '' to draw in my horns . ''

		For that limb of the '' Dandiacal Body , '' the author of `` Pelham , ''
Carlyle	PERSON	evinced much contempt , calling him a '' poor fribble , '' and approving his own plain-spoken spouse 's still more vigorous epithet , '' a lanthorn - jawed quack . ''

		For
Dickens	PERSON	, on the other hand , he had much personal liking .

		He declared that he was the only man of his time in whose writings genuine cheerfulness was to be found , and com - pared favorably his sunny geniality with the '' terrible cynicism '' of
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	notes a curiously characteris - tic judgment of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's respecting
Ranke	PERSON	whose elaborate
Neun Bilcher JPreussischer Geschichte	PERSON	he pronounced '' a complete fail - ure . ''

		He had , it seems , once seen
Ranke	PERSON	rum - maging among the manuscripts in the Brit - ish Museum , and had noted , with his usual keen eye for personal defects , '' That something , either congenital or the result of ex - ternal injury , was so much the matter with an upper section of
Ranke	ORGANIZATION	's dorsal region that he had to link the peccant parts together with an iron hook . ''

		So , agreeably to a pet theory of his as to the bearing of a man 's bodily peculiarities upon his intellect , he at once pronounced the emi - nent Teuton '' a broken-backed man , '' and pro- ceeded to draw inferences from his physical affliction to his book . ''

		Broken-backed man , '' ergo , weak-backed book , seems to have been the not very sequent enthymeme .

		Oddly enough , in Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	's own case , a kindred analogy is often drawn , the maligned world professing to have found much of the dyspep - tic censor 's stomach in his writings .

		Our au - thor himself rather neatly observes , '' Much in
Carlyle	LOCATION	and what flowed from him was , as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	said of
Schiller	PERSON	, ' pathological . ' '

		Carlyle 's oral criticism on the opening vol - umes of
Froude	PERSON	's History was curt and pithy : '' Meritorious , but too much raw material '' ; while the impression left upon him by
Thiers	PERSON	's '' French Revolution '' was that its author was '' a man without a conscience . ''

		That his lat - ter-day literary judgments were sometimes at variance with his early enthusiasms is attested in the case of Fichte whom he once charac - terized in his Essays as '' a colossal and ada - mantine spirit , standing erect and clear like a Cato Major among degenerate men , fit to have been the teacher of the
Stoa	ORGANIZATION	, and to have dis - covered beauty and virtue in the groves of
Academe	LOCATION	. ''

		Twenty years later , however , says Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	, when '' He had been reading a new volume in a series of translations from
Fichte	ORGANIZATION	's works , he pronounced , to my great astonishment , the lauded Fichte of earlier years to be ' a thick-skinned fellow ! ' ''

		His appreciation of and gratitude to
Kant	PERSON	, on the contrary , remained unimpaired . ''

		Kant , '' he declared , '' taught me that I had a soul as well as a body '' a tribute which , to say the least , was not flattering to the logic of his own pre - Kantian spiritual pastors and masters .

		Owing to his prophetic character
Carlyle	PERSON	was much tormented by counsel-seeking bores , by all sorts of people asking all sorts of questions with all the confidence shown by Captain Cut - tle in the oracular Bunsby .

		The most pesti - lent pilgrims to the
Chelsea	LOCATION	tripod were , we re - gret to learn , Americans , a fact which led their victim to write his famous sentence about the millions of transatlantic bores who had been brought into the world with unexampled rapid - ity .

		One American cleric , our author remem - bers , '' Half-forced his way into the house to insist on Car - lyle 's explaining to him difficulties which had occurred to him in studying ' the moral character of Goorty ' such , according to
Carlyle	PERSON	, was his pronunciation of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's name .

		All he got out of
Carlyle	LOCATION	was a recom - mendation to restudy , in ' Goorty 's ' own writings , the ' moral character , ' the anomalies of which had perplexed him . ''

		Of
A. Bronson Alcott	PERSON	's historic visit to Car - lyle we find no mention in this unflattering connection ; but he certainly must have pro- pounded some '' unmitigated staggerers '' to the oracle .

		From
Alcott	PERSON	to
Emerson	LOCATION	the mental transi - tion is easy ; and we shall pass on to our au - thor 's capital chapter on ''
Emerson	PERSON	in En - gland . ''

		His manner in the lecture-room , says Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	, was one of perfect serenity : '' To the public success or failure of his lectures he appeared to be profoundly indifferent , a mood to which his experiences in American lecture-rooms had habit - uated him .

		He told me , with perfect equanimity , that at home he was accustomed to see hearers , after listen - ing to him a little , walk out of the room , as much as to say that they had had enough of him . ''

		Perhaps the '' perfect equanimity '' was the fruit of the lecturer 's Platonic opinions as to the capacity for higher truth of his vanishing

		THE DIAL 107 auditors .

		Emerson would seem to have chosen , on the whole , rather an odd circle of associates while in
England	LOCATION	.

		Before leaving Manchester he gave a dinner party to which he invited '' A strange collection of mystics , poets , prose-rhap - sodists , editors , school-masters , ex-Unitarian ministers , and cultivated manufacturers , the only bond of union among them being a common regard and respect for Emerson ... After the prandial and post-prandial babblement , to which our host as usual contributed noth - ing , he gave a serene close to the evening by reading to us his lecture on Plato . ''

		It may be added that one of the guests on this hilarious occasion was a vegetarian , an apos - tle of what
Carlyle	PERSON	once called the '' dom 'd potato-gospel , '' for whom a separate dinner of herbs was considerately served .

		The account of this '' function '' prepares us for our author 's statement that the Englishman in whom Em - erson seemed most interested was one
Thomas Taylor	PERSON	, Platonist and Neo-pagan , a crack - brained enthusiast whom some visitors once found kneeling before a silver shrine of Mer - cury ! ''

		Taylor lived in
Walworth	LOCATION	, whither
Emerson	PERSON	told me that he made a pilgrimage the only literary pil - grimage which I knew him to make in
London	LOCATION	in search of memorials of this reviver of the worship of the gods of antiquity . ''

		Carlyle used to relate with much amusement an incident reported to him by a friend who had visited '' the seraphic man '' at Concord : ''
Emerson	PERSON	's little boy being very fretful and tearful , the optimistic parent took the urchin in his arms , and said , caressing him , ' I will love the devil out of him . '

		Garlyle evidently thought that for such an extrusion a sterner mode of treatment would have been more effect - ive or appropriate . ''

		Possibly something in the way of a sound birch - ing would have been the Ecclefechan mode of exorcism .

		Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	had a long talk with
Carlyle	PERSON	about one of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's
Edward Street	ORGANIZATION	lectures .

		* ' When I spoke , '' he says , '' Of the high ethical ideal which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	held up to us ,
Carlyle	PERSON	replied that
Emerson	PERSON	's ethics consisted chiefly of < prohibitions . '

		... Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	was more dissatis - fied than her husband with
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's ethics .

		Dilating in his high-flown optimistic way on the ultimate triumph of good over evil , the lecturer went to the length of saying that even when in a haunt of sensual vice , un - mentionable to ears polite -LRB- though
Emerson	LOCATION	called it by its plain English name -RRB- , ' man is still tending upwards , ' or words to that effect .

		Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's moral indigna - tion at this statement knew no bounds , and for some time she could scarcely speak of
Emerson	LOCATION	with patience . ''

		On the much-discussed , if not very import - ant , relations between
Carlyle	PERSON	and his wife our author has little to say , but that little is to the point .

		Men are rarely heroes to their valets , or , a fortiori , to their wives who enjoy , it will be admitted , even better opportunities for close observation ; and the wife , in the present case , happened to have an unusually keen eye for contrasts between theory and conduct .

		Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	did not , in fact , always take her dog - matical spouse as seriously as he liked to be taken ; and our author notes her readiness to tell '' before company '' anecdotes of him which made him appear just a little ridiculous : ``
Carlyle	PERSON	was full of inconsistencies , especially in the contrast between his doctrine of the sacredness of silence and his own incessant talk .

		This gave Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	a handle , of which , when irritated , she was not slow to avail herself , for comment on the difference between her husband 's preachment and his practice .

		Once when he was declaiming against the love of perpetual loco - motion , and insisting on the duty of staying where you are , the little lady bowled him out very neatly by citing two lines from his own translation of a distich in Wil - helm
Meister	PERSON	's Wanderjahre ' To give room for wandering is it That the world was made so wide . ' ''

		The key to Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's occasional petu - lance , is not , perhaps , far to seek .

		The author recalls the '' emphasis '' -LRB- '' it seemed afterwards a little significant , '' he adds -RRB- with which she once refused his request to sing ''
Auld Robin Gray	PERSON	. ''

		We have done scant justice to the range and variety of Mr.
Espinasse	PERSON	's book , which we once more commend as a capital collection of liter - ary anecdotes and ana .

		108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, in the shape of the best course of lectures on Greek poetry the lectures which he delivered in
1892	DATE	on the
Percy Turnbull Memorial Foun	ORGANIZATION	- dation in the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The eight lectures fill one neat little volume .

		On the fly-leaf the author has set a pretty Greek elegiac stanza , which may be roughly Englished as follows : Like to a rose that withers in the leaf Thy death the ninth
spring	DATE	's threshold not yet crossed .

		Now to the Muse each
spring	DATE	thy parents ' grief Offers this wreath in memory of the lost .

		A brief preface expresses the desire that this volume may take its place in a series deriving unity from the Turnbull foundation , the series initiated by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's '' Nature and Ele - ments of Poetry , '' and to be continued next
spring	DATE	by Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's eagerly anticipated lec - tures on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have the author 's warrant for turning first to the last chapter , on the '' Permanent Power of Greek Poetry . ''

		It is the lecture which he selected to read before the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and for publication in the `` Atlantic Monthly . ''

		Its leading thought is an idea already illustrated by Professor
Jebb	PERSON	in his '' Attic Orators . ''

		The truth , the variety , the permanent power of Greek poetry and ora - tory are due in large measure to the fact that they grew up in immediate and vital contact with the life of the people .

		All other litera - tures -LRB- with the possible exception of the Eliz - abethan drama -RRB- have been produced by a cul - tivated class , a literary remnant dwelling as sojourners and aliens among toiling millions who knew them not .

		They have been the ex - pression of schools , cliques , and coteries .

		The literature of
Greece	LOCATION	only was truly autoctho - nous .

		The poets and orators of
Athens	LOCATION	could repeat , in respect of the rich soil of human life in which they had their roots , that proud
Athen	LOCATION	- ian boast : `` All races but one are as aliens engrafted or sown , Strange children and changelings , but we , our mother , thine own . ''

		Let not the heralds of a free untrammelled lit - erature of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, broad as our prairies and untamed as our buffaloes , derive comfort from this thought .

		If literature and life are to meet in fruitful contact , the people must come half-way .

		The average man whom the Athenian poets and orators addressed sur - passed in mental power , according to Mr.
Gal	PERSON	- ton 's estimates , the average Member of
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment .

		When he sat on a jury he did not need to be propitiated by the quaint mixture of slang and '' highfalutin '' which a distinguished ex - governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	thought it necessary to employ in a recent celebrated case in order to separate himself from sophistical '' literary fellers '' in the minds of the twelve good men and true .

		And to amuse him in the theatre it was not necessary to resort to ''
Texas	LOCATION	Steers , '' '' Holes in the Ground , '' or '' Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Do n't be afraid to make fine points , the chorus cry , in the '' Frogs '' of Aris - tophanes ; the audience are clever enough .

		Thus , as Professor
Jebb	PERSON	elsewhere finely says , the poetry of the Greeks was the index of their capacity , and not merely like the po - etry of the English-speaking race , the flower of their spirit .

		It was not only inspired by life , but it was also regulated by life ; and to this it owes its immunity from affectation and unre - ality , and from the false sentiment which `` may pass muster in the study , but which is inevit - ably betrayed by its own un veracity when it is spoken aloud before witnesses whose minds are sane . '' ''

		In such an art we find lessons which no lapse of time can make obsolete and which no multiplication of modern interests can make superfluous . ''

		In a few brief pregnant paragraphs , Pro- fessor
Jebb	PERSON	goes on to contrast this quality of classical Greek literature with the artificial product of
Alexandria	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, pausing only to pay a tribute of warm enthusiasm to The - ocritus , the last genuinely inspired poet of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		He then touches lightly but suggest - ively on the Hellenic influences in modern lit - erature , in
Goethe	LOCATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Keats	PERSON	, and Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	, and on the too familiar antithesis of Hellenism and
Hebraism	ORGANIZATION	.

		Keats , he truly says -LRB- after Arnold -RRB- , is essentially an Elizabethan ; '' his manner , even in treating Greek themes , was not Greek except occasion - ally and for brief spaces . ''

		One hesitates to differ from Professor
Jebb	PERSON	; but it is not easy to accept the dictum that the most Greek thing in Keats is '' his vivid spontaneous sympathy with the life of eternal nature '' as shown , for example , in the '' Ode to a Nightingale . ''

		Surely
Keats	PERSON	's interpretation of nature is '' Celtic , '' as Arnold would say , rather than Greek .

		The truly Greek element in
Keats	PERSON	's work , I think , is a certain monumental plasticity of style re - vealed in occasional touches only ; the too rare expression of a mood borne in on him when he contemplated the Elgin marbles , and contrasted their everlasting superhuman calm with the breathing human passion that left his own heart high-sorrowful and cloyed .

		Such lines , I mean , as these :
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 109 '' And charioting foremost in the envious race Like a young Jove with calm uneager face . ''

		Or these : '' She would have ta'en Achilles by the hair and bent his neck , Or with a finger stayed Ixion 's wheel . ''

		Or these : '' What little town by river or sea shore Or mountain built with peaceful citadel Is emptied of this folk this pious morn ? ''

		Or the second stanza of the '' Ode to
Autumn	DATE	, '' which , but for a touch of Elizabethan luxuri - ance , might have been taken directly from Theocritus .

		Very admirable , too , is Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's sketch , in the introductory lecture , of the '' Dis - tinctive qualities of the Greek race as expressed by Homer , '' shown on a dark background of the pre-Hellenic Egyptian , Assyrian , and
Phoani	PERSON	- cian civilization of the tenth century B. C .

		The Greek is free , natural , and human , from the moment of his first appearance on the stage of history a large-eyed Miranda-like child , look - ing out upon the brave new world that hath such people in it .

		The free expansion of his spirit was never checked by thralldoin to priests , kings , or conventions .

		And although , as the old Egyptian priest says in the '' Timseus , '' this young people possessed no store of vener - able tradition that could vie with the hoary wis - dom of the
East	LOCATION	, they soon bettered their in - struction and left their teachers far in the rear .

		In reading the six more special chapters that fill up the body of the book , one must confess to a slight sense of disappointment .

		The feel - ing is an unjust one .

		Nowhere is there to be found a clearer or juster statement of the es - sential facts of the development of Greek poetry from Homer to
Euripides	LOCATION	.

		If there are few novelties and little spirit-stirring eloquence , it is because the writer 's sober taste and unerring scholarship reject the tinsel of Mr.
Syinonds	PERSON	's rhetoric and the wilful exaggerations of bril - liant partial fancies that enliven the pages of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, or Mr.
Ernest Myers	PERSON	, or even oc - casionally of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		What , within these limits , could Professor
Jebb	PERSON	have told us of Homer that has not already been said by
Arnold	LOCATION	, or in his own incompara - ble little introduction to the study of Homer ?

		How could he write of the Greek lyric poets in one chapter more succinctly and soundly than he has done in his excellent primer , or more eloquently than Mr.
Symonds	PERSON	in his 44 Greek Poets '' ?

		How could he hope to sur - pass in one lecture his own admirable paper on
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, published in the '' Journal of Hellenic Studies '' a few years ago ?

		What could he tell us about Sophocles that is not more adequately expressed in his great edition , and how could he improve on his own model article on Euri - pides in the '' Encyclopaedia Britannica '' ?

		He is in the position of the orator Isocrates , vainly striving to compete with his own earlier work . ''

		The Panegyricus has beggared him . ''

		Here and there , however , one finds bits of criticism that deserve the emphasis of special notice ; as , for example , the spirited portrait - ure of the character of Achilles a blending of suggestions taken from
Hegel	LOCATION	and Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- kin ; the remarks on the exquisite art with which Homer combines the human and divine agencies in the scene where Achilles pursues Hector around the walls of Troy ; and the sub - tle observations on the peculiar instinct for the picturesque which partly compensates in the '' Odyssey '' for the dramatic force of the '' Iliad . ''

		The chapter on
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, who is natur - ally one of Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's favorites , contains some fine renderings of four or five of the great tonic passages which every student of Greek lit - erature ought to know by heart .

		Pindar , Pro- fessor
Jebb	PERSON	beautifully says , shows us the epic heroes under a new light , '' neither that far-off though clear light , as of a fair sunset , which the lay of the minstrel shed around them in the palace of Alcinous , nor yet that searching sun ^ shine of noontide which fell upon them in the theatre of Dionysus . ''

		The nearest analogue of a Pindaric ode in the manner of affecting the hearer , he tells us , is an oratorio such as the ' ' Messiah '' or ''
Israel	LOCATION	in
Egypt	LOCATION	. ' '

		We are happy to find one English scholar who does not tell us , like
Cicero	PERSON	and Mr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	, that we can not know how the metres of Pindar sounded .

		The following words should be set up in letters of gold in every class-room where pedants drawl out Greek verse by the metronome and the rule of thumb : '' For in the higher poetry , especially when it employs the grand style , the movement of every modern language is slower than the Greek . ''

		Professor
Jebb	PERSON	has learned much from Mat - thew
Arnold	LOCATION	, as all his writings show .

		Why will he condescend to captious criticism of the great critic ?

		He must know that when Arnold describes Pindar as '' the poet on whom above all other poets the power of style seems to have exercised an inspiring and intoxicating effect , '' he does not in the least intend to imply '' a cer - tain absence of due self-restraint . ''

		Else how could he have taken
Pindar	PERSON	for a type of the grand style in simplicity ?

		And what can a 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, writer who uses words with Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's habitual precision mean by the affirmation that the style of ^ Eschylus is always the grand style ?

		The style of ^ Eschylus is , in passages , as vicious as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's : '' Till that
Bellona	ORGANIZATION	's bridegroom lapped in proof Confronted him with self-comparisons . ''

		Professor
Jebb	PERSON	should leave it to the critics who think Arnold was '' running down '' Shake - speare to confound grand style and great poet .

		The most noteworthy thing in the chapters on the Drama is the acute and sensible sum - ming up of the controversy as to the merits of Euripides .

		It would perhaps have been more amusing if Professor
Jebb	PERSON	had '' taken sides , '' and either rehabilitated Euripides with
Brown	PERSON	- ing and Mr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	, or denounced his plays as '' shapeless abortions '' with Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		Instead of this , he shows us , by an admirable critical analysis , just why Euripides , though he failed as an Hellenic artist , became the ideal poet of the Hellenistic world , and appeals with a legitimate attraction to the troubled romantic modern spirit .

		He is a `` fascinating poet , '' the author of a '' dazzling compromise , '' and the '' peculiar gift which his genius has bequeathed to the modern world '' shows a '' blending of Hellenic light , though its light is declining , with the incipient promise of Eomance . ''

		In spite of this scrupulous judicial fairness , it is easy to feel that Professor
Jebb	PERSON	is too good a Greek not to prefer for himself the pure `` Hellenic light . ''

		His private and intimate feeling would , if I mistake riot , be that of Professor
Jowett	PERSON	, recently communicated by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	in his '' Recollections '' : '' I have been reading Euripides lately , and still retain my old bad opinion of him sophist , sentimentalist , sensa - tionalist no Greek in the better sense of the term . ''

		Professor
Jebb	PERSON	is too urbane to disa - ble the judgment of Euripides ' admirers , but it is not difficult to apprehend his real meaning when he writes : '' The degree in which a mod - ern enjoys Sophocles is not necessarily a meas - ure of his feeling for poetry ; but it may fairly be taken as a measure of his sympathy with the finest qualities of the Athenian genius . ''

		In conclusion , I wish to call attention to one distinctive excellence which this interesting lit - tle volume possesses in common with all the work of its author .

		It will not mislead the English reader .

		Greek literature is coming to be studied more and more in translations , ex - positions , compendiums .

		There is no lack of such aids , and they are multiplying every day .

		But it is not easy to find books that may safely be recommended to serious students who desire truth and just opinions as well as entertainment and mild titillation of the intellectual palate .

		Even when gross inaccuracies as regards ex - ternal fact are avoided , there is apt to be some - thing limited , arbitrary , fantastic , exaggerated , or wilfully perverse , in the expositions of Greek life and thought written for the general reader .

		The picture is slightly out of drawing , the ob - jects are out of focus , the values are not rightly given , and there is a haze of false sentiment over all .

		It is not the least of the many merits of Professor
Jebb	PERSON	's work that it is free from these defects .

		And the English reader may almost employ it as a touchstone by which to test his other helps .

SHOREY	PERSON	> ARCHITECTURE , PAST AXD FUTURE .

		* A very interesting field of study might be found in the principles , if there be any , that should govern the naming of books , or per - haps the variations of fashion in book-naming .

		If Mr.
Van Brunt	PERSON	's book entitled '' Greek Lines '' had been published a century ago , it would probably have been called '' An Inquiry into the
Present State of Architecture	ORGANIZATION	, espe - cially in the
United States	LOCATION	; with some
Observ	PERSON	- ations upon the Nature of the Architectural Art and its Connection with Poetry . ''

		Such , at any rate , are the subjects chiefly considered in his book , which takes its name from the title of the first essay . ''

		Greek Lines '' is a collection of studies on architectural subjects ; but not merely a gath - ering together of separate papers , for the au - thor has collated the essays so as '' to form a sequence in which from first to last there should be evident a more or less orderly development . ''

		Being , then , the presentation , in a somewhat systematic form , of opinions concerning the present state of architecture and of principles concerning architecture in general , by one of the eminent practical architects of the day , the book certainly commands attention ; and it must at once be said that it well repays any - one who is interested in the matter , for it is original and scholarly and refined .

		The present state of architecture is a very interesting subject .

		On the one hand , we have jeremiads on the part of such as point out that we have nowadays no distinctive style ; on the i other just at present , at least we have * GREEK LINES , and Other Architectural Essays .

		THE DIAL ill the joyful paeans occasioned by the successful beauty of the World 's Fair buildings .

		We see every day much that is distressing , and in our mind 's eye we look forward on future beauties flushing in the glow of hope .

		Meanwhile we have an enormous amount of building , espe - cially in the
West	LOCATION	; a number of young gentle - men in
Paris	LOCATION	learning how it should be done ; and too many other people engaged in doing it .

		Mr.
Van Brunt	PERSON	is by no means discouraging .

		His book is in sjood part an exposition of the motto , '' Good Architecture , but not a Style . ''

		The motto is perhaps daring , and yet it seems as though something of the sort were necessary , when we think of the Gothic revival , the Queen
Anne	PERSON	revival , even of the Richardsonian Ro - manesque .

		Good Architecture , of course ; but why not also a Style ?

		Why not an American style -LRB- to go , let us say , with our American school in music , painting , literature -RRB- , or a Western style , or even a World 's Fair style ?

		Well , for one thing -LRB- I believe I am practically quoting Mr. Van Brunt -RRB- , because to have a style we must have a national feeling , an artis - tic tradition , and a comparative ignorance of other styles .

		And even if the first two of these possessions were ours , the last is practically im - possible .

		But if we are not to have a style , what then ?

		Mr.
Van Brunt	PERSON	's answer to this question is , to - a layman at least , exceedingly instructive , both as to what a style is and as to what American architecture can achieve .

		In his different Es - says he treats the question in various ways ; he shows the value of an appreciation of the spirit of Greek art , he points out the value of con - science in modern architecture , he insists on the possibility of in some way manipulating the cumbersome knowledge of the present day into work that will be good .

		His treatment through - out is on a high plane , and one gets ideas even when disagreeing .

		In his more general views on architecture , Mr. Van Brunt propounds many opinions which it would be a pleasure to debate with him .

		The notion of Aphrodite , or the personification of the great creative principle '' as lying at the root of all high art , '' for instance , or the view of architecture as the most human of the arts , these and other views , did only time and space permit , would in discussion lead to beau - tiful and interesting variations .

		To one mat - ter Mr.
Van Brunt	PERSON	has devoted more than a passing notice ; namely , the analogy between Architecture and Poetry .

		The analogy be - tween the arts has given rise to various pleasant fallacies nowadays .

		Why can not '' the emotions awakened in the mind of an intelligent expert by the contemplation of a work of pure archi - tecture '' be awakened , at least in some degree , in other minds by poetry ?

		Mr. Van Brunt can - not see why such a thing should not be natural ; he comments upon architecture in the poets , and finally offers an experiment of his own . ''

		The Church Door : a Study in Romanesque , '' is a sweet and pleasing poem , and it would be somewhat ungracious to take it as offered in proof of the point .

		I incline to compare it with Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	's Introduction to '' With Sa ` di in the Garden . ''

		But that effort to pre - sent the impression of the
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	was by no means the most poetical part of the book ; and its two most poetical passages were two that had hardly any reference to architecture .

		112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Everything seemed to come to this globe-trotter , just as he went to everything ; he had a perfect genius for travelling .

		Earthquakes did not over - look him , nor did he omit being tattooed .

		He must have been exceptionally vigorous in health and alert of eye to have accomplished so much ; but it all would have been as naught , he would have been but one of Lord
Bacon	PERSON	's `` land-lopers , `` had he not also such a simple , unaffected , but thoroughly well-poised literary style of telling what he saw , and telling it with point and humor .

		His good taste is also shown in the illustrations chosen for his volume , which are extremely beautiful , and many of them novel , even to the eye of a traveller .

		We might especially note the views in
Japan	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	.

		For its illustra - tions alone the book would be eagerly welcomed as offering a method of exhibition of foreign pictures much more convenient than the ordinary burden - some and expensive collection of photographs gath - ered in travel .

		Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	says very frankly : '' Almost every writer seems to have his own method of spelling not only the Hindoo names , but also other words not entirely relating to
India	LOCATION	, which is exasperatingly confusing . ''

		This may account for some unusual spellings in the book Knas for Khas , Ledia for Sedia , and Munataz for Mumtaz ; or these may be simply errors in printing .

		One is impressed with Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's care in relating his wondrous tales , his evident intention to give as facts solely what that seventeenth century traveller
James Howell	PERSON	called his '' owne Optique obseruations . ''

		We have the full confidence , too , that the author saw more than he told , but remembered and exemplified
Schiller	PERSON	's line , `` The artist may be known by what he omits . ''

		But one regret arises in reading the book : it emphasizes the fact that we have now found the day of
Seneca	LOCATION	's prediction there is no longer any ``
Ultima Thule	LOCATION	. ''

		A few of the beautiful head and tail pieces through - out the volume are accompanied with no significant description , notably that of a very good-looking man in a fez , who makes his bow on the last page of the book .

		Of his personality , we can , to use Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	's phrase , hazard a wide solution : he might be Captain
Parsell	PERSON	, whose name occurs on that same page ; or Abdul-Hamid II. , to whom the volume is dedicated .

		But we hope it is the '' coun - terfeit presentment '' of the author , the alert , clear - eyed traveller , to whom we say , as did an admirer to another traveller , Captain
John Smith	PERSON	of Vir - ginia , centuries ago : '' Thou to passe the worldes foure parts dost deeme No more than ` twere to goe to bed or dreame . ''

		Some portions of Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's wanderings near the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	followed in the steps of Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	; but Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's de - scriptions , in '' The Rulers of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, '' are much fuller , he tells much more of surround - ing circumstances and of his own impressions , and with that ease and finish that comes from art , not chance .

		His chapters relate to '' The Rock of
Gib	ORGANIZATION	- raltar , '' '' Tangier , '' '' From
Gibraltar	LOCATION	to
Cairo	LOCATION	, '' ''
Cairo	LOCATION	as a Show Place , '' '' The English in
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' `` Modern Athens , '' and `` Constantinople . ''

		The one on '' The English in
Egypt	LOCATION	'' is a thoughtful , a powerful exposition of the condition of the govern - ment of
Egypt	LOCATION	to-day , wonderfully concise and pointed in expression , yet perfectly and interest - ingly explanatory ; it is a chapter to set one think - ing .

		The account of
Modern Athens	LOCATION	is appropri - ate ; the style is suited to the theme .

		The book is well illustrated .

		The steamer that bore Mr.
Davis	PERSON	to
Gibraltar	LOCATION	carried another traveller , a far older one , who had visited the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	shores four times before , and who was to write a book called `` The
Barbary Coast	ORGANIZATION	, '' the Rev. Dr.
Henry M. Field	PERSON	, the editor of '' The Evangelist . ''

		It affords much amusement to read Dr. Field 's chapters on
Gibraltar	LOCATION	,
Tangier	LOCATION	, etc. , after reading Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's .

		I am bound to say that on the whole the two travellers agree very well in their stories ; nor can I wholly decide which gives the better account .

		I will follow the exam - ple of the ambassador of
France	LOCATION	when asked by Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	which danced the better , the Queen of Scots or herself .

		He answered , '' The Queen of Scots doth indeed dance most gracefully , but your Maj - esty dances more high and disposedly . ''

		Mr.
Davis	PERSON	wields certainly a most graceful pen , but the cler - gyman writes '' more high and disposedly , '' he tells more details of the various subjects .

		For instance , in his chapter on
Gibraltar	LOCATION	he devotes eight pages to the history of the
Black Watch	ORGANIZATION	becoming , in - deed , somewhat discursive thereon .


Howell	PERSON	, in his book on `` forreine travail , '' tells of purblind travellers , whom he compares to
Jonah	PERSON	, who travelled much and saw little .

		Dr. Field is none of these ; he saw everything , and with clear and discriminating eye . ''

		The common man , '' says
Richter	PERSON	, `` is copious in Narrative , and exiguous in Reflection ; only with the cultivated man is it re - verse-wise . ''

		It may be said of Dr. Field that he is copious both in narrative and reflection .

		He has an almost perfect narrative style ; he is a most dis - passionate observer of mankind ; he has wonderful depth of penetration into the character of men of various nationalities , and much facility in the ex - pression of his observations .

		His chapter on '' Lights and Shadows of African Life '' is a profound study ; and that on '' How the Islams Fast and Pray '' is a most sympathetic one .

		A single sentence of Dr.
Field	PERSON	's shows his character and the spirit of his book : '' I never condemn a man without afterward trying to clear him from my own condemnation . ''

		The illustrations in Dr. Field 's book are very fine ; some of them are very remarkable .

		There is an absplutely unique and deeply interesting portrait of the Sultan of
Morocco	LOCATION	, showing a noble countenance full of the melancholy so characteristic of the
Ori	PERSON	- entals .

		A scene in the street of
Algiers	LOCATION	, a view of an Arab school , one of the lighthouse at
Cape Spar	LOCATION	- tel , one entitled '' An African pet , '' are particularly striking .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 Books on
Northern Africa	LOCATION	abound and are widely read , but Father Ohrwalder 's '' Ten Years '
Captiv	PERSON	- ity in the
Mahdi	PERSON	's Camp '' will scarcely find the cir - culation in
America	LOCATION	that it has had in
England	LOCATION	, where it has been through nine editions within a year .

		Ninety pages have been struck out for the American public , for which we are very grateful , for there is enough of the book as it now stands to satisfy each and every reader , no matter what he seeks .

		But there is much that is interesting in it ; many pages also that are dull ; still more that are re - volting ; many that are pathetic ; some that are incomprehensible and bewildering .

		No Arabian Nights tale ever was more romantic , apparently more impossible , than this story of the life of
El Mahdi	ORGANIZATION	.

		No martyr of old suffered more or longer than did these Romish missionaries and sisters dur - ing those years of captivity ; and so long as
Gordon	PERSON	and
Hicks	PERSON	still live in the hearts of their fellow - countrymen , or rather of the entire world outside of the Soudan , as emblems of patriotic heroes and martyrs , so long will such books as this be of liv - ing though gruesome interest .

		But the book is not '' pretty reading , '' nor soothing to the nerves , nor has it any alluring literary qualities ; and for my - self I shall rejoice in what
Carlyle	PERSON	calls '' the tri - umph of the Decency-principle , '' when such blood - curdling details are not given to the reading public .

		To one who in days of his youth has pored en - chanted through many an hour of dim twilight and firelight over what a friend designated as the '' mlion mpalm mtesai massegai-filled pages '' of
Bruce	PERSON	,
Baker	PERSON	, and
Burton	PERSON	, of Speke and
Livingstone	PERSON	, and of other more or less tergiversating African explor - ers , who has in later days greeted with delight even Rider
Haggard	PERSON	's fairy tales of the Dark Con - tinent , the volume of '' Adventures in
Mashona	LOCATION	- land '' is as welcome as fresh news from an old friend ; and it has also an additional zest of novelty in that the news has an unusual and somewhat fem - inine cast , albeit a professional one the view taken by a trained hospital nurse .

		The book is written in a vigorous , hearty style , with much plainness of speech , though never flippant , and with no flowers of rhetoric , though thoroughly graphic .

		The authors are , on the whole , not very complimentary to the African clergy .

		They found the Bishop `` young , pleasant , persuasive , with an exceptional talent for getting out of the room well .

		He evanesced rather than left , and left behind him a little hush . ''

		This talent for getting away was displayed by the Bishop on other occasions , in leaving the sisters in a most critical point on the road ; and in promptly , on the day of the death of their first patient , leav - ing
Mashonaland	LOCATION	, and then
Africa	LOCATION	altogether , and going to
England	LOCATION	to collect money .

		He seems to have had a fine apostolic presence , with but little else .

		Of a rowdy ball at
Johannesburg	LOCATION	, their first African home , they write : '' A Church of
England	LOCATION	clergyman played the fiddle in the orchestra .

		He was attired in the usual swallow - tail , and wore tight black knee-breeches , silk stockings , shoes and buckles .

		The next day his ungrateful flock commented in the papers on the thinness of his legs . ''

		The
Manica	LOCATION	pastor they depict thus : '' He wore a helmet , a flannel shirt , and coarse blue trousers much too short , of the type dear to navvies .

		These were held in place by a large , scarlet handker - chief , which , however , did its work so indifferently that Mr.
Sewall	PERSON	was always hitching up his trousers like a comic sailor in a pantomime .

		I may state here that the following Easter Mr.
Sewall	PERSON	, to use his own expression , ' chucked his orders ' and went into partnership with a Jew tavern-keeper . ''

		Sociological observations were little noted by these nurses .

		Living for two years in a land where polygamy and polyandry were practised , and hav - ing unusual opportunities of insight into the effect of those institutions on the lives of native women of all stations , from the queen to her slaves , they might have contributed much to our knowledge of primitive marriage customs ; yet the pages are bar - ren of these facts .

		Perhaps they felt as did another woman traveller , two centuries ago , that such things were not '' Proper to be Related by a Female pen . ''

		Contrary to the reports of many travellers in
Mashonaland	LOCATION	-LRB- Mr.
Bent	PERSON	being one -RRB- , but confirming the stories of Mr.
Selous	PERSON	, these nurses found plenty of lions and wild beasts .

		At one point of the jour - ney they write : `` The lions , coming down to drink at the swampy - pool just in front of the huts , made such a terrific noise that the earth seemed to shake with their roar - ing .

		It was a strange sensation to find ourselves so near all these wild creatures , with not even the slender - est door or mat to shut them out of our hut . ''

		Lions were bold enough to make inroads into
Umatili	LOCATION	, the town , where two were killed , '' one in High Street and one near the oven of our friend the baker , '' and their spoor was found everywhere .

		The authors tell of the death of many natives through lions ; one horrible story of an attack and siege of two Englishmen in their remote hut , and the piti - ful death of one Mr.
Teal	PERSON	.

		When the nurses them - selves were lying seriously ill with a fever , a great leopard tried to
spring	DATE	in through the upper half of the door , which was open to admit air .

		Of their meeting with Mr.
Selous	PERSON	, we read : `` We were much afraid we should miss Mr.
Selous	PERSON	, but he sent us word that he would come as soon as he could get his shirt washed .

		When we received this message we felt sure he was a delightful person ; and our instincts did not deceive us .

		Mr.
Selous	PERSON	appeared to be a man about eight and thirty , light , active , and giving one an impresssion of presence of mind and re - source .

		Of his personal appearance it is impossible to remember anything but his eyes , which are extraordi - narily clear and limpid .

		He is known throughout
Africa	LOCATION	as the man who never tells a lie .

		What a splendid re - putation to have anywhere , but especially in
Africa	LOCATION	!

		He told us he had shot twenty-three lions with his own gun , and helped to put an end to nine others .

		He said our mode of travelling , sleeping about in the open beside dim fires , was extremely foolhardy , and we should pro- bably have suffered for it had not the country been so well stocked with game . ''

		114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, The chief nursing done by these two heroines was in cases of fever ; and we can not wonder that fevers were so violent and fatal in
Mashonaland	LOCATION	when we read of the climate , and of the vast amount of bad whiskey that is consumed there .

		The book shows , without ostentation or demand for sympathy or laudation , the noble life of self-sacrifice led for two years by these devoted Englishwomen among most unwonted and even repulsive surroundings ; and proves that women will cheerfully endure , for love of God and their fellow-men , many privations that men will shrink from , even though lured on by the all-powerful love of gold .

		The jesting and vivacious account of a visit to
Corsica	LOCATION	, '' A Wild Sheep Chase , '' sparkles with that ironical French gaiety first made known to us in the writings of Rabelais , and since familar to us almost too familiar in the more or less successful imitations and variations seen in the works of many successive French authors .

		Though the hero of this tale chases , of course he never catches , or even sees , the wild sheep , the mouflon ; but the recounting of the elusions and illusions of the chase affords him a felicitous opportunity to display for our amusement and edification many clever anecdotes and vivid descriptions , and much half-serious information ; to give , indeed , as a whole , a most spirited picture of life in
Corsica	LOCATION	a life which exhibits a simplicity that will inevitably be soon altered , as there is now a railroad across the island .

		Doubtless in the Na - poleonic renaissance of the day .

		this account of the birthplace of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	will be much read .

		The laughing by-play of wit suffers in the translation , as does nearly all humorous writing when rendered into another language than its native one .

		Some - how the laughter , even in the original , seems a lit - tle forced , and the eccentricities of style somewhat monotonous .

		Pages peppered with exclamation marks and interrogation points abound to satiety ; and , altogether , we close the book feeling we are not as amused as we ought to be .

		It is a long way from
Africa	LOCATION	to the Arctic seas , but the same glamour of novelty , of strangeness , hangs around both lands . ''

		My Arctic Journal , '' the interesting book of Mrs.
Peary	PERSON	's life in the Arctic regions , written only after much persuasion , opens with a tender and manly preface from her husband , Lieutenant
Robert E. Peary	PERSON	, and ends with an account written by him of '' The Great White Journey . ''

		Though her publishers announce that the fair traveller has made a valuable contribution to ethnological learning , I think the book is in some points of ethnological study somewhat disappoint - ing ; notably so in information about the women of the isolated Eskimo tribe among whom she re - sided .

		A year 's residence among them should have given her a close insight into their lives ; but she seems -LRB- and who could blame her ? -RRB-

		to have care - fully avoided seeing too much of the `` huskies . ''

		Some of her information is curious , and all that she gives is interesting .

		She writes : '' The native method of treating the skins of all ani - mals intended for clothing is first to rid them of as much of the fat as can be got off by scraping with a knife ; then they are stretched as tight as possible and allowed to become perfectly dry .

		After this they are taken by the women and chewed and sucked all over in order to get as much of the grease out as possible ; then they are again dried and scraped with a dull in - strument so as to break the fibres .

		Chewing the skins is very hard on the women , and all of it is done by them ; they can not chew more than two deerskins per day , and are obliged to rest their jaws every other day . ''

		She tells of hiring a chewer for one seamstress too old to chew for herself .

		The work is held by the seamstress with her feet and legs .

		The thread is made by splitting narwhal sinews moistened in the mouth .

		Mrs.
Peary	PERSON	does not describe the thimbles used .

		I know nothing in the book more fairly pa - thetic than her description of what she endured through the odor emanating from these seamstresses who must indeed `` smell to heaven '' and her invariable and necessary cleansing of person and room with alcohol and corrosive sublimate , to be rid of the parasites shed by the dirty chewers .

		The Chicagoized Esquimo wives and their villainous children make one fully believe Mrs.
Peary	PERSON	's tale .

		The book is illustrated from interesting photo - graphs taken by the Pearys .

		Some of the prints are half - tinted , and prove very satisfactory in effect ; the one entitled `` The Sunset Glow '' is especially beautiful with its opalescent tints .

		The chief thought that rises upon reading this book is whether , after all , Mrs.
Peary	PERSON	's experience was '' worth the while . ''

		When the courageous explorer visited one Innuit igloo , she was met by a very aged and oily Eskimo woman , who scrutinized her closely , and then said slowly , '' I have lived a great many suns , but I have never seen anything like you . ''

		May we live a great many suns ere we see any other woman like her ere we see any refined , intelligent , gently nurtured woman going unnecessarily upon any exploring ex - pedition , in peril of her health , her comfort , her life ; and at the additional peril of being a hind - rance , in emergencies , to the success of the explor - ing party .

		And yet , what the hospital nurses did in
Africa	LOCATION	for love of Man , ` Mrs.
Peary	PERSON	did in
Greenland	LOCATION	also for love of man for love of her husband !

MORSE EARLE	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Prof.
Romanes * Professor Romanes	ORGANIZATION	has , perhaps Studies in Organic more than any other writer in this Evolution .

		country or in
England	LOCATION	, interested himself in the critical examination of publications relating to the subject of organic evolution .

		He has written voluminously on all its phases , and is a sort of guardian of the faith , examining and pro- nouncing on all heresies and schisms .

		For this function he is eminently fitted by his intimate per - sonal acquaintance with
Darwin	PERSON	's modes of thought ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 as well as by his wide acquaintance with the liter - ature of the subject and by his experimental knowl - edge in certain lines .

		In '' An Examination of Weismannism '' -LRB-
The Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- he has attempted only an examination seriatim of Professor
Weismann	PERSON	's essays on this subject since
1886	DATE	, including his latest theory of Amphimixis .

		The work is a keen scrutiny of all the positions taken by the
Freiburg Professor	ORGANIZATION	, and a testing of these in the light of facts .

		In a general way we may say that Professor Romanes finds it impossible to assent to the doctrine of the continuity of germ - plasm , and appears to be inclined to advocate in its stead Gallon 's idea of '' Stirp , '' a continuous but open succession , which does not exclude from time to time new accessions capable of being grafted upon the ancestral stock , though due to the direct action of the environment of the structure of the parent .

		Though the present work is not an attempt to defend any thesis on the subject , but , rather , merely an examination of the structure reared by another , there is no lack of glimpses of the Dar - winian notion of '' gemmules , '' and some defences of the same against the entirely opposite doctrine of germ-plasm continuity .

		Of this doctrine our author says : '' Beautiful though it may be in its imposing elevation , this drawing of the architecture of the germ-plasm must be regarded as a work of the artistic imagination rather than as one of sci - entific generalization . ''

		This position will strike the reader of `` The Germ-Plasm '' as hardly fair , since the latter work , though highly speculative in its char - acter and in some respects doubtless in error , is never - theless as genuine an attempt to interpret the hidden facts of nature from the patent ones as are many of the notions passing current in biology and other sciences .

		Though Professor
Weismann	PERSON	shall be proved to be wrong in regard to the absolute sta - bility and perfect continuity of the germ , this will not compel the rejection of his notion of the nuclear structure .

		The central idea of this theory is the definite structure of the nucleus , whereby it is able to sort and distribute structural units whose devel - opment will produce a new organism .

		This notion , according to Professor Romanes , is not proven .

		The further position of Professor
Weismann	PERSON	is that the nuclear material has been derived from an ovum of the preceding generation which before its own development set this aside as the nuclear material of the succeeding generation .

		On this conception of the structure and history of the nucleus , heredity is the result of the continuity of nuclear material , or , as Professor
Weismann	PERSON	calls it , '' germ-plasm . ''

		Darwin 's idea of the history of the ovum was en - tirely different .

		He supposed that all the cells of an adult animal or plant throw off minute particles called by him '' gemmules , '' some of which are at - tracted together from all cells to constitute the ovum , so that this is a sort of epitome of the body to be developed .

		This , Professor
Weismann	PERSON	also supposes ; but he views the egg-cell nucleus , not as a new formation in each generation , but as one car - ried along continuously from a generation to the next .

		The final structure , by whichever route at - tained , may be much as Professor
Weismann	PERSON	has formulated it .

		Professor Romanes , however , does not admit this .

		But his main contention is upon the absolute stability of the germ-plasm , which no - tion he considers incompatible with the facts of both heredity and evolution .

		If the germ-plasm , though very stable , be still capable of alteration through the effects of influences , coming directly to it from the organism , such as gemmules thrown off from various parts , then we should have the substance of
Galton	PERSON	's theory of '' Stirp . ''

		This latter seems more probable ; and Professor
Weismann	PERSON	seems to be drifting in this direction , without , Professor Ro - manes contends , sufficiently acknowledging the pri - ority of the theory of
Galton	PERSON	.

		In this work Pro- fessor Romanes does not appear sufficiently to ap - preciate the value of Professor
Weismann	PERSON	's efforts to arrive at a notion of the real structure of the nucleus ; but he does point out truly the limitations of the germ-plasm theory as held by Professor
Weis	PERSON	- mann in the domain of Evolution .

		Tennysonian Studies and Criticisms .

		`` Tennyson , Poet , Philosopher , Ideal - ist , '' by Mr.
J. Cuming Walters	PERSON	-LRB- im - ported by Scribner -RRB- , is the work of an enthusiast , generally in full sympathy with his sub - ject , not exaggerated in its estimates , but possessed of slight critical , as distinguished from expository , value .

		Although it does not claim to be a biog - raphy of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, it nearly amounts to that , for the history of the poet 's works is really the history of his life .

		A few features of the book are the fine engraved portrait -LRB- from one of Mrs.
Cameron	PERSON	's photographs -RRB- , the chapter on
Tennyson	PERSON	's literary characteristics , the study of his suppressed and re - vised poems , the note on Tennysonian volumes and manuscripts , and the careful chronology .

		The book is also noticeable for the anecdotes which it gathers from out-of-the-way sources , and for its numerous selected passages from the earlier criticism made upon the poems .

		But why , in this connection , the author should have done
Hain Friswell	PERSON	the honor of quotation , as he does upon three or four occa - sions , passes comprehension .

		If ever man wrote himself most unmistakably an ass , it was this same
Hain Friswell	PERSON	when he set forth the reasons why
Tennyson	PERSON	should not , in his estimation , be held a great poet .

		Mr.
Walters	PERSON	has gleaned an occasional new fact , as when he discovered that
Thomas Sun	PERSON	- derland of
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	was the subject of `` A Character , '' and has made an occasional mistake , as when he states that Mr.
Frederick Tennyson	PERSON	wrote but one of the '' Poems by
Two Brothers	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		At least four of them are acknowledged by him .

		Like many of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's otherwise intelligent critics , Mr.
Walters	PERSON	joins in the , cry against the dramas .

		He calls '' Queen Mary '' '' incomparably ponderous and dull , '' `` The Falcon '' `` unmeet for serious criti - cism , '' and makes other no less inapt observations .

		But he subsequently bestows so much praise upon 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Pictures of the Hibernian < it home .

		the dramas taken in detail that these preliminary depreciations lose most of their effect .

		He pretends to praise these details without heing '' antilogous , '' but this we can not admit .

		And it is difficult to un - derstand how any true Tennysonian could have said that the twenty-three poems of the posthumous vol - ume would not have made any poet 's fame .

		To our mind , almost any single poem of that volume would have won fame for its author had he heen hitherto absolutely unknown .

		To recur to the plays once more , the question of their fitness for the stage has never been fairly tested . ''

		Queen
Mary	PERSON	'' has been highly successful in
Australia	LOCATION	; '' Becket '' and `` The Foresters '' in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		The fact that `` The Cup '' and `` The Falcon '' and `` The Promise of May '' have been rejected by the pub - lic simply shows that they failed to find their proper audience when the first attempt was made .

		We may say , in conclusion , that , although a better book planned upon the same lines might be easily con - ceived of , the book that Mr.
Walters	PERSON	has made is one that the student of English poetry can hardly go without .

		The saying '' better late than never '' is well verified in '' Seventy Years of Irish Life '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a racy col - lection of Hiberniana by Mr.
W. R. Le Fanu	PERSON	, who now makes his literary debut at the age of seventy - eight .

		The author , a brother of
J. Sheridan Le Fanu	PERSON	, sketches with a light and rapid hand various phases of life in
Erin	PERSON	, fairs , wakes , factions , duels , and what not , the whole agreeably enlivened by the sparkle of the national wit and the whack of the national blackthorn .

		Touching that popular
Hiber	PERSON	- nian social '' function '' the faction fight , Mr.
Le Fanu	PERSON	declares that the story that the row begins '' by one man taking off his coat and trailing it behind him , saying i who dare tread on that ? '

		is a myth .

		I have seen many a faction fight , every one of which began in the same way , which was thus : one man ' wheeled , ' as they called it , for his party ; that is , he marched up and down , flourishing his black - thorn , and shouting the battle-cry of his faction , ' Here is
Coffey	PERSON	aboo against Reaskawallahs ; here is
Coffey	PERSON	aboo who dar strike a Coffey ? ' '

		I dar , ' shouted one of the other party ; ` here 's Reas - kawallah aboo , ' at the same instant making a whack with his shillelagh at his opponent 's head .

		In an instant hundreds of sticks were up , hundreds of heads were broken , '' etc. .

		Once , just after one of these little affairs , the author saw '' an elderly man running after a young fellow of two or three and twenty , every time he got near striking him on the head with a heavy blackthorn , and at every blow setting the blood streaming from his head . '

		Why , ' said I , ' does that young fellow let the old man beat him in that savage way ? ' '

		Ah , sure , your honor , ' said he , ' that 's only his father that 's chastisin ' him for fighting . ' ''

		Here is a good story of a witty priest no rara avis , by the way , in the Green Isle : '' A farmer once asked the well-known Father
Tom Maguire	PERSON	what a miracle was .

		He gave him a very full explanation , which , however , did not seem to satisfy the farmer , who said ' Now do you think , your raverence , you could give me an exam - ple of miracles ? ' '

		Well , ' said Father Tom , ' walk on before me , and I 'll see what I can do . '

		As he did so he gave him a tremendous kick behind . '

		Did you feel that ? '

		he asked . '

		Why would n't I feel it ? '

		said the farmer , rubbing the damaged place , ` Begorra , I did feel it , sure enough . '

		` Well , ' said Father Tom , ' it would have been a miracle if you did n't . ' ''

		This demonstration a posteriori seems to have proved sufficient .

		Mr.
Le Fanu	PERSON	's book will help to while away an evening or two very pleas - antly .

		Two more volumes of the '' Collected Collected Essays of f p rofessor Huxley have Professor Huxley ... v 7 i_vi J/A i ^ \ r \ just been published -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		One of them , '' Darwiniana , '' reproduces the lectures and essays written in defense of '' The Origin of Spe - cies , '' beginning with an essay which dates from the very year -LRB-
1859	DATE	-RRB- of that epoch-making work , and ending with an obituary notice written in
1888	DATE	for the Proceedings of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is now all ancient history , yet not undeserving of preserva - tion .

		Professor
Huxley	PERSON	did yeoman service for the cause of natural selection , and bore , more than any other one man in
England	LOCATION	-LRB- except the Great Dis - coverer himself -RRB- , the brunt of the battle .

		And he must , in collecting these essays for republication , look back with peculiar satisfaction to his share in forcing the general public to its acceptance of the essential Darwinian doctrines .

		The volume is pieced out by a series of six lectures to working - men '' On Our Knowledge of the Causes of the Phe - nomena of Organic Nature . ''

		The lectures date from
1863	DATE	, but many audiences might still profit by them . ''

		I am not without some grounds for suspecting , '' says the author , '' that there yet re - mains a fair sprinkling even of ' philosophic think - ers ' to whom it may be a profitable , perhaps even a novel , task to descend from the - heights of spec - ulation and go over the A B C of the great biolog - ical problem as it was set before a body of shrewd artisans at that remote epoch . ''

		In '' Science and Education , '' the other volume now published , we have no less than seventeen pieces , most of them relating to the place of science in educational schemes .

		The author appears in a less favorable light than usual in this volume , for the zeal with which he champions science leads him to say some very indiscreet things about the humanities .

		We are all glad that , thanks largely to Professor
Hux	PERSON	- ley 's efforts , science has obtained ample recognition in the school and the college , but the exaggerated claims made by him -LRB- and by Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	-RRB- in its behalf at a time when it was struggling for recog - nition will not bear the test of sober examination .

		Even the Darwinian polemic has more of permanent value than this collection of addresses , however use - ful they may have been in their time .

		THE DIAL 117 Literary anecdotes and reminiscences .

		A readable and commendably con - cise volume of literary and other reminiscences is
Camilla Crosland	PERSON	's `` Landmarks of a Literary Life 1820-1892 '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Mrs.
Crosland	PERSON	's pages are well studded with eminent names
Edmund Kean	PERSON	,
Malibran	PERSON	,
Thomas Moore	PERSON	,
Jenny Lind	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, the
Brown	PERSON	- ings , the Howitts ,
Charlotte Cushman	LOCATION	,
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	, etc. and her stories are mostly fresh and crisply told .

		She met Hawthorne in
1854	DATE	, and gives the following impressions of him : '' In society he was one of the most painfully shy men I ever knew .

		I never had the pleasure of an unbroken tete-h-tete with him , and am under the impression that with a single listener he must have been a very interesting talker ; but in the small social circle in which I first met him it really seemed impossible to draw him out .

		We were only five or six intimate friends , sit - ting round the fire , and with a host remarkable for his geniality and tact ; but
Hawthorne	PERSON	fidgeted on the sofa , seemed really to have little to say , and almost resented the homage that was paid him . ''

		Not so reticent was Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, who '' did not ignore the fact that she had done an important piece of work in the world , but showed neither mock humil - ity nor self-laudation on the subject . ''

		Notwith - standing `` the strong Yankee twang of her dialect , '' thinks Mrs.
Crosland	PERSON	, '' there was a very charming simplicity about Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	. ''

		Here is an amusing story of her : '' She was being entertained at one of the ducal residences , and the occasion was a large dinner-party .

		In a momentary lull of conversation , Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, who had been gazing somewhat earnestly at her hostess , exclaimed in a voice that everyone could hear ' Duchess , however do you fix your hair ? ' '

		You must ask
Louise	PERSON	, ' replied the Duchess of
Sutherland	LOCATION	, with a smile that in no way betrayed astonishment or rebuked her guest . ''

		Apropos of this British analogue of the episode of
Ajax	ORGANIZATION	and the lightning , Mrs.
Crosland	PERSON	is good enough to add , '' In glancing at the eccentricity of manners of a past generation of Americans , it is only fair to ac - knowledge how vastly they have impi'oved of late years '' largely , it seems , through much contem - plation of
John Bull	PERSON	, the
Chesterfield	LOCATION	and the '' Tur - veydrop '' of national types , whose urbanity and un - failing tact are a byword among nations .

		Old English and That .

		^ historical study of English Middle English is gaining ground in this country is in one handbook .

		attes t e d by the large number of Old English text-books that have appeared in
America	LOCATION	in recent years .

		Prominent among these are Pro- fessor
Cook	PERSON	's translation of Professor
Eduard Sie	PERSON	- vers 's `` Grammar of Old English '' and Dr. Bright 's 41 Anglo-Saxon Reader . ''

		The latest American pub - lication in the department of English philology is Professor
MacLean	PERSON	's '' Old and Middle English Header '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which deserves to be ranked with the best of its kind .

		The book '' is primarily & n attempt to provide for the learner in Old and Middle English helps similar to those which have been furnished in the best Greek and Latin text - books . '' ''

		It is based on Professor
Zupitza	PERSON	's Alt - und Mittelenglisches Ubungsbuch zum Gebrauche bei Universitdts - Vorlesungen '' and '' like its orig - inal , it is emphatically an Exercise Book .

		Like that , it is concise and comprehensive .

		Unlike its original , in order to meet the requirements of En - glish-speaking teachers and pupils , it is supplied with illustrative etymologies , cognate words , phon - ological equations , necessary historical and literary introductions , and bibliographical references . ''

		The Introduction gives information as to the Old and Middle English dialects , and contains a special in - troduction to each of the selections , with much val - uable bibliographical detail , and critical notes on the text .

		A chapter on Versification , from the pen of Mr.
O. L. Triggs	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, of the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago , gives , in concise and clear form , the most nec - essary information on this important subject .

		The Selections are thirty-four in number , fifteen illus - trating Old English , and the rest Middle English .

		For schools in which both the Old and the Middle English periods are to be studied in one year or less , Professor
MacLean	PERSON	's book is doubtless the best now available in this country .

		Dr.

VIII	PERSON	v Section I. , of Dr.
Mur	PERSON	- New English ray 's `` New English Dictionary '' Dictionary .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a thin quarto of about one hundred pages , and extends from Crouchmas to Czech , thus at once completing the letter C and the second volume of the colossal work .

		Volume Three will include D and E , Dr.
Murray	PERSON	assuming respon - sibility for the former letter and Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	for the latter .

		The `` C '' volume complete fills 1308 pages , C being next to S in dictionary dimensions , and including 29,295 main words , nearly as many as belong to S .

		The ten smallest letters , X , Y , Z , Q , K , J , N , U , V , and 0 , taken together , might be brought into a volume of hardly greater dimensions than those of the volume now completed , whence we may see that the work will make greater apparent pro- gress in the future than it has up to the present time .

		Those who wax impatient at the leisurely advance of the work may take comfort from the story of the '' Dictionnaire Historique de la Langue Francaise . ''

		That monument of erudition , begun by the Academy nearly fifty years ago , has just completed the letter
A. Renan	PERSON	once prophesied that the work might be done in about twelve cen - turies , whereupon
M. Bergerat	PERSON	made the skeptical comment : `` M. Renan tells of only twelve centuries as being enough for the purpose , in order to keep up our spirits . ''

		Beginning with number six , we note the completion of the chapter on the Manufacturers ' exhibits , and the first pages of the chapter on the Liberal Arts .

		This chapter runs well into number seven , and gives an intelligent account of the Educational exhibit .

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, The Woman 's department is next taken up , and gets rather more attention than Education .

		Machinery takes us well into part nine , where it is succeeded by Agriculture , which runs nearly through the tenth part .

		Part eleven is devoted to Electricity and Hor - ticulture .

		These parts of a very attractive work are abundantly supplied with processed illustrations , to which the text is really subordinated .

		The paper is heavy , smooth of finish , and receives the impres - sion well .

		There are to be twenty-five instalments of the work , which will form , when complete , a highly satisfactory memorial of the great undertak - ing to which it is devoted .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		There are many editions of
Boswell	PERSON	, but for a com - bination of scholarly editing with inexpensive compact - ness , the two-volume set just published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	deserves special commendation .

		Mr.
Mowbray Morris	PERSON	is the editor .

		He has given all of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's notes and a few of his own in addition .

		The typography is clear and the paper is good , while the price is low enough for most purses .

		The '' Ariel ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- has been com - ing to ns in instalments of seven booklets to a box .

		To the seven '' Comedies '' and the seven '' Histories '' pre - viously published must now be added a series of seven '' Tragedies '' in the same neat form of issue .

		A second set of seven '' Comedies '' will soon follow , and the nine plays remaining will appear in due time .

		The '' Poems '' will eventually be added to the set , and the '' Ariel ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	will be complete .

		We recently noticed the abridgment , by Colonel Al - fred
Pearson	PERSON	, of the late
J. A. Symonds	PERSON	's history of the Italian Renaissance .

		Our notice had reference to the English edition of that work , and now requires to be supplemented by mention of an American edition -LRB- Holt -RRB- , published in neat form , and at less than half the price of the other .

		Those who wish to take their Sy - monds condensed -LRB- or perhaps pruned -RRB- will do well to possess themselves of this book .

		A pretty little volume , of vest-pocket dimensions , with flexible leather covers , of '' The Thoughts of the Emperor
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	Antoninus '' in Long 's trans - lation , has been edited by Mr.
Edwin Ginn	PERSON	, and is pub - lished by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editorial part of the booklet comprises a preface , a biography , an essay on the philosophy of the imperial sage , and an index .

		The biography and the essay are condensed from
Long	LOCATION	.

		A similar edition of
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	is promised by Mr.
Ginn	PERSON	. ''

		HazelPs Annual '' for
1894	DATE	-LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- covers the year
1893	DATE	up to the close of

		The present issue contains a number of maps , such as
Siarn	LOCATION	,
Matabeleland	LOCATION	, and the
Pamirs	LOCATION	; a lot of new biographies , such as Messrs.
W. W. Astor	PERSON	,
T. F. Bayard	PERSON	,
W. E. Henley	PERSON	,
William Watson	PERSON	, and Miss Ada Rehan ; and timely ar - ticles upon such subjects as the Behring Sea question , the Home Rule Bill ,
Bimetallism	PERSON	,

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just published Dr.
C. A. Buchheim	PERSON	's school edition of the first four books of Goethe 's '' Dichtung und Wahrheit . ''

		The apparatus of notes is very full and satisfactory .

		The same pub - lishers also send us a '' Complete Graded Arithmetic , '' in two volumes , by Mr.
George E. Attwood	PERSON	; and , in their '' Pedagogical Library , '' a two-volume treatise , by Mr.
George Ricks	PERSON	, on '' Object Lessons and How to Give Them . ''

		The parts of the two works just men - tioned are designed , respectively , for primary and gram - mar schools .

		`` The Blind as Seen through Blind Eyes '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , translated from the French of
M. Maurice de la Sizer	ORGANIZATION	- anne by Dr.
F. Park Lewis	PERSON	, gives an excellent idea of the intellectual and moral character of those who have lost their sight , an account of the special methods em - ployed in their education , and a suggestion of the va - rious avenues -LRB- more numerous than one would suppose -RRB- open to such of them as must become self-supporting .

		A considerable part of the work is devoted to the life and labors of
Valentine Haiiy	PERSON	, the French founder of schools for the blind .

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish an abridged edition of Vigny 's '' Cinq-Mars '' in their series of mod - ern language texts .

		Mr.

		The book is cut down to rather less than half-size , and provided with an excellent historical introduction .

		From
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have ''
Brigetta	PERSON	, '' one of
Auer	PERSON	- bach 's '' Erzahluugen , '' edited by Dr.
J. Howard Gore	PERSON	; , and '' Popular Science , '' a volume of French readings edited by Dr.

		Maxime du Camp ,
C. Flammarion	PERSON	, and E. Re `` clus . ''

		The Significance of Names '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Leopold Wagner	PERSON	, is a volume of roughly classified and curious information about the proper and other names comprised under such heads as '' Nicknames of American States , '' '' Titles of Honor , '' '' Schools of Philosophy , '' and '' Cordials and Beverages . ''

		The information given is sometimes astonishing , as when we read of
Chicago	LOCATION	: '' It is called the
White City	LOCATION	, from the general aspect of its houses and public buildings , and the
Windy City	LOCATION	, owing to its exposed situation on the margin of a great lake . ''

		Other amusing trouvailles await the explorer of these pages .

		Mr.
E. A. Wallis Budge	PERSON	's `` The Mummy : Chapters on Egyptian Funeral Archaeology '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a handsome volume issued by the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its scope is considerably more comprehensive than the title would indicate , for it iflcludes Egyptian history and chronology , and a full account of the forms of Egyptian writing .

		The story of the
Rosetta Stone	ORGANIZATION	is told at length , and the conflicting claims of Champol - lion and
Young	PERSON	to the honor of its decipherment are carefully and dispassionately discussed .

		The work is abundantly illustrated .

		There are Egyptian gods , pyra - mids and other monuments , reproductions of notable inscriptions , and lists of hieroglyphs , scarabs , and royal cartouches .

		The work is thoroughly scientific and up to date .

		Under the title '' The Evanston Colloquium , ''
Messrs. Macmillau & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the `` Lectures on
Mathe	PERSON	- matics '' delivered last
summer	DATE	at the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, by Professor
Felix Klein	PERSON	, of
Gottingen	LOCATION	.

		This course of lectures was given as a sort of annex to the proceedings of the
Mathematical Congress	ORGANIZATION	given under the auspices of the World 's
Congress Auxiliary	ORGANIZATION	.

		The lectures are published from a report made by Pro- fessor
Alexander Ziwet	PERSON	, and are followed by Professor
Klein	PERSON	's historical sketch of '' The Development of
Mathe	PERSON	- matics at the German Universities . ''

		Among the sub -

		THE DIAL 119 jects discussed in the lectures are
Clebsch	PERSON	and
Sophus Lie	ORGANIZATION	, ideal numbers , and recent work in the non-Euclid - ean geometry .

		Since Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	published his '' Child 's Garden of Verse '' there has been no such book of rhymes for the little ones as Miss
Rossetti	PERSON	's `` Sing-Song '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- .

		Here is an example : '' The city mouse lives in a house ; The garden mouse lives in a bower , He 's friendly with the frogs and toads , And sees the pretty plants in flower . ''

		The city mouse eats bread and cheese ; The garden mouse eats what he can ; We will not grudge him seeds and stalks , Poor little timid furry man . ''

		The same publishers also send us an illustrated edition of '' Goblin Market , '' Mr.
Laurence Housman	PERSON	being the designer .

		He has happily seized the spirit of that fan - tastic and remarkable poem .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
Feb. 10 , 1894	DATE	.

		Sundry hints have reached me from time to time to the effect that the brief description , in an earlier letter , of the recently published '' Liber Scriptorum '' was not sufficient for the purposes of THE DIAL , and I have been asked to review the '' Book of the
Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	'' for that journal .

		Probably the makers of this request scarcely realized its formidable nature .

		To sit in judg - ment on the work of one hundred and nine writers , and in a single article at that , is something which even Kit North might have shrunk from doing .

		Then again , if I am rightly informed , the '' Liber Scriptorum '' has not been offered for review to any periodical whatever , but the committee in charge of its publication , Mr.
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	, Mr.
John D. Champlin	PERSON	, and Mr.
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	, have very gladly shown copies to representatives of papers which have wished to print articles about it .

		Some description of the volume and its contents is all that can be attempted .

		It is now nearly two years since the idea of publish - ing such a book was first proposed to members of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		The suggestion met with immediate favor , but it has taken a great deal of time to obtain the articles contributed , to have the sheets printed and signed by the contributors , to have the hand-made paper manu - factured in
Holland	LOCATION	, and to design and prepare the spe - cial binding used .

		Passing over details mentioned in my former letter , it is perhaps well to say that the com - pleted books , in every feature of printing and binding , are the sole work of the De
Vinne Press	PERSON	, the managers of which have spent much time and thought in their preparation .

		The handsome volumes are bound in dark maroon leather , with gilt tops and uncut edges , and are sold at
$ 100	MONEY	each .

		Most of the edition of 250 copies has been disposed of , and Mr.
Henry T. Thomas	PERSON	, the publisher , of 13
Astor Place	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, who is a per - sonal friend of many members of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	, has taken charge of the sale of the remainder , thereby relieving the committee of their long trusteeship .

		Now , the only practical arrangement of the contribu - tions to such a work is alphabetically , according to the names of the writers .

		This arrangement gave first place to my friend , Mr.
Henry Abbey	PERSON	, the poet , of
Kingston	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, who would be very loth to seek such prominence of his own accord .

		But he responded nobly to the occasion , and , indeed , has written one of the finest things in the book , a sonnet embodying the sentiment of its writers .

		I take the liberty of quoting it in full . ''

		TO BAFFLE TIME . ''

		To baffle time , whose tooth has never rest , And make the counted line , from page to page , Compact , fulfilled of what is apt and best , And vibrant with the key-note of the age , This is my aim ; and even aims are things ; They give men value who have won no place .

		We pass for what we would be , by some grace , And our ambitions make us seem like kings .

		But never yet has destiny 's clear star For aimless feet shed light upon the way .

		So have I hope , since purpose sees no bar , To write immortally some lyric day , As
Lovelace	PERSON	did when he informed the lay Inspired by his
Lucasta	PERSON	and the war . ''

		Each author being at liberty to write what he pleases , we find Dr.
Felix Adler	PERSON	contributing an interesting study of Sir
Thomas More	PERSON	, while Mr.
Henry M. Alden	PERSON	, of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' has prepared a '' fireside study , '' ''
Flammantia Mcenia Mundi	PERSON	, '' in his most mystical vein .

		It is not surprising to find Mr.
Poultney Bige	PERSON	- low writing about '' Russian Rule as It Is Felt by Ten Millions of the Unorthodox , '' and no one will look for complimentary references to
Russia	LOCATION	and the Russians in such an article .

		It contains some of his interesting personal experiences while in
Poland	LOCATION	.

		From San Fran - cisco , Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	sends a dainty little poem , '' Noon in the Hills , '' while Major
Joseph Kirk	PERSON	- land tells the story of
Jean Baptiste Pointe	PERSON	de Sable , whose identity need not be explained to Chicagoans .

		From England Mr.
Harold Frederic	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry Harland	PERSON	contribute a story and a poem respectively .

		Mr.
Harland	PERSON	's poem , entitled '' The King 's Touch , '' is quite
Browningesque	PERSON	in style , and is the first from his pen which I remember to have seen .

		Poems by Colonel Hay , Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	, and Mr.
Howells	PERSON	lend to the distinc - tion of the volume , and a pathetic story by
Mark Twain	PERSON	, '' The Californian 's Tale , '' shows how completely each contributor has followed his own impulse in writing for '' Liber Scriptorum , '' rather than the expectation of the reader .

		Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	gives free play to his deli - cate fancy in '' My Search for the Goddess , '' following next to Dr.
Ludlow	PERSON	's sketch , '' Afloat on the ^ Egean . ''

		Prof.
Josiah Royce	PERSON	contributes a long and thoughtful essay on ''
Tolstoi	PERSON	and the Unseen Moral Order . ''

		Some of the lighter articles are Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's '' Literature in a Dress Suit , '' Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's '' How to Train Our Wives and Children , '' and Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's '' Pomo - na 's Club . ''


Pomona	LOCATION	is made to preach so clever a ser - mon on a burning literary question of the day that I can not forbear quoting the most of it .

		`` The human race -LSB-
Pomona	LOCATION	says -RSB- is divided into women and men , and literatoor is divided into romantickism and real - istics .

		And the great trouble with both of them is that some - times there is too much of one and not enough of the other .

		Everybody knows that we ca n't git along without realistics , that is , a certain amount of 'em ; but if a boy puts too much rag-tag and bobtail to his kite , he ca n't make it fly .

		There 's times when you might git a kite up into the air with - out any tail , though it would be apt to spin about in an un - certain way .

		But nobody could make a tail fly without any kite . ''

		In ray opinion , the worst thing about facts is that they are too common .

		Everybody 's got 'em piled up around 'em and all over the ground ... 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, `` But when the beautiful snows of romantickism come floatin ' down and cover up all them facts , and spread a lovely white veil , like the icin ' on a pound-cake , over all nature and art , then them facts is of some use ; they make a foundation for the snow and keep it from bio win ' away .

		And what was perfectly horrid a little while ago becomes like dazzlin ' mounds , and domes , and minarets a-sparklin ' in the sun . ''

		Bravo ,
Pomona	LOCATION	!

		One question is settled at last .

		I half forget whether your views coincide with those of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	or with those of Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	.

		It must be one or the other , for
Pomona	LOCATION	never takes mid - dle ground with anyone or anything , be it lightning-rod peddlers or literature .

		On second thoughts , it must be Quiller-Couch .

		It is , then , only possible to mention a few of the con - tributors to `` Liber Scriptorum . ''

		They have cheer - fully done their part , in the hope that a sufficient fund might be obtained to provide their democratic little or - ganization with permanent quarters .

		Their expectation is about to be realized .

		The
Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	is now in a most flourishing condition , and those who founded it and held to it during its early progress have been re - warded by the great benefits resulting to the writing guild in social and even professional directions .

		The original manuscripts of all the articles contributed to '' Liber Scriptorum '' have been inlaid in uniform sheets , and bound up in three large volumes in crushed
Levant	PERSON	morocco .

		They have been on exhibition all this week in
Tiffany	ORGANIZATION	's window ,
Union Square	LOCATION	, and have at - tracted crowds of people all day long , being opened at the autographs of some of the best known writers .

		The three volumes will be sold , as one lot , to the highest bidder .

		MR.
LESLIE STEPHEN ON MATTHEW ARNOLD	PERSON	.

		From Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's recent article on
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, in '' The
National Review	ORGANIZATION	, '' we make the fol - lowing pithy extract : '' Putting on a mask , sometimes of levity , sometimes of mere literary dandyism , with an irony which some - times is a little too elaborate , but which often expresses the keenest intelligence trying to pass itself off as sim - plicity , he was a skirmisher , but a skirmisher who did more than most heavily-armed warriors against the vast oppressive reign of stupidity and prejudice .

		He made the old dragon Philistine -LRB- to use his phrase -RRB- wince at times , and showed the ugliness and clumsiness of the creature ; and after all he did it in a spirit as of one who recognized the monster was after all a most kindly monster at bottom .

		He may be enlisted in useful serv - ice if you can only apply the goad successfully ; and made effective , in his ponderous way , like the
Cartha	PERSON	- ginian elephant , if only you can mount his neck and goad him in the right direction .

		No single arm is suf - ficient for such a task ; the dragon shakes himself and goes to sleep again in a stertorous and rather less com - placent fashion , let us hope !

		and we feel that the strug - gle will too probably endure till we have ceased to be personally interested . ''

		I can not , indeed , get it out of my head that we 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 slow-footed and prosaic persons sometimes make our ground surer ; and that , for example , poor Bishop Col - enso , whom Arnold ridiculed as the typical Philistine critic , did some good service with his prosaic arithmetic .

		There are cases in which the four rules are better than the finest critical insight .

		But there is room for poets as well as for arithmeticians ; and
Arnold	LOCATION	, as at once poet and critic , has the special gift if I may trust my own experience - of making one feel silly and tasteless when one has uttered a narrow-minded , crude , or un - generous sentiment ; and I dip into his writings to re - ceive a shock , unpleasant at times , but excellent in its effects as an intellectual tonic .

		THE DUTY ON BOOKS : A LETTER FROM HON.
WILLIAM EVERETT	PERSON	, M. C .

		The
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	having failed to re - spond to the appeal made by the educated classes for the removal of the stupid duty on imported English books , the missionary efforts of the friends of culture should now be directed upon the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and it is yet quite possible that the reform may be accomplished .

		Meanwhile , the following letter addressed to President Gates of Am - herst College by Dr.
William Everett	PERSON	will be found in - teresting .

		Dr.
Everett	PERSON	took an active part in urging upon the
Ways and Means Committee	ORGANIZATION	the desirability of the reform , and stood sponsor for a large number of THE DIAL 'S petitioners , among whom were President
Gates	PERSON	and the faculty of
Amherst	LOCATION	.

		President
Merrill E. Gates	PERSON	, LL.D. ,
Amherst College	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	: '' MY DEAR SIR : I had the honor to present to the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	, for the consideration of the committee on ways and means , the petition of yourself and your associates for the removal of the duty on books printed wholly or in part in the English language .

		Similar petitions came in through myself and others , from many universities and colleges , and from individ - uals of the first consideration who understand the in - terests of literature and education .

		I am absolutely in sympathy with the petition .

		I called the attention of more than one member of the committe on ways and means to the propriety of removing what , with you , I consider an inexcusable burden on a heavily burdened and ill-paid class .

		I had hoped to see free books in the bill ; I dwelt on the subject in my speech ; and I duly filed with the chairman of the committee of the whole an amendment in accordance with your petition .

		I am sorry that this and others could not have been presented at an earlier stage , though I am afraid its success was problematical . ''

		There was one fortnight devoted to amendments , as the chairman recognized their proposers .

		Far the greater part of this time was absorbed in lengthy dis - cussions on amendments offered by the committee on ways and means .

		The rest of the time was given , after eager competition , to the representatives of various im - portant industrial interests , who felt that their constit - uents were injured by the bill as it stood .

		The chair - man was anxious to be perfectly fair in recognizing the proposers of amendments ; but their number was be - yond satisfactory arrangement .

		I found very early that it was almost impossible for me to get in the amend - ment for free books in time and so it ultimately proved .

		Even if I had got it in , it would have been subject to serious opposition from influential quarters .

		That I should have been willing to try to overcome ; but I saw more than one amendment , boldly and skilfully sup - ported , fall before the simple opposition of the committee on ways and means , who admitted the force of the ar - gument , but declared that after careful consideration they believed the duty should be retained .

		Under the circumstances , I was obliged , slowly and painfully , to renounce the hope of presenting and advocating the claims of my own guild a set of quiet modest men and women , scattered all over the country , working under heavy burdens for inadequate pay , and yet with this extra burden on what are for them the tools of trade . ''

		I trust you will not fail in pressing the objects of your petition in all public and private ways , and I can assure you of my sympathy , which shall take a practical form at every moment that I see a practical opening .

		Most respectfully yours ,
WILLIAM EVERETT	PERSON	. ''

		ELABORATION IN POETIC ART .

		A recent critique , by Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	, in '' The Athenaeum , '' includes the following considerations upon the labor limce of the poet : '' The subject of elabora - tion in poetic art , especially by
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, remains still to be adequately handled by the poetic critic .

		Improvisatorial poetry , so easy in Italian , is impossible in a language so rich in rhyme-emphasis , and yet so comparatively restricted in rhymes , as En - glish .

		But while it may be said that in English the warring between the emphasis natural to the rhymed structure and the emphasis natural to the subject-mat - ter of the poem can not be appeased offhand , it must also be said that the very cause which makes it more difficult to rhyme in English than in Italian is really one of the causes of the superiority of English rhyming over Italian rhyming .

		In Italian , where so many of the words rhyme with each other , the rhyme lends none of that sting to the thing said which is lent by English rhyme .

		It was this stinging effect of the rhyme-em - phasis of English poetry which gave Chaucer his ad - vantage over
Langland	LOCATION	's work in the great struggle be - tween the scansion of alliterative bars and the scansion of the rhyme-pause which we have before alluded to .

		No good rhymed verse can exist in English , however , without more or less elaboration on the part of the poet .

		It is mainly in their methods of manipulation that poets differ in this matter .

		And it would be easy to show that in this respect English poets have to be divided into three classes : those who elaborate the material in their own minds , and bring it to perfection , or almost to perfection , before setting down the words on paper ; those who jot down their verses in the rough , but begin to change them before ever the ink is dry ; and those whose elaborations are mainly effected after the verses have passed into type .

		To some poets the sight of their verses in manuscript produces that sense of finality which to others only comes by the sight of their verses in type .

		To others , again , not even type itself produces the sense of finality . ''

		The nearest approach to improvisatorial work was that of Byron ; but then , great as was
Byron	PERSON	's poetic energy , his verses are so loose that , as regards the merely artistic qualities , they are not much more than poetry in solution .

		Judging from what we know of the rarest fruit of the genius of
Keats	PERSON	, the ` Ode to a
Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	, '
Keats	PERSON	seems to have belonged to those who have the power of elaborating the verses in the mind and then rolling them over the tongue , so to speak , before setting them down on paper .

		But spontaneous as seems this glorious ode , no one will contend that it has more apparent spontaneity than
Shelley	PERSON	's Ode to 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the West Wind ' or his < Skylark , ' and yet if
Shelley	PERSON	were to be judged by the state of some of the manu - script he left behind he would be ranged among the least spontaneous of poets .

		Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	tells us of en - tire sheets of manuscript so cut about that in some cases one line only would be finally left to stand upon a page .

		From this it would appear that while in
Keats	PERSON	's case the passage of the line or sequence from its first crude form to perfection was partly achieved in the poet 's brain before the pen was taken in hand , in
Shelley	LOCATION	's case this process went on during the very act of writing . ''

		There is , however , as we have hinted above , a third class of poets to whom neither manuscript nor type has any suggestion of finality , and to this class Rossetti be - longed .

		Although he did undoubtedly make altera - tions in his verses while in manuscript , it was when they lay before him in the sharpness of type that he saw how far from , or how near to , his ideal of poetic expression he had brought himself .

		And yet , howsoever great had been the corrections he had introduced in his proofs , the printed page never did suggest finality to him .

		From the first appearance of ' Sister
Helen	PERSON	, ' when the poet was not much more than a boy , down to the year preceding that of his death , the ballad was subject to changes .

		And in this , as in certain other matters , he was like
Coleridge	PERSON	, that his changes were almost always improvements . ''

		Sport , discovery , and science contribute in this narrative to form a book of surpassing interest ... The result is that a book which is full of exciting adventures with wild beasts and wild men in a strange country yields also in every chapter matter which the geographer , the natur - alist , and the anthropologist will account of solid and peculiar value . ''

		A splendid book of travel ... The illustrations are themselves of the highest interest .

		No such series of pictures have we ever found ii > a book of travel ; full of life and vigor they are , and without an apparent element of exaggeration , though many of them make the nerves thrill with a sense of almost personal danger ... From all points of view general interest , scientific value , exciting adventure , and perfect illustra - tion Lieutenant von Ho ` hnel 's work is not far from the best that have been produced out of the Dark Continent .

		We think we are well within the mark in saying that this novel is one of the three or four best novels of the year .

		The author is eminently thoughtful , yet the story is not distinctively one of moral purpose .

		The play of character and the clash of purpose are finely wrought out ... What gives the book its highest value is really the author 's deep knowledge of motive and character .

		The reader continually comes across keen observations and subtle expressions that not infrequently recall

		The friends of modern language instruction have reason to congratulate themselves upon the progress made during recent years in that department of education .

		Nearly every Amer - ican college of any standing has a corps of trained instructors in French and German at least , if not in Italian and Spanish also .

		That these instructors take their work seriously is shown by the grammatical and philological manuals , and by the carefully-edited modern language texts that they have been preparing in such numbers since
1880	DATE	, and that pub - lishers have found it profitable to produce .

		Twenty years ago , the only manuals availa - ble for the use of the instructor in this coun - try were works of the Ahn-Otto-Fasquelle - Ollendorf type , and texts of a very few among the most hackneyed of the classics .

		Now , the instructor has his choice among many scien - tific manuals , and among still more attractive and interesting texts .

		Moreover , those of our teachers who take seriously the work of modern language instruction have now carried on for ten years an association the
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	which has been justi - fied by its works , and which stands in the front rank of the learned societies of this country .

		The pedagogical section of this
Association	ORGANIZATION	held a meeting a few weeks ago for the discus - sion of the important subject of methods of in - struction .

		Mr.
E. H. Babbitt	PERSON	reported this meeting for the
February	DATE	'' Educational Re - veiw , '' and from his report we extract a passage that we have read with peculiar satisfaction : '' Dr.
Rambeau	PERSON	made the point that in Ger - many the Sprachmeister , whose business is to impart a practical knowledge of the spoken language , is classified with the music and danc - ing master , where he belongs , and has no more to do with the work of liberal education than they .

		There is even more reason why he should be so classified in this country ; the /
Sprach	PERSON	- meister and his methods have no more place in our higher schools and colleges than teach - ers of piano-playing and type-writing .

		But the fact is , that when a generation ago modern languages were first thought of among us as a factor in a liberal education , the Sprachmeister 130 -LSB-
March	DATE	l r were the only people in the country who could teach them , and had to be taken to do the work in the colleges .

		Some of them rose to the oc - casion and became real educators , with a true sense of the relations of their work , but many more did not , and so the modern language in - struction in this country is still tinged with
Sprachmeisterei	PERSON	to an extent which seriously impairs its usefulness and dignity . ''

		In con - nection with these remarks Dr.
Rambeau	PERSON	fur - ther stated that '' the public , even the educa - tional public , still believes that the only end and aim of studying a modern language is the ability to speak it , '' and the following surpris - ing note is attached : '' In a paper on the edu - cational value of modern languages , read re - cently before the
Middle States Association of Colleges	ORGANIZATION	and Preparatory Schools , the view re - ferred to was taken apparently as a matter of course , and no one challenged it in the discus - sion which followed . ''

		That the condition of things in the Middle and
Western States	LOCATION	is not quite as desperate as would appear from the note above quoted may be illustrated by the fact that a similar School and
College Conference	ORGANIZATION	was held at
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION
last November	DATE	, and that the paper read upon the subject of modern lan - guage teaching -LRB- to which subject the Confer - ence was largely given over -RRB- expressed views entirely in agreement with those of Dr.
Ram	PERSON	- beau .

		These views , while they evoked dissent from a few belated educators -LRB- mostly from the country districts -RRB- , seemed to meet the approval of the majority of those engaged in the Con - ference .

		The paper in question has just been published in '' The School Review . ''

		A per - tinent passage in this paper states the difficulty that our modern language instructor -LRB- at least below the college -RRB- has as yet hardly begun to overcome , and that should be made the object of a persistent and unwearying crusade on the part of all who have at heart the success of this important branch of education .

		The passage speaks of '' that great divergence of educated from common opinion which every educator must squarely face , for the popular verdict says that students of a foreign language should learn to speak it , while the educator as emphatic - ally asserts that they should learn to read it , and that it makes little difference whether they learn to speak it or not . ''

		This is the educa - tional , as distinguished from the Sprachmeister , view of the question , and it will take a great deal of hammering to get it into the heads of the well-meaning but not highly-intelligent pub - lic upon which most of our lower schools , and many of our colleges , depend for their support .

		There are few departments of our secondary instruction in which reform is more needed than in that now under consideration , for the waste of time and energy at present going on is sim - ply enormous .

		The serious objects of modern language teaching are being neglected in a vast number of high schools , in order that children may be taught to chatter upon a limited range of useless subjects in a language that nine - tenths of them will never have any real occa - sion to employ .

		As long as our schools pre - tend to be educational institutions , it is their business to educate , and not to encourage merely ornamental accomplishments ; to keep in view the needs , not the vanities , of the human soul .

		The real objects of modern language work are , of course , to get access to a new lit - erature , and to reach a better realization , by translation and comparative study , of the his - tory , the resources , and the force of English speech .

		The recent report of the
Committee of Ten	ORGANIZATION	very properly emphasizes these objects , and the influence of the Modern Language As - sociation is almost wholly in the direction of their accomplishment .

		But the inertia of the public consciousness should be reckoned with , , and educational effort must not relax .

		Every year our universities are sending out young men and women who understand what modern lan - guage teaching should be , and who are compe - tent to undertake it .

		It is the business of our schools to secure these people as teachers , impos - ing no vexatious restrictions upon their work , and to relegate the Sprachmeister to his proper function of coaching people who wish to go abroad or to shine in a society which accepts the gilding for the pure metal .

		He certainly has no business in the school unless he is will - ing to abandon the methods demanded of him by his private pupils , and rise to the educa - tional occasion offered by connection with an institution for serious training .

		THE SUPPRESSION OF `` FOREIGN IDEAS . ''

		The educated opinion of this country is practically unanimous in favoring a removal of the stupid tariff upon English books , but Mr.
Henry Carey Baird	PERSON	-LRB- of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RRB- is `` agin it . ''

		Some of his ob - jections are stated in a letter to '' The Publishers ' Weekly , '' which journal recently placed itself in very distinct terms upon the side of free books .

		We quote a significant passage from Mr.
Baird	PERSON	's letter :
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 131 '' The idea that taxation is necessary to the very ex - istence of society , and that no productive industry in a country can escape it , seems to be wholly overlooked and ignored by those theorists , like yourself , who would benefit students and others while sacrificing the fun - damental rights of domestic producers .

		... In a word , the policy which you advocate is highly unjust , because it would discriminate against the American pub - lisher .

		As for the student himself , and for the
State	ORGANIZATION	, it may be said with entire truth that many of these for - eign books , which you would allow him the privilege of importing free , would teach him doctrines which are utterly antagonistic to the best interests of American society , such free importation , in that case , thus being against public policy .

		The fact is , this country , through the medium of the college , is being honeycombed and our civilization is being threatened with destruction , by reason of the absorbing of foreign ideas , especially En - glish , and of an economic character .

		Rather would I put a prohibitive tariff on books containing such ideas than admit those books free of duty . ''

		Partisans of Mr.
Baird	PERSON	's type are not usually as out - spoken as this .

		As a rule , while mentally carrying to its logical conclusion their fundamental assump - tion that all ideas not in accordance with their own should be suppressed , they contrive to cover their intolerance with the veil of some sort of rhetorical verbiage .

		But Mr.
Baird	PERSON	scorns such subterfuges , and the expression of his fanaticism is refreshingly frank .

		In spite of his protest , and of his curious notions of `` public policy , '' we imagine that the honeycombing work of enlightenment will go on , whatever superstructure may suffer from the pro- cess .

		The age and country in which he lives must seem sadly out of joint .

		He should have been born a Chinaman or a
Mohammedan	DATE	.

		As the latter , he would have gloated over the destruction of all books that did not agree with the
Koran	LOCATION	; and as the former , he would have occupied the most approved patriotic standpoint in seeking to protect his nation from the deadly invasions of foreign culture .

		As an American Mr.
Baird	PERSON	is distinctly misplaced , and as a modern he is as decidedly out of date .

		Our tariff laws have been made to accomplish many purposes besides that of providing revenue for the govern - ment , but this is the first time , to our knowledge , that anyone has proposed that they should also as - sume the function of an intellectual censorship .

		one year , and seven assistants , a total of twenty .

		During the present year these teachers have in charge nine courses and seventeen half-courses .

		A whole course at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	meets three hours a week throughout the year ; and a half - course either three hours a week for half the year , or once a week for the whole .

		In addition to the courses actually in progress , one course and seven half-courses an - nounced by the department of English are not given this year , but have been given in the past , and will be given in the future , alternating with some of those now in hand .

		Statistics as to the number of students enrolled this year are not readily available .

		The forthcoming report of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences shows that the state of affairs last year , which may be taken as typical , was as fol - lows : In nine full courses , including the English Composition prescribed for Freshmen which num - bered 499 there were 52 Graduate Students , 113 Seniors , 119 Juniors , 136 Sophomores , 377 Fresh - men , 88 Special Students , 62 Scientific Students , 1 Divinity Student , and 3 Law Students , a total of 952 enrollments .

		In thirteen half-courses in - cluding the courses in English Composition pre - scribed for Sophomores and for Juniors , which to - gether numbered 648 , there were 58 Graduate Students , 188 Seniors , 382 Juniors , 281 Sopho - mores , 12 Freshmen , 51 Special Students , 25 Scien - tific Students , 1 Divinity Student , 3 Law Students , and 1 Student of Agriculture , a total of 998 en - rollments .

		No statistics are available as to how many of these students were enrolled in more than one of the courses under consideration .

		These figures , then , are valuable chiefly in showing the amount of teaching , in terms of courses and half-courses , actu - ally demanded from the teachers .

		It may be added , however , that no Freshman is commonly admitted to an elective course in English , while for the reg - ular half-course in English Composition prescribed for Sophomores there is an alternative elective full course in the same subject , in which last year 122 Sophomores were enrolled .

		The full course in En - glish Composition prescribed for Freshmen , and the half-courses in the same subject prescribed for the two years following , comprise all the required work in English at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the course prescribed for Freshmen , Professor
A. S. Hill	PERSON	's '' Principles of Rhetoric '' is used as a text-book .

		Lectures based thereon are given , and also lectures dealing with some aspects of English Literature .

		Of these lectures students are required to write summaries .

		Besides this written work , every member of the class writes a composition in the class-room once a week ; and these compositions are carefully criticised by the teachers .

		In the half - course prescribed for Sophomores , lectures are given on Exposition , Argument , Description , and
Narra	ORGANIZATION	- tion ; and during the year the students write twelve themes , of from five hundred to a thousand words .

		These are carefully criticised by teachers , and gen - erally rewritten by the students , with this criticism in mind .

		In the half-course prescribed for Juniors 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, there are lectures on Argument ; and the students make one formal analysis of a masterpiece of argu - mentative composition , and write four arguments known as '' f orensics '' of from a thousand to fif - teen hundred words .

		Each of these is preceded by a brief , which is criticised by a teacher before the forensic is written .

		The forensics themselves are also carefully criticised , and frequently rewritten .

		All teachers engaged in these courses keep frequent office hours for personal conference with their pupils .

		Apart from these courses , all the work in English at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is elective .

		This year the English pre - scribed for Freshmen is divided into three distinct courses , somewhat differing in detail .

		This leaves six elective courses and fifteen elective half-courses to be accounted for .

		Of these , only one an ele - mentary half-course in Anglo-Saxon can be called purely linguistic .

		Three courses and five half - courses may be described as both linguistic and lit - erary .

		These deal with various specimens of En - glish literature from
Beowulf	LOCATION	to
Milton	LOCATION	, in each case attending both to the literary meaning of the matter in hand and to grammatical details in the broadest sense of the term .

		One full course and five half-courses may be described as literary , de - manding a great amount of reading and critical work , but paying no attention to linguistic detail .

		These deal with various periods of English Litera - ture , from the
Sixteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	to the present tune .

		In the broader sense of the term , all these courses linguistic and literary alike may be called philological .

		Of the remaining work , two courses and two half-courses are in English Composition ; one half-course is in
Elocution	LOCATION	; and one consists of oral discussion of topics in history and economics .

		There is no sharp distinction , then , between lit - erary courses and linguistic .

		In the past , however , the faculty has held that a full course should gener - ally involve some linguistic study .

		The single full course given this year in literature apart from lin - guistics is a division of a very advanced one in special research .

		Of the teachers , one professor , one assistant professor , and one instructor concern themselves wholly with the work classified as both literary and linguistic .

		All the remaining teachers concern themselves more or less with
Composition	ORGANIZATION	, either prescribed or elective .

		The courses in liter - ature apart from linguistics are this year in charge of four of these teachers one professor , one assist - ant professor , and two instnictors .

		Last year the largest elective courses were in Composition , when the most elementary numbered 154 , and the next 148 .

		The largest course among those both linguistic and literary was one in Shake - speare , which numbered 111 ; the largest half - course in literature , which dealt with the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, numbered 122 .

		In general , the courses deal - ing either linguistically or otherwise with the earlier periods of English Literature were small and mature .

		One , which dealt with Early English Metrical Ro - mances , numbered only six , all graduate students .

		In the courses in Composition , prescribed and elective alike , little importance is attached to theo - retical knowledge of rhetoric as distinguished from constant practice in writing under the most minute practicable criticism .

		In the two full elective courses given this year , the students write both daily themes of about a hundred words , and fortnightly themes of from five hundred to a thousand words .

		This work is frequently discussed in person with the teach - ers , who for this purpose keep office hours , - quite distinct from regular class-room appointments , averaging five hours a week .

		It will be seen , then , that the use of text-books , as distinguished from personal instruction , is reduced to a minimum .

		The text-books actually in use have been written for the purposes in hand by the teachers who use them .

		Of the courses in linguistics and in literature alike it may be said that no text-books are generally used .

		In linguistics the student must naturally provide himself with a good standard copy of the text under consideration ; but the better part of the comments on these texts is supplied by the actual teachers .

		In literature the student is always sent directly to the works of the writers under considera - tion .

		Of these he is often required to read so much as to make the purchase of the works in question impracticable .

		In such event students commonly read in the college library , where as many copies as possible of the works under consideration are re - served for their use .

		In no course in literature is any regular text-book employed .

		In the matter of methods , it has long been held by the teachers of English at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	that each teacher 's best method is his own .

		When a course is given into a man 's charge , then , he is absolutely free to conduct it in any way he chooses .

		The natural result is such wide divergence of method in detail that no valuable generalization concerning such detail can be made .

		One man finds recita - tions useful , generally interspersed with frequent comment ; another lectures ; a third prefers per - sonal conference ; a fourth finds the best results coming from properly directed discussions of special topics by his class , and so on .

		Furthermore , in certain cases , the methods of the same teacher may greatly vary with different classes and at different times .

		On only two points , perhaps , may definite agreement among the teachers be asserted : the first is that a candidate for honors in English , in addition to very high proficiency in six elective courses , ought to know at least the elements of Anglo-Saxon , ought to have made some study of pure literature , and ought to write respectably ; the second is that the best educational results are attainable by such free and mutually cordial efforts of teachers differing widely in attainment and temperament as we at present enjoy .

		It may be added that the Secretary of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	will gladly send to any applicant a pam - phlet describing in detail our courses in English ; and that any teacher of English at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	will 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 133 gladly explain his actual methods to any properly accredited inquirer .

		Persons seriously interested in these methods , then , will probably find a visit to Harvard instructive .

		THE `` PURE SAXON '' OF BURNS 'S `` COTTER . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In his article on Transplanted Genius , '' page 72 of THE DIAL for
February 1	DATE	, Mr.
S. R. Elliott	PERSON	writes : '' Certain critics have assumed that
Burns	PERSON	was a poet who could write in two languages , and was not , therefore , limited to his original field ; and they assume this because the same hand that drew the masterpiece ' Tam-o-Shanter ' was also responsible for one of the sweetest idyls in the English lan - guage , ` The
Cotter	PERSON	's
Saturday	DATE
Night	TIME	, ' written in the purest
Saxon	PERSON	and in the Spenserian stanza .

		But ah !

		it was the same
Bobby Burns	PERSON	writing of the same people , and trying to show , for once , that his pathos needed no dialect to give verisimili - tude .

		The scenes he describes are everywhere familiar to his boyhood and throughout his brief manhood ; in short , he never wrote save of what he knew too well . ''

		The pure Saxon '' of The
Cotter	PERSON	's
Saturday	DATE
Night	TIME	'' is to be found in the dedication , which fills the first stanza , in the reflections that fill stanzas nine and ten , and in the concluding stanzas .

		The body of the poem , the description of the cotter and of his family , begins with the second stanza , which reads : ''
November	DATE	chill blaws loud wi ' angry sugh ; The short ` ning
winter	DATE	day is near a close ; The miry beasts retreating f rae the plough ; The black ` ning trains o ' craws to their repose : The toil-worn Cotter frae his labor goes . ''

		This is very far from being `` pure Saxon . ''

		If , as some have been wont to assert , the passages composed in pure English are decidedly inferior to the others , the poem furnishes an instance in confirmation of Mr.
El	PERSON	- liott 's thesis .

		It shows that , to do his best ,
Burns	PERSON	must needs use his mother-tongue , as well as handle familiar subjects .

		This makes Mr.
Elliott	PERSON	's paragraph the more inexplicable .

		In my diary for that
winter	DATE	, under date of
January 13 , 1883	DATE	, I find the following entry : '' It is a little odd to American eyes to see , in the amusement columns of the
Berlin	LOCATION	newspapers , adver - tisements setting forth that ` Mr.
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, the American tragedian ' is playing Hamlet ' at the Resid - enz Theater .

		But that is just what he is doing ; and winning a gratifying triumph .

		The Crown Prince was also present , and remained until after the scene with

		He was repeatedly recalled during the progress of the play ; at the close of the performance he had to appear four times and ac - knowledge the enthusiastic greetings .

		As for the press , it is unanimous in its praise .

		The

Booth	PERSON	's Hamlet is a creation of flesh and blood ; not such as we have been accustomed to in

		What he did
last night	TIME	was sufficient to show that he is fully entitled to the great reputation which has pre - ceded him .

		The noblesse and retiring modesty with which he received all manifestations of favor made a winning impression . '

Lowell	PERSON	as a curiosity of criticism , and as such may be worth reprinting : `` The other evening , in returning home , what time our streets and sidewalks were glare with ice , we ob - served a chap endeavoring to scale an inclined plane , and at the same time he gave evidences of an uneasy stomach .

		His biography has been delayed by a series of misadventures .

		His closest friend ,
Hugh Pearson	PERSON	, who might have written it , followed Stanley within a twelvemonth .

		His travelling companion and frequent co-worker , Sir
George Grove	PERSON	, found the pressure of other duties incompatible with the task which the Dean had hoped that he would undertake .

		Mr.
Walrond	PERSON	, to whom the work fell , died while arranging and assimilat - ing his superabundant materials .

		Finally , Mr.
Rowland Prothero	PERSON	was put in possession of Dean
Bradley	PERSON	's notes and Dean
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's pa - pers , with the result which lies before us .

		It proves well worth waiting for .

		At first one is tempted to suspect that less space might have been occupied .

		The humors of the Tractarian controversy on both sides of it have had un - usual publicity , and may fairly be considered to be exhausted .

		Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	's comments upon
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's career , elucidative and sympa - thetic as they are , might sometimes be short - ened .

		A smaller number of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's letters might have as clearly revealed his delightful personality .

		A reviewer must find fault some - where , and so it may be said that the board sometimes groans under the profusion of the banquet .

		That may be taken for an official judgment .

		But personally the critic has read and rejoiced in every page from title to finis , and holds with the French gourmand who said '' Too much is not enough . ''

		It is curious that
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, living and dead , should have had almost the first and almost the last word in the long debate between Tract - arianism and Broad Churchmanship , between the men who looked backward and those who looked forward for the golden age of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fifty years are ended , and it is a life of
Arnold	LOCATION	's biographer which sums up the gains and losses of the long campaign .

		To be sure , there remains a Memorial of Jow - ett to be written , and
Pusey	PERSON	's Life is incom - plete .

		But we know from the volumes already issued what Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	's Life is likely , and un - likely , to give us ; and Dr.
Jowett	PERSON	, as scholar and educator rather than ecclesiastic or theo - logian , has been on a side-track rather than the main line .

		But
Stanley	PERSON	all his days was in the thick of everything .

		Whatever the event or spectacle of his period , he was either on the stage as an actor , or an eager participant as spectator in the front row of seats .

		Born in the highest ranks of English society , the son of a clergyman who was to become Bishop of
Norwich	LOCATION	in
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's early youth , from the first
Arthur Stanley	PERSON	was an unusual child , of a highly nervous organization and an almost feminine sweetness of nature .

		He was known at home as `` the little sylph '' and `` Prince Pitiful . ''

		Sent to a private school at nine years old , his heart was in his books rather than his play .

		He read
Southey	PERSON	and
Dryden	PERSON	and Shake - speare and
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, from copies bought with his pocket-money .

		He wrote odes to '' The humming-bird bright , The screech-owl of the
night	TIME	, And the stork snow-white . ''

		He '' screamed with rapture '' at the first sight of big waves at sea , and fairly '' danced in ecstasy '' at the vision of a mountain peak above the clouds .

		He had an early reputation as a teller of stories , and the gift probably stood him in good stead when he entered Rugby , a slim and delicate boy , at the age of thirteen .

		Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	had just been made Head-Master , and
Arthur	PERSON	came at once under his influence .

Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	.

		He caught the reforming temper of his hosts at
Hurst	PERSON	- monceaux , and wrote to Vaughan : '' Alas , that a church that has so divine a service should keep its long list of Articles .

		I am strengthened more than ever in my opinion that there is only needed , that there only should be , one ,
viz.	LOCATION	, < I believe that Christ is both God and Man . ' ''

		That was the mood of
Arthur Stanley	PERSON	always .

		On that brief platform he was ready to stand with all believers .

		It was in
October , 1834	DATE	, that he went up to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first
Sunday	DATE	he heard Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	upon the Song of Solomon . ''

		It was very long and disproportioned ; most of it learned and clever . ''

		The length and the learning and the disproportion are all quite credible .


Pusey	PERSON	was already a recognized leader .

		The Tract - arian movement had begun , and the more earn - est minds of the
University	ORGANIZATION	were mainly drawn to it .

		It attracted
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, who respected
Pusey	PERSON	, loved to quote
Keble	LOCATION	, and admired New - man .

		The spell of
Arnold	LOCATION	was no longer as dominating as it had been .

		Stanley was grow - ing in independence , beginning to measure and judge those whom most profoundly he rever - enced .

		He could disapprove of the temper of
Arnold	LOCATION	's fierce diatribe upon '' The Oxford Malignants . ''

		He was becoming less a student of books , more an observer of men .

		For this reason , perhaps , his university career was less brilliant than that at Rugby had been .

		It was only on the third trial that he won the
Ireland	LOCATION	scholarship , though he took his '' first-class '' and gained a fellowship , not in his own college .

		It had been hinted to him that his opinions were under suspicion , and that failure there was probable .

		He was at this time in '' a strait betwixt two '' as to his theological position .

		He was drawn to
Newman	PERSON	, he was still held by Ar - nold . ''

		A magnificent and consistent system '' of Sacramentarian teaching appealed to his imagination and historic sense , while '' the voice of St.
Paul	PERSON	's Epistles '' called him , '' loud and clear , '' in the opposite direction .

		The struggle was brief and decisive .

		The earliest fathers once for all triumphed over any later authori - ties .

		A Tory and High Churchman by his nerves , his affections , his sympathies ,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	was a liberal in
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	by virtue of his reason and conscience .

		When his feelings led one way and his sober judgment another ,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	knew where to go , however painful the wrench of the decision .

		But finding , as he said a little later , the character of the Liberals '' miserably unsatisfactory , '' and '' to act with the Newmanites impossible , '' he struck across country for himself , and from the hour of Ar - nold 's death called no man master .

		That death occurred in
June , 1842	DATE	.

		Stunned by the aw - ful shock at first ,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	roused himself to comfort the desolated household .

		Presently , at their request , he threw himself heart and soul into the work of preparing
Arnold	LOCATION	's biography .

		To be entrusted with it had been a dream of his boyhood .

		He entered on his task with a fine prescience as to what the record of such a life might be .

		For two years , his toil was great , almost '' an agony . ''

		The result was adequate .

		He produced one of the half-dozen best biog - raphies in the English tongue .

		It is singularly free from the faults of an unpractised writer .

		It is more reserved and sober in style than any of
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's after works .

		Its author was not yet thirty years old .

		Meanwhile , after some scruples as to the damnatory clauses of the Athanasian creed and the strictness of clerical subscription ,
Stan	PERSON	- ley had been ordained deacon and priest , and appointed college lecturer and tutor at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The atmosphere of the
University	ORGANIZATION	was at this time dense with storm and overcharged with electricity .

		The fall of the Whigs , the issue of '' Tract No. 90 , '' the suspension of Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	, the publication of Ward 's '' Ideal Church , '' the degradation from his doctorate of its author , the stir about
Hampden	PERSON	's lectures , the volcanic eruption of party spirit on his nomination to the See of
Hereford	ORGANIZATION	, the lapsing of
Ward	ORGANIZATION	and of
Newman	PERSON	to
Rome	LOCATION	, made the life of an Oxford fellow at this period a series of shocks and jars and surprises , most uncongenial to Stan - ley 's pacific temperament .

		Yet , for all his love of peace , he would not slink out of the field of 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, contest where only sure and lasting peace was to be won .

		He was a chivalric champion of most diverse causes .

		Show him a victim of injustice anywhere , forthwith , sword in hand , though with olive-branch always waving upon his crest , he would
spring	DATE	to his rescue .

		He stood by
Ward	ORGANIZATION	and
Pusey	PERSON	as gallantly as he stood by
Arnold	LOCATION	and
Hampden	LOCATION	.

		His foes were never men , but falsehoods and cruelties and wrongs in whatever armor .

		Always he held with those who sought for the widest liberty and the most generous inclusiveness .

		He would ever strive to make the visible and the invisible Church coterminous .

		As much as might be , he passed out of the arena of controversy and busied himself with his books and his pupils .

		He knew how to make the page of his text - book '' glow with the light of wisdom and po - etry . ''

		The charm of his teaching was '' sim - ply irresistible . ''

		He gave his students '' his heart and his best gifts , '' as well as large pe - cuniary aid , freely and delicately bestowed upon those who needed it .

		It is curious to know that the ready and copious writer of after-years at this time shrank from sermonizing , declaring that he '' could see his way to twelve sermons and no more . ''

		He had not yet discovered , as a naive student once said , '' what a surprising number of good texts there are in the Bible ! ''

		His flow was a little checked , perhaps , by feel - ing himself under suspicion from a clerical gen - eration which dreaded German theology in the lump and knew no distinction between
Strauss	PERSON	and
Ewald	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are men to-day who draw no line between
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and Renan .

		.

		For his own part , Stanley was '' fearless , and could af - ford to be bold . ''

		Assuming no party badge , uttering no clamorous war-cry , fighting with his own sling and stone , he found few to stand beside him .

		Detesting , as
Arnold	PERSON	did and
Paul	PERSON	did , the spirit of party , there was danger that he might become '' a bigot against intol - erance . ''

		Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	says that he did ; but the epigram is not quite just .

		Stanley would allow no diversities of temper or opinion to sever him from anyone who followed Christ , as the Way , the Truth , and the Life .

		When Dr.
Liddon	PERSON	and Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	would hardly own that
Maurice	PERSON	and
Jowett	PERSON	and
Stanley	PERSON	were dis - ciples of their Christ , still
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	urgently of - fered them the pulpit of the Abbey to freely preach their Gospel .

		His charity could span all chasms of opinion .

		He had no doubt that truth would prevail .

		In
1849	DATE	Bishop
Stanley	PERSON	died , sincerely mourned throughout his diocese .

		His son had learned to honor a father with whom he had not overmuch in common . ''

		The crash , the gloom , the uprooting , and the void '' left by the death were at first overwhelming .

		Stanley for a season was driven forth from his books into practical business cares for his mother and sis - ters in the breaking up of their home , and learned '' to sympathize more than ever before with the working part of the world in every - day life . ''

		The burden soon grew heavier .

		Within three months both his brothers died , and , succeeding to the small family estate , he could no longer hold his fellowship .

		He had just declined the deanery at
Carlisle	LOCATION	.

		He was presently glad to accept the post of
Canon	ORGANIZATION	at
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, and make his home there for half a dozen years .

		Before this , all
England	LOCATION	was shaken with the
Gorham	PERSON	controversy .

		For Stanley it was not a question of the meaning of baptism , but of the right of his clerical brethren to resist a test imposed by a Bishop without color of law , and the larger question still , should the English Church be rent and a large body of its devoted clergy be driven forth from it .

		He took his ar - dent part in the struggle , fighting , as always , for what he believed to be liberty and peace .

		But he recognized that '' no man ever threw himself into controversy without regretting the plunge . '' ''

		I have had some misgivings , '' he wrote , `` about my article -LSB- in the ''
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' -RSB- .

		I fear St.
John	PERSON	would hardly have approved of it '' ; and '' I am a real St.
John	PERSON	's man , '' he might have added , in the words of our own Muhlenburg .

		Yet St.
John	PERSON	was at times nota - bly plain of speech .

		There are junctures when charity does not forbid even an apostle to say `` thou fool '' or `` this is the deceiver and the antichrist . ''

		Stanley 's conscience was a sensi - tive organ .

		How droll his scruples must seem to some modern hammerers of heresy , who , shar - ing the temper of the Puritans without their convictions , are ready to hew Agag in pieces before the Lord , in the columns of church newspapers !

		So intense is their zeal for the inspiration of the Bible that they even trans - mute its warnings into examples , and when it says , as in the ninth commandment for exam - ple , '' Thou shalt not , '' reply thankfully '' I will , Lord . ''

		It were not strange if
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's gen - tle tolerance should supply them a fresh occa - sion to blaspheme .

		From this time on ,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's life at Can - terbury from
1851	DATE	to
1857	DATE	, at
Oxford	LOCATION	as Pro- fessor of Ecclesiastical History until
1863	DATE	, and for the eighteen years that followed at West -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 137 minster , was mainly that of the ardent stu - dent and brilliant writer of
Church History	ORGANIZATION	.

		There were frequent episodes of travel , there were dashes into the arena of Convocation , there were the diversions of society .

		He accom - panied the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	to
Egypt	LOCATION	and Pal - estine .

		He married the
Duke of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	in the Imperial Chapel at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	.

		He visited
America	LOCATION	, and was the guest of
Phil	PERSON	- lips
Brooks	PERSON	.

		But mainly he was scholar and author .

		Having written the best religious biog - raphy in our language , he proceeded to write brilliant volumes upon
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	as its
Canon	ORGANIZATION	and upon Westminster as its Dean .

		He wrote the best volume extant in English upon Sinai and Palestine .

		He wrote luminous lectures on the
Eastern Church	ORGANIZATION	and the Scottish Church , and traced the whole course of Hebrew history from
Abraham	LOCATION	to the Maccabees , treading in
Ewald	ORGANIZATION	's steps and anticipating some of
Kenan	PERSON	's conclusions .

		He made the Old Testament a living book .

		Men of all schools profit by his labors .

		His volumes , with their clear , rich , flowing style , and wealth of illustration , have become classics .

		Everybody helps himself to their contents without shame , knowing that the theft will be recognized , condoned , and im - itated .

		Those who regard their author as anath - ema still illuminate their sermons with his glowing descriptions , and pay unwilling tribute to his fame .

		For a few years the Dean 's life at West - minster was brightened by a late but most for - tunate marriage .

		Then the brief blessing was withdrawn , and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, the lonelier for the experience of a perfect companionship , lived on and labored on , somewhat wearily .

		Loving friends ministered to him .

		Travel and society more or less dulled his pain .

		It was after his wife 's death that he visited this country , and found a tonic influence in -LRB- what
Bryce	PERSON	noted afterwards -RRB- the special hopefulness of Amer - ican life .

		But his work was done .

		The causes he had championed had won their way .

		Men spoke their thought with freedom and were tolerant of differences that once had sharply divided them .

		The progress of the higher crit - icism had made what had been heresies received opinions .

		The Bible which he loved , the He - brew history which he had illuminated , were become more familiar and more precious for his labors .

		Their inspiration was altogether unimpaired , though he had brushed away the dust and cobwebs from the covers of the sacred volume and recognized the existence of fly - specks on its ancient and precious pages .

		The Church of
England	LOCATION	was the less imperilled be - cause he had done his best to lift its life a little above the moods of party ; to interpret its formularies largely , in the spirit rather than the letter ; to draw representatives of opposed opinions into a bond of peace ; to free church - men from the overbearing weight of hard ec - clesiasticism ; to uphold the Living Spirit against spectres evoked from the darkest ages of Christian history ; to point courageously forward , not with melancholy backward , for the ideal of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		What a rich life it had been rich in love and honors , in service and reward !

		The boy who won all hearts and all the prizes , kept on winning them to the end .

		The Queen 's friend , the favored guest of princes , the cherished com - panion of scholars and men of letters , won the devotion of the working-men , whom he loved to lead through the aisles of the
Abbey	LOCATION	, interpret - ing as they went its monuments and descant - ing on its history .

		Did he ever make an en - emy ?

		If he did , he probably soon converted him into a friend .

		Canon
Wordsworth	PERSON	pro- tested against his appointment as Dean of Westminster .

		He avenged himself by paying tribute in his earliest sermon to good work which the protesting
Canon	ORGANIZATION	had done .

		His Chapter sometimes opposed him , but they could not make him quarrel with them .

		He respected their consciences , while asserting firmly the right of his own .

		He had his faults , like other men .

		He be - wailed his `` fatal irresolution , '' but it only dis - turbed himself and his inner circle .

		He per - haps loved peace even idolatrously , and in his concern for charity risked seeming indifference to truth .

		He would refuse to see the great gulf fixed between him and those over against him , which narrower eyes saw very well .

		He too much identified the English Establishment with the
Church of Christ	ORGANIZATION	.

		His ministry was more to the Church at large than to individual men .

		An aristocrat by temper and circumstance , he was more optimistic than if his lot had been less favorably cast .

		He was curiously dependent upon others in all his minor habitudes .

		There was a '' quaint , pathetic helplessness '' about him , half vexing , half endearing .

		With all his gentleness he was pugnacious , and thought peace worth seeking at the cannon 's mouth .

		But he enriched the life and literature of his time .

		In all his encounters he never dodged , nor struck an unfair blow .

		He spared his en - emies , he championed his friends .

		Those who scarce confessed him a disciple were won by 138 THE DIAL his works , though they had been frightened by his words .

		The churches of all English speak - ing lands are the better for his living .

		The heresies of the hour become the orthodoxy of the ages .

		The memory of
Arthur Penrhyn Stanley	PERSON	will endure and be precious so long as men love and value tolerance and peace .

		And some do still .

		THE MYTHICAL , WELSH DISCOVERY or
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* f The question of the Welsh discovery of
America	LOCATION	has engaged the attention of the pub - lic more or less for the last three hundred years .

		The theory was first enunciated by
Humphrey Lloyd	PERSON	, in the sixteenth century ; and since then there have been continually-recurring discus - sions of the subject , both in the native press of
Wales	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		In the exhaustive bibliography prepared by Mr.
Paul Barren Watson	PERSON	and published in the writer 's '' Amer - ica not Discovered by
Columbus	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Watson	PERSON	gives no less than fifty-one books and essays on '' Discovery by the Welsh '' ; and this list does not include the vast amount of literature on the subject which has appeared from time to time in
Wales	LOCATION	.

		The work of Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	was written for competition at the celebrated
Llangollen Eis	ORGANIZATION	- teddfod , held on
September 21 , 1858	DATE	, and the three following days .

		The subject for compe - tition was announced in these terms : '' For the best essay upon the
Discovery of America	ORGANIZATION	in the twelfth century by
Prince Madoc	PERSON	ap
Owain Gwynedd	LOCATION	, prize 20 and a silver star . ''

		Six essays were sent in , five of which assumed the truth of the Welsh tradition .

		In the remaining essay , under the assumed name of ''
Gwenerth Engydlym	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	, after presenting an almost exhaustive summary of the literature of the subject , and marshalling all the evidence usually cited for and against the Cambrian story , subjected them to a rigid criticism , and finally declared himself a disbeliever in the tale , '' How
Madoc	PERSON	from the shores of
Britain	LOCATION	spread The adventurous sail . ''

		It is this essay which is now given to the pub - lic in a sumptuous volume .

		The Eisteddfod committee to award the prize being aware of the existence of this negative essay , decided that , it being not on the Discovery but on the * AN ESSAY ON THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA BY MADOC AP
OWEN GWINEDD	PERSON	, in the
Twelfth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Thomas Stephens	PERSON	.

		Edited by
Llywarch Reynolds	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Long - mans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Non-discovery of
America	LOCATION	by
Madoc	PERSON	, it was not on the given subject , and must therefore be excluded from the competition .

		This led to a bitter contest , the echoes of which are still reverberating in the world 's press .

		The most competent member of the committee , the dis - tinguished scholar
Silvan Evans	PERSON	, resigned , and disgraceful scenes took place at the
Eisteddfod	LOCATION	.

		The fourth centenary celebration in honor of
Columbus	LOCATION	seemed an opportune time for giving the manuscript of Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	to the public ; and this has been done through the capable ed - itorship of Mr.
Llywarch Reynolds	PERSON	, the author having carefully revised the work before his death .

		The book is divided into three parts , the first presenting all the literature of the subject , and leaving the statements , without note or comment , to make their own impression on the reader ; the second passing in review the opin - ions of the various writers who have treated the subject pro and con , and thus exhibiting the impressions produced by the facts upon other minds ; and the third giving a critical discus - sion of the whole subject by the author .

		By this method there is of course involved no lit - tle diffuseness , the same facts being marshalled for three different purposes ; but the result is that the subject is discussed in all its bearings , and the treatment made absolutely exhaustive .

		A personal reference at this point may be per - mitted .

		In
1874	DATE	, when 1 prepared my little book on the Norse disco vei * y of
America	LOCATION	in the tenth and eleventh centuries , I had examined , though rather superficially , some of the writers who held the discovery of Madoc to be a dem - onstrated fact ; and while I had no means of making a thorough study of ' the question , I came to look upon the Welsh claim as not only possible but even probable , and accordingly stated in that work that '' It is generally be - lieved , and not without reason , that the ances - tors of the Welsh , under the leadership of
Madoc	ORGANIZATION	, made a settlement in this country about the year
1170	DATE	. ''

		But after reading Mr.
Ste	PERSON	- phens 's exhaustive work , with its overwhelming weight of argument , I am bound to revise my former opinion , and to say that he has not left a single shred of supposed evidence unrefuted .

		I believe no candid reader can rise from the perusal of '' Madoc '' with any other impression than that the story is not founded on facts .

		The supposed discovery is not an historic nar - rative , but merely a legend which has had its day and must henceforth be put in its proper place in the list with the Welsh '' Mabinogion . ''

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 The Welsh , on whose minds the
Madoc	PERSON	story has taken a firm hold and has had all the force of a patriotic sentiment , should not regret that it has at length been effectually relegated to the domain of fiction .

		Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	's work , with all its iconoclasm , shows that the Welsh race pos - sesses men capable of self-analysis and histor - ical criticism .

		And , indeed , the Welsh have an abundance of other things of which they may well be proud .

		They speak one of the parent languages of the world , a language which holds an enviable position in comparative philology .

		They have an ancient literature , which scholars in every land are translating and illustrating .

		They have an honorable history , much of which yet lies hid in bardic materials .

		The Welsh furnished the
Norman Trouveres	PERSON	with the ma - terial for the Arthurian and British romances .

		Spenser found among the Welsh the materials for `` The Faerie Queen '' ; and without Welsh traditions Shakespeare could not have written his immortal '' Lear '' or '' Cymbeline . ''

		While Welshmen can lay no claim to the glories and renown that belong to
Leif Erikson	PERSON	and Co - lumbus as discoverers of
America	LOCATION	, they have secured many a place of honor in the annals of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The clinging to the
Madoc	PERSON	legend in the future can only tend to lower Welshmen 's reputation as truthful men , and thus injure their credit as a people of sterling worth .

		Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	's verdict must be ac - cepted as final .


RASMUS B. ANDERSON	PERSON	.

		REMBRANDT AGAIN .

		* The oft-told story of Agassiz reconstructing the skeleton of a rare fish from one small bone brought to him by a fisherman , is applicable to the new life of Rembrandt by
Emile Michel	PERSON	.

		There are only one or two bones in the whole life of Eembrandt , but
M. Michel	PERSON	has made a complete skeleton from them , and not only put blood and brains into it , but has clothed it with moral , social , and religious qualities .

		Unfor - tunately ,
M. Michel	PERSON	's historic method is not so satisfying as
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's scientific method ; and the reader may indulge in some doubts about the basic statements which start as guesses and finally end up as un controverted facts . ''

		Perhaps '' Rembrandt learned a great deal about Bible story from his mother 's knee ; but * REMBRANDT : His Life , His Work , and His Time .

		By
Emile Michel	PERSON	.

		From the French by
Florence Simmonds	ORGANIZATION	.

		Edited by
Frederick Wedmore	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		because he painted his mother with a Bible in her hand , in lieu of some other book , is not sufficient proof to warrant any such inference , or to account for the fact that Rembrandt so often painted Bible stories in his pictures .

		Would
M. Michel	PERSON	argue that all painters who painted religious pictures were '' pious brought up '' at their mothers ' knee , we wonder ?

		And if the argument hold good , why was not Rem - brandt 's mother a pagan Greek teaching Greek mythology to her son , since he painted myth - ological as well as Biblical subjects ?

		There are a great string of these '' perhapses '' and '' probablys '' running through the first volume , which are interesting enough as speculations , but the pity of them is that the next writer of a Rembrandt life will put them down as ab - solute facts , and in a few years we shall have a house-of-cards history of Rembrandt that will eventually have to be knocked down just as
M. Michel	PERSON	has knocked down the Rembrandt his - tories of the past .

		That is the way history and biography are made , and it accounts very well for the continual re-making that has been go - ing on since the world began .

		And , after all , what is the use of all this study into the minutiae of a life like Rem - brandt 's ?

		People are interested in him as a painter , not a man of the world .

		His was not a life of action , or of any great social or polit - ical importance .

		He was not a
Napoleon	LOCATION	, a Mirabeau , or even a romantic
Anton	PERSON	ello da
Messina	LOCATION	, or a travelled Rubens .

		His life was quiet , sedate , and thoroughly Dutch , not dif - fering essentially from that of his contempo - raries .

		Born of middle-class parents , at Ley - den , in
1606	DATE	, he was the fifth of six children .

		We know nothing of his boyhood , and little more of his education .

		He was sent to the uni - versity , but at fifteen he had decided to become a painter and was a pupil of Swanenburch .

		In
1624	DATE	he went to
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, and for about six months was a pupil of
Lastman	PERSON	.

		This ended his apprenticeship at painting ; and as for his skill as an etcher , no one knows who taught it to him or whether he just picked it up through native genius .

		He returned to
Leyden	LOCATION	, estab - lished himself as an independent artist , and soon rose to fame , money , and some pupils .

		Then , in
1631	DATE	, he went back to
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, to live there permanently and to become the people 's painter of the time .

		In
1634	DATE	he mar - ried
Saskia van Uylenborch	PERSON	, a young woman of better family and more money than he pos - sessed , with whom he lived happily up to the time of her death .

		In
1639	DATE	he bought , and 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, fitted up with many objects of art , the much - talked-about house in the Breestraat .

		He was then at the height of his fame , making money and spending it lavishly , devoted to his art and his wife , and to all appearance serenely happy .

		In
1642	DATE	Saskia died , leaving Rembrandt a year - old son , Titus , and the bulk of her property , which was considerable .

		From that time began the decline of his fame and his prosperity , but not of his art .

		He worked on in the Breestraat house , and took for a mistress and model his house-servant ,
Hendrickje Stoffels	PERSON	.

		Careless - ness and extravagance in money matters fol - lowed , and in
1656	DATE	he was declared a bank - rupt and sold out of house and home the art collections going for a song to the Jews and hawkers .

		He then wandered from pillar to post about
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, domiciled in various places , and protected from his creditors in a measure by the efforts of Titus and
Hendrickje	PERSON	.

		About 1664 Hendrickje died , and in
1668	DATE	Ti - tus too passed away .

		The painter , outclassed in popular esteem by the peddling little men of the paint-brush who had arisen , steeped in pov - erty and comparative obscurity , aged and quite forsaken , at last gave up the struggle and died in
1669	DATE	.

		Such are the bare facts of a commonplace life ; and the only thing that makes them at all interesting to us is that this life was led by one of the greatest painters of any time or country .

		Undoubtedly his sorrows and trials had their effect upon his art , for he was a man of much feeling , and herein lies the answer to our previous question and the chief value of
M. Michel	ORGANIZATION	's extensive researches .

		He has fol - lowed chronologically Rembrandt 's life and work , showing his varying styles of art and their probable origin in the varying circum - stances of his life .

		Some of this is strained in inference to the breaking point , and still more is mere over-subtile conjecture ; but it is read - able , and often suggestive .

		There is .

		matter more pertinent in the discussion of dates , and attributions , and all that , because
M. Michel	PERSON	had the pictures to work from .

		Besides this , the author has brought together an exhaustive mass of shrewd criticism reviewing every im - portant work that Rembrandt ever etched or painted , and illuminating it not only by the text , but by a vast number of plates and repro - ductions .

		Probably no one was better qualified to do this work than
M. Michel	PERSON	.

		He was in perfect sympathy with his subject before he began to write , had studied it for years , was surrounded and saturated with
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's art , and from the art drew the character of the man .

		If his sympathy has sometimes made him a partisan , it is not to be wondered at , since his cause was a good one .

		For
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	was a remarkable man in the annals of art , a superb etcher and a su - preme painter , whose like it is not probable we shall see again .

		Primarily he was a portrait painter .

		The single figure was more consonant with his art-methods than the composed group .

		That was probably due to several causes .

		He was no lover of the traditional or academic , and never followed school formulae in compo - sition to any extent .

		His composition was his own , and it was sometimes good and sometimes bad .

		He had not a particle of what has been called '' style , '' had no care for line as line , and was uniquely individual in the picturesque * With peculiar methods that became dominant in his art and were opposed to classic compo - sition , he often distorted lights and shadows , and built up certain portions of a composition by dragging down other portions ; and this , while a forceful method of procedure with the single figure , as his portraits attest , was not perhaps the best method of handling composed groups , as a number of his large figure-pieces attest .

		His mastery of light-and-shade rather militated against his composition , just as it bleached and often falsified his color .

		Fine in many instances as a colorist , he was prone to destroy the purity and value of tones by sub - ordination ; and , positive as he was in hand - ling , he at times lapsed into heaviness and inef - fectual kneading .

		Mentally , he was a man keen to observe , as - similate , and synthesize .

		His conception was localized with his own people - and time -LRB- he never built up the imaginary or followed
Italy	LOCATION	-RRB- , and yet into types taken from the streets and shops of
Amsterdam	LOCATION	he infused the very larg - est humanity through his inherent sympathy with man .

		Dramatic , even tragic , he was at times , and yet showed it less in vehement ac - tion than in passionate expression .

		He had a way of striking universal truths through the human face , a turned head , bent body , or out - stretched hand , that was powerful in the ex - treme .

		His people have great dignity and character , and we are made to feel that they are types of the Dutch race people of sub - stantial physique , slow in thought and impulse , yet capable of feeling , comprehending , enjoy - ing , suffering .

		His landscapes , again , are a synthesis of all Dutch landscape , a grouping of the great truths of light , space , and air .

		THE DIAL 141 Whatever he turned his mind upon was treated with that breadth of view that overlooks the little and grasps the great .

		He painted many subjects , dating from
1627	DATE	to the time of his death , and at first was a little sharp in detail and cold in coloring .

		After
1654	DATE	he grew much broader in handling and warmer in coloring ; tending , toward the end of his life , to rather hot tones .

		His domestic troubles served only to heighten and deepen his art , and perhaps his best canvases were painted under stress of circumstances and in sadness of heart .

		His life is another proof , if needed , that the great - est truths and beauties are to be seen only through tears .

		Too bad for the man !

		but the world the same ungrateful , selfish world that has always lighted its torch at the funeral pyres of genius is the gainer .

		These two quartos are handsomely gotten up in the matter of paper , printing , and binding : and the upwards of three hundred illustrations are a mine in themselves , giving as they do the best of the master 's work .

		Both as a readable book and as a book of reference , no

		Mr.
Frederick Wedmore	PERSON	has edited it , and compiled for it several serviceable indexes , with knowl - edge and discrimination ; and the task of trans - lating from the French seems to have fallen into good hands .

		J OHN C > y AN DyKE > THE RELIGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES .

		* To inaugurate a series of denominational his - tories illustrative of the religious development of our country , Dr.
H. K. Carroll	PERSON	has under - taken to give , in a handsome octavo volume of 440 pages , entitled '' The Religious Forces of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' some of the results of his investigations on behalf of the
Eleventh United States Census	ORGANIZATION	.

		He anticipates to some extent the eleven volumes which are to follow his and give the history of twenty more or less flour - ishing religious denominations ; but , deriving his material wholly from the Census bulletins -LRB- not yet published -RRB- , his purpose is '' to describe and classify all denominations so as to give a clear idea of the character and strength of the religious forces of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		VOLUME I. , THE KEU - GIOUS FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES , Enumerated ,
Clas	PERSON	- sified and Described on the Basis of the
Government Census	ORGANIZATION	of
1890	DATE	.

		With an Introduction on the condition and character of
American Christianity	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
H. K. Carroll	PERSON	, LL.D. , in charge of
the Division of Churches	ORGANIZATION	,
Eleventh Census	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Christian Literature Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the author and compiler sets out upon the most interesting portion of his volume , the introduc - tion , embracing fifty-two pages and divided into fourteen sections , wherein , after sketching the effort made , amid the greatest difficulties , to develop the ecclesiastical department of the late Census , he comments upon the '' Variety in Religion , '' '' Denominational Titles , '' and the '' Causes of Division . ''

		He does this with con - siderable humor , though he furnishes much food for sober reflection for those whose minds are fixed upon the subject of
Christian Unity	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is to lighten the statistician 's labors by se - curing a scientific nomenclature , that Dr. Car - roll chiefly favors reunion ; and he drolly adds : '' And why such reunion has not taken place in scores of instances , I can not explain , except by the prevalence of the doctrine of the perse - verance of saints .

		It must be that the saints of the sects think they ought to persevere in sectarian division . ''

		One must needs have a well developed sense of humor to deal statistically , and without losing temper , with the difficulties presented in having to classify four distinct bodies of '' Brethren , '' popularly known as , yet disclaiming the name of , ''
Plymouth	LOCATION	Brethren '' -LRB- who can only be distinguished by the Roman numerals I. , II. , III. , IV . -RRB-

		, twelve varieties of Presbyterians , thirteen of Baptists , and seventeen of Method - ists .

		And among them all , the only denomi - national title which Dr.
Carroll	PERSON	finds to be really definitive is that of the '' Old Two-Seed - in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists . ''

		By re - ducing the one hundred and forty-three denom - inations he encounters to '' denominational fam - ilies , '' he still has forty-two such families on his hands , while we venture to assert that many of the members of these families would repu - diate the parentage he has assigned to them .

		His attempt to create a '' Catholic '' family to include the Roman Catholics , the Greek Cath - olics -LRB- Uniates -RRB- , the Russian Orthodox , the
Greek Orthodox	ORGANIZATION	, the Armenians , the Old Cath - olics , and the Reformed Catholics , and leaving out the `` Protestant Episcopalians '' -LRB- who daily assert their belief in the
Holy Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, and frankly admit that if their church be not Catholic it has 110 right to exist -RRB- , is a curious blunder .

		As might be expected , Dr.
Carroll	PERSON	brings to light many religious curiosities .

		He includes in his Census Report one denomination with as few as twenty-five members ; and with re - luctance excludes one with twenty-one members , because unorganized , its twenty-one members 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, being in three different States .

		If the author 's ability to maintain such absolute impartiality , in his dealing with the various denominations , as not to betray his sympathy with any partic - ular one , were the grounds upon which the Superintendent of the
Eleventh Census	ORGANIZATION	made choice of Dr.
Carroll	PERSON	to take charge of the Divi - sion of Churches , the choice is fully justified by the book before us .

		But there are other indications of the wisdom of the selection ; and while we await the appearance of the Census Report , this summary furnishes some racy as well as some more serious -LRB- though always en - tertaining and instructive -RRB- reading .

		ARTHUR
HOWARD NOLL	PERSON	.

		THE FRESHEST VOICE AMOXG LATIN POETS .

		* English students of Catullus have hitherto been dependent chiefly on the two learned and costly volumes of Mr.
Robinson Ellis	PERSON	.

		For class-room use there has been available a se - verely sifted selection of the most proper verses , with useful notes , by Mr.
F. P. Simpson	PERSON	, in the ugly little scarlet covers of
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's Classical Series .

		There was a strongly-felt need for a complete edition of moderate size and agreeable form .

		We think Professor Mer - rill 's work will satisfactorily fill this need .

		It is especially pleasant to welcome an edition of a classic , by an American scholar , which is neither '' based on '' nor translated from any German book .

		This pleasure has , unhappily , the added charm of extreme rarity .

		Mr.
Mer	PERSON	- rill has also the courage of his individuality , and usually prefers to state his own under - standing of his author , rather than to compile from earlier editors .

		Further , he appreciates the fact that Catullus lives as a poet , and as such he interprets him , with sympathy and hearty interest .

		Of course the requirements of a school-book , and especially of a series , set limits to this latter quality of an editor , but it shines through in frequent brief comments and especially in the cautious reconstruction of Catullus 's life and poetic development , which fills pp .

		xii.-xxxvi .

		It is well known that we are dependent for this poet upon copies of a single old MS. which was discovered early in the fourteenth century , and subsequently disappeared again .

		Pro- fessor
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	gives -LRB- pp. 227-263 -RRB- a careful * CATULLUS .

		By
Elmer T. Merrill	PERSON	, of
Wesleyan University	ORGANIZATION	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		list of the readings in the two oldest of these copies , from which he evidently believes alt others are in turn derived .

		That will appar - ently suffice , at least for all who accept this theory as to the younger copies : which theory is , however , vigorously combatted by Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	in the last edition of his work .

		Almost any col - lege student will doubtless be more than satis - fied with this much apparatus criticus .

		The book is , then , timely , attractive , and apparently by a competent hand .

		It is likely to restore Catullus to college curricula , much more widely than he is now read .

		This is a pleasant prospect , for his voice is far more di - rect , genuine , human , so to speak , than any other that has reached us from the Roman world .

		As has been said of him before , he also represents , more fully than perhaps any other poet , what youth can accomplish and what it can not .

		He arouses in almost every youthful reader a feeling which the other Latin poets rarely call forth : enthusiastic sympathy .

		All this gives us the better right to qualify our welcome with frank criticism of certain minor details .

		We find no statement at all of the relation of this edition to its predecessors .

		But
Ellis	PERSON	, in particular , like Mayor for Juvenal and
Munro	PERSON	for
Lucretius	PERSON	, has so preempted Catullus in a monumental work , that an English editor should at least either acknowledge a heavy in - debtedness , or claim independence in explicit words .

		There are valuable German investi - gations -LRB- like those of
Schwabe	PERSON	-RRB- which Pro- fessor
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	undoubtedly utilized largely , and also useful school editions -LRB- by
Riese	PERSON	and others -RRB- which he should have consulted .

		If this silence is a rule of the series , so much the worse .

		Certain qualities of Catullus his audacity , his fiery rebelliousness against authorities and dignitaries , his irrepressible sense of the gro - tesque , his fury in love and hate , are so om - nipresent that no poem , no line , can be safely interpreted where they are left out of the ac - count .

		Few among our expounders of the classics are fitted by age and temper to appre - ciate such qualities fully .

		Perhaps Professor Merrill does not always give them due weight .

		Thus , on the famous poem of seven lines de - voted to
Marcus Cicero	PERSON	-LRB- c. 49 -RRB- , we are told with full assurance : '' It is , however , mistak - enly understood by many critics to be iron - ical in tone . ''

		We venture to assert that every wide-awake lad who reads those seven verses , or has ever read them , joins in the grin they were meant to call forth .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 And first , a priori .

		Did Catullus ever else - where show respect , simple and sincere respect , to anyone ?

		To the greatest generals and po - litical powers e. g. ,
Pompey	PERSON	and
Caesar	PERSON	?

		The terrible scars left by the verses of No. 29 are the answer .

		Or to his dearest friends and to himself ?

		The foul and extravagant figures of 28 lie close at hand .

		To the woman that had dominated his life ?

		Here it is surely needless to quote . ''

		Odi et amo '' he could say , if ever any soul incarnated might .

		The meaning of tc Diligo '' he never learned .

		What father can read without something like disgust , remembering what the loves of Catullus and
Clodia	PERSON	had really been , his worse than auda - cious words : '' Then my regard for thee Was such as is a father 's for his sons ! ''

		That Catullus 's poems were circulated when written , can be proved , if need be , from Sue - tonius 's statement : ''
Caesar	PERSON	, conscious that he was himself indelibly branded by the verses , '' etc. .

		The '' catchy '' heudecasyllables of the audacious young Provincial were surely laughed over in clubs , if not set to music and sung in the streets .

		Thus the poem No. 21 has no other purpose than to call down ridicule upon a rival in love : ''
Aurelius	PERSON	, sire of starvelings thou , Nor only those existing now , Of all who lived in ages gone , Or shall until the years are done . ''

		-LRB- The rest is abusive words which our speech can not render . -RRB-

		Shortly after , in a brief poem to the young Juventius , over whose charms the quarrel with
Aurelius	PERSON	had arisen , he repeats the refrain : '' Of all Juventii thou ` rt the flower : Nor only of this present hour : Of all who lived in ages gone , Or shall until the years are done . ''

		-LRB- And a rival is assailed , somewhat less coarsely , in the few remaining verses of this poem also . -RRB-

		With another day comes a less reprehensible grievance . ''

		What injury has the great orator done you , Catullus ? '' ''

		He has tried to pa - tronize the impecunious young Transpadane , a thing no man shall ever do !

		And the town shall hear me thank him ! ''

		To cut off all doubt , the freshest voice among Latin poets chooses to employ a third time the tag all
Rome	LOCATION	knew by heart : '' Most eloquent ,
Marcus Tullius	PERSON	, Art thou of the sons of Romulus ; Of all who lived in ages gone , Or shall until the years are done .

		Catullus thanks you heartily : The wretchedest of poets he ; As far of poets wretchedest , As thou ` rt of all men patron best . ''

		As evidence that in private , at least , among the enlightened , the absurd side of the Rom - ulus-myth was appreciated and familiarly han - dled , we need only cite
Cicero	PERSON	's own expression -LRB-
Atticum	LOCATION	, act II .

		1-8 -RRB- : '' Cato talks as though we were living in
Plato	LOCATION	's Utopia , and not , as we are , in the rogue 's asylum of Romulus . ''

		-LRB- Jeans . -RRB-

		As to `` pessimus poeta '' our editor says : '' Catullus also speaks of himself with excess - ive modesty in addressing his patron Nepos in I. '' Well , yes .

		He makes his bow to his ma - ture , eminent , learned friend -LRB- not without a mocking sigh over the learning -RRB- : '' This dainty little hook and new , Just polished with the pumice , who Shall now receive ?

		Cornelius , you ! ''

		For these my trifles even then You counted of some value , when You only of Italian men '' Into three volumes dared to cast The story of all ages past : Learned , oh
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	, and vast ! ''

		Perhaps there is a touch of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's royal mod - esty , as he slips the little roll into
Nepos	PERSON	' hand , '' So take it , prize it as you may '' ; but the murmured prayer as he turns , '' And , gracious virgin , this I pray : That it may live beyond our day ! ''

		is surely a far cry from `` pessimus poeta '' is less blunt than the assurance of
Catullus	ORGANIZATION	's distant kinsman , `` Nennt man die grossten Namen , So wird auch der meine genannt , '' but Catullus , like
Heine	PERSON	, sinned little through self - depreciation .

		Possibly modest
Mark Tully	PERSON	smiled indulgently , and thought the compli - ment not ill-turned ; but certainly the bad boys laughed so loudly , perhaps , that even pater patriot had an uneasy suspicion , as he passed on , that the fast young cantores Euphorionis sometimes made game of pompous dignitaries .

		But we have a more serious final exception to take .

		Catullus , of all men , never hesitated to say what he meant .

		It is perilous for a commentator to assume that he does not mean the thing he says .

		Exempli gratia : the poem in honor of the yacht which had brought her master safe home from the
Black Sea	LOCATION	is a general favorite .

		Now this voyage may have been in 56
B. c. Catullus	PERSON	's death is generally set about 54 , though only because no later al - lusions can be positively cited from his poems .

		Dean
Smith	PERSON	has discussed this poem in '' Har - vard Studies '' -LRB- Vol .

		III . -RRB-

		, with great inge - nuity and thoroughness .

		He insists that the craft could not be spoken of as '' growing old '' 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, only two or three years after her first voyage .

		Alas , the Dean surely never owned a yacht , then !

		Again , the voyage began at Amastris on the
Euxine	LOCATION	; while in another poem
Catul	PERSON	- lus takes leave of his fellow-officers at
Nicaea	LOCATION	, two hundred and fifty miles nearer home .

		This is as if an Englishman returning home from
Bangor	LOCATION	should take ship at
New York	LOCATION	!

		Hence Professor
Smith	PERSON	puts the voyage back into the generation before the poet , assigning it to some roving friend of
Catullus	ORGANIZATION	's father .

		The chief objection to all this is that it destroys the only sentiment and significance the poem ever had .

		Professor Merrill praises , and rejects , this presentation by his editor-in-chief , and puts forth another theory , presumably a new one .

		The poem , he tells us , is a dedicatory inscrip - tion , written not for the real yacht , but for a miniature model thereof , consecrated in a tem - ple of Castor and Pollux , as a thank-offering .

		Both scholars deny that the poet could have brought his vessel home to his beloved
Sermi	PERSON	- one on the
Lago di Garda	ORGANIZATION	, because it would have been extravagant , and Catullus came home from
Bithynia	LOCATION	poor .

		As to the sentiment of the matter , I appeal with confidence to lovers of poetry and of yachting .

		But on matters of fact , we have just one source of information : the verses of Cat - ullus .

		He does jest elsewhere of his purse-full of cobwebs , of his mean and stingy commander - in-chief in the
Orient	LOCATION	, etc. .

		But the poverty of this lord of several country-seats , this leader of young
Rome	LOCATION	, is of the jaunty and gentlemanly sort .

		Of course his income is narrow .

		He craves a fortune to fling away on a banquet , an amour , a pearl .

		Catullus clung to his Italian promontory especially when far away from it .

		He loved that yacht at least in retrospect .

		He would have them together .

		It would be costly , difficult , unheard of , to work her up the Po and Mincio to
Garda	LOCATION	?

		Reasons enough , surely , these , why the thing must be done !

		What old Assian , staid and stout and come to forty year though he be , would not give more than he can afford to see the dear unmanageable old Mezethra rot - ting at a Yankee wharf-side , instead of by the mole of Mitylene ?

		But the poet was rarely at home on
Sermi	PERSON	- one , rarely at leisure to sail when there ; and
Garda	LOCATION	was but a landlocked millpond to the craft built to brave the Pontus 's storms and the cliffs of the Propontis .

		And so '' Senet quiete '' '' In peace she 's growing old . ''

		If he built a shrine to the Sailors ' Friends upon his windy promontory , and , anchoring under its shadow , dedicated his craft to them , she was so much the safer and fitter to bear the '' pious bard . ''

		This , we submit ,
Catullus	ORGANIZATION	says plainly enough .

		Who shall correct him ?


WILLIAM C. LAWTON	PERSON	.

		RECENT FICTION .

		* Among the novels accumulated during the past few weeks there is no difficulty in selecting the one that stands out above all the others , and comes as near to being a masterpiece as this degenerate age of English fiction will permit any novel to do .

		And , strange to say , although written in English , it is not the work of an English novelist at all , but of that genial Dutchman who calls himself ''
Maar	PERSON	- ten Maartens , '' and whose name was absolutely unknown to the literary public of four years ago .

		`` The Greater Glory '' is an ambitious work , but in performance it justifies both the scale upon which it was planned and the aims which it sought to ac - complish .

		Let us hasten to say , lest the words just used should be misunderstood , that the story is not didactic in any narrow or obtrusive sense , but that it merely exhibits the moral purpose of all great fiction , and seeks to set the realities of life over against the conventions and the shams , to contrast its superficial aspects with its profound inner sig - nificance .

		Readers of `` God 's Fool '' will remem - ber how effectively the author had already pui -- sued this method , how distinctly he had kept this contrast in view .

		`` The Greater Glory '' produces the same general impression , and has the advantage * THE GREATER GLORY .

		THE DIAL 145 of dealing with more natural conditions .

		There was a trace of the repulsive in the former story , and the attention of its readers was too much di - verted by the curious psychological questionings that could not fail to be suggested by the character of the reine Thor who was the hero .

		The hero of '' The Greater Glory '' has all five of his senses , and is none the less a hero in the spiritual sense .

		Lov - able in childhood as in manhood , his growth from the one stage to the other is depicted with subtle psychological insight .

		As for the
Baron	PERSON	, with his old - world notions of faith and duty and honor , we pity the reader who can stand by his deathbed with un - dimmed eyes , or without feeling the better for having lived with him .

		He is instinctively enshrined in the memory along with Colonel
Newcome	PERSON	and the good Bishop of Hugo 's best known novel . ''

		The Greater Glory '' is far from being a perfect work of fiction there are few such in the world and its defects are easily discernible .

		It is confused in structure , and its architectural analogue would be some irreg - ular Gothic cathedral with unrestrained grotesque ornamentation .

		In style , also , it is lacking , being over-colloquial and addicted to mannerism .

		But it gives us such a picture of manners and morals as only the greater novelists are capable of drawing , and it is informed throughout with a nobility of sentiment that makes of it a singularly helpful and wholesome piece of literature .

		Is there something in the atmosphere of the
Ba	ORGANIZATION	- learic Islands to stimulate the imagination and in - cite to the spinning of wild and preposterous yarns ?

		Twice within a few months we have read novels having their scene in those islands , and in each case the plot has been something distinctly out of the common . ''

		The Recipe for Diamonds '' was , ac - cording to Mr.
Cutcliff	PERSON	e Hyne , formulated by no less distinguished a character than
Raymond Lully	PERSON	, and by him intrusted to the keeping of an underground Minorcan vault .

		To this spot certain modern ad - venturers , taking their cue from an ancient manu - script , were led , and the secret was caught by a pho - tographic plate .

		The original inscription being then destroyed , the undeveloped plate remained in sole possession , and this plate , unfortunately , lost the record forever by exposure .

		So the reader is left none the wiser for it all , and the adventurers get nothing for their pains but a small jar of diamonds , made by the aforesaid
Raymond Lully	PERSON	, and buried with the recipe as evidence that it had been a real working formula .

		This outline of the story gives but a slight notion of its exciting character , and no notion at all of the cleverness with which its char - acters and its incidents are fitted together .

		It is as good , in a way , as many of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's many in - ventions , and there is not a little art in its elaborate artlessness .

		It brings one into contact with life itself , which is a more worthy task than that of making reflections , however subtly analytical , about life .

		The reader may be assured that his interest will not be permitted to flag , if he once takes up the book for the amusement of an idle hour . ''

		Catharine Furze '' is a book written under the stress of religious emotion , and will appeal to the reflective mind .

		Yet it may hardly be described as a novel with a purpose , unless we admit as a pur - pose its tacit plea for the importance of the relig - ious motive as a determining factor in everyday life .

		It is a simple and depressing story of English village people and ways half a century ago .

		There is something of strength in its delineation of the titular character , and of one or two others , but the book claims more attention for its obvious sincer - ity than for any artistic quality of structure or char - acterization .

		In reading '' A Gray Eye or So '' one is struck by the lack of development in the characters .

		They are absolutely the same from first to last , although the narrative covers time enough to affect their des - tinies very materially , and although it is the privi - lege , if not the duty , of the novelist to foreshorten both in time and space .

		The gravest defect of the story is offered by the hero , who commits an act of unspeakable villainy quite out of keeping with the general tenor of his character .

		This is bad enough , and that he should have been forgiven for it is worse still .

		A pervasive element of dry satire contrib - utes not a little to the interest of this book , for it is interesting , although it must be condemned by any exacting standard of literary art .

		The con - trasted types , fixed though they are , supply an ex - cellent diversity , and the conversations are nearly always cleverly managed .

		If one will forget for an hour his critical standards , he may extract much entertainment from the book .

		Miss Harraden 's '' Ships that Pass in the Night '' is a novel , or rather a nouvelle , that is fairly de - serving of the success that it has already obtained .

		It is well-written , and excellent in characterization .

		There are but few figures on the canvas only two of any consequence and they are essentially vital in delineation .

		In the character of the hero ,
Miss Harraden	LOCATION	has attempted the task so triumphantly performed in
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	's '' Villette '' : that of leading us finally to understand and to admire a man who is at first , and to a superficial observer , almost repellant .

		Her title is suggested by the quatrain , '' Ships that pass in the
night	TIME	, and speak each other in passing , Only a signal shown , and a distant voice in the darkness ; So on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another , Only a look and a voice , then darkness again and silence . ''

		And it might almost equally well have taken for a text
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's more beautiful lines : '' Yes !

		in the sea of life enisled , With echoing straits between us thrown , Dotting the shoreless , watery wild , We mortals million live alone .

		The islands feel the enclasping flow , And then their endless bounds they know . ''

		Readers who can feel the pathos of either passage will understand the motive of Miss Harraden 's En - gadine idyl without reading it .

		We should not , however , advise them to take it thus vicariously , for it is well worth an hour 's attention .

		-LSB-
March 1	DATE	, A Woman of Forty '' is not , a priori , the most prepossessing of heroines , but
Miss Stuart	LOCATION	has made such a heroine interesting , although we are glad that the metal more attractive of a maiden less el - derly by half finally wins the day , and carries off the allegiance of the young
New Zealander	LOCATION	who is given us for a hero .

		The story is a very slight structure , not unpleasing as a sketch of English so - cial life , but written in a style that is often diffuse and slovenly .

		On the third page we find such a sentence as , '' They demeaned themselves to beg that their special pictures might be one of his ex - hibited portraits . ''

		One does not often trap so in - excusable a vulgarism and so gross a solecism within the limits of one brief phrase .

		Mrs.
Campbell-Praed	PERSON	's latest novel is an excit - ing but vastly improbable tale .

		The characters , from the Australian heroine to the least of her mimerous devoted admirers , are stilted and unnat - ural in most of their actions , and few of them suc - ceed in arousing either sympathy or respect .

		The padding of the book takes the form of drawing - room and dinner-table conversation , always on tap for the novelist of impoverished ideas ; and , con - sidered as mental food , about as satisfactory as sawdust to the physical appetite .

		Perhaps the best thing in this novel is the sketch of a fashionable
London	LOCATION	painter , whose conversation is a delightful burlesque of the jargon of his guild .

		Mr.
Battershall	PERSON	's story , `` A Daughter of the World , '' combines a psychological problem , a study in villainy , and a social sketch , and does not very happily weld together these disparate themes .

		Its leading motive remotely suggests Tourgue ` nieff 's '' Faust . ''

		The heroine is a young woman who has lost her mother in childhood , and who lives a se - cluded life with her father , in his country home .

		The latter , knowing his daughter to have inherited an unusually sensitive and emotional nature , seeks to secure for her a tranquil future by keeping her a child .

		With this object in view , he entrusts her education to a priest , who is really a disciple of Molinos and a mystic , who becomes her sole teacher and guide , and whose system is directed towards the one end of repressing her natural instincts , and of leading her in the ways of quietism .

		The plan bids fair to prove successful , when a disturbing ele - ment enters her life in the shape of a young man , whom first sympathy , and afterwards love , impels to save her from the consequences of this unnatural discipline .

		In this effort he is successful , but the outcome is not tragic , as in the Russian masterpiece that has been mentioned .

		The young woman , after a period of storm and stress , during which she dis - appears from view , becomes a successful singer , and in this character once more meets the man who stood at the turning-point of her life years before .

		The end is both natural and commonplace .

		We think the writer has weakened his story by super - adding upon its fundamental structure the stock situations and incidents that mostly make up the latter half of the book .

		We could spare both the villainy and the social complications that have been so incongruously attached to the promising central theme .

		The character of Father Axon , the mystic , is impressively presented , although with a certain tinge of the melodramatic that does not add to its strength .

		The hero is a somewhat colorless creatior , but the heroine is interesting enough to make up for his defects .

		One of the minor characters in
Miss Long	LOCATION	's `` Ap - prentices to Destiny '' is a woman who writes novels .

		Speaking of the problems of her profession , she re - marks : '' For one thing , there is the little fact that book-reviewers are mostly men and the readers mostly women .

		If you write with an eye to getting good notices your book is n't read , and if you write for readers the superior critics sniff at you . ''

		This is amusing , if exaggerated , but we ventui-e to con - tribute a trifle towards the disproof of the proposi - tion .

		For Miss Long 's story is clearly written for readers , even for the most feminine of them , yet far from us be the thought of `` sniffing '' at so clever and genuine a book .

		There are , indeed , two or three characters that are imperfectly developed , that have not been properly fitted into the economy of the structure , and there are some wordy pages that a more experienced writer would have condensed or omitted ; but Miss Long displays so unquestionable a talent for enjoyable and wholesome narrative that we are not disposed to carp at her defects .

		One of the characters , however , the woman who rejects the man whom she loves to marry him whom she ab - hors , we find hard to accept .

		The motives that might impel to such conduct are not distinctly enough displayed to make it seem reasonable .

		The book toys with socialism to a certain extent almost enough to make it a novel of tendency , but the dangerous fascination of that subject for generous and over-emotional minds has not , in the present case , precluded the other interests that are needful for variety 's sake , nor has it greatly distorted the writer 's sympathies from a just appreciation of the social problem .

		A volume of stories by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	easily takes precedence over any other collection of fiction in miniature likely to be included in a two months ' survey of current novelists ' work .

		There are six stories in Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's new volume , five of them
Cal	LOCATION	- ifornian , and the other Glaswegian -LRB- let us say -RRB- in theme .

		The Californian stories are a little thin , perhaps , but they have the incomparable freshness and interest that the author can give to the simplest sort of a tale .


Jack Hamlin	PERSON	and
Yuba Bill	LOCATION	are old friends of ours , and the other characters are of sufficiently familiar type . ''

		The Heir of the Mc - Hulishes '' is a story in which the author has turned to account his experiences as our consular represent - ative in
Scotland	LOCATION	, and his light sure touch is shown at its best in this delightful sketch .

		The stream of Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's stories , we have every reason to expect , may flow on forever , but Dr.

		THE DIAL 147
Doyle	PERSON	's stories , as far as they relate to one Sher - lock
Holmes	PERSON	, appear to have reached an end with the volume of '' Memoirs '' now published , for the artistic and imaginative detective finds his match at last in the person of a villain bearing the appropri - ate name of
Moriarty	LOCATION	.

		The cliff by the Swiss Falls of
Reichenbach	PERSON	are the scene of the closing catas - trophe , which ends the careers of both
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	and the only man who ever successfully outwitted him .

		The story of this disaster is the last of the dozen contained in the new volume , which is quite as thrilling as any of its predecessors .

		Apropos of this closing story , we notice that Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	has recently published an amusing skit , scare-headed as follows : '' The Late
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	.

		Sensational Arrest .

		Watson Accused of the Crime . ''

		The following is a characteristic ex - tract from Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	's jeu d ` esprit : '' The public can not have forgotten that
Holmes	PERSON	used to amuse himself in this room with pistol practice .

		He was such a scientific shot that one evening while Wat - son was writing he fired all round the latter 's head , shaving him by the infinitesimal part of an inch .

		The result is a portrait on the wall in pistol shots of
Watson	LOCATION	, which is considered an excellent likeness .

		It is under - stood that , following the example set in the Ardlamont case , this picture will be produced in court .

		It is also in contemplation to bring over the Falls of
Reichenbach	PERSON	for the same purpose . ''

		We may also hope , after all , that the rumor re - ported by Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	, according to which '' Mr.
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	, at the entreaty of the whole British public , has returned to Baker Street , and is at present solving the problem of ' The Adventure of the Novelist and His Old Man of the Sea , ' '' is not wholly without foundation .

		Of Mr.
Henry Harland	PERSON	's five stories , that which comes first on the title-page , ''
Mademoiselle Miss	PERSON	, '' far outranks the others .

		It is a variation upon the text , to the pure all things are pure , for it tells how an English girl , happily innocent of any other than Ollendorfian French , falls among a set of etudiants and etudiantes in a most disreputable pension of the
Latin Quarter	LOCATION	, lives with them in a joyous cama - raderie unsullied by the consciousness of any evil , and by her very artlessness subdues them into as devoted a band of worshippers as ever gathered about a pure girl 's shrine .

		The story is a little im - possible , but it is very charming .

		Of the others , '' The Funeral March of a Marionette '' is a char - acter study of some subtlety , and `` A Sleeveless Errand '' a semi-humorous sketch with a sadly cyn - ical moral .

		Seven of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's stories , each having its quota of delicious absurdities and matter-of-fact statements of the unexpected , make up a volume that can not fail to amuse .

		The story of ''
Asaph	PERSON	, '' the village loafer who works with his head , is irre - sistibly droll , and hardly less so is that of '' The Watchmaker 's Wife , '' who so unexpectedly comes down from the skies , or that of '' The Knife that Killed Po Hancy , '' and afterwards inoculates its possessor with the predacious instincts of its whilom owner .

		It would take a reader of unusual alertness to anticipate the twists and turns of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's fancy , or to forecast the outcome of one of his en - tertaining inventions .

		We have often wondered why the inimitable short stories of M. Ludovic HaleVy should have been missed by the busy tribe of translators .

		With the possible exception of '' La Famille Cardinal '' -LRB- which ought , perhaps , to be left in the original as an in - centive to the mastery of the French language , if not for other reasons -RRB- , they richly deserved putting into English , and we are glad that a selection of them has now been gracefully done by
Edith V. B. Matthews	PERSON	.

		Nine stories are included in this volume , which is one of the '' Odd Number '' series .

		We find , among others , `` Only a Waltz , '' `` The Most Beautiful Woman in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' '' The Insurgent , '' and `` In the Express . ''

		Professor
Brander	PERSON	Mat - thews supplies a brief introduction , which happily sketches the literary portrait of M. HaleVy , placing stress upon his dramatic faculty , his amiable irony , and his gentle optimism .

		The whole thing , introduc - tion and translation , is exceptionally well done , and the volume ought to prove the most popular of the series to which it belongs .

MOKTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Ancient authorship In these da y s o contention , perhaps as studied by a over-contention , about the relations modem publisher .

		o f p u bii s h e rs and authors , and their rights and wrongs as regards each other , it is pleas - ant to see one who has acquired experience and standing as a publisher essaying also the role of authorship , thus identifying himself , at least in feel - ing , with both classes , and by his widened range of sympathies and experience helping to bridge the gap that too often separates them or makes their attitudes antagonistic .

		In the case of Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, our present instance , there is little enough chance of disagreement , since the author is his own publisher , and the relations are presumably those of entire harmony ; yet the gain from broad - ened experience and standpoint must still be pres - ent .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	is already well known as a writer on copyright and other practical literary sub - jects ; and his present volume , '' Authors and Their Public in Ancient Times , '' is the expansion of a monograph by him in the cause of
International Copyright	ORGANIZATION	, to which he has been much devoted .

		The work is a complete and compendious history of authorship before the introduction of printing .

		Beginning with the earliest graphic forms of liter - ature , as traced in the tablets of baked-clay found by
Layard	PERSON	in the ruins of the palaces of Sennacherib and Asshurbanipal -LRB- Sardanapalus -RRB- in ancient Nin - eveh , he follows its later records in the papyri found in Egyptian tombs and preserved by the 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, Greeks when they had
Egypt	LOCATION	under their control , and thence traces its development onward through the more familiar achievements of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		This current of progress he follows step by step , until -LRB- the Hebrew and Christian literature inter - vening -RRB- the monkish rule cast its shadow over the stream , and classic glory was all but blotted out by the destroying hand of bigotry a hand strong , grimy , and relentless in its killing grasp .

		The record closes with the fifteenth century , when the invention of printing from movable types vanquished priestly hierarchy and put a stop to its avowed pol - icy of suppressing reason in the interests of blind faith ; and thus a new literature began its enduring sway , part of its task being to gather up and pre - serve the scattered fragments of the older writings .

		In this beneficent task , Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's book takes its modest but indispensable part .

		It covers a field hitherto unreaped or reaped but scantily , and offers many curious and suggestive results of the author 's research .

		The long struggle for the mere physical materials with which to perpetuate thought forms in itself a most interesting story .

		The baked-clay was awkward , crude , and cumbersome ; hieroglyphs on exposed surfaces are enduring only in the dry unchanging air of
Egypt	LOCATION	; papyrus has its season of decay , and its insect enemies ; parchment will mould , and mice will eat it ; brass plates are costly , and will rust at last .

		Only paper frail , perishable paper , the dried pulp of vegetable fibres forms man 's true dependence ; for its cheapness makes it plentiful , and by its plentifulness the copies of writ - ings become scattered far and wide , so that though one copy a year may perish , an edition of six thou - sand copies may endure for a period outlasting re - corded time .

		Other chapters in the history are not less interesting .

		They are often enlivened with anecdotes and pat quotations , of which the follow - ing is an illustration : '' ' You have not treated me fairly , ' writes
Alexander	PERSON	to
Aristotle	LOCATION	, ` in including with your published works the papers prepared for my instruction .

		For if the scholarly writings by means of which I was educated become the common property of the world , in what manner shall I be intellectually distinguished above ordinary mor - tals ? ''

		How , indeed ?

		might well be echoed by devotees of the modern `` limited edition . ''

		The method of treatment renders Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	's volume eminently readable , while the story that it tells gives one a new sense of the value of that best and cheapest thing in the world , a printed book .

		Dr.
William Frederick Poole	PERSON	, in ac - C6 P tin S the invitation of the North - western
University	ORGANIZATION	to deliver the Phi Beta Kappa address of
last June	DATE	, chose for his sub - ject `` The
University Library	ORGANIZATION	and the
University Curriculum	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The address is now published -LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in book form , and makes excellent reading , as those acquainted with THE DIAL hardly need to be told .

		Dr.
Poole	PERSON	could not write a dull page if he tried , and these particular pages are in his most vigorous and breezy manner .

		They open with a plea for the university study of books from a bibliographical point of view , which naturally leads to the question of finding room for such additional work .

		This gives the author an opportunity to assail existing methods , especially in the teaching of the classical languages .

		At this point the
Mather	PERSON	family are brought in , and their example does yeoman service for the argument .

		Within eighty years , eight of them were graduated from
Harvard	LOCATION	, having entered at the average age of less than thirteen .

		They all had to speak Latin as an entrance condition , and most of them spoke Greek and Hebrew as well .

		Cotton spoke all three when he entered college at the age of eleven and a half , and besides this '' he had composed many Latin treatises , had read
Cicero	LOCATION	,
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Virgil	PERSON	, and
Terence	PERSON	; had finished the Greek New Testament ; and had read portions of Homer and Socrates . ''

		More than six hundred books were printed by members of the Mather family , and -LRB- here the bibliophile appears -RRB- '' their cost in the markets of the world exceeds that of the writings of any other five families which have ever lived in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The substance of Dr.
Poole	PERSON	's charges against the clas - sical instruction of to-day is that Greek and Latin are not taught as living languages , but are made a sort of stalking-horse for the investigation of syn - tactical complexities and philological niceties .

		He probably goes too far in assuming that a language -LRB- ancient or modern -RRB- to be really known must be learned as a spoken language .

		We believe the speaking of a foreign language to be a mere knack , superadded upon the real knowledge obtained from its study , but hardly bringing a perceptible incre - ment of culture , or of penetration into the meaning of the language in question .

		But there are many ways of making a language seem dead to its stu - dents besides that of getting along without the du - bious aid of viva voce chatter , and it is against these ways in general that the author invokes the wrath of the
Goddess of Common Sense	ORGANIZATION	.

		At all events , Dr.
Poole	PERSON	is a stanch defender of the classics , and his reply to those who call them fetiches is , in sub - stance : Begin to study them earlier , and learn them more thoroughly than you now do .

		One other point in this address calls for a word of comment .

		The argument against existing college methods is rein - forced by some statistics of college attendance , which seem to show a decline in the ratio of stu - dents to total population .

		As far as Dr.
Poole	PERSON	's figures go they are substantially correct , but they do not go far enough .

		He gives figures for the pe - riod from
1840	DATE	to
1880	DATE	, showing a decline of nearly fifty per cent in college attendance relative to pop - ulation .

		He then adds : '' The disparity is doubt - less greater now . ''

		But a recent investigation of this subject made by Mr.
Merritt Starr	PERSON	shows a re - markable reaction .

		The decline in -LRB- relative -RRB- col - lege attendance kept on until
1887	DATE	, but since then there has been a steady annual gain , and the figures for
1892	DATE	bring the record up to the point that had been reached in
1860	DATE	.

		In a word , the losses of a
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 quarter-century have been offset by the gains of five years .

		Perhaps the moral of all this is that the more vital educational methods championed by Dr.
Poole	PERSON	already have a stronger hold upon the col - leges than he imagined , and that his attack is made upon a system already moribund , if not defunct .

		compact and read - That long-suffering person , the gen - abie compendia of eral reader , '' does not always have European history .

		> , / > .

		< j.v / * , reason to be grateful for the efforts made to supply his shelves with compendia of the world 's knowledge .

		But he should welcome the new series of volumes entitled '' Periods of European His - tory '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , for they will provide him if the names of their authors count for anything , and if the volume now published may be taken as a meas - ure of those to follow with a compact and readable narrative from the fall of the
Western Empire	ORGANIZATION	to the present time .

		The volume first published covers the period from 476 to 918 ; that is , to the accession to the German throne of Henry the
Fowler	PERSON	, which marked the turning-point in Teutonic -LRB- and conse - quently European -RRB- fortunes or misfortunes .

		Mr.
Charles Oman	PERSON	is the author of this volume , being peculiarly fitted for the task by his previous work as historian of the Byzantine Empire .

		Its special features are , perhaps , besides the attention paid to Byzantine annals , its account of the Lombard kings , and its story of the Mohammedan invasions of
Italy	LOCATION	and
Sicily	LOCATION	in the ninth century .

		If we may judge from this opening volume , English history is not to come within the scope of the work .

		At all events , there is hardly any mention of
Britain	LOCATION	in Mr.
Oman	PERSON	's pages .

		Professor Tout has undertaken the second volume , which will take us to the year
1272	DATE	.

		The others are in the hands of scholars almost equally well known .

		Mre essay * by Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	.

		We need scarcely bespeak a welcome f M
August	DATE	i ne
Birrell	PERSON	's latest sheaf of essays , '' Men , Women , and Books '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , an alluring little volume , gen - erally similar in form and contents to his '' Obiter Dicta '' and '' Res Judicatae . ''

		We own to a hearty liking for Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	for his wholesome views , for his neat and pointed way of putting them , and for his ability to say a sensible , even a wise , thing in a light and humorous way .

		In the present vol - ume there are in all nineteen titles , '' Dean Swift , '' `` Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, '' ``
Sterne	PERSON	, '' ``
John Gay	PERSON	, '' `` Hannah More , '' ''
Marie Bashkirtseff	PERSON	, '' '' Poets Laureate , '' etc. ; rather hackneyed themes some of them , but one does not mind that with Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	.

		The pa - per on
Hannah More	PERSON	, though a little caustic , is de - licious almost as good as
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author starts out by saying that
Hannah	PERSON	`` is one of the most detestable writers that ever held a pen , '' and that '' she flounders like a huge conger-eel in an ocean of dingy morality , '' after which he proceeds to depict the '' class '' to which she belonged : '' This class may be imperfectly described as ' the well-to-do Christian . '

		It inhabited snug places in the country , and kept an excellent ; , if not dainty , table .

		The money it saved in a ball-room it spent upon a green - house .

		Its horses were fat , and its coachman in - variably present at family prayers .

		Its pet virtue was church twice on
Sunday	DATE	, and its peculiar hor - rors theatrical entertainments , dancing , and three - penny points .

		Outside its garden wall lived the poor , who , if virtuous , were forever curtsying to the ground or wearing neat uniforms , except when ex - piring upon truckle-beds beseeching God to bless the young ladies of the Grange or the
Manor House	ORGANIZATION	, as the case might be . ''

		In another paper Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	says a few sensible words touching the importation of '' McKinleyism '' into literature : '' The fact is , it is a weak point in certain American writers ' of the patriotic school ' to be forever dragging in and puffing the native article , just because it is native and for no other reason whatever ; as if it mattered an atom whether an author whom , whilst you are discussing literature , you find it convenient to quote was born in
Boston	LOCATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, or
Boston	LOCATION	,
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts .

		One wearies of it indescribably . ''

		One does ' indeed ; and we suspect most of our readers will go on preferring
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	to
Joel Barlow	PERSON	, and
Holmes	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	to the '' Sweet Singers '' of their own respective townships , na - tional and local patriotism to the contrary notwith - standing .

		A study of ^ *
Charles Bourgeaud	PERSON	's `` Etablisse - written inent et Revision des Constitutions constitutions .

		en Amdrique et en

Paris	LOCATION	:
Thorin	PERSON	-RRB- is a solid piece of work that won in
1892	DATE	-LRB- and well deserved -RRB- the Rossi Prize of the
Paris	LOCATION	Fac - ulte '' de Droit .

		It is now published in a series that in - cludes translations from the English of the principal works of
Maine	LOCATION	and Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	, so that it has no reason to complain of its company .

		The work is a study of the written constitutions of his - tory , from the
Connecticut	LOCATION	'' Fundamental Orders '' of
1639	DATE	to the latest experiments of the Latin - American republics , with reference to their estab - lishment and the provisions made for their amend - ment or revision .

		After an introductory discussion of the written constitution , mainly illustrated by early American examples , the constitutions of the present century are taken up seriatim .

		The funda - mental division made by
M. Bourgeaud	PERSON	is between the group of charters or '' constitutional facts '' and the group of truly popular constitutions ; that is , constitutions which start out from popular sover - eignty as an admitted principle .

		Under the first head are discussed the German ,
Latin	LOCATION	, and Scan - dinavian constitutions ; under the second , the con - stitutions of
France	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The author is to be particularly commended for having made a careful study of
State	ORGANIZATION	constitu - tions in this country .

		Most foreign writers ignore them altogether , although they are in many respects more instructive than the Federal Constitution it - self .

		In connection with his analysis of the Amer - ican constitutional convention and its functions , the 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, author quotes from
Jameson	PERSON	and from Professor von Hoist 's criticism of
Jameson	PERSON	's work .

		He adds in a note that Professor von Hoist , having ac - cepted a chair in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, `` va pouvoir lire ailleurs que dans ses livres . ''

		The En - glish Constitution , heing unwritten and at any time amendable by mere act of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, does not come within the scope of
M. Bourgeaud	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		But the fact that his attention is confined to the written constitution does not blind him to the fact that there are many things , even in the fundamen - tal law of a country , to be sought outside the text of any constitutional document .

		In a pregnant pass - age he asserts '' que les constitutions e `` crites ne sont pas 1 ` unique mesure des institutions politiques d'un pays , qu'elles formulent plus qu'elles ne cre'ent , et qu'il ne faut pas chercher dans leurs articles toutes les normes constitutionelles . ''

		And he continues as follows : '' La declaration des droits de 1 ` homme et du citoyen n'est pas inscrite en les lois de
1875	DATE	.

		Aucun de ` cret de 1 ` Assemblee de
Versailles	LOCATION	ne 1 ' a confirme'e .

		In it Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	presents , with much felicity of phrase and fancy , '' some notes and impressions of the remarkable

		The '' Itinerary '' embraces

Kew Gardens	LOCATION	, the Chilterns , etc. ; and the volume closes with A Ballad of a Musician , '' a production which , like the prose , has a savor quite its own .

		Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	's writing bears throughout the hall - mark of originality , and it has a charm , born partly of thought and partly of diction , that is hard to de - fine .

		There is , perhaps , at times a hint of self - consciousness , of phrasing that is the fruit of rep - etition and experiment ; but we need not quarrel with that .

Walton	PERSON	, the type of literary innocency , has been caught , once at least , hammer - ing out his `` artless '' phrases with all the fore - thought and deliberation of a
Donne	ORGANIZATION	.

		A fair sam - ple of our author 's director descriptions is his pic - ture of a lark not so poetical , certainly , as
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	's or
Walton	PERSON	's , but graphic enough : '' Then came a withered heath ; and out of it , almost from between the itinerant 's feet , a lark with hissing wings shot up like a rocket .

		Right underneath it he watched its ascent ; he had never had such an opportunity before .

		It wedged its way up spirally ; and as distance gradually hid the corkscrew motion , it seemed to be climbing a stair , moving from side to side like a skater .

		At a certain height the di - rect ascent changed to an oblique one ; the lark had ceased drilling a passage through the air , and , impelled by the momentum acquired in its long involved race up the skies , it slid without effort high into the blue .

		The descent was a continua - tion of the ascending slide , its wings remaining mo - tionless , until , near the earth , they were employed as brakes to avoid destruction .

		And all the while the powerful song went on , filling the air . ''

		The passage has a ring of the observant
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	, and the reader may profitably compare it with
Shelley	PERSON	's and
Wordsworth	PERSON	's immortal Odes to this '' pilgrim of the skies . ''

		The little book is artistically made , and there is a frontispiece fairly rivalling in oddity the quaint eccentricities of
Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	and
E. Burne-Jones	ORGANIZATION	.

		It includes papers written be - tween
1774	DATE	and
1779	DATE	, the most important of them being '' Common Sense '' and '' The Crisis . ''

		These are so well known that mere mention of their in - clusion is sufficient .

		As the editor remarks , '' No apology is needed for an edition of
Thomas Paine	PERSON	's writings , but rather for the tardiness of their appearance . ''

		The work of collecting them has not been easy , and their value , to the student of American history alone , is hardly exaggerated by Mr.

		This volume is devoted to '' Episch-Lyrische Poesie . ''

		It is really but the beginning of a comprehensive work -LRB- under - taken by the
Germania Mannerchor of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which is intended to illustrate the achievements of the German-American not only in literature , but in music , painting , sculpture , and architecture as well .

1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 151 history of the subject begins with 1520 , when a German adventurer who came over in the train of
Cortez	PERSON	wrote an account of his experiences .

		The manuscript of this '' Zeitung aus Yucatan '' was discovered about forty years ago , and published at
Amsterdam	LOCATION	.

		The next date recorded is 1532 , when
Nikolaus Federman	PERSON	described his adventures in Ven - ezuela .

		This work was actually printed in
1536	DATE	.

		Three other sixteenth-century writings are chron - icled , all dealing with
South America	LOCATION	.

		These facts are curious , but they do not directly concern the subject of the work before us , which deals essen - tially with the literary production of Germans who have settled in
America	LOCATION	.

		In the work proper , three periods are distinguished : a religious , from
1625	DATE	to
1825	DATE	; a political , from
1825	DATE	to
1850	DATE	; and the period of immigration subsequent to the latter date .

		The religious period was barren , and three names serve to illustrate it .

		The political period gives us a score of '' Vor-achtundvierziger , '' and half as many more of the '' Achtundvierziger '' themselves .


Franz Lieber	PERSON	,
Friedrich Hassaurek	PERSON	,
Niklas Muller	PERSON	, and
Eduard Dorsch	PERSON	are among the better known names of this period .

		In the closing period , about a hun - dred and fifty names are represented .

France	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
P. F. Willert	PERSON	.

		A pervert and traitor in the eyes of the Protestants and a victim to the knife of a Catholic fanatic ,
Henry the Fourth	ORGANIZATION	presents a character dif - ficult to judge fairly and calmly .

		Mr.
Willert	PERSON	's estimate is just and appreciative .

		He sees in the great Bourbon neither an impossible hero nor an unprincipled voluptuary , but a coarse vigorous man of action , versatile , daring , and honestly desirous of the welfare of his kingdom , with an openness of manner and an unfeigned humanity that led even his enemies to confess that he had '' sublime vir -
tues.	DATE	'' '' There was that about him which , what - ever he did , prevented his appearing mean or hate - ful , and it is not without reason that , of all kings who have occupied the French throne ,
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	still retains the first place in the memory and affection of his people . ''

		A new life of
Catherine IT	ORGANIZATION	.

		of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Lack of the conventional ingredients of romance will scarcely be predi - cated of
R. Waliszewski	PERSON	's '' Romance of an Empress '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a Life of Catherine II .

		of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Materials for a detailed study of the northern Semiramis have only of late years been forthcoming ; now , out of the seventy-two volumes of documents published by the Russian Imperial Historical Society , there are scarcely twenty not directly bearing on the history of her reign .

		The author , we learn , has availed himself of these and other hitherto unexplored sources with a freedom of selection and expression that has resulted in the prohibition of his book in
Russia	LOCATION	from which it would seem that the national ability to digest the political facts of Russian history is in rather a weak and infantile stage as yet .

		Catherine 's personal record would certainly bear fumigating ; but we find nothing in
M. Waliszewski	PERSON	's book especially provocative of dynamite .

		Human society presents no more pitiful spectacle than this of a government , secular or religious , slinking perpetually into the shadow , blinking the light of advancing knowledge , and striving to perpetuate its outworn or partly out - worn rule by blindfolding the eyes of its depend - ants to discreditable truths in its past history .


M. Waliszewski	PERSON	is a lively and graphic narrator , and he has been acceptably translated .

		There is an in - teresting frontispiece portrait of
Catherine	PERSON	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		There seems to be no doubt that
Thoreau	PERSON	has become an American classic .

		The fact is emphasized by the '' Riv - erside '' edition of his writings , now complete in ten vol - umes -LRB-
Hough	ORGANIZATION	ton . -RRB-

		The last of these volumes to be pub - lished are '' Excursions in Field and Forest '' and '' Mis - cellanies . ''

		The former includes '' A Yankee in
Canada	LOCATION	'' and one or two pieces not before printed in book form .

		The latter opens with
Emerson	PERSON	's sketch , which is fol - lowed by a number of essays representative of '' the somewhat less known
Thoreau	PERSON	, the student of human life , of literature , and religion . ''

		Last of all , the vol - ume presents translations from ^ Eschylus and
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, and a few original poems .

		The index to the entire edi - tion , which appears in this volume , doubles the useful - ness of the work to the student .

		Mr.
William R. Jenkins	PERSON	has published three useful books for teachers of the French language .

		Perhaps the most valuable of the three is
M. A. de Rougemont	PERSON	's '' Manuel de la Litte ` rature Fran ^ ais , '' which covers , cur - sorily , the last three centuries , and includes extracts , biographies , notes , and questions .

		M.
Paul Bercy	PERSON	's '' French Reader '' is designed for advanced classes , and is made up of complete stories to the number of thirty , by Such nineteenth century authors as
Mendes	LOCATION	,
Mau	PERSON	- passant , Coppe'e , HaleVy ,
Droz	PERSON	,
Daudet	PERSON	, and Bourget .

		The third publication is a `` College .

		Preparatory French Grammar , '' by
M. Charles P. Du Croquet	PERSON	.

		It includes lessons for a year 's work , selections , and all sorts of ex - ercises , winding up with a number of specimen college examination papers .

		Volume XXXVI .

		of the `` Dictionary of National Biography '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- opens with an article on Mal - thus , by Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, and carries us through the Masons , of whom
William	PERSON	, the poet , is also discussed by Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's competent pen .

		The most noticeable of the literary biographies is Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's '' Mar - lowe , '' which fills ten pages .

		Even this liberal measure is exceeded , however , by Mr.
T. F. Henderson	PERSON	's ''
Mary Stuart	PERSON	, '' which gets no less than eighteen pages , and is much the longest biography in the volume .

		Volume XXXVII .

		of the '' Dictionary '' extends from
Masque	LOCATION	- rier to

		`` Pictures from Greek Life and Story '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is the title of the latest of the popular books on ancient history which Mr.
A. J. Church	PERSON	continues to send forth with a regularity that would weary a less facile book - maker .

		In this volume the author succeeds fairly well in the attempt to '' present a few picturesque scenes from Greek story '' in the period between
Solon	ORGANIZATION	and
Epamiuondas	LOCATION	, although the picturesqueness is sometimes more apparent in the titles of the sketches than in the narrative itself .

		There are numerous illustrations after the antique .

		It is gratifying to see that the renewed interest in Greek institutions aroused by the discovery of Aris - totle 's treatise on the Constitution of
Athens	LOCATION	has again borne fruit in
America	LOCATION	, this time in a monograph by Dr.
George Willis Botsford	PERSON	on `` The Development of the Athenian Constitution , '' recently issued as the fourth number of the
Cornell Studies in Classical Philology	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		Taking the patriarchal family as the starting - point of his work , Dr.
Botsford	PERSON	describes in detail the constituent elements of Greek society , and traces their development at
Athens	LOCATION	down to the beginning of the Peloponnesian war .

		The material is discussed in a care - ful and scholarly manner , and the study deserves a creditable place in the rapidly growing literature of the subject .

		THE `` ANTIGONE '' AT
TORONTO	LOCATION	.

		The representation of a Greek play in its native dress is not yet so common an event as not to excite unusual interest , though apparently it is becoming a more fre - quent occurrence in spite of the growth of a tendency to look upon Greek as an obsolescent and useless study .

		It is less than a year ago that the '' Antigone '' was brought out at
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	; and the recent celebra - tion of the quarter-centennial of the
University of Ne	ORGANIZATION	- braska was made academic by the rendering of scenes from the '' Electra '' and the '' Antigone . ''

		When we saw , a fortnight ago , large placards posted about the streets of
Toronto	LOCATION	, announcing the perform - ance of the '' Antigone '' in Greek by students of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, under the special patronage of the Governor General and the
Countess of Aberdeen	ORGANIZATION	, we wondered whether the Zeitgeist would applauding look on with - out receiving at least a sop to placate him .

		The rep - resentation , which was given on three successive even - ings before large audiences in the
Academy of Music	ORGANIZATION	, was successful in so many ways , and the concessions to the notions of the modern stage manager were so few , that the
University	ORGANIZATION	and its friends have good reason for self-gratulation .

		Those of us who were from '' the States '' could not be expected to admire the English sound of the Greek vowels ; but this might be regarded as a matter of pro- vincial prejudice .

		What seemed more strange to us was the peculiar rhythm by which the iambic trimeter was given the effect of the choliambus verse , the last syllable of the line being treated as short , giving the verse an unexpected close as though it were lame .

		The scenery was borrowed from the Vassar representation , and the text was furnished by
Messrs. Ginn & Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		As at
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	, the chorus and the actors stood on the same level , the Greek orchestra serving at the same time as the proscenium .

		No one will claim that the ''
Antig	PERSON	- one '' affords a fair test of the soundness of the Dorp - f eld theory of the Greek stage as applied to the natural - ness and effectiveness of the representation ; yet all , we think , will be ready to admit that even in such a play as this , in which chorus and actors do not come into what may be called hand to hand contact , the pathos and power of many of the scenes would be diminished were the hero or heroine to be separated from those who are appealed to for sympathy and counsel by the space re - quired for the Vitruvian stage .

		The well-trained Chorus of fifteen elders was aided in the singing by an effective supplementary chorus of forty voices .

		Mendelssohn 's music , written for Dou - ner 's German translation and adapted to the Greek by Professor
Ramsay Wright	PERSON	, was admirably rendered .

		The Chorus proper indicated by pantomime the senti - ment of the odes perhaps too palpably .

		How far the Greeks employed pantomime and action in the choric stasima is a matter of conjecture .

		The hyporchema , in which Dionysus is celebrated as a patron god of
Thebes	LOCATION	, was a very realistic Bacchic dance ; it was well done , possibly too well done , and here more than any - where else there was an appeal to the modern love of the spectacular .

		In the absence of stage directions , there is always room for differences of interpretation ; and if we had such directions , would these differences be any the less ?

		Many interpreters make the guard too much of a clown , over-emphasize the wrath and excitement of Teiresias , and make colorless the thrilling narrative of the messen - ger who announces the self-inflicted death of Eurydice .

		The simple dignity and true pathos of this noble drama asserted their power over minds accustomed to the complex and unnatural realism of the sensational drama .

		Again was proof given of the eternal human - ness of '' our Sophocles , the royal , '' who could bring un - der the spell of his genius a company of '' barbarians '' to whom the accents of his Attic tongue were as unintel - ligible as the confused and harsh cries of the birds that flocked about Teiresias on the seat of augury .

		THE DIAL 153 When the decease of

		Each number of this magazine will be a 320-page book , having the outward guise of a French novel .

		Subjects of the day will be expressly excluded from the pages of this enter - prise , and only untimely topics will find favor with the editors .

		While
Hungary	LOCATION	was engaged , a few weeks ago , in celebrating the fiftieth year of

		He was dined by the

Seiior Echegaray	PERSON	.

		Deputations from all over

		His early plays were revived in the thea - tres , and streets in
Toledo	LOCATION	and Valladolid were rechris - tened with his name .

		Altogether , he must have been highly gratified by the numerous evidences of his popu - larity .

		Among the many
Spring announcements of Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, we notice with peculiar interest Mr.
A. W. Pollard	PERSON	's edition of `` The Canterbury Tales '' ; the second volume of Professor

Wiilcker	ORGANIZATION	's `` History of Anglo-Saxon Literature '' ; and the nine volumes in the dollar edition of
Dickens	LOCATION	, making the series complete .

		Mr.
Coulson Kernahan	PERSON	, a young English writer , pub - lished not long ago '' A Book of Strange Sins , '' which a great many people bought in the expectation of find - ing something racy .

		The contents of the book were , in fact , perfectly inoffensive , but it seems that one of its critics -LRB- possibly one who reviewed it by title -RRB- described it as unfit for publication .

		Mr.
Kernahan	PERSON	's way of meeting the attack is novel .

		Instead of bringing suit for libel , he offers to submit his work to the arbitration of six Wesleyan Methodist ministers , agreeing that if two out of six say there is anything in it which '' ought never to have seen the light '' he will pay 100 to some charitable institution .

		This shows Mr.
Kernahan	PERSON	to be of an exceedingly peaceful and conciliatory disposition ; it also shows him to have an eye for a good advertise - ment .

		Mr.
Charles S. Peirce	PERSON	, of
Milford	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, issues a pros - pectus of a work in twelve volumes -LRB- each distinct -RRB- en - titled '' The Principles of Philosophy ; or ,

		The original treatise dates from
1269	DATE	, and '' occupies a unique position in the history of the human mind , being without exception the earliest work of experimental science that has come down to us . ''

		The transcript of
Peter Peregrinus	PERSON	's text has been made afresh from a contemporary MS. in the
Paris Library	LOCATION	, and is repro - duced in black-letter , together with a translation and notes .

		After a private and somewhat vicarious existence of seven years '' The Hobby Horse '' has been granted a new lease of life , and will continue to be issued quar - terly in a limited edition to subscribers only .

		It will be under the editorship of Mr.

		EARLY LITERARY DAYS IN
CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	gives the following example of liter - ary criticism as she was wrote in
California	LOCATION	some thirty years ago .

		Mr.
Harte	PERSON	had just published a volume of selected verse from
Calif	LOCATION	ornian writers : '' A well-known mining weekly , which I here poetically veil under the title of the Red Dog `
Jay Hawk	PERSON	, ' was first to swoop down upon the tuneful and unsuspecting quarry .

		At this century-end of fastidious and complaisant criticism , it may be interesting to recall the direct style of the
Calif	LOCATION	ornian ` sixties ' : ` The hog wash and `` purp '' - stuff ladled out from the slop-bucket of
Messrs. & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		of `
Frisco	LOCATION	, by some lop-eared
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	apprentice , and called `` A Compilation of
California	LOCATION	!!

		Verse , '' might be passed over , so far as criticism goes .

		A club in the hands of any able-bodied citizen of Red Dog and a steam - boat ticket to the
Bay	LOCATION	, cheerfully contributed from this office , would be all-sufficient .

		But when an imported greenhorn dares to call his flapdoodle mixture ''
Cali	PERSON	- fornian , '' it is an insult to the
State	ORGANIZATION	that has produced the gifted '' Yellow Hammer , '' whose lofty flights have from time to time dazzled our readers in the columns of the ''
Jay Hawk	PERSON	. ''

		That this complacent editorial jackass , browsing among the dock and thistles which he has served up in this volume , should make no allu - sion to
California	LOCATION	's greatest bard , is rather a confession of his idiocy than a slur upon the genius of our esteemed contributor . '

		I turned hurriedly to my pile of rejected contributions the nom deplume of ` Yellow Hammer ' 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, did not appear among them ; certainly I had never heard of its existence .

		Later , when a friend showed me one of that gifted bard 's pieces , I was inwardly relieved . ''

		VERSES BY
MR. SWINBURNE	PERSON	TO MR.
WILLIAM MORRIS	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's forthcoming volume of poems is in - scribed to Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	by a copy of verses in the poet 's best dedicatory manner .

		We reprint the closing stanzas , about one-third of the entire poem : `` Truth , winged and enkindled with rapture And sense of the radiance of yore , Fulfilled you with power to recapture What never might singer before The life , the delight , and the sorrow Of troublous and chivalrous years That knew not of night or of morrow , Of hopes or of fears . ''

		But wider the wing and the vision That quicken the spirit have spread Since memory beheld with derision Man 's hope to be more than his dead .

		From the mists and the snows and the thunders Your spirit has brought for us forth Light , music , and joy in the wonders And charms of the north . ''

		The wars and the woes and the glories That quicken and lighten and rain From the clouds of its chronicled stories , The passion , the pride , and the pain , Whose echoes were mute and the token Was lost of the spells that they spake .

		Rise bright at your bidding , unbroken Of ages that break . ''

		For you , and for none of us other ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	is not : the dead that must live Hold commune with you as a brother By grace of the life that you give .

		The heart that was in them is in you , Their soul in your spirit endures : The strength of their song is the sinew Of this that is yours . ''

		Hence is it that life , everlasting As light and as music , abides In the sound of the surge of it , casting Sound back to the surge of the tides , Till sons of the sons of the
Norsemen Watch	ORGANIZATION	, hurtling to windward and lee ,
Round England	LOCATION	, unbacked of her horsemen , The steeds of the sea . ''


BROWNING	PERSON	'S `` LOST LEADER . ''

		Who was
Browning	PERSON	's '' Lost Leader '' ?

		is a question that crops out as regularly as '' Who are the characters in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's ' Dream of Fair Women ' ? ''

		Its latest appearance is in the
London	LOCATION	`` Literary World , '' where it elicits a number of communications , one of which is interesting enough to quote .

		It is a letter written by
Browning	PERSON	in
1875	DATE	.

		`` Dear Friends , Your letter has made a round to reach me , hence the delay in replying to it , which you will , therefore , pardon .

		I have been asked the question you put to me though never asked so poetically and so pleasantly I suppose a score of times , and I can only answer , with something of shame and contrition , that I undoubtedly had
Wordsworth	PERSON	in my mind , but simply as a ' model ' ; you know , an artist takes one or two striking traits in the features of his ' model , ' and uses them to start his fancy on a flight which may end far enough from the good man or woman who happens to be ' sitting ' for nose and eyes . ''

		I thought of the great poet 's abandonment of Lib - eralism at an unlucky juncture , and no repaying conse - quence that I could ever see .

		But once call my fancy - portrait
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and how much more ought one to say !

		There is my apology , dear friends , and your ac - ceptance of it will confirm me .

		Truly yours ,
EGBERT BROWNING	PERSON	. ''

		Since the anxious inquirer in this latest case was par - ticularly troubled by the reference to the '' mild and magnificent eye '' of the '' Lost Leader , '' and could not reconcile the description with what he knew of Words - worth , another correspondent contributes this passage from Hazlitt : '' His manner of reading his own poetry is particu - larly imposing ; and in his favourite passages his eye beams with preternatural lustre , and the meaning labours slowly up from his swelling breast .

		There is little here of the hard cyni - cism and of the pessimism that have been the distinguishing marks of her books , while in the qualities of picturesqueness and of world - knowledge the volume shows her at her best . ''

		*** This book will constitute a complete exposure of the methods and devices employed in cheating at the present day , and a revelation of the whole of the secrets of the modern gaming sharp .

		It will be a work absolutely unique of its kind , nothing at all approaching it having ever before been published in any language .

		Apart from its value as a warning to those who are addicted to any form of gambling , it is a book which will prove , it is hoped , of the utmost interest to the general public , showing , as it does , the capabilities of trickery .

		Swindling of any kind is only rendered possible by the fact that the public have so little knowledge of what can be accomplished by unfair means , and this applies more particularly perhaps to unfair practices in play than to any other subject .

		195 WILLIAM
FREDERICK POOLE	PERSON	.

		In the death of Dr.
Poole	PERSON	, which occurred on the first of this month , American history has lost one of its best equipped and most pains - taking students , the profession of librarianship one of its foremost exponents , and THE DIAL one of its stanchest friends and most valued contributors .

		Although he had made his home for some years past in the university suburb of
Evanston	LOCATION	, a few miles from
Chicago	LOCATION	, his work was done in this city , which has for the past twenty years reckoned him among its most dis - tinguished citizens .

		The number of persons who , in this great community , are identified with intellectual rather than with material in - terests is still relatively so small that the dis - appearance from our midst of so commanding a figure as that of Dr.
Poole	PERSON	is a public loss more grievous than it would be in many other places .

		His death leaves a social vacancy not easily to be filled , even from the public point of view ; from that of the friends who have loved and honored him for so many years , the mere suggestion of its ever being filled is a mockery .


William Frederick Poole	PERSON	was born at
Salem	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	,
December 24 , 1821	DATE	, thus being at the time of his death seventy-two years of age .

		The annals of his career may be briefly chronicled .

		He entered
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	in
1842	DATE	, and was graduated in
1849	DATE	.

		This period in - cludes an interregnum of three years spent in earning the money needed to complete his col - lege education .

		President
Timothy Dwight	PERSON	, of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, was one of his classmates .

		From the time of graduation from college to the close of his career , the story of his life , viewed externally , is little more than a state - ment of the various libraries that he was called upon to direct or to organize .

		He was an assistant librarian in the
Boston Athenaeum	LOCATION
from 1850	DATE	to
1852	DATE	; Librarian of the
Boston Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	from
1852	DATE	to
1856	DATE	; Li - brarian of the
Boston Athenaeum	ORGANIZATION	from
1856	DATE	to
1869	DATE	; and Librarian of the
Cincinnati	LOCATION	Pub -
lic Library	ORGANIZATION	from
1869	DATE	to
1874	DATE	.

		Called , in
1873	DATE	, to the work of organizing the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, he entered upon that task early in
1874	DATE	, and remained at the head of the Chi - cago institution until
1887	DATE	, when he was called upon to undertake the task of organizing the reference library endowed by the late
Walter L. Newberry	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, and known by the name of its generous founder .

		During the nearly seven years that he lived to act as the director of that institution , he collected for its uses nearly one hundred thousand volumes , and superintended , not many weeks ago , their trans - fer to the magnificent new building which is to be the permanent home of the Library .

		166 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Librarianship , in this country , has during the past twenty years become one of the learned professions ; that it has become so is due in very great measure to the efforts of Dr.
Poole	PERSON	.

		To secure for his fellow-workers the recogni - tion accorded to the clergyman , the lawyer , and the physician ; to substitute the trained bibli - ographer for the mere custodian of books ; to establish professional schools of librarianship ; to make the public familiar with the principles of rational library architecture ; to facilitate access to collections of books , and to enlarge their usefulness by library helps prepared by the cooperation of bibliographers these were , briefly stated , the aims towards whose accom - plishment he devoted , for a full half-century , an exceptionally active and industrious life .

		He was a member of the
New York Conven	ORGANIZATION	- tion of Librarians held in
1853	DATE	, the first con - vention of the sort ever held anywhere .

		He helped organize the American Library Asso - ciation in
1876	DATE	, was one of the Presidents of that body , and attended all but one of its an - nual meetings .

		He represented this country at the first
International Conference of Libra	ORGANIZATION	- rians , held in
London	LOCATION	in
1877	DATE	, and was , in
1893	DATE	, at the head of the World 's
Congress Auxiliary Literary Congresses	ORGANIZATION	, one of which was an
International Congress of Librarians	ORGANIZATION	.

		The papers published by him upon professional subjects are very numerous , but are difficult of access .

		These papers ought to be collected , for they contain much material of permanent value .

		As a librarian , Dr.
Poole	PERSON	's methods were characterized by sagacious practicality and clear common sense .

		He mistrusted the elaborate scientific systems now in vogue with our younger bibliographers ; systems which are excellent for the uses of the librarian , but sadly perplex - ing to most of the people for whom libraries are collected .

		His methods of classification and catalogue-making were to a certain extent em - pirical , and not a little is to be said on behalf of empiricism in such matters .

		He never lost sight of the fundamental principle that books are meant to be used ; that their chief end is not at - tained when they are catalogued and shelved .

		He wanted the public to use the books under his charge , and encouraged such use in many ways .

		He welcomed the work of
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	, and tried to make the public library a helpful adjunct to that work .

		And long before Uni - versity Extension was talked about in this country , he sought to bring the school into more intimate relations with the library , and arranged for bibliographical talks to students , illustrated by the literature of the subjects talked about .

		Such a collection of Dr.
Poole	PERSON	's bibliograph - ical papers as we have suggested would be a worthy monument to his memory .

		But a still worthier monument already exists in the shape of the great '' Index to Periodical Literature . ''

		The author began this important work as a student , when he was acting as librarian of a college society .

		Its first edition was printed in
1848	DATE	, making an octavo of 154 pages .

		In
1853	DATE	it reappeared in an octavo of more than three times the thickness of the earlier volume .

		In
1882	DATE	-LRB- `` the author having meanwhile secured the cooperation of a number of his fellow - librarians -RRB- it made its third and final appear - ance , again multiplied threefold as to the num - ber of pages , and much more than that as to the quantity of matter .

		Two supplements have since been published , with the cooperation of Mr. W , I ,
Fletcher	PERSON	, bringing it down to
1892	DATE	.

		As a student of history , Dr.
Poole	PERSON	devoted himself chiefly to subjects connected with the early settlement of this country .

		His '' Anti- Slavery Opinions before
1800	DATE	'' is a valuable contribution to the history of the '' peculiar in - stitution '' in
America	LOCATION	.

		His paper on '' The
Popham Colony	ORGANIZATION	'' discussed certain conflicting claims between
Maine	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	as to priority of settlement , deciding in favor of the latter .

		He investigated the history of the
Northwestern Ordinance	ORGANIZATION	and the connection therewith of
Manasseh Cutler	PERSON	, making him - self the recognized authority upon that impor - tant subject .

		He pricked the bubbles of the Pocahontas story and of the Mecklenburg De - claration so effectively that they were relegated to the realm of myth , and are not likely again to find serious defenders .

		He published valu - able studies in the history of the early North - west .

		Most important , perhaps , of a 'll his stu - dies were those relating to early
Massachusetts	LOCATION	history , and especially to the
Mathers	PERSON	and the subject of witchcraft .

		These subjects were as - signed to him in '' The Memorial History of
Boston	LOCATION	, '' and were frequently discussed by him elsewhere .

		He did much to correct the erro - neous popular estimate of
Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	, showing him to have been learned , sagacious , and tolerant , free from responsibility for the witchcraft delusion , and a commanding figure worthy of the respect and admiration of poster - ity .

		In this , as in other instances , Dr.
Poole	PERSON	, himself a descendant of the Puritans , stoutly defended his ancestors against the misrepresen -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 167 tations under which they have suffered .

		An - other piece of historical work , possibly the most important done by him , was his lengthy his - torical and critical introduction to the reprint of Captain
Edward Johnson	PERSON	's '' Wonder - Work - ing
Providence of Sion	ORGANIZATION	's Saviour in
New En	LOCATION	- gland . ''

		These numerous historical studies , no less than those devoted to the professional work of the librarian , are so scattered as to be diffi - cult of access , and richly deserve collection and publication in permanent form .

		Many of Dr.
Poole	PERSON	's historical papers were contributed to the journal upon which now de - volves the sad task of paying a tribute to his memory , and it was through his good offices that the contents of THE DIAL were , from the start , included in the great '' Index . ''

		The first number of THE DIAL appeared in
May , 1880	DATE	, and the first article in that number was a re - view , by Dr.
Poole	PERSON	, of the new edition of
Hil	LOCATION	- dreth .

		His latest contribution , which appeared only
last month	DATE	, and which was probably the last piece of work done by him , was that vigor - ous defense of the Puritans of which our read - ers will hardly need to be reminded upon this occasion .

		Between these two contributions , upwards of thirty others from his pen appeared in the pages of THE DIAL ; contributions de - voted , with a single exception , to subjects in American history .

		Whatever might be his subject , the forcible and picturesque qualities of his style could not fail to be impressive , and the pages that he wrote , however aggressive and tending to excite opposition , always held the attention , and were never invaded by any - thing remotely suggestive of dulness .

		The bibliographer and the historical student combined in
William Frederick Poole	PERSON	were known to the world ; something better than these , the man himself , was known to his friends .

		The brusqueness of his manner , at first a little repellant to those who came into contact with him , was soon seen to be but the outward ex - pression of a mental habit of the rarest sincer - ity .

		And upon those who had the privilege of his intimacy was made the impression , domi - nant above all others , of his absolute integrity , intellectual and moral .

		They realized that here was a man who simply could not think one thing and say another , or swerve by so much as a finger 's breadth from what he believed to be the right course , were the matter in ques - tion great or small .

		Such men are none too common in the world , and when one of them leaves it , his place , for those who have really known him , is not likely to be filled again .

		THE INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH AT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY	ORGANIZATION	* In order to understand the purposes and methods of the English courses at the
Leland Stanford Jr.	ORGANIZATION	.

		University , it is necessary to know something about our system of what is technically called '' major sub - jects . ''

		At the beginning of his second year in the
University	ORGANIZATION	every student is expected to elect a spe - cialty , to which he shall devote at least a third of his time throughout his undergraduate course .

		So soon as the specialty , or major subject , has been chosen , the professor of that subject becomes the student 's official adviser , and no degree is granted until the course pursued by the student shall have been in all respects satisfactory to the professor .

		It will be seen that this system combines the advan - tages of great freedom of election on the part of the student , with those of direct , close , and friendly supervision on the part of an expert .

		Thus , for example , if a student upon entering the
University	ORGANIZATION	chooses English as his major subject , he is expected to report every semester to one of the professors of English , whose approval he is bound to secure for the course he elects .

		Should the student see fit to elect certain subjects not approved by his major professor , he is perfectly free to do so , the probable result being that his residence at the
University	ORGANIZATION	is so much the more prolonged .

		If , therefore , a stu - dent is willing either to prolong his residence or to renounce the hope of obtaining a degree , his free - dom of election is conditioned only upon his com - petency to get on in the studies elected .

		The usual result of the system is simply this : The student takes the five or more hours of work in English -LRB- if that be his specialty -RRB- ; several more hours in col - lateral subjects , such as Latin , French , German , or History , are recommended by the professor ; and the student is left free to choose for himself such other subjects as may attract him .

		The practical working of this system has hitherto proved very satisfactory .

		Students elect for the most part only such subjects as they have taste or talent for , and professors have the pleasure and in - spiration of working with earnest and enthusiastic men and women .

		The organic quality of a course thus planned from semester to semester by the inter - ested student , under the advice of his professor , turns out to be far superior to that of the conventional college curriculum .

		Under the system here de - scribed , the graduate finds himself pretty thoroughly grounded in some science , or in some group of related languages , and goes out into the world , not indeed master of a specialty , but at least interested in some branch of rational research , and versed in the appar - atus and methods essential to its further pursuit .

		168 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, I can scarcely define the aims of the courses in English better than I have done in the following sentence from the University Register : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- To give training in the formulation and expression of thought ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- to impart a scientific knowledge of the English Language and of literary history , En - glish and European ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- to acquaint the student with a juster and more liberal method of literary criticism ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- to introduce him to literature as an art , to cultivate a refined appreciation of what is best , and thus to reveal unfailing sources of pure enjoyment . ''

		Before proceeding to describe the courses , it may be well to advert briefly to the English preparation exacted for admission to the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The re - quirements for admission were at first modelled upon those of the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	, which are similar to those of the
New England	LOCATION	Asso - ciation of Colleges : namely , a play or two of Shake - speare , the
Sir Roger de Coverley Papers	ORGANIZATION	, a story of
Thackeray	PERSON	, and a few of the masterpieces of En - glish and American poetry .

		Under this system the examination consists mainly in a test of the ap - plicant 's ability to quote readily , to explain allusions , to write outlines and abstracts , and in various ways to show upon paper that he has read and digested the works in question .

		While this system is a great advance upon the old practice of requiring an ac - quaintance with rhetoric and the formal side of grammar and composition , experience shows it to be not quite sufficient .

		The tendency is to encour - age the '' getting up '' of a certain number of books , and the cramming of a modicum of information about words and etymologies , rather than the at - tainment of such a practical acquaintance with the vernacular as a student needs in order to take a col - lege course successfully .

		We have therefore thought it wise to lay more stress upon a student 's prepar - ation in composition than has hitherto been custom - ary in our secondary schools .

		While there has been no nominal increase in the requirements for admis - sion in English , it has become , as a matter of fact , more difficult for the graduates of high schools and other secondary schools to satisfy our requirements .

		Thus , out of perhaps a hundred and fifty applicants for admission in English at the beginning of the present year , only some forty wrote satisfactory pa - pers .

		It is hoped that our course in adhering rig - idly to the relatively high , but really very moder - ate , standard of admission in English will have a salutary effect upon secondary instruction in
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia and elsewhere .

		All that we really ask on the side of style is that the student be pretty familiar with the mechanical details of composition , spell - ing , punctuation , correct sentence structure , para - graphing , and the like , and that he be able to ex - press himself with some idiomatic fluency .

		During the first two years of the short history of the English department here , the professors were worn out with the drudgery of correcting Freshman themes , work really secondary and preparatory , and in no sense forming a proper subject of colle - giate instruction .

		This year , in accordance with the program sketched above , we have absolutely refused to admit to our courses students unprepared to do real collegiate work .

		The Freshman English course in theme-writing has been eliminated from our pro- gram , and has been turned over to approved teach - ers and to the various secondary schools .

		Had this salutary innovation not been accomplished , all the literary courses would have been swept away by the rapidly growing inundation of Freshman themes , and all our strength and courage would have been dis - sipated in preparing our students to do respectable work at more happily equipped Universities .

		As it is , no student is admitted to the course in English composition until he has acquired the proficiency above indicated .

		Instead , therefore , of requiring the undivided attention of a half-dozen professors , the work in English composition now occupies most of the time and strength of two .

		It is plain , how - ever , that one or two additional instructors in this important division of the work will be necessary next year .

		It would be bad policy to allow any in - structor to devote the whole of his attention to the work in English composition ; for however great a man 's enthusiasm for such work may be , it is inci - dent to human nature that no man can read themes efficiently for more than three hours at a stretch , and that the professor does his theme-reading more intelligently and more humanely when a portion of his time is spent in research preparatory to higher instruction .

		At the outset of his
University	ORGANIZATION	career , the student of English is advised to begin or continue an ac - quaintance with one or two , at least , of the chief foreign languages , ancient or modern .

		It is also suggested that he make himself proficient in some one of the natural or physical sciences , in order that he may not remain entirely a stranger to the great currents of positive research and philosophy .

		Apart from the advanced work in English com - position and forensics , intended to qualify the stu - dent to express with idiomatic grace and logical cogency whatever he may have to say or to write , the first work which confronts the student of En - glish at
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	is a careful study of some of the prose writers of the nineteenth century : such as Ma - caulay , De Quincey ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, Savage Landor ,
Cardi	PERSON	- nal
Newman	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		It is a fact that the majority of students enjoy good prose at an earlier stage of their culture than is requisite to the real appreciation of poetry .

		It is , moreover , observed that such a study of the best prose writers gives the instructor a fine opportunity to become acquainted with his students and to throw out suggestions that may help them to correct or cure their illiteracy .

		Moreover , this course proves an invaluable adjunct to the course in composition , inasmuch as nothing conduces more to the mastery of a good style than an intimate acquaintance with the best models .

		The majority of our students come to the Uni - versity with little Latin and less Greek ; and even those who come to us with thorough training in the
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 rudiments of one or both of these Cultur-Sprachen , come entirely innocent of anything in the nature of a comprehension of their literary masterpieces .

		It has therefore been thought wise to offer courses in ancient and foreign classics , treated through the medium of translations .

		Professor Newcomer is now conducting such a course in Homer and
Dante	PERSON	, devoting one semester to each of these great poets whose works , Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	has recently told us , count among the five indispensable books of the world .

		These courses are largely attended by in - terested and earnest students , some of whom are acquainted with the classical languages , but most of whom are not .

		I may say that Professor
Moul	PERSON	- ton 's a priori views as to the advantage of courses like this are fully borne out by our experience so far .

		If anything like a systematic and thorough reading , even of the five indispensable authors enumerated by Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, is to be secured on the part of the ma - jority of educated men and women in this busy mod - ern world , it must be by some such means as this .

		At all events , from the standpoint of the English teacher merely , we count the time not lost that is spent in acquainting students , as thoroughly as may be through translations , with at least a few of the masterpieces of the ancient and mediaeval world .

		Possibly some may find it difficult to understand why authors belonging to such remote times and diverse languages are to be included in courses in English .

		But how can one study modern poetry without knowing something , for example , of '' Thebes and Pelops ' line , Or the tale of Troy divine '' ?

		And how can an aquaintance with these great quar - ries of imaginative literature be better obtained , on the part of the non-classical student , than by the study of a good translation of Homer and of trans - lations of a few typical masterpieces of the Athe - nian stage ?

		These last are not neglected .

		The course in the Ancient Classical Drama , studied from translations , is similar in aim to the course in Ho - mer and
Dante	PERSON	, the latter being introductory to
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	especially , the former to the general study of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the succeeding semester an introductory course in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is Undertaken , which is not only an attempt at an in - ductive study of methods of dramatic construction , but also a general survey of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life and times , his art and his thought .

		In what follows , in order to prevent confusion , I shall designate the courses by the numbers by which they are known to us .

		Course 26 is a critical study of a few plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, involving a collation of such of the quarto and folio editions as may be obtainable in cheap reprints .

		At present , for example , the class is engaged in the task of constructing a text of Ham - let based upon
Victor	PERSON	's reprints of the first and sec - ond quartos and the first folio -LRB- 1623 -RRB- .

		Members of this class are advised to make no use of the work of modern editors , but to do their best to form from the original editions such a text as the author him - self would have approved , thus putting themselves back into a time immediately succeeding the au - thor 's death and the publication of the first collected edition of his writings .

		The value of such work as this for the acquirement of a sense of what Shake - spearean scholarship means , and , still better , for the attainment of fine taste and discrimination in mat - ters of textual criticism , should be too obvious to require comment .

		Of course such a class as this must necessarily be small , both for the attainment of the best results and because only the more ad - vanced undergraduates are capable of profiting by work of such critical character .

		Indeed , as matters stand at present this course is better suited to the graduate student than to any but the more thor - oughly trained undergraduates .

		Among the courses preliminary to this more ad - vanced Shakespearean study I should have men - tioned Course 16 , devoted to the Pre-Shakespearean Drama and to the
Contemporaries of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, , as well as to a more cursory review of the
Growth and Development	ORGANIZATION	of the Modern European Drama , , especially in
Spain	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	.

		In like - manner , Course 17 is in a sense introductory to the study of
Milton	LOCATION	, being a survey of the Minor Poet * of the Sixteenth and
Seventeenth Centuries	ORGANIZATION	, from
Tottel	ORGANIZATION	's Miscellany to the death of
Dryden	PERSON	.

		As at present conducted by Professor
Lathrop	PERSON	, this course is , however , by no means elementary , involving as it does the study and the attempted solution of many obscure and vexed questions of literary history .

		Course 18 involves a review of the more note - worthy Literary Masters of the English Literature of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, together with a some - what philosophical treatment of the uniquely inti - mate and extremely interesting relations between literature and life in that time , a time which more than any other rang out the old and rang in the new .

		Courses 19 and 20 , given by Professor Hudson in alternate years , are respectively a comparative study of the chief mgvements and tendencies of contemporary Literature , and a review of the novel - ists of the present century , together with a brief treatment of the earlier development of the novel .

		Courses 24 and 25 , given in alternate years , are respectively devoted to the study of
Edmund Spen	PERSON	- ser and of
John Milton	PERSON	.

		In the case of Spenser a critical examination is made of his chief poems , with special reference to their literary and ethical qualities , and to the influence of Spenser upon other poets ; and in the case of Milton the additional ef - fort is made to realize his character and the rela - tion of his activity to the time in which he lived .

		Course 27 is a reading course , devoted to the somewhat cursory but not necessarily superficial reading and interpretation of characteristic longer and shorter poems by
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		Course 21 , to which three hours a week through the year are devoted , is a study of the history of American literature and of the most significant works of representative writers .

		In this , as in all 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, other courses in literature , students are in every way incited to possess themselves of the complete works of the principal masters studied .

		Professor
Flugel	PERSON	's undergraduate work consists of one elementary course in Anglo-Saxon , and one in
Chaucer	LOCATION	, both three hours weekly through the year .

		The main aim of the former is to introduce the student to the spirit of Anglo-Saxon literature , and to give him facility in translating , less stress being laid upon phonological and grammatical de - tails .

		Inasmuch as all students who make English their '' major '' are required to take this course , and as better results may be gained in smaller classes , this first year 's class in Anglo-Saxon will be divided into two sections , in charge of two recently appointed assistants .

		From the foregoing outline it will be noted that relatively considerable attention is given to the di - rect study of the texts of the great classic authors who illustrate English literature ; and that , although literary history is by no means neglected , it is nearly everywhere made subordinate to the supreme aim of introducing the student largely to the best litera - ture .

		It seems almost superfluous to add that , while every professor employs his own method of instruction , no one employs the text-book method .

		Independent first-hand study , and candor in the statement of the results gained by such study , are invariably encouraged .

		A word in conclusion with reference to that por - tion of our work which , from the scholar 's stand - point , is most interesting if not most important : namely , the Philological and Literary Seminaries for graduate students .

		It should be noted that a considerable proportion of the undergraduate courses are adapted to the needs of graduates of other colleges , and of graduates of the
University	ORGANIZATION	in other courses than English ; but for the attain - ment of the advanced degrees of Master and Doc - tor in English Literature and Philology , every such student is required to become a member of the two Seminaries .

		It is impossible here to enter into de - scriptive details with respect to this branch of the work .

		At present all of the five professors of En - glish are so largely engrossed with the numerous undergraduate courses that too little time is left to devote to the needs of advanced students ; still , the Seminary course is by no means entirely neglected .

		The advanced courses in philology consist of lec - tures on Historical English Grammar , on Old and Middle English Literature , and on Beowulf -LRB- Sem - inary -RRB- .

		With these will be given in alternate years a Seminary course on King
Alfred	PERSON	and his time -LRB- four hours weekly through the year -RRB- ; a course in Early English Lyrical Poetry from the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	times to the Reformation -LRB- three hours through the year -RRB- ; and a History of Early English Metrics .

		An additional course is given on Early English Palaeography intended as a general introduction to the '' Schrif twesen '' of
Old England	LOCATION	, to the reading of English MSS. , and to studies in textual criticism .

		Skeat 's Facsimiles , and a number of photographs of Old English MSS. , prepared especially for this class , are placed in the student 's hands .

		The Literary Seminary is conducted in two di - visions : one , under the charge of Professor
Hud	ORGANIZATION	- son , is devoted this year to the development of the modern novel ; the other , conducted by myself , is now pursuing a comparative study of the chief works of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	and
Browning	PERSON	, and , incidentally , of the predecessors of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, that is , of the authors to whom
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	seems either stylistic - ally or spiritually most indebted .

		It should be un - derstood that the subjects of the Seminary courses vary from year to year , and that , even when it seems best to deal with the same subject in two suc - cessive years , the method of treatment and the se - quence of topics is such that the same individual may continue the study with profit .

		I have been requested to add a few statistics .

		Last year six professors gave instruction in thirty English courses , to a total of seven hundred and sev - enty students , counting by class registration .

		The total number of individuals receiving instruction in English was not far from four hundred and fifty .

		The total number of hours per week occupied by the lectures of these six professors was fifty-one in the first and fifty-six in the second semester .

		The num - ber of lectures or recitations per week required of each professor varies from eight to ten .

		The number of students receiving instruction this year is smaller than last year , owing to the severer requirements in English composition .

		The number of professors is now five : a professor of English Literature , a professor of English Philology , an associate profes - sor of English Literature , and two assistant pro- fessors .

		There are also two '' assistants in English , '' and additional appointments are contemplated .

		On these phrases , referred to below as A and B , I purpose to remark briefly .

		With B , denoting relinquishment , A was , for a con - siderable time , occasionally made one in signification .

		Of producible proofs of this , here are four followed by a quotation in which '' part from '' is noticeably ar - chaistic : '' From all parts of the Hand the people come unto us , bring - ing all such things as they had , to wit , sheepe , cockes , etc. .

		For B , importing , contextually , personal separation , as in '' I parted with him , '' I have at hand quotations , dated from before
1600	DATE	to our own day , numbering up - wards of a hundred .

		From first to last , however , among authors of mark , few have employed it at all freely , while many such authors have shunned it wholly .

		In Gold - smith , negligent as he is in his diction , I have noticed it but once , and but once in the thousands of pages be - queathed to us by
Southey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet Mr.
R. O. Williams	PERSON	, in THE DIAL for
Jan. 1	DATE	, roundly avers that it `` has been classical English for three centuries . ''

		There are industrious and observant students that know better .

		Dr.
O. W. Holmes	PERSON	writes , '' I remember a young wife who had to part with her husband for a time . ''

		Object - ing to '' part with '' here , I have said that '' part from '' should be substituted for it ; and because of my having said so , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	pronounces that '' sometimes '' my judgments '' seem arbitrary . ''

		My objection was made two and twenty years ago .

		Fashions in language change rapidly ; and , therefore , it does not surprise me that ,
1894	DATE	, 1 find myself obliged to alter , in part , my criticism of
1872	DATE	.

		Though , as I could show from books , '' part from '' him , or her , etc. , was common at that date , one very rarely hears it now-a-days , at least in English society .

		Indeed , it is , apparently , on the way to become , before very long , almost as outworn as '' part from '' a place .

		They parted , '' etc. , that is to say , mutually , is , how - ever , still as current as ever .

		The humbler class of people hereabouts , including the most illiterate , continue , as might have been ex - pected , to use what Mr.
Williams	PERSON	calls a '' pedantic af - fectation , '' namely , '' I parted from him , '' and practically ignore `` 1 parted with him . ''

		I think it worth mentioning , too , that , in a batch of 680 essays which I have had occasion to go through within a few weeks , I came on the like of '' I parted from him '' and '' I parted with him '' only once each , but on '' we parted , '' etc. , repeatedly .

		In fact , so infrequent at present is '' part with '' for leave , '' '' take leave of , '' '' be absent from , '' '' go away from , '' etc. , and so infrequent has it been for the last fifty years , more or less , that it must be ranked , as is 41 never so , '' among those second-rate archaisms which the best writers of recent times have generally avoided .

		I am convinced , moreover , that any wide and heedful reader of English literature will share this opinion with me .

		As to the distinction which Mr.
Williams	PERSON	professes to have discovered between '' part from '' and '' part with , '' he may be assured that , when he has investi - gated further , he will see it to have no foundation but fancy .

		Neither of the combinations , by the by , occurs anywhere in the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		The approved uses of '' part with '' may here appro - priately be enumerated .

		Primarily , it is a material thing that is parted with , by which is meant that one divests oneself of it by gift , sale , or loan .

		Further , one speaks of parting wit h a servant ; and
Lord Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	writes of James II .

		that `` he parted in anger with his
Parlia	PERSON	- ment , '' when he dispensed with it by prorogation .

		One may say , too , with
Tom Jones	PERSON	, '' I feel my innocence , my friend ; and I would not part with that feeling for the world . ''

		Nor , again , need one hesitate to copy the ex - pression of
Tom Jones	PERSON	, where , alluding to the prospects of his odious rival ,
Blifil	PERSON	, he protests to
Sophia Western	PERSON	, `` Indeed , I can never part with you ; indeed , I can not . ''

		Permissible , finally , is '' part with , '' for '' have done with , '' in the ensuing quotation , concluding this tedious letter : `` I shall only tell you , before I part with this city , ... that as I was one day coming forth from my Inn , '' etc. .

		THE EDUCATIONAL VIEW OF MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read with peculiar interest and gratification your excellent editorial on '' Modern Language Teach - ing and Sprachmeisterei '' in the last issue of THE DIAL .

		It will be encouraging to modern-language men to know that they have the moral support of your journal in their efforts to educate `` the well-meaning but not highly-intelligent public '' up to the educational view of this question .

		More than college instructors must the less fortunate teachers in the schools contend with the rather crude , one might say stubborn , belief that the chief aim of the studying of a modern language is the ability to speak it .

		This ability is , however , not to be scorned ; but the attempt to acquire it , if it must be ac - quired in this country , may be relegated to '' conversa - tional clubs , '' quite apart from the regular class-room instruction and Seminar conferences .

		The really pro- gressive teachers in this profession hold that the study of foreign languages and literatures should not only give us an insight into the best that has been thought and said by other nations , but that , among other things , it should lead us to a better conception of humanity and consequently to broader human sympathies .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The correspondent in your last issue who found con - solation for the recent fire at the World 's Fair grounds in the supposed destruction of the Egyptian Obelisk , whose Latin inscription has so affronted his scholarly sensibilities , will regret to learn that he was premature in his rejoicings .

		The obelisk still stands ; and its of - fending inscription which moves your correspondent to remark that a Freshman in one of his college classes would be '' sent out of the room '' for offering such work , and that the
Exposition Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	responsible for it might do well to '' get themselves edited '' before they again '' set up a monument to be read by the nations of the earth '' is still plainly to be read : so plainly , in - deed , that a comparison of it with the version given by your correspondent reveals no less than eleven errors made by him in copying .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Eije Books * SOME PICTURES OF NAPOLEOX THE MAN .

		*
M. Arthur Levy	PERSON	's `` The Private Life of Napoleon , '' essentially a collection of logically - ordered extracts taken verbatim from the au - thorities and welded into a continuous narra - tive in the style of
M. Saint	PERSON	-
Amand	ORGANIZATION	's popular books , should prove no less attractive to the general reader than useful to the special stu - dent .

		It is a really important work labor - saving and vastly entertaining .

		Picturesque , varied , brimming with the piquant gossip of a rarely interesting coterie and period , it presents in the compass of two moderate octavos facts hitherto sown broadcast in sources not always familiar or easy of access .

		M. Levy has cer - tainly not written without bias ; but his admir - ation for
Napoleon	PERSON	has not , so far as we have observed , resulted in a Procrustean treatment of facts .

		Of
Napoleon	PERSON	's early life an unusually satis - factory picture is given ; and in these opening chapters our confidence in M. Levy is at once awakened by the fact that he sensibly declines to see in the molehills of his hero 's boyhood mountains prophetic of his future greatness .

		Every historian , according as he has taken upon himself the character of apologist or de - tractor , has represented
Napoleon	PERSON	during his school-days either as a prodigy of youthful gen - ius , or as a sullen and obstinate child fore - shadowing the ferocious despot .

		As a matter of fact , no child would seem to have been less father of the man than was the little appointee to the royal school at
Brienne	LOCATION	.

		Napoleon was , said Chateaubriand , '' a boy neither more nor less distinguished than his fellows . ''

		Socially , his position among his schoolmates was not an agreeable one .

		Timid in the use of a language imperfectly learned during his three prepara - tory months at
Autun	LOCATION	, a native of a country but recently made French a country , more - over , then as now marked for peculiarity of manners , the little Corsican appeared odd to his comrades , and he displayed reserve towards those whom he knew to be above him in rank and fortune . ''

		I was , '' the Emperor once observed to Caulaincourt , '' the poorest of all my school-fellows .

		They always had money in their pockets ; I never .

		I was proud , and was most careful that nobody should perceive this .

		... I could neither laugh nor amuse myself like the others .

		Bonaparte the schoolboy was out of touch with his comrades , and he was not popular . ''

		Thus isolated by his poverty and by circum - stances of birth and manners , the boy naturally became , for a time at least , a chosen mark for the witticisms of the other pupils .

		The ingen - uity of schoolboys in the arts of petty raillery is proverbial , and the Brienne young gentle - men seem to have been , in this respect , no whit behind their kind .

		They called their victim '' the Corsican , '' showered upon him a thousand small indignities , nicknamed him -LRB- humorously enough -RRB- `` Paitte-au-nez '' a variant of the na - tive pronunciation of his Christian name Na - poleone .

		No doubt the child was , as Bourrienne records , '' rendered bitter by the mockery of his comrades '' ; but the bitterness did not en - gender meanness , and we learn from the same authority that
Napoleon	PERSON	, victim as he was of all sorts of bullying , always '' preferred going to prison himself to denouncing his comrades who had done wrong '' on days when , being on duty , he was charged with some special super - vision .

		Much has been made by hostile histo - rians of his threat -LRB- at the age of ten -RRB- , '' I will do your French people all the harm I can ! ''


M. Taine	PERSON	, with his occasional penchant for remote corollaries , has turned this childish outburst ta account in a way that recalls his famous logical flight from the moist climate of
England	LOCATION	to the '' huge feet '' of the natives , '' like those of wading birds , admirable for walking in mud . '

		r That
Napoleon	PERSON	's sojourn at
Brienne	LOCATION	had it * bright side appears in the following anecdote , though perhaps the story merely illustrates the truth that the scenes of one 's life , like work * in mosaic , are beautiful only from a distance t '' As the First Consul was walking one day with
Bour	PERSON	- rienne in the garden of
Malmaison	LOCATION	, he heard the chim - ing of some bells , which always had a remarkable effect on him .

		He stopped , listened delightedly , and said in a broken voice : ` That reminds me of my first years at
Brienne	LOCATION	; I was happy then ! ' ''

		There is abundant evidence that these ten - der recollections bore good fruit for his old tu - tors and school-fellows .

		No single petitioner whose claim upon the Emperor dated from the days at Brienne seems to have remained empty - handed or unsatisfied .

		Even the surly porter of
Brienne	PERSON	was handsomely installed in the lodge at
Malmaison	LOCATION	; and a Madame de Mon - tesson , who at school had placed upon
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon 's brow his first -LRB- and his most unsullied -RRB- crown , was summoned to the Tuileries , and her property , which had been confiscated , was restored to her .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 173 When the young provincial arrived at
Paris	LOCATION	it was certainly not in the guise of the future conqueror of the world .

		He looked like a new-comer ; he gaped at everything he saw , and stared in rustic amazement at the wonders of those streets and boulevards which he was one day to sweep of the threatening hordes of fac - tious sans-culottism with a murderous discharge of grape-shot and the next to fill with the signs of imperial magnificence . ''

		His appear - ance , '' said
Demetrius Comneno	PERSON	, a Corsican compatriot , `` was that of a man whom any scoundrel would try to rob after seeing him . ''

		Unlike the goblin
Marat	PERSON	and the titanic
Dan	PERSON	- ton ,
Bonaparte	PERSON	was not cast by nature in a mould suited to the role he was to play .

		Of his first appearance in uniform , M. Levy tells an amusing story : '' While awaiting his orders to join his regiment , he , in the highest spirits , as beseems a sub-lieutenant of sixteen , put on his uniform , from which all unnecessary smartness was excluded , as the state of his fortune only permitted what was absolutely requisite .

		His boots were so inordinately large that his legs , which were very small , disappeared in them completely .

		Proud of his new outfit , he went off to seek his friends the Per - mons .

		On seeing him the two children
Cecilia	PERSON	and
Laura	PERSON	-LRB- the latter was afterwards Duchesse d'Abrante 's -RRB- could not restrain their laughter , and to his face nick - named him ' Puss in Boots . '

		He did not mind , it ap - pears , for , according to one of these little wits , the Lieu - tenant took them a few days after a toy carriage con - taining a puss in boots , and a copy of
Perrault	PERSON	's fairy - story . ''

		Napoleon 's employment , in
1795	DATE	, by the all - powerful
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	may be taken as the real starting-point of his career .

		His condition at this period was , despite his services at
Toulon	LOCATION	and in
Italy	LOCATION	, sufficiently un - promising .

		He was morally and physically wretched .

		One met him , says the Duchess d'Abrantes , wandering about the streets of
Paris	LOCATION	, shabby , awkward , ungainly , his round hat thrust down over his eyes , and with his curls -LRB- known at that time as oreilles de chien -RRB- badly powdered , half combed , falling in elf - locks over the collar of the historic iron-gray coat that was one day to serve in some sort as an oriflamme or Navarre-plume to the grena - diers of
Marengo	PERSON	and Austerlitz ; his hands , long , thin , and without gloves , because , as he said , these were a needless expense ; his boots ill - made and ill - cleaned . ''

		But his glance and his smile , '' adds the Duchess , with a fem - inine eye for the lights of the picture , '' were always admirable , and helped to animate an appearance always sickly , resulting partly from the yellowness of his complexion , which deep - ened the shadows projected by his gaunt , an - gular , and pointed features . ''

		That this triste and sombre figure , haunting the streets of
Paris	LOCATION	like an embodiment of the national poverty and unrest , was to leap , as it were , in a day from want and obscurity to the throne of
Charle	LOCATION	- magne , was a prediction which the Duchess does not claim to have hazarded .

		It was
Boissy d'Anglas	ORGANIZATION	, a man whom he hardly knew , who saved Napoleon by commend - ing him to
Monsieur de Pontecoulant	PERSON	, a mem - ber of the
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	, who was charged with the direction of military op - erations .

		Matters at the War Office were in great disorder at the time , and M. de Ponte - coulant made no secret of his perplexities .

		He was discussing them one day at the Convention with d'Anglas , when the latter said : '' I met yesterday a General on half - pay .

		He has come back from the army of
Italy	LOCATION	, and seemed to know all about it .

		He might give you some good advice . '

		` Send him to me , ' said de Ponte * coulant .

		Next day there came to his room on the sixth floor the leanest and most miserable-looking creature he had ever seen in his life ' a young man with a wan and livid com - plexion , bowed shoulders , and a weak and sickly ap - pearance . '

		Boissy d'Anglas had told him that his man was called General
Bonaparte	PERSON	, but M. de Pontdcoulant could not remember this extraordinary name , but he thought that this being , notwithstanding his curious ap - pearance , had good reasoning faculties .

		< Write down all that you have told me ; put it into the form of a memorandum , and bring it me , ' he said .

		A few days later , M. de Ponte ` coulant , meeting
Boissy d'Anglas	ORGANIZATION	, said to him : ' I have seen your man , but he seems to be mad .

		He has not been near me again . ' '

		The reason is that he thought you were laughing at him .

		He expected you would make him work with you . ' '

		That need not be a difficulty ; tell him to come back to-morrow . '

		...
Bonaparte	PERSON	returned next day .

		After arguing upon the statements made in his report , the Minister said to him : ' Would you work with me ? ' '

		With pleasure , ' replied the young man , seating himself at a table . ''

		History has recorded the services rendered by
Napoleon to Pontecoulant	PERSON	, as well as his meagre requital at the hands of
the Ministry	ORGANIZATION	.

		But his star was now in the ascendant ; and the 13 Vendemiaire saw his final emergence from the cloud of poverty and neglect that had so long darkened his fortunes .

		His bearing at that crisis so momentous to
France	LOCATION	recalls
Bossuet	ORGANIZATION	's expression : `` In his bold leaps and light movements he resembles some vigorous , bounding animal that neither mountains nor precipices can arrest . ''

		In tendering
Bonaparte	PERSON	, on the eve of this death-grapple with the sec - tions , the command of the forces of the Con - vention , Representative Barras , says De Segur , gave him three minutes to reflect .

		Of the paths offered him , the one led to fortune , the 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, other to obscurity perhaps to the guillotine , whither nearly all possible political roads had so long converged ; but the ends of the paths were hidden .

		In three minutes he said to Barras , '' I accept , but I warn you that , once my sword is out of the scabbard , I shall not replace it till I have restored order . ''

		This scene occurred on the 13 Vendemiaire , at one o'clock in the
morning	TIME	, when scarcely a man had been placed or a gun mounted to repel the insurgents .

		Before daybreak every avenue to the Tuileries bristled with cannon ; and when the insurgent sections , 30,000 strong , advanced along the quays of the
Seine	LOCATION	, the rue Saint -
Honore	PERSON	, and other approaches to the scene of their former triumphs , they were met by a mur - derous discharge of grape that sounded the knell of the long Jacobin apotheosis of rags , ignorance , and human degradation in
France	LOCATION	.

		The scanty remnant of French law and order , rallied by a man of action , was at last in a posture of defence ; and less than an hour of actual fighting secured the victory to the Con - vention .

		History can point to ew victories so entirely due to the agency of one man .

		With the futile rising of the 13 Vendemiaire the history of the Revolution ends , and the epoch is in sight when the wearied peasantry , welcoming the rule of a strong hand , said , '' Now we have rest , thanks to God and Bona - parte . ''

		Unfortunately , the '' rest '' proved as illusory as the coalition .

		Splendid in his new rank , and with the pres - tige of victory , the hero of the 13 Vendemiaire made a triumphal entry into those drawing - rooms where hitherto , small and humble , marked from the rest only by his needy ap - pearance , he used to come and try to please the guests of his patrons .

		It was shortly be - fore the 13 Vendemiaire that he was presented to
Madame Tallien	PERSON	, and of all who composed her salon he was perhaps the least remarkable , the least favored by fortune .

		One evening , assuming the guise of a fortune-teller , he seized
Madame Tallien	PERSON	's hand , and '' poured out end - less nonsense . ''

		The picture is a striking one : '' The future conqueror of
Europe	LOCATION	, small and thin , his face hollow and pale , like parchment , as he said him - self , long hair on either side of his forehead , the remain - der of his hair unpowdered , tied into a queue behind , clothed in a threadbare uniform , reading the hand of her who was called ' the beautiful
Notre Dame	LOCATION	de Ther - midor . ' ''

		Notable among the amused witnesses of this odd scene was a woman '' dark-haired , lan - guishing , full of listless indifference '' whose fortunes the young officer 's subtlest palmistry would scarcely have divined .

		In five months she was to become the wife of the soothsayer ; in three years she was to become quasi-sovereign of
France	LOCATION	; and , in time , the Pope himself was to journey to
Paris	LOCATION	to crown her Empress of the French .

		It was at
Madame Tallien	ORGANIZATION	's that , after the 13 Vendemiaire ,
Napoleon	PERSON	again met Jo - sephine de Beauharnais ; and he '' fell in love with her , '' says an eye-witness , '' in the fullest sense of the word , in all the force of its fullest acceptation . ''

		Josephine 's early attitude toward her admirer may be inferred from a letter to one of her friends : `` You have seen
General Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	at my house .

		Well , it is he who is good enough to act as stepfather to the orphans of
Alexaudre de Beauharnais	ORGANIZATION	, as husband to his widow !

		Do you love him ?

		you ask me .

		No ... I do not .

		Then you dislike him ?

		No ; but my state is one of tepidity towards him that is displeasing to me , and which , from a religious point of view , would shock the goody people more than anything else . ''

		Josephine , says
M. Levy	PERSON	, was of medium height , and perfectly proportioned not so faded as the caustic
Marmont	ORGANIZATION	has it . ''

		All her movements had a kind of undulating sup - pleness , which naturally fell into careless attitudes , and imparted to her person a sort of exotic languor .

		Her pale complexion , which gleamed like thin sheets of ivory , became slightly animated under the softened reflections of large deep-blue eyes , with long lashes slightly curled .

		Her hair , of a shade of chestnut , with a wonderful sheen on it , escaped in small curls from a net fastened over it with a gold clasp , and the wayward locks added an in - definable charm to a countenance whose mobility was excessive , but always attractive .

		Her toilette contrib - uted to heighten the ethereal charm of her person .

		Her gown was of Indian muslin , and its exaggerated amplitude fell around her body in cloud-like folds .

		The bodice , draped in large pleats across the bosom , was fastened at the shoulder by two lion 's heads enamelled in black .

		The sleeves were short , and puckered over very beautiful arms , ornamented at the wrists with two little golden buckles . ''

		With this charming portrait we shall take leave of
M. Levy	PERSON	, who certainly merits the gratitude of all who desire the data to work out for themselves a fair estimate of Napoleon the man .

		Mr.
Simeon	PERSON	's translation , while it lacks polish , is generally acceptable , and the material features of the book leave little to be desired .

		THE DIAL PROBLEMS OF MUNICIPAL , REFORM .

		* The republication in book form of Mr.
Glad	PERSON	- den 's series of magazine articles on '' The Cos - mopolis City Club '' gives one a good oppor - tunity to consider the position there taken on the vital problems of municipal reform .

		Mr.
Gladden	PERSON	assumes , in the form of a story , that five directors of a public library ,
viz.	LOCATION	, a me - chanic , a clergyman , a lawyer , a teacher , and a business man , finding it impossible to secure intelligent consideration of appropriations for their institution from the city council , deter - mine on municipal reform .

		They call together , by personal invitation , about forty others , rep - resentative of the best professional , business , and artisan classes , and through committees of this body they receive from week to week val - uable reports of the good and bad conditions of the police , street , educational , and other de - partments of the city government .

		Newspaper reporters publish the proceedings , and the com - munity becomes stirred up at the revelations made .

		The committee of forty proposes such a change in the executive branch of the city gov - ernment as to lodge responsibility in a few men subject to popular control , instead of its being divided up , as in most American cities , among aldermen and commissioners .

		Thereupon the self - constituted committee drafts a new charter , giving to the mayor the appointment and re - moval , without control by the council , of a chief of police , of water service , and of every other department excepting education .

		These chiefs are to have similar power over their subordi - nates , but can appoint none that are not rec - ommended by a civil-service board .

		The objec - tion that this is a one-man power is met by the statement that the public at present is bereft of as much power as in the proposed scheme , only that at present the public can hold no one responsible for abuse of power and give no re - wards for its proper use , since it is impossible to fix responsibility .

		The book further as - sumes that the charter meets with such popu - lar endorsement that the legislature is obliged to grant it , and that under it a pure civil gov - ernment is secured , at least for the time being .

		It closes with the prediction that constant vig - ilance will be found necessary under any ma - chinery , and holds that municipal parties of the future will and ought to disagree on ques - tions as to the degree of societary or socialistic activity in matters of natural monopolies and * THE

		in the control of abuses in competitive business .

		As Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	remarks in the preface , lit - tle is said upon the importance of reforming our legislative as well as our executive depart - ments .

		This reform can hardly come until we have fewer wards in the large cities , and men elected on a general ticket in small cities , so as to secure larger constituencies and thus render probable the election of men of higher stand - ing in the community ; and , also , until we have some system of proportional or minority repre - sentation .

		In this way minorities often coin - posed of reform elements can be represented in the council , which at present is even more corrupt than the executive department .

		This interesting book admirably fulfils its purpose of presenting practical suggestions for the inception of reform work .

		It is assumed that the knowledge of corruption in street con - tracts , for example , and the failures to enforce gambling and liquor laws , etc. , will call forth an efficient demand for reform from the vast mass of the people .

		It is to be hoped that time will prove the truth of this , but doubts will sometime arise as to whether the influential classes of any large city really want any better government than they have , unless it gets so exceedingly outrageous as just now in
Chi	LOCATION	- cago ; for such better government must mean less evasion of taxation by the wealthy and less profits from public franchises .

		It is sig - nificant to note how the efforts at reform made by the mayor of
Detroit	LOCATION	have been opposed by a large portion of the leading people of that city .

		Without the hearty cooperation of the best classes of our business men , it is not likely that the reforms suggested by our author can be ac - complished unless associated , almost from the start , with demands for economic reform which will appeal to the wage-workers and the small property-owners sufficiently to arouse not merely their sympathy , but their active cooperation .

		A large portion of these classes do not care much for civil-service reform , or for securing fewer saloon-keepers and more men of business prom - inence in public office , unless they can see in this a direct stepping-stone to city ownership and reduced charges for light and street trans - portation , the abolition of the contract system on public works , taxation of everybody accord - ing to his ability to pay , the prevention of child - labor and long hours , and similar reforms .

		It is noticeable that in Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	's book these demands of the masses are supposed to wait on the attainment of administrative purity .

		This 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, is all well and good , provided municipal purity can be thus secured .

		To secure a sufficient popular support , however , it would seem as if the small home-owner and wage-worker must first be convinced that those working for polit - ical reform are in hearty sympathy with the ef - fort to obtain industrial reforms .

		To carry out many of these reforms , any very large city will doubtless require strong ward as well as cen - tral organizations , committed to the use of all the reputable portions of the Tammany meth - ods of organization .

		A great service has been done the public by this little book , which has already contributed much to the development of the promising , though yet untried ,
Civic Federation of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		AN
AMERICAN WARRIOR-BISHOP	ORGANIZATION	.

		* There is no lack of warlike prelates in the annals of the early Middle Ages ; but a warrior - bishop in the nineteenth century , and in our own country , is an anomaly sufficient in itself to justify the writing of his biography .

		There were circumstances attending the acceptance , by one of the
Southern Bishops	ORGANIZATION	, of a commis - sion in the Confederate army which make his biography an important contribution to the apologetic literature of the Confederacy .

		It is significant of the widespread conviction of the truth and justice , even holiness , of the cause for which the South went to war , that the head of the Confederate government , and the South - ern people , could set aside all conventional ideas of the Christian ministry and urge a Bishop to take up arms in defense of a prin - ciple ; and that the Bishop himself , who had twenty years before declared it incompatible with his high calling for a Christian minister to bear arms even for self-defense against rob - bery on the wild Western frontier , should con - sent to lay aside the Episcopal robes and take up the sword .

		We can scarcely imagine any other circumstances in which , in the selection of military leaders in a great crisis , attention would be turned toward the
Episcopate	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fact that
Leonidas Polk	PERSON	was a soldier by he - redity and education scarcely relieves these cir - cumstances of their strangeness .

		It is a sig - nificant fact , observable in this connection , that at the end of the struggle , many of the Con - * LEONIDAS POLK , BISHOP AND GENERAL .

		federate officers turned to the sacred ministry ; and as the general officers received one recruit from the
Episcopate	ORGANIZATION	, at the outbreak of the war , the
Episcopate	ORGANIZATION	has since received several from that army which fought for and lost a great cause .

		These circumstances are worthy of consideration , and should have the effect of modifying our judgment of the motives of the South in secession .

		Of the patriotic convic - tions of the Confederate leaders , there should be no longer any question .

		Perhaps the time has arrived when the people of the North can calmly consider this phase of the subject , and give due credit ; and should the life of '' Leon - idas Polk , Bishop and General , '' secure atten - tion to these circumstances , the delay in the preparation and publication of these volumes -LRB- only partly accounted for in the preface -RRB- will not have been in vain .


Leonidas Polk	PERSON	was born in
Raleigh	LOCATION	,
North Carolina	LOCATION	,
April 10 , 1806	DATE	.

		He entered
the University of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	in
1821	DATE	, and two years later received an appointment to a cadet - ship at West Point , whence he was graduated in
1827	DATE	.

		During his cadetship he came under religious influences virtually for the first time , and was so deeply impressed that he chose for himself a career far different from that of the soldier ; and in
November , 1828	DATE	, entered the Theological Seminary at
Alexandria	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, to begin active preparations for the ministry .

		He was ordered deacon on Good
Friday , 1830	DATE	, married shortly afterwards , and was ordained a priest the following year , being then twenty - five years of age .

		Delicate health compelled his spending a year in European travel , and several years subsequently upon patrimonial estates in
Tennessee	LOCATION	, his time - being divided between the improvement of his estate and min - isterial duties at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		In
1838	DATE	he was elected Missionary Bishop of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, and was consecrated
December 9	DATE	in that year .

		His jurisdiction embraced Ala - bama ,
Mississippi	LOCATION	,
Louisiana	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	,
Arkansas	LOCATION	, and
Indian Territory	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1841	DATE	he resigned this jurisdiction to become Bishop of the then newly-created Diocese of
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		Remov - ing his family to
Leighton	LOCATION	, an estate which he purchased in
Louisiana	LOCATION	, he began a life prob - ably common to the Southern Bishops of that time .

		That Bishop Polk was an indifferent eccle - siastical scholar , his biographer admits ; but he was in other respects a model Bishop .

		The task of organizing and building up the Church in
Louisiana	LOCATION	was faithfully performed , and its
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 177 affairs were skilfully administered .

		His abil - ity was severely tested by the events of
1861	DATE	.

		His chief anxiety was the effect of secession upon the Church of which he was the chief pastor in an important diocese .

		His view of the situation , set forth in a pastoral proclama - tion declaring that the constitution of the Pro- testant
Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	was dependent upon the integrity of the nation , and that the right of a State to secede being established , each diocese had the right to se - o cede from the general organization , and declar - ing that
Louisiana	LOCATION	was therefore an independ - ent diocese , was severely criticised by the South - ern Bishops as well as at the North .

		The provisional establishment of the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in the
Confederate States of America	LOCATION	was the result of the discussion that ensued , and the complete reunion of the South - ern dioceses with those of the North , at the close of the war , was one of the happiest events in the ecclesiastical history of our country .

		As a matter of fact , however , and from force of circumstances ,
Louisiana	LOCATION	remained an inde - pendent diocese until after the war .

		Scarcely had the affairs of the Church been arranged , when the demand was made upon the Bishop for his services in the field .

		His interest in the defense of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	Val - ley having been enlisted , he visited
Richmond	LOCATION	and the camps in the neighborhood , and saw the President of the Confederacy and members of his cabinet .

		He was , on all sides , urged to take service in the Confederate army .

		The President twice tendered him a Major-Gen - eral 's commission .

		The commission was finally issued to him ,
June 25 , 1861	DATE	.

		He set out at once for
Memphis	LOCATION	, where he took command of the military department entrusted to him .

		From that time forth he performed no Episcopal func - tions , and , excepting the baptism of two fel - low officers , abstained from the performance of even priestly offices .

		He hoped , however , soon to be relieved of his military duties and to re - turn to his '' cherished work . ''

		The phrase in which he was wont to justify his course in ac - cepting the military commission , and to express his anxiety to return to his pastoral work , he repeated a few days before his death : '' I feel like a man whose house is on fire , and who has left his business to put it out .

		As soon as the war is over I shall return to my proper calling . ''

		But this was not to be .

		He occupied
Colum	PERSON	- bus with his troops ; participated in the battles of
Belmont	LOCATION	,
Shiloh	LOCATION	,
Perryville	LOCATION	,
Stone Ridge	ORGANIZATION	, and
Chickamauga	LOCATION	, and in the
Meridian	ORGANIZATION	and
Atlanta Campaigns	LOCATION	.

		On
June 14 , 1864	DATE	, while reconnoitring upon Pine Mountain ,
Georgia	LOCATION	, a cannon-shot from the Federal lines crashed through his breast , and left him dead in the arms of his faithful friends , General
Hardee	PERSON	and General
Joseph E. Johnston	PERSON	.

		It was a wise provision to divide Folk 's biog - raphy into two volumes , the first relating the career of the Bishop , the latter devoted wholly to that of the
General	ORGANIZATION	.

		The biographer is the son of the Bishop , and was a participant in the war from the beginning to the end .

		His sym - pathies are clearly with the military rather than with the Episcopal career .

		He calls other hands to his aid in portraying the latter .

		It is wise historic foresight which devotes so much time and space to the founding of the Uni - versity of the South , whose present assured suc - cess justifies the gathering up for careful pres - ervation of all that can be learned concerning the inception of that grand scheme .

		The biog - rapher restrains a natural tendency to produce a memorial volume , filled with eulogy , and lim - ited in its interest .

		He provides an enduring contribution to the history of the times , care - fully verifying his statements by authoritative and official documents .

		In many cases his biography becomes a vindication of his sub - ject 's military theories and plans , where they have been called in question ; and it is likely to strengthen the opinion which many now hold , that , with greater unanimity among the Con - federate leaders , the struggle for the Confed - eracy might have eventuated far otherwise than it did .

		In only one case can the biographer 's sense of proportion be said to have failed .

		To the early history of the Polk family , belonging as it does to the Revolutionary period , too much space is devoted .

		And family pride prompts him to declare for the authenticity of the much - disputed Mecklenburg Declaration of Inde - pendence of
May 20 , 1775	DATE	.

		Unfortunately , the evidence which he adduces is now generally conceded to refer to an altogether different document .

		The volumes are substantially bound , clearly printed -LRB- the only typographical errors observed occur in two footnotes in the first volume -RRB- , and are furnished with an admirable index .

		The illustrations consist of steel portraits of Lieutenant-Colonel
William Polk	PERSON	-LRB- the Bishop 's father -RRB- , of the Bishop at the age of forty-four and again at the age of fifty-five , and of Lieu -
tenant-General Polk two years later	DATE	, in Con - federate gray , full-bearded and looking grizzled 178 THE DIAL -LSB-

St. John 's Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Ashwood	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	; and a double - page view of the
University of the South	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second volume has seven valuable folded maps of battlefields .

		POPULAR STUDIES ix LANGUAGE .

		* Ever since Dean Trench published his sug - gestive but wholly unscientific studies in lan - guage , a very general popular interest has been taken , both in
England	LOCATION	and this country , in etymology .

		This has shown itself in the wild etymological guesses of the newspaper and the pulpit , which have so roused the righteous wrath of Professor Skeat , in the general im - provement of our dictionaries with regard to derivations , and last but not least in the pub - lication of independent works on various lin - guistic problems .

		At first , these excursions in the realm of words were of the same aimless character as those of the imaginative Dean of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's ; but during the past ten years or more , under the inspiration of advanced Ger - man thought , many of them have assumed a more serious and systematic character .

		The latest of these serious attempts to pop - ularize the results of philological research , and also one of the most successful , is Professor
Clark	PERSON	's '' Manual of Linguistics . ''

		While the author states as his object '' to produce a vol - ume that will , with fair completeness and in moderate compass , present the main results of modern phonology , '' he has '' also sought to round it off by the addition of such supple - mentary matter as may usefully accompany the main theme . ''

		It is this '' supplementary matter , '' so modestly referred to in the pre - face , that gives to the book its chief interest and value for the general reader ; and hav - ing the general reader rather than the amateur phonologist in mind , it is this supplementary matter that will receive special attention here .

		The main phonetic problems discussed in the several chapters are Sound Eelations in Indo - European , Analogy , Ablaut and Accent ,
Grimm	PERSON	's Law , and
Sound Relations	ORGANIZATION	in English .

		Accompanying these are separate indexes of the words quoted from the different languages , together with a separate index of the English words referred to in the last two chapters .

		But even for those for whom the signs and symbols of phonology have no charms , there is * MANUAL OF LINGUISTICS .

		ample material in the opening chapter , which deals with that much-abused people , the Ary - ans , their language and culture .

		Disposing of the '' idyllic , but certainly also idealized , pic - ture of the ancient Aryans , '' with which a past generation of scholars has made us familiar , the author proceeds to state briefly but clearly the latest and most plausible theory with re - gard to the primitive state of the Indo-Euro - pean peoples : '' It must not be supposed that the original tribes dwelt as next-door neighbours within circumscribed lim - its , for they dwelt at long distances , though still in touch with one another .

		They observed various atti - tudes towards the sound-norms , had certainly much in common , but were also predisposed to change in differ - ent degrees and along different lines .

		Each family of languages , each system of sounds , had its own idiosyn - crasies . ''

		These statements assume the truth of the wave or transition theory of
Schmidt	LOCATION	, approved by
Brugmann	PERSON	,
Paul	PERSON	, and
Schrader	PERSON	.

		This theory has supplanted the old or pedigree theory of former writers , according to which there was one homogeneous Ursprache , with some - thing approaching to a dead level of uniformity , spoken by one people dwelling together in unity of speech - sound and speech-bent , from whom there hived off swarms , which , on geographical disjunction began to de - velop differences in language that separated them from the other members of their stock , swarms , however , which still comprised two or more peoples that for a long period were linguistically one . ''

		To understand this theory we must imagine the various Indo-European tribes as occupying different but adjacent territories , the spaces between being occupied by '' transition dialects , which gradually shaded off into one another and into the main languages that bounded them .

		These have died out with little or no record , and left the abrupt transitions we now encounter . ''

		Apart from its scientific value , this theory must commend itself to the ordinary non-lin - guistic mind on account of its eminent common - sense .

		It assumes for the primitive languages the same general principles that govern lan - guage growth as it is going on at the present day .

		It gives to dialectic peculiarities the sig - nificance that modern methods claim for them .

		The discussion of the culture of our ances - tors is too long and involved to permit of more than a very brief summary here .

		It is hardly necessary to state , however , that its results dif - fer widely from those referred to by our author in his opening words .

		They show , among other things , that the Aryans probably knew none of the metals save copper , that their weapons were of a very rudimentary kind , that they were not acquainted with the art of agriculture , that their dwellings were windowless huts '' made of such 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 179 materials as wood , clay , and plaited twigs , and perhaps sunk into the earth for protection . ''

		Their first clothing was probably hides , to which were later added garments made of wool .

		They '' were flesh-eaters , and further possessed some knowledge of cookery . ''

		Of special interest is the author 's account of the Indo-European family relations , and here the idealism of the earlier picture is replaced by a realism of the most extreme Zola type .

		As in many savage tribes of our own time , '' Wives were procured , in the very early days of Aryan life , when the various wandering households observed a semi-hostile attitude to each other , by capture .

		After - wards , when milder manners obtained , purchase was sub - stituted . ''

		As regards the early home of the Aryans , our author wisely contents himself with stating the various arguments in favor of a European and an Asiatic site , and leaves the choice to his readers .

		He seems to show , however , a leaning towards
Schrader	PERSON	's selection of
Eastern Iran	LOCATION	.

		The discussion of the origin of speech , with which the introductory chapter closes , is , as the author himself admits , '' slight and frag - mentary . ''

		It seems a pity that so careful and satisfactory a treatment of linguistics should be weakest in this so important and much dis - cussed point .

		It is to be hoped that in a later edition this defect may be remedied .

		The book would be further improved by the addition of a subject index , as the table of contents is not sufficiently full to take its place .

		Let us not forget , however , to be grateful for all the good things that are offered here , and most of all for the development of a more rational general in - terest in philological problems which this work seems to indicate .

		* A most interesting sketch of the life of an interesting people is furnished in

		Nansen , well known in con - nection with the first crossing of
Greenland	LOCATION	, knows the
Greenland Eskimo	LOCATION	at near quarters .

		He writes : '' I dwelt in their huts , took part in their hunting , and tried , as well as I could , to live their life and learn their language . ''

		pathetic to an unusual degree .

		The result is that he gives us a sketch of unusual fidelity .

		Nansen loves
Greenland	LOCATION	: '' It is poor , this land of the Eskimo which we have taken from him : it has neither timber nor gold to offer us it is naked , lonely , like no other land inhabited by man .

		But in all its naked poverty how beautiful it is !

		-LSB- f
Norway	LOCATION	is glorious ,
Greenland	LOCATION	is in truth no less so .

		When one has once seen it , how dear to him is the rec - ollection !

		I do not know if others feel as I do , but for me it is touched with all the dreamlike beauty of my childish imagination .

		It seems as though I there found our own Norwegian scenery repeated in still nobler , purer forms .

		It is strong and wild , this Nature , like a sage of antiquity carved in ice and snow , yet with moods of lyric delicacy and refinement ... Everything in
Greenland	LOCATION	is simple and great , white snow , blue ice , naked black rocks and peaks , and dark stormy sea .

		When I see the sun sink glowing into the waves , it re - calls to me the
Greenland	LOCATION	sunsets , with the islets and rocks floating as it were on the burnished surface of the smooth softly-heaving sea , while inland the peaks rise row on row , flushing in the evening light .

		And some - times when I see the saeter-life at home , and watch the sseter-girls and the grazing cows , I think of the tent-life and the reindeer herds on the
Greenland	LOCATION	fiords and up - lands : I think of the screaming ptarmigans , the moors and willow copses , the lakes and valleys in among the mountains where the Eskimo lives through his brief
summer	DATE	. ''

		Few descriptions of any people , in our En - glish language , are so scientifically good as this of
Eskimo	LOCATION	life ; yet it is also delightful popu - lar reading .

		There are many reasons why the ethnologist finds the Eskimo interesting .

		Scarcely elsewhere is there a race-type , pure through so great an area .

		The Eskimo of
Greenland	LOCATION	and of
Western Alaska	LOCATION	are physic - ally the same .

		So little variation is there in the language that a Greenlander might probably travel from his home to
Behring	PERSON	's Strait and make himself everywhere understood .

		Life is , in general , the same over the whole region .

		The same traditions and beliefs are found among the tribes .

		Of course there are vary - ing details .

		If we compare the Greenlander whom
Nansen	ORGANIZATION	describes with the Central Es - kimo of
Boas	PERSON	and the
Point Barrow Eskimo of Murdoch	ORGANIZATION	, we shall find many interesting little differences ; but these disappear before the won - derfully conserved similarity in generalities .

		Look the world over , and we shall nowhere find such an example of perfect adaptation to environment .

		We can not here discuss how such adaptation conies : it is there .

		It shows itself in every detail .

		Notice the skin gar - ments , the kayak , the winter house of stones and earth , the
summer	DATE	tents of skins , the spears and harpoons , the spear throw ing-stick , these are but a few examples of adjustment between 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, the Greenlander and his surroundings .

		The food he eats , his smoking lamps , the
summer	DATE	excursions along the coast , all these are exactly proper to his conditions of life .

		To change these adjustments is a misfortune ; to introduce new tastes and needs and life is a crime .

		Consider one invention the kayak .

		A problem was presented the Eskimo for solution .

		Wanted a hunting boat , easy to manage , re - quiring the least force for its propulsion , light but strong , easily righted if upturned by the billows .

		The Eskimo struggles with the prob - lem : he produces the kayak a light frame - work of wood ; a covering of sealskin usually fitted raw and drawing tightly .

		In the upper side an opening only large enough to allow the man to pass his legs and lower body through .

		Perhaps six yards in length , its greatest breadth may be but eighteen inches ; its depth is little more than six or seven inches .

		Narrowing fore and aft from the centre , it ends in sharp points .

		There is no keel .

		Across the kayak deck , in front of the ring surrounding the central hole , are perhaps six thongs , while behind there may be three to five more .

		Under these are inserted weapons , each in its proper place most conven - ient to the hand .

		To these thongs , too , the game is fastened .

		The boatman , carefully slip - ping into the kayak through the hole above , sits on the bottom , with a bit of skin for seat , cross-legged .

		With his two-bladed paddle held at the middle , and dipping into the water on each side in turn , he shoots the slender craft ahead rapidly .

		He wears the half-jacket , or the jacket , fastened to himself and to the kayak ring in such a way that dashing waves may sweep the deck without water leaking in .

		The kayak , with all its appurtenances , is so light that it is easily carried on the head .

		But the kayak is no more remarkable than the beautiful series of harpoons and spears that the Eskimo has devised .

		The throwing-stick , for hurling darts of all kinds , is ingenious .

		The modes of dressing skins , so simple in them - selves but so wonderful in their results , are ad - mirable .

		Quaint is the method of preparing bird-skins by chewing with the teeth .

		Only recently we have seen one of those marvellous robes of eider duck breasts , now such favorites in
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		It is a work of beauty and of art .

		No doubt , however , every skin has been chewed in the mouths of
Greenland	LOCATION	women .

		Teeth are worn down almost to the gums in such work .

		We can not even refer to other in - genious or interesting arts and industries of our Eskimo .

		Rink has made a special study of the tradi - tions and superstitions of the
Greenland	LOCATION	Es - kimo .

		Nansen depends largely upon him for the brief sketch he presents of this subject .

		He points out that there has been a profound European -LRB- Scandinavian -RRB- influence upon these stories and ideas .

		Scientific in this compari - son , our author is less so when he traces analo - gies , often fanciful , between the
Greenland	LOCATION	tales and those of
Africa	LOCATION	or
Polynesia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Very interesting is the great prevalence of witch - craft among
Greenlanders	ORGANIZATION	, although
Boas	PERSON	finds little of it among the
Central Eskimo	LOCATION	.

		Surely here we find some European influence .

		In witchcraft , human bones , flesh from corpses , skulls , snakes , and spiders , are used .

		Of won - derful power is a tupilek , prepared in pro- foundest secrecy of various animal bones , skins , bits of the anorak -LRB- jacket -RRB- of the man to be injured or , if it can not be secured , bits of seals he has caught all wrapped together in a piece of skin and tied .

		It is brought to life by singing charms over it .

		Then the ilitsitsok , or wizard , seats himself on a bank of stones near the mouth of a river .

		He puts his anorak on hind-side foremost , draws his hood over his face , dangles the tupilek between his legs .

		This makes it grow , and when it has gained its size it glides away into the water and disappears .

		It can transform itself into all kinds of ani - mals and monsters , bringing ruin and death upon the man against whom it is despatched , but reacting upon the sender if it fails .

		The character of the Eskimo is singularly happy .

		With no true chiefs , and no marked classes , all men are truly equal .

		The brother - hood of man is an axiom practically recognized .

		Time was , before white man - taught avarice and personal advancement , when an individual could not starve or seriously want .

		A tribe might die for want of food ; but while one had , all could claim a share .

		Crime was rare .

		Mor - ality prevailed , although not by our standard .

		-LRB- Much of the moral depravity now existing is due to the demoralizing influence of white vis - itors . -RRB-

		Even in
Greenland	LOCATION	we have harmed all that we touch .

		There are regions remote from the settlements where Eskimo life still goes on in the old and happy way .

		Nansen 's chapter on '' The Eskimo at Sea '' gives vivid pictures of it .

		We can give but one quotation : `` It is a gallant business , this kayak-hunting : it is like a sportive dance with the sea and with death .

		There is no finer sight possible than to see the kayak - man breasting the heavy rollers that seem utterly to engulf him .

		Or when , overtaken by a storm at sea , the kayaks run for the shore , they come like black
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 181 storm-birds rushing before the wind and waves , which like rolling mountains sweep on in their wake .

		The paddles whirl through air and water , the body is bent a little forwards , the head often turned half backward to watch the seas ; all is life and spirit while the sea around reeks like a seething cauldron .

		And then it may happen that while the game is at its wildest a seal pops its head up before them .

		Quicker than thought the harpoon is seized and rushes through the foam with deadly aim ; the seal dashes away with the bladder be - hind it , but is presently caught and killed , and then towed away .

		Everything is done with the same mas - terly skill and with the same quiet demeanor .

		The Es - kimo never dreams that he is performing feats of hero - ism . ''

		Our author frequently bemoans the fate of the
Greenland Eskimo	LOCATION	, and mourns that the settler and the missionary have wrought havoc to his happy life and ancient ways .

		Truth to tell , we agree with him .

		Most sympathetic non - philanthropic visitors to any barbarous race which is being made over into civilized white men wonder whether , after all , good is being done .

		Nansen says many vigorous things in this direction .

		We quote but one , and that quite mild : '' And lastly comes this question : Can an Eskimo who is nominally a Christian , but who can not support his family , is in ill health and is sinking into deeper and deeper misery , be held much more enviable than a heathen who lives in spiritual darkness , ' but can sup - port his family , is robust in body , and thoroughly con - tented with life ?

		From the Eskimo standpoint , at any rate , the answer can not be doubtful .

		If he could see his true interest the Eskimo would assuredly put up this fervent petition : God save me from my friends ; my enemies I can deal with myself . ''

		Seldom do we lay down a book so reluctantly it tells so much so well .

		No thoughtful per - son can fail to find it suggestive and helpful .

		Of course , as a piece of bookwork it is well done .

		The illustrations are unusually good .

		The translator , too , deserves no little praise .

		So well has he done his work that he really disappears from view , and we forget that the author was a Norwegian , and that we are not reading his very words , fresh from his pen .

		HISTORY OF THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN -LRB- official -RRB- .


Yokohama	LOCATION	:
Japan	LOCATION	`` Mail `` Office .

		The Japanese are our neighbors across the
Pa	ORGANIZATION	- cific , which is not an Oceanus dissociabilis to '' separate ''
Japan	LOCATION	from
America	LOCATION	, as it is ex - pressed in geography , but is a connecting link to bind the two peoples in the closest ties .

		Japan was '' opened '' by the
United States	LOCATION	; has been materially , politically , socially , edu - cationally , and morally assisted by American influences in her wonderful career of progress ; and appreciates the kindness and friendliness of our people .

		We , in turn , ought to know more of our rapidly developing protege ; and undoubtedly we learned much during the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, in which the completeness and the beauty of the Japanese exhibits elicited almost universal surprise and admiration .

		These object lessons may also have aroused a desire to know still more about
Japan	LOCATION	and the Japanese .

		A book has just been published which satis - fies this laudable desire .

		It comes in clear type from the
Knickerbocker Press	ORGANIZATION	, and is the thirty - eighth volume in that admirable series , '' The Story of the Nations . ''

		There has also been issued recently from the press of the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Mail , '' of
Yokohama	LOCATION	, an official history , com - piled under the direction of the
Department of Education	ORGANIZATION	, and translated into English by the scholarly editor -LRB- Captain
Brinkley	PERSON	-RRB- of the '' Mail . ''

		It is a good-sized book of more than four hundred pages , in large type ; it has a neat Japanese cover , and contains reproductions of pure Japanese illustrations , as well as numer - ous collotypes .

		It is a valuable work ; but as it is not easily procurable in this country , and is comparatively expensive , its circulation on this side of the
Pacific	LOCATION	will probably be limited .

		True it is , '' and pity 't is 't is true , '' with ref - erence to
Japan	LOCATION	, that of making many books there is no end '' ; but '' The Story of
Japan	LOCATION	'' clearly has a raison d'etre .

		It can not , of course , take the place of larger and more detailed treatises , like those of
Griffis	PERSON	,
Adams	PERSON	,
Eein	PERSON	, and others ; but it fills a long-felt want of an interesting and accurate connected history of
Japan	LOCATION	, of moderate size and price .

		The book contains some typographical errors , even slips in sentence-structure , and a few statements of doubtful accuracy ; but as the faults are com - paratively insignificant and superficial , while the merits are numerous and profound , the work stands as a trustworthy guide for the reader .

		The author acted for several years as Adviser to the Japanese Minister of Education , and rendered excellent service in remodelling the system of education along modern lines .

		182 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Very appropriately , he puts this residence in
Japan	LOCATION	as '' most important '' among the sources of his material .

		And it is very evident , not only from the perusal of his own work , but also from comparison with the above-mentioned official history , that he made use of the best native -LRB- `` as well as foreign -RRB- authorities .

		Thirty - five appropriate illustrations , including two maps , add instruction and interest to the fif - teen chapters of text ; and four appendices are inserted to give such valuable material as the `` list of Emperors , '' `` list of year - periods , '' '' list of Shoguns , '' and '' laws of
Shotoku Taishi	PERSON	, '' a great reformer of the seventh cent - ury A. D .

		The index can be improved ; but the titles of the chapters are , in the main , well - chosen , and make a suggestive table of con - tents .

		The object of the book is '' to trace the story of
Japan	LOCATION	from its beginnings to the es - tablishment of constitutional government '' ; and that story is well told .

		But the writer of Japanese history is con - fronted , at the outset , with a serious difficulty .

		In ancient times the Japanese had no literary script , so that all events had to be handed down from generation to generation by oral tradition .

		The art of writing was introduced into
Japan	LOCATION	, from
China	LOCATION	probably , the latter part of the
third century	DATE	A. D. ; but it was not used for recording events until the beginning of the fifth century .

		All these early records , moreover , were destroyed by fire ; so that the only '' re - liance for information about ... antiquity '' has to be placed in the
Kojiki	LOCATION	, or '' Records of Ancient Matters , '' and the
Nihongi	PERSON	, or `` Chron - icles of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		The former , completed in 711 A. D. , is written in a purer Japanese style ; the latter , finished in 720 A. D. , is '' much more tinctured with Chinese philosophy '' ; though differing in some details , they are practically concordant , and supply the data upon which the Japanese have constructed their '' history . ''

		It is thus evident that the accounts of the B. c. period must be largely mythological , and the records of the first four centuries of the
Chris	PERSON	- tian era must be a thorough mixture of fact and fiction , which it is difficult carefully to sep - arate .

		According to Japanese chronology , the Empire of
Japan	LOCATION	was founded by
Jimmu Tenno	PERSON	in 660 B. c. ; according to foreign scholars , who have sifted the material at hand , the first absolutely authentic date in Japanese history is 461 A. D. If , therefore , the Japanese are given the benefit of more than a century , there yet remains a millennium which falls under the sac - rificial knife of the historical critic .

		But , while we can not accept unchallenged the details of about a thousand years , and can not withhold surprise that even the constitution of New Ja - pan maintains the '' exploded religious fiction '' of the foundation of the Empire , we must ac - knowledge that the imperial family of
Japan	LOCATION	has formed the oldest continuous dynasty in the world , and can probably boast an '' un - broken line '' of eighteen or twenty centuries .

		Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, in `` The Story of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' fol - lowing the illustrious example of Arnold in Roman history , treats this mythological period in a reasonable way .

		He says : '' Yet the events of the earlier period ... are capable , with due care and inspection , of furnishing import - ant lessons and disclosing many facts in regard to the lives and characteristics of the primitive Japanese . ''

		These facts concerning `` native culture '' pertain to the mode of government , which was feudal ; to food , clothing , houses , arms , and implements ; to plants and domestic and wild animals ; to modes of travel ; to read - ing and writing , which were unknown ; to va - rious manners and customs ; to superstitions ; and to `` religious notions , '' which found ex - pression in Shinto , itself not strictly a '' reli - gion , '' but only a cult without a moral code . ''

		Morals were invented by the Chinese because they were an immoral people ; but in
Japan	LOCATION	there was no necessity for any system of morals , as every Japanese acted rightly if he only con - sulted his own heart '' !

		So asserts a Shinto apologist .

		And from the fact that so many myths cluster around
Izumo	LOCATION	, it is a natural in - ference that one migration of the ancestors of the Japanese from
Korea	LOCATION	landed in that prov - ince ; while the legends relating to Izanagi and Izanami , the first male and female deities , since they find local habitation in
Kyushu	LOCATION	, seem to indicate another migration -LRB- Korean or Malay ? -RRB-

		to that locality .

		These different migrations are also supposed to account for the two dis - tinct types of Japanese .

		The continental influences form an impor - tant factor in the equation of Japanese civil - ization , and are emphasized by Dr.
Murray	PERSON	.

		The Japanese `` have been from the begin - ning of their history a receptive people , '' and are indebted to
Korea	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	for the be - ginnings of language , literature , education , art , mental and moral philosophy -LRB- Confucian - ism -RRB- , religion -LRB- Buddhism -RRB- , and many social ideas .

		At first the government of
Japan	LOCATION	was an absolute monarchy , not only in name , but also in fact ; for the authority of the Emperor was recognized and maintained , comparatively
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 183 unimpaired , throughout the realm .

		But the decay of the imperial power began quite early in ''
The Middle Ages of Japan	LOCATION	, '' as Dr. Mur - ray calls the period from about 700 to
1184	DATE
A. D	ORGANIZATION	.

		The emperors themselves , wearied with the restrained and dignified life which , as '' de - scendants of the gods , '' they were obliged by etiquette to endure , preferred to abdicate ; and in retirement '' often wielded a greater influ - ence and exerted a more active part in the ad - ministration of affairs . ''

		This practice of ab - dication frequently brought a youth , or even an infant -LRB- of two years , for instance -RRB- , to the throne , and naturally transferred the real power to the subordinate administrative officers .

		This was the way in which gradatim the `` duarchy , '' as it is sometimes called , was developed , and in which seriatim families and even individ - uals became prominent .

		First came the
Fujiwara	PERSON	family , which for about 400 years '' monopolized nearly all the important offices in the government , '' but was finally deposed by the so-called '' military fam - ilies . ''

		The first of these was the
Taira	LOCATION	, who , after only a short period of power -LRB-
1156	DATE	-
1184	DATE	-RRB- , were utterly overthrown and practically annihilated .

		Next came the
Minamoto	PERSON	, rep - resented by Yoritomo , whose authority was further enhanced when the Emperor bestowed on him the highest military title , sei-i-tai-sho - ffun -LRB- barbarian-expelling-great-general -RRB- .

		And from this time -LRB- 1191 -RRB- till
1868	DATE	the emperors are practically non-entities , and great generals actually govern the empire .

		The Japanese Merovingians , however , are never deprived of their titular honor by the '' Mayors of the Palace . ''

		But the successors of Yoritomo in the office of Shogun were young and sensual , * and gladly relinquished the executive duties to their guard - ians of the Hojo family , who ruled '' with re - sistless authority '' and '' unexampled cruelty and rapacity , '' but yet deserve credit for de - feating an invading army of Tartars sent by
Kublai Khan	PERSON	.

		The great patriots ,
Kusunoki	PERSON	and
Nitta	PERSON	, with the aid of
Ashikaga	ORGANIZATION	, finally overthrew the Hojo domination in
1333	DATE	; but the
Ashikaga	LOCATION	rule succeeded and continued till
1573	DATE	.

		It was , however , an
Ashikaga Shogun	ORGANIZATION	who encouraged the quaint tea - ceremonial , called cha-no-yu ; it was '' in almost the worst period of the
Ashikaga	ORGANIZATION	anarchy '' that , in
1542	DATE	, '' the Portuguese made their first appearance in
Japan	LOCATION	'' ; and it was only
five years later	DATE	when * '' A general has no -LSB- worthy -RSB- offspring , '' says a Japanese proverb .


Francis Xavier	PERSON	arrived there to begin his mis - sionary labors .

		.

		The next few decades of Japanese history are crowded with civil strife , and include the three great men ,
Nobunaga	PERSON	,
Hideyoshi	PERSON	, and lyeyasu , each of whom in turn seized the su - preme power .

		The first named was favorable to Christianity ; the other two interdicted it .

		Hideyoshi , who '' rose from obscurity solely by his own talents , '' is regarded by Dr.
Murray	PERSON	as `` the greatest soldier , if not the greatest man , whom
Japan	LOCATION	has produced . ''

		If this statement can be successfully challenged , the palm will certainly be awarded to lyeyasu , who became the virtual ruler of the Empire in
1600	DATE	.

		He founded a dynasty -LRB- Tokugawa -RRB- of Sho - guns , who , for more than two hundred and fifty years , ruled at Yedo , surrounded by faith - ful vassals , and who at least gave the empire a long period of peace .

		His successors de - stroyed Christianity by means of a fearful per - secution ; prohibited commercial intercourse , except with the Chinese and the Dutch , and allowed it with these only to a limited extent ; and thus crystallized Japanese civilization and institutions .

		It may be true that ``
Japan	LOCATION	reached the acme of her ancient greatness dur - ing the Tokugawa dynasty '' ; but it is also true that by this policy of insulation and se - clusion she was put back two and a half centu - ries in the matter of progress in civilization .

		It was in
July , 1853	DATE	, that
Commodore Perry	PERSON	entered Yedo Bay for the purpose of deliver - ing to the Tokugawa Shogun -LRB- then supposed to be the Emperor -RRB- President
Fillmore	PERSON	's letter asking for a few tradal privileges ; and on the
last day of this present month of March	DATE	it will be just forty years since the first treaty be - tween the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	was signed at
Kanagawa	LOCATION	by the representatives of the two nations .

		This , of course , brought about , in a short time , the utter ruin of the policy of se - clusion ; for the negotiation of similar treaties with many other nations followed .

		This was also the occasion of the overthrow of the Sho - gun -LRB- '' Tycoon '' -RRB- in
1868	DATE	, and of the central - ization once more of the actual power in the hands of the Emperor .

		The real causes , how - ever , of the revolution were internal , and con - sisted partly of jealousy , and partly of a gen - uine impulse toward imperialism .

		This im - pulse had been fostered by a study of
Japan	LOCATION	- ese history , which revealed the fact that the Shogun , originally only the imperator , had usurped most if not all of the governmental functions .

		Thus the old Japanese spirit of in - 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, tense loyalty to their '' divinely-descended '' ruler once more triumphed in the restoration of the imperial authority .

		But the revolution of
1868	DATE	did not mean the restoration of the absolute despotism and the oppressive feudalism of the past .

		The lat - ter institution , by and with the consent of al - most all the feudal lords themselves , was abol - ished by an imperial edict in
1869	DATE	; and twenty years later -LRB-
February 11 , 1889	DATE	-RRB- the Emperor promulgated a constitution , by which he vol - untarily relinquished to his people many of his hereditary and time-honored powers .

		With this gracious act of His Imperial Majesty , Mu - tsuhito , the 122d Emperor '' in unbroken line '' from
Jimmu Tenno	PERSON	, not inappropriately closes '' The Story of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		For with this ends the old Oriental absolute monarchy and begins the new constitutional and representative gov - ernment .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The Lover 's Lexicon .

		It was a happy thought that led Mr.
Frederick Greenwood	PERSON	to write '' The Lover 's Lexicon '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		We must recognize as genuine literature this collec - tion of graceful essays , which is further described as '' a handbook for novelists , playwrights , philos - ophers , and minor poets ; but especially for the en - amoured . ''

		There are upwards of a hundred brief chapters upon such subjects as `` Affection , '' `` Be - trothal , '' '' Constancy , '' '' Fickleness , '' '' Marriage , '' '' Rapture , '' '' Sweetheart , '' and the like ; each an essay in itself , combining wisdom , wit , and the charm that comes from a sympathetic presentment of high ideals .

		Both in style and in subtlety the book suggests Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's `` Virginibus Puer - isque '' essays , and should stand beside that volume upon the shelf .

		The quality of the book must be set forth by illustration ; no description could do it justice .

		The article on '' Flirtation '' is thus intro - duced : `` A pastime which , like card-playing , is in - nocuous only when nothing is staked that can be missed if lost , while it is most harmful when the stakes are abstracted from partnership capital .

		The game is usually played by the ruder sex for amuse - ment alone , its chief pleasure being the titillation and excitement of vanity .

		By the other it is played for amusement too ; but also for practice in various kinds of fascination , and to satisfy curiosity as to the inner nature of men . ''

		Here is an extract from the article on '' Love-making '' : '' The effect of mu - sic on the passions is not to be measured by beauty of melody or cultivation of ear .

		In half-barbarous lands a moaning chant , a twanging of the guitar , will raise storms and languishings unsurpassed in a German beer-garden ; and then would a man en - slave the fair , let him sally forth and stab another man for love of her .

		In more savage countries hearts are won in simpler fashion , though much the same .

		The lover goes head-hunting , and on his re - turn silently but tenderly leads his beloved to view his trophies in a basket .

		We have amongst our - selves a survival from similar kinds of love-making in a chastened preference for military men . ''

		The article on '' Dolls '' yields this choice bit : '' Very few girls , however , wish to be thought dolls and nothing else .

		Even those who are nothing else have moments of conviction that to be pretty , to be bright , to be brainless and useless , puts them at a disadvantage everywhere except at picnics , at water - parties , and at church . ''

		The article '' Eros '' is brief enough to permit of quotation in full : '' The Greek name for the God of Love , who was much better known in
England	LOCATION	as Cupid till about the
end of the seventh decade	DATE	of the present century . '

		Cupid ' then fell out of favor with the literary genius of the age ; which , being of a warmer tem - perament than preceding geniuses , or desirous of seeming so , and conceiving that ' Eros ' stood for a bolder , wilder , more faun-like and abandoned sort of passion , determined that the god should have no other name either in prose or verse .

		So far , however that is to say , up to the date of the present publication the change has been coldly re - ceived by a public already prejudiced against cer - tain derivations of ` Eros ' -LRB- See art .

		` Erotic ' -RRB- . ''

		Last of all , we will reproduce the close of the arti - cle '' Love-Pledges '' : '' Yet there must be no mis - prising of love-gifts .

		They are a need , a grace , a propriety ; and whatever the first may be , it should be supplemented at the earliest convenience by a copy of that useful book , ' The Lover 's Lexicon , ' with a votive kiss on the ` Constancy ' page . ''

		In which suggestion we heartily concur .

		Society and '' The Realm of the Habsburgs '' politics of the -LRB-
Lovell , Coryell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Sid	PERSON	- Aush-ian Empire .

		ney whitman , is a singularly compe - tent and acute study of the society and the politics of the
Austrian Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		That Empire puzzles the casual observer in many ways , and a number of writers , headed by the late Professor
Freeman	PERSON	, have for a long time been somewhat frantically insisting that it has no rational right to exist .

		But it con - tinues to exist , although its raison d'etre is thus questioned , and that wonderful dynasty of the Habs - burgs , with its curious power to adapt itself to the age without sacrificing the essentials of its tradition , acts as a cohesive element no less surely than the race spirit or the centralized political structure of other nations .

		Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's sympathetic sketch of the present Emperor helps us to understand much of his influence , and to wish that other monarchs might have preserved more of the tradition of nob - lesse oblige that still shines out in the example of the
Habsburgs	LOCATION	.

		Such an anecdote as that of his telegram to the Holy Father , after the tragic occur -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 185 rence that recently darkened his life , speaks vol - umes for his character .

		The Austrians , in Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's account , appear to have preserved , bet - ter than their fellow-Europeans , those Old World virtues that go far to justify paternalism .

		Loyalty , simplicity of life , the sense of honor , and cheerful acquiescence in the order of things , are character - istic of few other peoples as they are of present-day Austrians .

		But the author , while bestowing due praise for these things , is not sparing in his criti - cism of the national faults .

		Nor does he fail to give the necessary prominence to the race-elements that make up the composite Empire .

		The Magyar , the Czech , and the German are discussed , each on his own account , and the discussion is thus summed up : '' If the Germans of
Austria	LOCATION	may be said to typify the past , the Slavs a possible future , the Hun - garians are , politically and economically at least , eminently characteristic of the present day . ''

		We do not quite understand why Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	should imply that
Berlin	LOCATION	, however much more important politically , is a more beautiful and impressive cap - ital than
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		In our opinion , the Danubian Kaiserstadt still keeps its ancient prestige , as far as outward show is concerned , and the days are by no means `` gone by when the easy-going Austrians were literally justified in singing '' : '' ` Sgiebt nur a Kaiserstadt , ` Sgiebt nur a
Wien	PERSON	. ''

		It is , however , interesting to be reminded that the Viennese have themselves recognized the claims of the Spree Kaiserstadt by adding a couplet to their old song : '' ` Sgiebt nur a Rauberstadt , Und das is
Berlin	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's book is one to be read with pleas - ure , mingled with regret that he should not have worked upon a larger scale .

		Beginnings of the '' ^ h 6 interest that attaches to the skil -
Engiish Romantic	ORGANIZATION	ful treatment of a subject in itself uninteresting is aroused by The Beginnings of the English Romantic Movement '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , a work by Mr.
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	.

		This book is a study in one of the most arid periods of our literature , but is itself redeemed from aridity by an exceptionally attractive form of presentation , by a discriminating use of texts and authorities , and by a scholarship that is accurate without being pe - dantic .

		In preparing the book , the author has gone through a course of `` desperately dull reading , '' as he hardly needed to assure us , but the result justi - fies the pains -LRB- certainly to the reader , and we hope to the author no less -RRB- , and every student of English literature should be grateful for a piece of work so thoroughly well done .

		The study covers a period of over half a century -LRB- 1700-1765 -RRB- , and seeks to trace to its obscure and varied sources the roman - ticism that was swelling towards full tide at the dawn of the nineteenth century .

		After a prelim - inary examination of romanticism itself , and of the Augustan spirit as the soil in which the seed of romanticism was sown , Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	proceeds to dis - cuss the reaction from the couplet form which cul - minated in the Spenserian revival -LRB- nearly sixty Spenserian imitations , from
1706	DATE	to
1775	DATE	, are listed in an appendix -RRB- , the Miltonic influence , the revival of interest in medievalism and mythology , and the appeal of the old ballad literature to the gradually awakening romantic consciousness .

		A final chap - ter is devoted to Gray , and a very striking series of extracts illustrates the growth of the romantic movement as epitomized in his work .

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	has taken great care in the matter of dates and like minutiae .

		Incidentally , he corrects a number of the blunders of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	; for that plausible essay - ist does not , as Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	pointed out some years ago , err in the direction of an over pe - dantic accuracy .

		An appendix puts together the facts , old and new , about the famous ballad of ''
William	PERSON	and
Margaret	PERSON	, '' and constructs an emi - nently reasonable theory of the way in which Mal - let got for himself the credit of having written it . ''

		Stelligeri '' is the first one of half - *** * y * ** Prewar Bar - rett
Wendell	PERSON	has collected into a vol - ume -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		In the old
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	catalogues , the names of deceased graduates were marked with a star .

		It is of these star-bearers stettigeri , in the quaint Latin of the Quinquennial that the in - itial essay is written .

		The other papers are occa - sional lectures on American topics .

		The author is entirely right in thinking that the papers possess a unity , although they are written on unconnected subjects .

		Lowell as a teacher ,
Whittier	LOCATION	as a poet of the Quakers , a new theory about the Salem witches , the Puritans , these are some of the themes .

		The essay on
American Literature	ORGANIZATION	is a remarkably sym - pathetic yet dispassionate attempt to decide whether we have yet made an independent and permanent contribution to English literature .

		The decision probably the decision of every careful student is in the negative ; the crucial test being this : '' Have we lasting expression of the meaning of the past periods of American life , in words which have added either thought or phrase to the literature of the English language ? ''

Wendell	PERSON	has written a book that is pleasant to read .

		His style is marked by careful lucidity , pointedness , and easy movement .

		His clearness is especially admirable when one takes into account the difficulties of some of the tasks he set himself .

		It could not have been easy , for in - stance , to interpret so plainly the leading traits of '' Four American Centuries '' in terms that should be intelligible to a child at school ; and yet it was to the school children of
Worcester	LOCATION	that the address was delivered .

		The writer 's phrases are sometimes very happy , and his analysis is often marked by keen insight .

		His comments on American humor are both apt and searching .

		It is not profound humor , he says ; it is fresh , wholesome , extravagant , but '' at bottom , after all , extravagance is only an - other term for cheerful neglect of stern reality . ''

		186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Throughout the book there is an intelligent patriot - ism that is at once a contrast and an antidote to bla - tant spreadeagleism .

		The volume , indeed , is a con - tribution to American patriotism , as well as a dis - tinct addition to our none too abundant store of true information about ourselves .

		Complete and After a vear?s dela y > thel ; e has a P ~ beauiifui edition peared , in the Dent edition -LRB- Mac - oj Landor .

		millan -RRB- , the second volume of '' The Longer Prose Works of Walter Savage Landor . ''

		This volume completes the edition of Landor for which we have given thanks upon several past oc - casions .

		There are six volumes of '' Imaginary Con - versations , '' two of poems , and two of the longer prose works a practically complete edition of a writer who will live as long as the English language , and whose audience will increase with every new gener - ation .

		We have previously expressed regret that some of Landor 's poems should have been left un - published , but the new edition , as a whole , includes enough matter not collected by
Forster	PERSON	to make it fully as desirable as its predecessor , while in me - chanical attractiveness it easily takes the first place .

		The volume now published gives us a novelty in the shape of a frontispiece-portrait of a bearded Landor .

		The text includes the '' Pentameron '' ; five additional `` Conversations , '' four of them now for the first time reprinted from the '' Examiner '' ; the three essays on Theocritus ,
Catullus	LOCATION	, and
Petrarca	PERSON	, first published in the `` Quarterly Review '' ; and an index .

		This index , which fills seventy-five pages , and covers the ten volumes of the edition , has been prepared by Miss
Lucy Crump	PERSON	, and its '' object has been to indicate as far as possible allusions to Lan - dor 's own life scattered throughout the volumes , and to illustrate his opinions . ''

		It is difficult to be -LRB- in words -RRB- sufficiently grateful for this intelligent and helpful adjunct to the edition .

		Landor 's opinions concerning men and things are always interesting and often weighty , but his work is of so miscella - neous a character that the search for some particular but vaguely-remembered allusion is almost a hope - less task .

		From the burden of that task the liter - ary worker is henceforth freed .

		If he wishes to know all that Landor wrote of Plato or Dante or
Milton	LOCATION	, of
Greece	LOCATION	or
Italy	LOCATION	, of kings or priests or religion , he has but to consult this index , which promptly reveals to him the volumes and the pages to be consulted .

		Would that such an index might accompany the collected works of every writer !

		Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	's '' The Span - Spanith Pioneers igh pi onee rs '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is a con - tn Amerwa .

		.

		?

		i cise popular narrative , based on re - cent historical investigation , of the part borne by
Spain	LOCATION	in American discovery and exploration .

		All will probably agree with Mr.
Luinmis	PERSON	that our his - tories and text-books have not sufficiently empha - sized the importance of Spanish pioneering in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		Yet we can not but think that he has been led by his love of fair play to overrate , if not the valor and endurance , at least the character and motives of the Spanish leaders men with whom gold-hunting , not colonization or the advancement of knowledge , was the predominant impulse , and the record of whose treatment of the native races we must still regard as one of the blackest chapters in the annals of man 's inhumanity to man .

		Co - lumbus was , to quote from a recent brilliant mono - graph on American history , `` the father of a line of adventurers who , like himself , were gold-seekers or seekers of lucre , gilding their rapacity with the same profession of zeal for the extension of relig - ion , who sacked
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Peru	LOCATION	, trampled to pieces there , under the hoofs of conquest , the high - est development of Indian civilization , worked to death the soft inhabitants of the American islands , and replaced them by the importation of African slaves .

		None of these adventurers looked upon
America	LOCATION	as a new home , or thought of founding a nation . ''

		The deductions indicated being made , Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's work will be found as accurate and in - forming as it is readable ; and the style , barring a slightly declamatory and dogmatic tone at the out - set , is suitable and agreeable .

		For those seeking a compact popular manual embodying the latest con - clusions on the subject treated , we can point to no better book .

		Mr.
W. J. Linton	PERSON	's biography of y
Whittier	LOCATION	in the `` Great Writers Se - ries '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , reads like a labor of love .

		There can be no doubt as to the author 's admiration for his subject .

		The familiar story of the poet 's life the boyhood on the farm , the first attempts at literature , the devotion to the abolitionist cause , the part played during war-time , the long and revered old age , all this is well told and well in - terpreted .

		The poetical history is accompanied by a running comment on the poems themselves , and special stress is laid on certain interesting points among other things , on the influence of the
New England	LOCATION	landscape in moulding
Whittier	LOCATION	's genius .

		The literary criticism is earnest and straightfor - ward independent rather than original .

		Mr.
Lin	PERSON	- ton 's forcible depreciation of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	when compared with
Whittier	LOCATION	readily suggests our writer 's point of view .

		It is uncatholic .


Whittier	LOCATION	, assuredly , can be praised , and to no man 's detriment .

		In summing up his critical opinions , Mr.
Linton	PERSON	discards orig - inality altogether , and quotes page after page from other writers .

		The last two chapters are little more than a compilation of the critical estimates of Stod - dard ,
Wasson	PERSON	, and
Stedman	PERSON	.

		`` Days Spent on a Doge 's Farm '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Margaret Symonds	PERSON	, daughter of the late
J. Addington Symonds	PERSON	, is a very charming piece of descriptive writing .

		The Doge 's Farm is situated at
Vescovano	LOCATION	, near the east of the great Lombard plain , and in the shadow of the Euganean hills .

		It is an estate that has for centuries been in possession
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 of the
Pisani	PERSON	family , and is now owned and man - aged by the English widow of a
Pisani	PERSON	who died many years ago .

		Upon this estate
Miss Symonds	PERSON	has been repeatedly a guest , and her book gives a simple and graceful account of everyday life at
Ves	LOCATION	- covano , of the country-people and their ways , and of the untiring energy of the Englishwoman who has made a garden out of a desert , and who per - sonally directs , to the minutest detail , the affairs of her little kingdom .

		The book tells us of village festivals and of mountain excursions , of life indoors and out , and of the various operations of agricul - ture , from ploughing to harvest .

		In this latter con - nection ,
Miss Symonds	PERSON	pays a worthy tribute to the magnificent Lombard oxen , whose gray and digni - fied forms are so characteristic of the landscape , whom
Carducci	PERSON	celebrated in his '' T'amo , pio bove , '' and whom the traveller always remembers , whatever else he may forget .

		Miss
Symonds	PERSON	has illustrated her book by many sketches , and she draws as well as she writes .

		In both cases she has an eye for the essentials , and the quality of the picturesque appears no less in her literary than in her graphic manner .

		General Strong in
1850	DATE	was first brought into contact with the Indians of the
Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	, and for six years thereafter he '' travelled with and among them . ''

		The interest thus aroused in the native Americans has continued , and now shows itself in the book en - titled '' Wah-kee-nah and her People '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Wahkeenah is a Yakima girl whose story the author relates .

		On one occasion she saved him from dan - ger of death .

		Knowing the Indians intimately , he loves them , and desires to present their cause from their point of view .

		He finds the Indian , when first brought into contact with the white man , ever kind , just , hospitable ; only after he has suffered wrongs does he become warlike , treacherous , revengeful .

		Starting with this idea , the author passes the vari - ous groups of tribes in review , sketching their daily life , their character , their grievances .

		The book , although not critical or scientific , will interest , per - haps instruct .

		- Mr.
J. B. Bury	PERSON	's History of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	from its Foundation to the D eatn of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, '' just issued in
Harper	PERSON	's Student 's Series , is devoted to a period of which there has hitherto existed no compact and scholarly account in English .

		Mr.
Bury	PERSON	's book is useful and in many respects excel - lent .

		Its author knows at first hand the most im - portant original sources , and has made himself ac - quainted with the views of the principal modern writers on the field he traverses .

		He has a clear apprehension of the significance of the period , and sees its relations to the earlier and later history of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		His judgment is in the main sound , and he has an evident desire to be fair to the emperors and the imperial system .

		Unfortunately , these mer - its are obscured by an abrupt and unattractive style .

		of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The facts are set forth clearly and concisely , but they are not combined so as to arouse interest or always to leave a definite and lasting impression on the reader 's mind .

		`` The Humor of
Holland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- imported .

		.

		b y Sc ` ibner -RRB- , Volume V. in the Li - brary of Humor '' series , is an amus - ing number , and it has the special merit of taking us into a comparatively new field .

		In the matter of broad , homely fun , the writers of
Holland	LOCATION	seem to be no whit behind her jovial painters
Jan Steen	PERSON	,
Teniers	ORGANIZATION	,
Brouwer	PERSON	, and the rest .

		It is indeed sin - gular that men who live on cabbage and wear six pairs of breeches should be capable of wit ; but the ways of nature are inscrutable .

		The volume is fur - nished with a critical introduction by the translator ,
A. Werner	PERSON	, and there are amusing sketches by Dud - ley Hardy and others .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A new edition of
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	's '' History of Ger - many '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- comes to us , with an additional chapter by Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	, and a portrait of the German Emperor .

		The new chapter is brief , and the work re - mains substantially as it came from the hands of its author .

		It is , we need hardly say , an excellent book both for school purposes and for the general reader .

		Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	's additions have been based mainly upon Professor
Muller	PERSON	's ''
Politische Geschichte	PERSON	der
Gegen	PERSON	- wart . ''

		Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	's Eight Illustrations to Shake - speare 's ' Tempest ' '' -LRB-
Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are published in an edition limited to 650 copies , each signed by the artist .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's designs have been engraved in fac - simile by Mr.
Duncan C. Dallas	PERSON	, and the effect is highly satisfactory .

		The plates are not bound , but each is printed upon Japanese paper , mounted and framed in a mat .

		A neat box comes with them .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's draw - ings are always interesting , and these examples of his work are strongly characteristic both of his manner and his mannerisms .

		Mr.
Justin Huntly McCarthy	PERSON	has translated nearly a hundred and fifty '' Ghazels from the Divan of Hafiz '' -LRB- Imported by Scribner -RRB- into English prose , and pleas - antly dedicated the volume to Mr.
W. E. Henley	PERSON	.

		Prose translations are well , even from the Persian , but it is hard to put up with 1 them after
FitzGerald	PERSON	and all the others who have delved in the riches of the
East	LOCATION	, and have really given us poetry for poetry .

		But Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's work is pleasing , and has clearly been a labor of love .

		There is considerable contemporary history , especially of
Turkey	LOCATION	and the
Balkan States	LOCATION	, in Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	's compilation about ``
Russia	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	in the Nine - teenth Century '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , and the work may be found useful for reference to recent events .

		It has been largely prepared by means of the scissors and the paste - pot , but the writer contrives to put her material to - gether in an attractive way , and has made a fairly con - tinuous narrative .

		A number of portraits , from
Madame de Krudener	ORGANIZATION	to Prince Ferdinand of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, add ma - terially to the interest of the book .

		188 -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' has just published ''
Sylvie	PERSON	and Bruno Concluded '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in a volume illustrated , as was its predecessor , by Mr.
Harry Furniss	PERSON	.

		Since the author informs us that he never reads the published criticisms of his writings , he , at least , will bear us no grudge for saying that the new volume is far from being worthy of the best writer of nonsense in the English language .

		In spite of such verses as , '' He thought he saw an Argument That proved he was the Pope : He looked again and found it was A bar of mottled soap . '

		A fact so dread , ' he faintly said , ' Extinguishes all hope I ' '' which occasionally enliven the pages , there is a sad de - cline from the story of
Alice	ORGANIZATION	, and even from the first volume of the work now concluded .

		We imagine it will be caviare to most children , and will find its most inter - ested readers among adults . ''

		The Building of the City Beautiful '' is a rhapso - dical prose romance by Mr.
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	, published in very tasteful shape by
Messrs. Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	.

		But our spirits are a little dashed at finding upon the first page of the text one of the most familiar of Mat - thew
Arnold	LOCATION	's stanzas reprinted with no less than three mistakes .

		The author provides the other chapters with headings from his own verse , which he may misquote as much as he pleases , but we object to having a great poet treated in this fashion .

		Recent publications of the
State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	are '' A Brief History of the Elective Fran - chise in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Florence Elizabeth Baker	PERSON	; ''
The Financial History of Wisconsin Territory	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Matthew Brown Hammond	PERSON	; and '' The Significance of the Frontier in
American History	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor Fred - erick
J. Turner	PERSON	.

		We have also received a syllabus of a course of six
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	lectures on '' The Making of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Reuben G. Thwaites	PERSON	.

		This syllabus illustrates an excellent sort of work in lo - cal history that might profitably be undertaken in every
State of the Union	LOCATION	.

		Our people know far too little , as a rule , of the history of their own States , and anything calling closer attention to the subject deserves com - mendation .

		Three numbers of ''
Indiana	LOCATION	Historical Society Pub - lications '' -LRB- Bowen-Merrill -RRB- are before us .

		The first is an '' oration for the Columbian year '' on the subject of '' The Man in History , '' by Mr.
John Clark Ridpath	PERSON	.

		It is rhetorical , after the manner of orations , but not without interest .

		Another of these pamphlets is called `` Ouiatanon : A Study in
Indiana	LOCATION	History , '' and is by Professor
Oscar J. Craig	PERSON	.

		It gives the story of the ancient trading-post named in the title . ''

		Reminiscences of a Journey to
Indianapolis	LOCATION	in the Year
1836	DATE	, '' by Judge
C. P. Ferguson	PERSON	; and a `` Life of
Liba Foote	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Samuel Morrison	PERSON	, make up the contents of the third of these pamphlets .

		`` Historic Green Bay , 1634-1840 , '' by
Ella Hoes Neville	PERSON	,
Sarah Greene Martin	PERSON	, and
Deborah Beaumont Martin	PERSON	, a neatly-appointed volume of 224 pages , con - tains `` the history of Green Bay from its earliest days until the organization of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	as a territory . ''

		The little book is soberly and intelligently written , and the authors have evidently taken due pains to make it ac - curate and full .

		There are maps and illustrations , and a commendatory Preface is furnished by Mr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	, Secretary of the
Wisconsin State Hist	LOCATION	- orical Society .

		ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS .

		The books to be issued this
Spring	DATE	by American pub - lishers are given below in the usual carefully arranged and classified summary which has become a regular semi-annual feature of THE DIAL .

		It is to be noted that books already issued and received are not here an - nounced , they being entered , instead , in the List of New Books on page 195 ; hence both lists are to be included in a survey of the products and activities of the pub - lishing season .

		This survey will be a matter of peculiar interest at this time of general commercial depression .

		It is somewhat surprising to find that instead of show - ing a falling off as compared with previous years , the present list is considerably longer than that of a year ago , which was the most extensive
Spring	DATE	list we have ever published .

		There is shown also , we think , an ad - vance as regards the general interest and importance of the works included .

		From a trade standpoint , the list is of marked significance , exhibiting as it does the pre - dominance of a few old and strong houses , while many of the smaller and newer houses are but slightly rep - resented , and some of the more sensational houses are not represented at all .

		The publishing trade as a whole , however , is certainly to be congratulated on showing so few signs of the prevailing business depression .

		192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
March 9 , 1894	DATE	.

		Eighteen of the thirty parts of '' The Art of the World Illustrated in the Paintings ,
Statuary	LOCATION	, and Architecture of the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have now appeared , and all who have seen them have had an opportunity to judge of the work 's success as an aesthetic undertaking .

		The names of the official contributors to the descriptive text , Pro- fessor
Ives	PERSON	, Director
Burnham	PERSON	, and others , are well known to THE DIAL 'S readers .

		That of Mr.
Ripley Hitchcock	PERSON	, who has designed and edited the work , may not be so well known to some of them , and it seems desirable to give a little synopsis of his life and work .


Ripley Hitchcock	PERSON	is the son of the late Dr.
Alfred Hitchcock	PERSON	, a distinguished physician of
Fitchburg	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and was born in that city .

		He graduated at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1877	DATE	, and , his interest having already turned to the fine arts , he remained at
Cambridge	LOCATION	for a grad - uate course under the direction of Prof.
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	.

		Removing to
New York	LOCATION	, he soon began to write , and after filling minor positions on the '' Trib - une '' he in
1882	DATE	became art critic of that paper .

		From this time on he became identified with the art movement in his adopted city .

		He has not , however , confined him - self exclusively to art-criticism in his writings .

		Much of his summers has been spent in travelling through all parts of
North America	LOCATION	, and these journeyings have resulted in many descriptive articles .

		He has also writ - ten a good deal about out-door life and sports .

		It was in
1885	DATE	that the '' Century Magazine '' commissioned Mr.
Hitchcock	PERSON	to visit the Western cities of the country , and report upon art conditions as he found them .

		His '' The Western Art Movement '' was the result of this trip , and proved to be a revelation of the progress of the fine arts in the
West	LOCATION	.

		This work was translated and republished in L'Art .

		Besides his earliest and his latest works , Mr.
Hitchcock	PERSON	has published '' Etchings in Amer - ica , '' '' A Study of
George Inness	PERSON	, '' '' American Water Color Painting , '' and several kindred volumes .

		In
1890	DATE	he resigned his position on the '' Tribune '' to accept that of literary adviser to the firm of
Messrs. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and since that time has been manager of this firm 's departments relative to the acceptance and publication of books .

		Messrs.
Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish next week the '' Life of
Edward L. Youmans	PERSON	, '' by Prof.
John Fiske	PERSON	, a book which will at once find its way to every library in the
United States	LOCATION	pretending to a department of science .

		The extracts from Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	's letters to Pro- fessor
Youmans	PERSON	, printed in THE DIAL just after the former 's death , were taken from this volume .

		As foun - der and editor of the '' Popular Science Monthly '' and originator of the '' International Science Series , '' Pro- fessor
Youmans	PERSON	was almost the first in this country to bring science to the knowledge of the masses .

		For many years the professor and his talented wife , who has survived him , were conspicuous figures in the limited literary circles of
New York	LOCATION	, and naturally his personal presence and social abilities are greatly missed by those who knew him .

		He was succeeded as editor of the '' Popular Science Monthly '' by his brother , Mr.
William Jay Youmans	PERSON	, the present editor .

		That charming
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	,
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	, who came over from
England	LOCATION	a few years ago , and lectured in a quiet way on literary subjects new and old in
Boston	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and other Eastern cities , may not have carried back with him so many American dollars as some of the gentlemen who have since visited us under the expan - sive auspices of the veteran manager , Major Pond , but he entered the houses of most of our -LRB- really -RRB- '' best peo - ple , '' and made numerous warm friends .

		These will be interested to learn that having married and settled down in
Hampstead Vale	LOCATION	, in the northwest of
London	LOCATION	, Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	is meditating various literary ventures , some of which are approaching completion .

		His first volume of poems is already announced for publication , '' A Lon -
don Rose	PERSON	, and Other Rhymes , '' which will be brought out in all the luxury of printing and binding which per - tains to the house of
Elkin Mathews	PERSON	and
John Lane	PERSON	.

		Besides a little cycle of
London	LOCATION	poems , a love sequence , etc. , Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	's volume will contain some rhymes and ballads of
Wales	LOCATION	, in which he has made some new ex - periments with Kymric measures in English verse .

		Of the limited edition one hundred and fifty copies are in - tended for the American market .

		Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	, it will be recalled , is the editor of the '' Camelot Classics '' series .

		I remember his telling me that he belonged to a little
London	LOCATION	society , yclept '' The Rhymesters , '' the members of which met every week and were obliged to produce a poem on a given subject , and how he planned an un - pleasant '' impromptu '' surprise for them one evening in the shape of a stinging satire on their alleged '' smug - ness , '' and how they rose up as one man and drove him out into the rain , hatless and umbrellaless , to find his way home as best he could .

		There is just such a club in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, called '' The
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	, '' whose members have periodical meetings for the same purposes .

		One of these gentlemen , Mr.
Har	PERSON	- rison
S. Morris	PERSON	, the poet , was recently invited to lecture before the
Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	is himself a member of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION
Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	, but he has a realizing sense of the master 's occasional failings .

		So he treated his audience to what the
Boston	LOCATION	papers styled a '' scathing analysis '' of '' A Blot on the ` Scutcheon , '' and stirred up considerable discussion thereby , doubtless to the benefit of the down-east dilet - tanti .

		Oddly enough , I saw not long since an announce - ment of Mr.
Morris	PERSON	's first volume of poems , to be brought out by the Lippincotts in dainty style next
fall	DATE	.

		So these two young Arcadians seem to have much in common , though so widely separated .

		Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	has varied his labors on the Putnam edition of
Jefferson	PERSON	's writings , now going through the press , with the editing of a new and , as far as possible , complete edition of the writings of
John Dickinson	PERSON	, the ''
Penman	PERSON	of the Revolution . ''

		The work , in three volumes , will be published by the Historical Society of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		Two volumes will contain the political writings , and a third will be devoted to
Dick	PERSON	- inson 's correspondence , which , with many political papers now first collected , has been gotten together by Mr.
Ford	PERSON	during five years of research .

		Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	, who has been visiting us , has writ - ten from
Mexico	LOCATION	announcing his safe arrival in that city , and his intention of returning to
New York	LOCATION	by way of
Havana	LOCATION	and
Florida	LOCATION	.

		I learn from Messrs.
Stone	PERSON	and
Kimball	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, that Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's fine sonnet-sequence , `` A Lover 's Diary , '' which I had the good fortune to see in manuscript , will soon be out .

		Messrs.
Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have announced his new novel , '' The Trespasser , '' for the last of
March	DATE	.

		THE DIAL 193 TjITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		Messrs.
Gopeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	will soon publish a volume of '' Vagabond Poems , '' by Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	and Mr.
Richard Hovey	PERSON	.

		`` The Bookman '' makes the astonishing statement that no book of Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	has ever been translated and published in a foreign language . ''

		La Patrie , '' a French Canadian paper , has recently been threatened with the ban of the church for announc - ing `` Monte Cristo '' as a feuilleton .

		Mr.
Evelyn Abbott	PERSON	, a Fellow of
Balliol College	ORGANIZATION	, and well known as the author of a history of
Greece	LOCATION	, will prepare the biography of the late
Benjamin Jowett	PERSON	.

		Colonel
T. W. Higginson	PERSON	has nearly completed his '' Military and Naval History of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, '' writ - ten under appointment from the Governor of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		A good story is told by
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	, illustrating the attitude of the French Academy toward him . ''

		It often happens , '' he says , `` that letters from foreign countries are addressed to me at the French Academy , in the supposition that I am one of its members .

		These letters are almost always returned to the post office with the remark , ' Unknown to the French Academy , ' writ - ten on the envelope .

		There is no harm in this , since the post office knows where to send my correspondence .

		But the formula is droll .

		I have often given evidence of its authenticity . ''

		Messrs. Stone and
Kimball	PERSON	make the very important announcement of a complete edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	, in ten vol - umes , with critical introductions to the several works by Mr.
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	, and a biography by Professor
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	.

		It gratifies one 's sense of the eternal fitness of things that just these two men should have agreed to cooperate in the production of this edition .

		There will be a portrait and fac-simile illustrations , and , in the case of the large-paper edition , eight drawings by Mr.
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	.

		There never has been even a respectable edition of Po , but the one now promised is likely to be everything that could be desired .

		Reference has already been made in these columns to the fine bronze monument provided by Mr.
George M. Pullman	PERSON	to commemorate the
Chicago Massacre	ORGANIZATION	of
1812	DATE	, and erected on the site of that historic incident the lake shore at
Eighteenth	LOCATION	street .

		The monument was formally unveiled in
June	DATE	last ; and an account of the ceremonies has , very appropriately , been published by the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, to whose charge the monument was transferred by Mr.
Pullman	PERSON	.

		The most important feature of the volume is the address of Mr.
E. G. Mason	PERSON	, the President of the Society .

		It is a care - fully-studied and spirited account , in small compass , of the tragic occurrence and the causes that led to it .

		The volume contains , also , the address of ex-President Har - rison , delivered on the same occasion ; and there are some excellent views of the monument in photogravure .

		The new Chaucer , upon which Professor
W. W. Skeat	PERSON	has been at work for twenty-five years , will be published in six volumes , to appear in rapid succession during the present year .

		The work represents the unremitting labor of a quarter of a century .

		It is a complete edi - tion of all the genuine works of Chaucer , whether in prose or poetry .

		It contains an entirely new text , founded upon the best manuscripts and the earliest printed editions .

		It is the first modern edition -LRB- not counting mere reprints from the old black-letter copies -RRB- which contains the whole of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		Various readings are recorded wherever they have any interest or value .

		The requirements of metre and grammar have been carefully considered throughout .

		Besides these , the phonology and spelling of every word have received particular attention , the spelling being , in fact , a fair guide to the true old pronunciation .

		The present edition is therefore the first that adequately represents the author 's words .

		A complete commentary accom - panies the whole , in which
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's indebtedness to
Boccaccio	LOCATION	,
Statius	LOCATION	,
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Boethius	PERSON	, etc. , is duly pointed out .

		In the notes every difficulty has been considered .

		The glossary is of exceptional fulness ; and all necessary indexes are appended .

		The English price of the vol - umes is fixed at sixteen shillings each , but subscriptions for the set , with advance payment , may be made for three guineas .

		The
American Folk-Lore Society	ORGANIZATION	is about to under - take an extensive scheme of publication , under the name of `` Memoirs of the American Folk-Lore Society . ''

		The first volume of this series , to be published in
March	DATE	, will be `` Folk-Tales of
Angola	LOCATION	, '' by
M. Heli Chatelain	PERSON	.

		The work , which , together with an explanatory intro - duction , will give in original text and literal translation the oral literature of the
West African Coast	LOCATION	, will be the first published representation of the ideas , emo - tions , and moral sentiments of races from which has been derived a great part of the negro population of the
Southern States	LOCATION	, and will therefore have an im - portant bearing on American history .

		Among other works intended to continue the series are collections of the French Creole tales of
Louisiana	LOCATION	, and of the Cur - rent Superstitions still found in great mass among the English-speaking population .

		Persons interested in the work of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	will gladly be received as mem - bers , the annual fee being three dollars , giving the right to a copy of the organ of the Society , the '' Journal of American Folk-Lore '' -LRB- quarterly -RRB- .

		A subscription of
ten dollars	MONEY	to the publication fund will include the membership fee , and entitle the subscriber to all the publications of the Society , including the Memoirs , of which it is proposed to issue several numbers annually .

		Persons wishing to become members , or subscribe to the publication fund , should address the permanent secre - tary , Mr.
W. W. Newell	PERSON	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		A NEW STORY OF PROFESSOR
JOWETT	PERSON	.

		Prof.
N. M. Butler	PERSON	, in '' The Educational Review , '' tells the following story of Professor
Jowett	PERSON	: `` A few years ago he was one of those who extended an invita - tion to the Extension students to meet at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		De - siring to find lodgings for some of them at Balliol Col - lege , he suggested to the dons that it would be a grace - ful thing for them to vacate their rooms for a fortnight , and allow him to assign the rooms thus set free to the visitors .

		The dons demurred , looking upon such a prop - osition as an invasion of their ancient and honorable privileges .

		The Master , however , had other weapons at his disposal besides persuasion .

		He had sole control of the chapel services and of the buttery .

		The former he lengthened very considerably , and the resources of the latter were reduced to the lowest ebb by his con - nivance .

		This policy had the desired effect , and the dons began to leave town for a holiday .

		As the last of them disappeared in the direction of the railway station , weighed down with hand-luggage , the Master rubbed his hands and said : ` This kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting . ' ''

		THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	,
GENEVIEVE GRAHAME GRANT	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
George Rowswell Grant	PERSON	, who died on the twenty - seventh of last month , was a woman of rare character and accomplishments .

		She was the daughter of Mr.
Fernando Jones	PERSON	, one of the earlier among the
Chicago	LOCATION	settlers .

		Much of her life was spent abroad , and few women have compassed so varied a social experience within so brief a term of years .

		Her acquaintance with people of literary , artistic , and other sorts of distinction , in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, as well as in this country , was extraordinary in its range .

		She was the founder of the
Twentieth Century Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and acted as its secretary from its beginning in
1889	DATE	to the time of her death .

		She was an occasional contributor to THE DIAL , one of her articles being a review of the '' Journal '' of
Marie Bashkirtseff	PERSON	, made particularly interesting by the fact of her acquaintance with the young Russian artist .

		Her literary work was of a fugitive sort , and but the earnest of what she might have accomplished had she lived .

		As it is , she will live chiefly in the memory of her many friends , but they will not easily forget her winsome disposition , her bright clear intelligence , or the never-failing charm of her presence and her conversa - tion .

		BLESSING A NEWSPAPER ESTABLISHMENT .

		The office of '' The Triluvian , '' a newspaper published at
Trois Rivieres	ORGANIZATION	, in
Lower Canada	LOCATION	, has recently been blessed in regular form by the authorities of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ceremony is thus described by the paper concerned : '' His installation being almost completed and the re - pairs which he had to make to our establishment being ended , our proprietor , Mr.
P. V. Ayotte	PERSON	, like a man careful of his responsibilities , and being conscious of his duties as a master who believes and acts accordingly , invited his
Grace of Three Rivers	ORGANIZATION	to come and bless his different workshops .

		Monsignor acceded with good grace to the desire , and , with that perpetual goodness which tempers the austerity of his life and the author - ity of his word , he called us together all around him in the editorial office of this paper .

		Monsignor , who was accompanied by
Canon Cloutier	PERSON	, cure '' of the cathedral , after having recited the customary prayers , made the tour of the different departments , which he blessed while he said the ' Miserere . ' ''

		The idea is a good one , although our own newspapers would not take to it kindly .

		To be '' blessed '' is the last thing that most of them would wish for .

		A WORD FROM
MR. BESANT	PERSON	ON
CHICAGO	LOCATION	AND THE WEST .

		Mr.
Walter Besant	PERSON	, writing in the
London	LOCATION	'' Author , '' makes the following comment apropos of our recent effort to secure the free importation of English books : '' THE DIAL of
Chicago	LOCATION	has made an attempt to ' enlist the friends of culture , irrespective of party , in an effort to secure the removal ' from the
United States	LOCATION	tariff law of the duty on books in the English language .

		The editor sent round in various directions a large number of blank petitions , which were filled with signatures and presented to the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		It must be remembered that this kind of work is far more arduous than it would be in this country on account of the great distances , and the difference in the .

		average of culture in the several States .

		For instance , not to be invidious , no one would expect in
Texas	LOCATION	the same intellectual stan - dards as in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		The result of the petitions is not yet apparent ; probably they were only expected to clear the way for another and a bolder attack .

		It is , however , remarkable though not astonishing that this movement should originate in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		We may look I firmly believe to the West , of which
Chicago	LOCATION	is the natural centre , for many great things in literature and in art .

		The youth and vigor of the place ; the suc - cess of the place ; the resolve of the young men and maidens to achieve what can be achieved by study and effort ; the wealth of the place , which secures all that can be obtained in learning and teaching ; even the sep - aration of the place from the old continuity of English literature ; the things that have already come from the place all lead me to look on
Chicago	LOCATION	as a centre of literature and art in the immediate future . ''

		BALLADE OF MAISTRE FRANCOYS RABELAIS .

		The following `` ballade , '' by Mr.
Showell Rogers	PERSON	, is reprinted from the
London	LOCATION	'' Author . '' ''

		Over a jolly chapter of Rabelais . ''


R. BROWNING	PERSON	, in `` Garden Fancies . '' ''

		Come down , old friend ; too long you 've lain On yon high shelf .

		You 're dusty ?

		Phew !

		Certes , I hear you answer plain , ' A judgment for neglect , pardieu ! '

		Ne'er fear , you 'll always get your due , Tho ' times go not the easy way , When lusty clerics gave the cue ; Eh ?

		Master Francois Rabelais ? ''

		Fair abbey gardens of Touraine Long spoil 'd , bloom in your page anew ; Old
France	LOCATION	unrolls her wide champaign For great Gargantua 's jovial crew ,
Sly Panurge	LOCATION	, Pantagruel too , And proud Thelema 's mad array : Their legend ' What thou Wilt , that

		MR.
GOLDWIN	PERSON	SMITH ON A '' SCHOOL OF ENGLISH LITERATURE . ''

		Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	comments upon the new
Oxford School of English Literature	ORGANIZATION	in the following not over-enthusiastic terms : '' The last new project is a School of English Literature .

		In English literature are included , we must presume , all the great English writers , grave or gay .

		What is to give shape or sub - stance to such a school ?

		Is Anglo-Saxon to be its backbone ?

		Anglo-Saxon is a proper subject for the pro- fessorial chair , which is at present most worthily filled , but as a general study it is meagre , having for peo - ple in general little more than an etymological value , nor does it seem likely to be effective in the way of intellectual training .

		It was said by a Member of Con - gregation that the School of English Literature would be , in the American phrase , ' a soft option . '

		But Ox - ford dreads unpopularity and the imputation of being behind the age .

		This is partly the nemesis of her op - position to progress in her Tory and High Church days .

		The cat was probably let out of the bag by the Mem - ber of Congregation who advocated the creation of the school in the interest of ' the ladies . ' ''

		225 THE APPROACH TO LITERATURE .

		An excellent educational method , much in vogue among the more progressive of modern teachers , is based upon the principle of pro- ceeding from the near and the familiar to the strange and the remote .

		It is a method that may be pushed to extremes , but it is funda - mentally sound .

		In geography , for example , a child starts with the schoolhouse , the village , and the surrounding country made familiar by his wanderings , and afterwards extends to scenes unvisited the construction thus begun .

		In history , the happenings of the day , as nar - rated in the newspapers and talked about by his acquaintances , provide the starting-point .

		In seeking to arrive at a comprehension of the nature and workings of government and the organization of society , his attention is first di - rected towards the town-meeting , which he has possibly seen at work ; towards the policeman or the constable , whom he has learned to rec - ognize as the embodiment of executive author - ity before having learned the meaning of that term ; or towards the tax-collector , about whose visits certain ominous associations have clus - tered , before the function of that persona non grata has been realized .

		Is there not in the method thus illustrated a suggestion worth putting to the uses of liter - ature ?

		May not the young be led to a true perception of literary values by just this pro- cess of smoothing the ways that - lead to a cor - rect taste , this device of fitting the conscious achievement to the earlier unconscious one ?

		Those having occasion to observe young peo - ple who are going through the educational mill know that literary taste and a genuine delight in '' the authors '' are not common , that they are the exception rather than the rule .

		Yet most children have , in the earlier stages of their school life , some germ of literary appre - ciation that needs nothing more than careful nurture to be brought to flower in the later stages .

		But when they come to the serious study of literature in school or college , it pre - sents itself to them as a part of the '' grind '' ; it must be pursued in a certain prescribed way , which is likely enough the wrong way ; it is treated as if it were geometry or linguistics ; 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, and the needs of the individual are lost sight of in the application of the system .

		It seems to us a fundamental principle that anything like rigidity in the methods employed for the teaching of literature and the develop - ment of literary taste will necessarily prove fatal to success .

		In physics or in philology , the '' course '' is a perfectly rational device ; it is of the essence of training in such subjects that the work should be logical in its development .

		The path of least resistance is in them the same , or nearly the same , for all normally con - stituted minds .

		It is obviously the path to be followed , and the treatment of a class en bloc becomes not only possible but desirable .

		With literature the case is very different , and the path of least resistance must be discovered for each individual separately .

		The imagination is a wayward faculty , and atrophy is likely to follow upon the attempt abruptly to divert it into channels other than those it listeth to seek .

		The facts of literature may be apprehended by the intellect thus constrained , but that emo - tional accompaniment which makes of litera - ture a personal message to the individual , which enshrines it , along with music and religion , in the most sacred recesses of the soul , is not to be coerced .

		Mere didactics are as powerless to impart the message of literature as they are to impart the message of music or of religion .

		The reward of such an attempt may be theology or counterpoint , formal rhetoric or literary his - tory ; but not that spiritual glow which is the one thing worth the having , that kindling of the soul which comes , perhaps when least ex - pected , with the hearing of some ineffable strain , or the reading of some lightning-tipped verse .

		There are many , no doubt , poor in emotional endowment , and unresponsive to the finer spir - itual vibrations aroused by the masterpieces of verbal art , to whom literature has hardly more meaning than nature had for the yokel of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's hackneyed ballad .

		To one of this class , if he do not actually look upon Homer from the standpoint of Zoilus , or share in lago 's view of the character of Othello , it is at least true that the last agony of
Lear	PERSON	is nothing more than the death of an old man ; for him the solemn passing of QEdipus '' To the dark benign deep underworld , alone '' is only a sort of hocus-pocus , and his ears are deaf to the '' Sudden music of pure peace '' wherewith the stars seal the successive divis - ions of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's threefold song .

		But even for such as these the case is not altogether hopeless .

		The appeal of literature to the human soul is so manifold that it must find in every nature some pipes ready to be played upon .

		Dull though the sense may seem , it is at some point waiting to be quickened .

		For literature is life itself , in quintessential ex - pression ; how then can it fail , in some of its many phases , to have both a meaning and a message for every human being ?

		The earliest responsive vibrations may be rudimentary in character , and combined in the simplest of harmonies .

		The heart may first be stirred by some bit of sentiment that would be accounted cheap by a refined taste ; the imagination may first be fired by some grotesque M'drchen , or by some wildly improbable tale of romantic ad - venture .

		The ripest literary taste has such be - ginnings as these , and the surest appreciation of literature is built upon such a foundation .

		Between the child , made forgetful of his sur - roundings by the spell of ''
Robinson	PERSON	Crusoe '' or the '' Arabian Nights , '' and the man , find - ing spiritual refreshment in Cervantes or Mo - liere , renewed strength in
Milton	LOCATION	, or solace from grief in
Tennyson	LOCATION	, there is no real break ; the delight of the child and the grave joy of the man are but different stages of the same growth , and the one is what makes possible the other .

		How far this development may go is a prob - lem to be worked out for each individual sep - arately ; and there are doubtless , in each case , distinct limitations .

		What we have sought to emphasize is just this individual nature of the problem , and the fact that regimentation offers no solution that can be accounted satisfactory .

		The approach to literature is , in our current educational systems , hedged about with so many thorny obstructions that not a few young persons start bravely upon it only to fall by the way , disheartened at sight of the forbid - ding barriers erected by historical , linguistic , and metrical science , for the purpose of taking toll of all wayfarers .

		Whatever the useful - ness for discipline of such subjects , the spirit of literature is not to be acquired by making chronological tables , or tracing the genealogies of words , or working out the law of decreasing predication .

		We may even sympathize to some extent with those who so revolt from all such methods as to refuse literature any place in the educational scheme .

		Turn the young person loose , they advise , in a well-stocked library , and let him develop his own tastes in nis own way .

		He will make mistakes , they admit ;
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201 there will be false starts not quickly righted ; but there will be , in the long run , a wholesome development of taste , and a steady ascent to higher levels of appreciation .

		In any case , as - similation will not be forced , and conventional judgments will not be made to parade as per - sonal convictions .

		This view has the one great merit of allowing full scope to individualism , but to admit that it speaks the last word would be to abandon altogether the position that ed - ucational theory is bound to maintain .

		That the young may profit by the guidance of the older and wiser is as true in literature as it is in any other of the great intellectual concerns .

		But the needs of the individual must be rec - ognized as they are not now recognized , if lit - erature is to play its proper part in education .

		Each case must be made the subject of a spe - cial diagnosis and a special prescription .

		We might apply to this problem the favorite form - ula of one of the schools of modern socialism : '' From every man according to his ability ; to every man according to his needs '' al - though it is curious to see a socialist precept doing service in an individualist cause .

		ENGLISH LITERATURE AT
CORNELL UNIVERSITY	ORGANIZATION	* At

Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	, are made the central figures .

		The lec - tures are given daily , except
Saturday	DATE	, and to the same class , so that there are about two hundred lec - tures given during the academic year .

		A large portion of the class are special students who have come to devote most of their time to English Liter - ature .

		They , accordingly , do a great deal of read - ing in connection with the lectures .

		It is made a special object of the lectures to bring the students into direct relationship with the authors treated , and hence much reading is introduced .

		The literature is presented mainly in its essential character , rather than in its historical , though the latter receives at - tention , but not such as to set the minds of students in that direction .

		appreciation of what is essential and intrinsic , be - fore the adventitious features of literature fea - tures due to time and place be considered .

		What is regarded as of great , of chief importance , indeed , in literary study , in some of our institutions of learn - ing , namely , the relations of works of genius to their several times and places -LRB- miscalled the Philosophy of Literature -RRB- , is of the least importance , so far as culture , in its truest sense , is concerned .

		Litera - ture is thus made chiefly an intellectual and phil - osophical study ; its true function , namely , to quicken the spiritual faculties , is quite shut off .

		An exclu - sively intellectual attitude is taken toward what is a production of the whole man , as a thinking , emo - tional , imaginative , moral , and religious being , a production which can be adequately responded to only by one in whom these several attributes are , in some degree , active ; and literary education should especially aim after their activity ; should aim to bring the student into sympathetic relationship with the permanent and the eternal with that which is independent of time and place .

		There is danger , too , in presenting literature to young people in its historical relations , and in '' phil - osophizing '' about it , of turning out cheap and pre - mature philosophers .

		A work of genius renders the best service when it is assimilated in its abso - lute character .

		All great works of genius are inti - mately related to the several times and places in which they were produced ; and it is important to know these relations , in the proper time when the '' years that bring the philosophic mind '' have been reached , not before .

		But it is far more important to know the relations of these works to the univer - sal , to the absolute , to that which is alive forever - more , by virtue of which alone they continue to live .

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, in her ''
Aurora Leigh	PERSON	, '' speaks of great poets as '' the only truth-tellers now left to God the only speakers of essential truth , opposed to relative , comparative , and temporal truths ; the only holders by His sun-skirts , through conventional grey glooms . ''

		The mode in which genius manifests itself , at cer - tain times , in certain places , and under certain cir - cumstances , may be explained to some extent ; but the genius itself can not be explained .

		Environ - ments stimulate or suppress , they do not and can - not make genius .

		The causes which bring it nearer to the essential world than men in general are brought , we can not know .

		The explanation which can be given of its mode of manifestation should be called the Physiology , not the Philosophy , of Literature .

		And how is the best response to the essential life of a poem to be secured by the teacher from the pupil ?

		I answer , by the fullest interpretative vocal rendering of it .

		f On the part of the teacher , two things are indispensable : first , that he sympathet - ically assimilate what constitutes the real life of the poem ; second , that he have that vocal cultiva - tion demanded for an effective rendering of what he has assimilated .

		Lecturing about poetry does 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, not , of itself , avail any more for poetical cultivation than lecturing about music avails , of itself , for mu - sical cultivation .

		Both may be valuable , in the way of giving shape to , or organizing , what has pre - viously been felt to some extent ; but they can not take the place of inward experience .

		Vocal inter - pretation , too , is the most effective mode of culti - vating in students a susceptibility to form that unification of matter and manner upon which so much of the vitality and effectiveness of expressed spiritualized thought depend .

		There is no true estimate , among the leaders in the educational world , of what vocal culture , worthy of the name , costs ; and the kind of encouragement which it receives from them is in keeping with their estimate .

		A system of vocal training should be in - stituted in the lower schools which would give pu - pils complete command of the muscles of articula - tion , extend the compass of the voice , and render it smooth , powerful , and melodious .

		A power of varied intonation should be especially cultivated , as it is through intonation that the reader 's sympa - thies are conducted , and the hearer 's sympathies are secured .

		The reading voice demands as much , and as sys - tematic and scientific , cultivation , for the interpre - tation of the masterpieces of poetical and dramatic literature , as the singing voice demands for the rendering of the masterpieces of music .

		But what a ridiculous contrast is presented by the methods usually employed for the training of the reading voice , and those employed , as in conservatories of music , for the training of the singing voice !

		To return to the other wRrk in the
Department	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature at Cornell : Readings are given by me every
Saturday	DATE	morn - ing , throughout the academic year , from English and American prose writers .

		These are open to all students and to any visitors who may wish to avail themselves of them .

		The attendance is generally large .

		The selections read are chiefly such as bear upon life and character , literature and art .

		The present year they have been , thus far , from essays of
George Eliot	PERSON	, Professor
Dowden	PERSON	, Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Frances Power Cobbe	PERSON	, and some other es - sayists .

		The regular members of the class after - wards read for themselves the compositions entire from which the selections are made , and many are inspired to read further from the same authors .

		There are four English Literature Seminaries , devoted , severally , to nineteenth century prose not including novels , seventeenth and eighteenth cen - tury prose not including novels , novelists of the nineteenth century , and novelists of the eighteenth century .

		The seminaries are open to graduates , spe - cial students , and to undergraduates who have main - tained a high rank in the lecture courses .

		A work is assigned to each member of a seminary , of which he or she makes a careful study , and embodies the result in a paper which is read in the seminary and afterward discussed by the members , each member having been required to read in advance the work in hand .

		The papers bear chiefly , almost exclu - sively , on what is understood by their authors to constitute the life , the informing spirit , the moral proportion , the motives , of the works treated .

		The merely technical is only incidentally , if at all , treated .

		The present year , essays have been read on all the novels of
George Eliot	PERSON	, and her poem '' The Spanish Gypsy , '' the seminary consisting of twenty-seven members .

		All the essays have been of high merit , showing much insight into
George Eliot	PERSON	's `` interpretation of life . ''

		It should be added that twelve Plays of Shake - speare are read by me during the present academic year , so cut down as to occupy two hours each in the reading .

		It is purposed so to read , in a sep - arate course , next year , the thirty-seven Plays , two hours a week to be devoted to each play .

		I would also add that by the end of the present year I shall have read entire , with requisite comment , to an outside class composed of graduate and special students ,
Browning	PERSON	's '' The Ring and the Book . ''

		The educating value of this great poem is of the highest character , embodying , as it does , the poet 's ideal of a sanctified intellect .

		MR.
HENRY CAREY BAIRD	PERSON	AND FREE BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I think THE DIAL departed from its usual fairness and courtesy in its criticism of Mr.
Henry Carey Baird	PERSON	, in the issue for
March 1	DATE	.

		1 .

		It is hardly to be assumed that such a man as Mr.
Baird	PERSON	would advocate a measure which could prop - erly be characterized as '' stupid . ''

		2 .

		May not Mr.
Baird	PERSON	's opinion be based on the ob - vious fact that since the organization of this government its legislation has been consistently based on the idea that it should favor the citizens of this country in pref - erence to the rest of the world , while during all that time English books have persistently and urgently ad - vocated the reversal of this practice , and argued that the legislation should operate on all alike should favor the foreigner as much as the American ; and that such has been their influence that one of the great parties of the country is trying to reverse the legislation of a cen - tury ?

		May not this induce Mr.
Baird	PERSON	to oppose grant - ing this literature special favors ?

		3 .

		As an abstract proposition , may not Mr.
Baird	PERSON	be unable to see any good reason why the products of the English printing-presses and publishing-houses should be admitted free of duty , that does not apply as well to products of her looms and workshops ?

Columbus	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
March 15 , 1894	DATE	, -LSB- Not to appear insensible to the good opinion of our correspondent , we give space to his communica - tion .

		We had not thought of charging Mr.
Baird	PERSON	with a penchant for stupid measures , nor , on the other
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 203 hand , can we go quite so far in our correspondent 's way of thinking as to believe that a stupid meas - ure , in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or elsewhere , becomes divested of its stupidity by the mere fact of Mr.
Baird	PERSON	's ap - proval .

		And of all possible reasons for prohibiting the importation of foreign books , we think the very worst one is that given by our correspondent as held by Mr.
Baird	PERSON	,
viz.	LOCATION	, that because certain books contain ideas and doctrines that happen to be dis - tasteful to one class of citizens , the use of these books should be forbidden to citizens of all classes ; and not these books only , but every kind of books science , history , poetry , fiction , or religion com - ing from the offending country .

		Even the Russian system of literary censorship could hardly equal this .

		It may be true we are afraid it is that Mr.
Baird	PERSON	is '' unable to see any good reason '' for making a distinction between books and scientific apparatus the means and implements of scholar - ship and knowledge and mere material manufac * tures .

		But this can hardly be offered as a reason why such a distinction should not be seen by others , nor why it should not be generally recognized by the enlightened sentiment of this and other civil - ized countries .

		On page 103 of your issue of
February 16	DATE	, a corre - spondent calls attention to a '' time-honored '' misprint in the text of Burns .

		Unfortunately , most of the edi - tions of Burns are full of misprints , owing largely , it would seem , to the fact that one of the earliest and most complete collections of the poet 's works was set up in
London	LOCATION	by men who evidently were unfamiliar with the Scottish language .

		I refer to
Currie	PERSON	's edition in four volumes -LRB- 1801 -RRB- .

Providence	LOCATION	has saved from the threaten - ing element .

		Heaven forbid that even that vagary of the stone-cutter should suffer wrong at my hands .

		The furnishing of a copy was intrusted to a friendly news - paper reporter .

		Of the '' eleven errors , '' ten have merely to do with the graphic form of a single charac - ter , and in no wise with its value or meaning .

		Not of this nature were the indicated solecisms which drove their iron into my soul .

		My informant reported con - fidently an error in gender which did not exist ; but the Commissioner will surely absolve from malice a transcription which omits one combination even more impossible than those noted .

		Without compromising my rigorous ideals of scholarship , I say frankly that I conceived nobler uses of my time than in collating that sort of material with the minuteness of an Umpf enbach 's
Terence	PERSON	.

		But let not my Freshman screen himself be - hind such a tu quoque '' as a defense .

		One is so accustomed to regard the

Tycho Brahe	PERSON	to find a number of mistakes , both as to facts and spelling .

		It is stated there that '' on the death of his father his uncle sent him in

		PROFESSOR
EDUARD ZELLER	PERSON	, who succeeded to the chair of philosophy at
Berlin	LOCATION	on the death of Trendelen - burg in
1872	DATE	, reached his eightieth birthday on
January 22	DATE	.

		He has retired from active service as a professor , Dr.
Karl Stumpf	PERSON	, formerly of
Munich	LOCATION	, having accepted a call to take the place thus left vacant .

		Professor
Zel	PERSON	- ler 's career has been a remarkable one in many ways .

		With the single exception of
Lotze	LOCATION	, perhaps no teacher of philosophy in
Germany	LOCATION	since
Hegel	PERSON	and
Herbart	PERSON	has exercised an influence equal to his .

		And yet he pro- fessed to teach no system of his own , but rather to ex - pound and criticise by the historical method the main problems of philosophy and the answers proposed to them .

		His literary style is remarkably good , and as a lecturer , while monotonous in his manner of delivery , he is decidedly interesting .

		Like
Schelling	PERSON	and
Hegel	PERSON	,
Baur	PERSON	and
Strauss	PERSON	, he is a Suabian .

		His early training was largely theological , and both
Baur	PERSON	and
Strauss	PERSON	were among his earliest university teachers .


Baur	PERSON	's in - fluence and example led him to the study of early
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , and from that it was a short step to the history of Greek philosophy .

		The latter subject , originally taken up as a means to an end , proved to be his life - work .

		His '' Philosophic der Griechen '' in six volumes all of which have passed through three editions , and some through as many as five is a recognized stan - dard .

		Its accurate scholarship , wide research , and con - stant subordination of speculation to interpretation , com - bine to make it in many ways a model of good historical writing .

		Some of his most important critical contribu - tions to modern philosophy are contained in his `` Vor - trage und Abhandlungen , '' of which three volumes have appeared .

		204 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, MEMORIALS OF Two ENGLISHWOMEN .

		*
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's expression , '' the eminent fine spirit of our type of aristocratic perfec - tion , '' becomes fairly intelligible and specific as one reads the new work entitled '' The Story of Two Noble Lives , '' three comely volumes containing the memorials of two amiable , beau - tiful , and gifted , if scarcely illustrious , sisters ,
Charlotte	LOCATION	,
Countess Canning	ORGANIZATION	, and
Louisa	LOCATION	, Mar - chioness of Waterford .

		The author , or rather the editor , Mr.
Augustus J. C. Hare	PERSON	, preludes his rather copious and rambling account of his heroines ' ancestry with an anecdote which may be quoted for its humor , if not exactly as an illustration of Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's phrase : '' Lady
Elizabeth Lindsay	PERSON	was one of a strange pro- cession of children who were met in a desolate road in
Scotland	LOCATION	, walking in single file , headed by the eldest boy , who was carrying the baby , gipsy-fashion , on his back .

		They were the eleven children of Anne , Coun - tess of
Balcarres	LOCATION	, making their escape from her harsh treatment , and going forth to seek their fortunes in the world .

		One of the younger boys had displeased his mother , and she had ordered a footman to throw him into the pond in front of the house .

		He managed to scramble out , and she desired that he might be thrown in again .

		Once more he clambered out , and she shouted , ' Throw him in again , ' when , with comic solemnity , the child looked up in her face and exclaimed , ' Woman , wad ye droon your ain son ? '

		and she desisted , but forthwith the children determined to make their escape . ''

		Despite the Spartan severities of their mother -LRB- whom the radical reader will naturally at once set down as a type of her class -RRB- , Lady Bal - carres 's children , including , one hopes , the hero of the horse-pond '' grew up wise , clever , cultivated , and God-fearing men and women . ''

		One of the daughters was the Lady Anne Bar - nard , celebrated as the author of that most pa - thetic of Scotch ballads , ''
Auld Robin Gray	PERSON	. ''

		The song made the greatest sensation at the time , its popularity extending even to
France	LOCATION	: '' ' Voila Vauteur dufameux roman de ''
Robin Gray	PERSON	, '' ' people used to say in
Paris	LOCATION	when Lady Anne visited it .

		When she had written most of the poem she could not tell how to bring the climax about , and read it to her sisters .

		< Mak the coo dee , ' said her little sister
Eliza	PERSON	- beth . ''

		This inventive sister , Lady
Elizabeth Lind	PERSON	- say , was married , in

Hardwicke	PERSON	's third daughter , Lady
Elizabeth Yorke	PERSON	, mar - ried , in
1816	DATE	, Lord
Charles Stuart	PERSON	, British Ambassador at
Paris	LOCATION	, afterwards Lord
Stuart de Rothesay	PERSON	; and this brings us down to Mr.
Hare	PERSON	's heroines proper ,
Charlotte	LOCATION	and
Louisa Stuart	PERSON	, children as the epitaphs phrase it '' of the above . ''

		Into these genealogical de - tails our author plunges with a zest , a parade of titles , and a general reverential suggestion of
Mayfair	LOCATION	,
Belgravia	LOCATION	,
Burke	PERSON	's `` Peerage , '' and the like exalted matters , that might , perhaps , have drawn the fire of Mr.
Thackeray	PERSON	, and will doubtless prove seductive to not a few Ameri - can readers .

		It was , we learn , a matter of surprise to their friends that the daughters of the plain Lord
Stuart de Rothesay	PERSON	and his plainer wife should turn out so beautiful .

		In celebrating the charms of the younger sister in particular , Mr.
Hare	PERSON	is prodigal of adjectives , but it must be ad - mitted his raptures are fairly borne out by the portraits submitted .

		At seventeen
Louisa Stu	PERSON	- art was duly '' presented at Court , '' and about the same time her mother took her to be painted by
Hayter	PERSON	.

		The courtly painter used after - wards to describe the effect produced on him when Lady Stuart de Rothesay '' took off her daughter 's bonnet and let down her hair . '' ''

		I was , '' he said , '' dazzled by a vision of the most supreme loveliness , robed in a rippled vestment of golden hair , reaching far below her knees . ''

		So far , however , from being spoilt by the ad - miration she excited ,
Louisa Stuart	PERSON	would seem to have been surprisingly unconscious of it . ''

		It is recalled , '' says our author , '' as an in - stance of her entire absence of self-conscious - ness at this time , that one evening , going up a stair-case to a ball , she exclaimed , '
Mamma	LOCATION	, do look at that girl with the handsome profile , ' when her mother saw with amusement that she had not recognized her own reflection in a mir - ror . ''

		One would like to believe that story .

		While hardly a
Penelope	LOCATION	in point of suitors ,
Lady Louisa	LOCATION	seems to have had the usual quota , among them the Duke of
Hamilton	LOCATION	, '' the hand - somest man of his day , '' and a certain rhym - ing Lord
Maidstone	LOCATION	, who , on meeting her again many years after the day on which she had sent him away disconsolate , penned the following lines .

		They have a pleasant ring of the old Annuals , with their '' sweet
L. E. L.	PERSON	's , '' and '' Persons of Quality . '' ' '

		And after many years we met , And we were all alone ; I looked into her glorious face As one gazes on a stone .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 205 '' The vision of my youth was flown , The silver cloud was rent , The wheel was broken at the fount , The strong delusion spent . ''

		More fortunate than
Lord Maidstone	LOCATION	was the
Marquis of Waterford	ORGANIZATION	, whom Miss
Stuart	PERSON	met at a tournament in
Scotland	LOCATION	, in
1839	DATE	.

		He had been known in youth as the '' wild Lord Waterford , '' and , devoted as he was to hunting and sport , he seemed to have little in common with the spirituelle art-loving daughter of Lord
Stuart de Rothesay	PERSON	. ''

		But from the moment , '' says our author , '' when her glorious beauty flashed upon him at the
Eglinton	LOCATION	tournament , he was her devoted knight , and only lived to win her . ''

		Like many men of his type , Lord Waterford was extremely diffident , and he shrank from a proposal till his sister had paved the way for him by a letter to Lady Stuart de Rothesay : '' ' I have had the most extraordinary letter , Loo , from Lady
Sarah Ingestre	PERSON	, ' said Lady
Stuart	PERSON	one day ; ` it is a proposal for you from her brother , and , of course , I must lose no time in writing a refusal ' ; and much was she astonished when her daughter said , Oh , but ... wait a little ; I should like to think about it first . ''

		The tenor of the young lady 's reply certainly leaves little doubt as to the sequel .

		The mar - riage took place on
June 8 , 1842	DATE	, in the royal chapel of
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Hare	PERSON	presents the details of the ceremony , and the imposing roll of titled personages who graced it by their presence , with becoming unction .

		Touching the appearance of the bride , a young girl who was present wrote , prettily enough , to Lady Hardwicke : '' It was
Louisa	PERSON	, who at that moment appeared in sight .

		By some accident her mother had moved from her side , and she sk > od alone , like a glorious picture of a poet 's bride , in the arch of the chapel door , which had the effect of framing the costly picture .

		There she stood motionless , with her white robes and her long bridal veil , which covered her from head to foot .

		It was impossible to distinguish a feature , but the form was that of a marble statue of Beauty veiled ... She looked extremely pale , and for a moment seemed to have lost all consciousness of what was before her .

		Every - one said softly , ' Look !

		Look ! '

		the gentle music of the organ commenced a hymn of praise , and we held our breath lest the least earthly sound should make that heavenly vision glide away . ''

		The account of Lord and Lady
Waterford	ORGANIZATION	's administration of their vast estate of Curragh - more forms , we need scarcely say , a bright chapter in the annals of Irish landlordism ; and towards the lovely bride that he had won , the knight of the
Eglinton	LOCATION	tournament never wav - ered in the most loyal and chivalrous devotion .

		There was no cloud upon their married life .

		Forgetting his irregular past as if it were a dream , the `` wild Lord Waterford '' entered hand in hand with his wife into all her schemes for ameliorating the lot of those about them , and their efforts were crowned with success .

		Lady
Waterford	ORGANIZATION	's whole heart was in
Curragh	LOCATION	- more .

		Not less than six hundred men found employment on the estate , and to these men and their families she was ever the Lady Boun - tiful , the wise and unobtrusive instructress , the ministering angel in the house of suffering and want .

		Mr.
Hare	PERSON	details many of her use - ful works and benevolences , of her lesser chari - ties done in that Christian wise in which the left hand knoweth not what the right hand doeth . ''

		To introduce habits of cleanliness into the Irish cab - ins , she would often go thither to make the beds herself , to show how it ought to be done , and would give per - sonal lessons in cleaning the rooms ... She gave them lime to whiten their walls , seeds for their gardens , and prizes for the best vegetables and most neatly-kept houses , whilst supplying their wants in many other ways .

		... To beautify the houses of the Irish poor , as well as to make them more wholesome and comfortable , was one of Lady Waterford 's greatest wishes . ''

		Lord
Waterford	ORGANIZATION	's tragic death , in
1859	DATE	, was a severe blow to the Curraghmore tenantry .

		A victim at last to his ruling passion , he was killed by a fall from his horse in the hunting - field , near
Castlemorris	LOCATION	,
County Kilkenny	LOCATION	.

		The injury was at first thought to be slight , for he lay , said his groom , '' in his hunting-dress quite unbruised and beautiful '' ; but it was soon seen to be fatal , and this truly worthy and generous nobleman breathed his last on the spot where he fell . ''

		-LCB- Oh , then , ' said the faithful groom , ' there was an awful wail , though we would none of us believe it .

		... Dr.
O'Ryan	PERSON	rode on to break the terrible news to my Lady , and he met her driving her two white ponies up to the door , all gay and happy , and told her at first that my Lord had broken his thigh-bone and was very much hurt ; but she saw by his face that it was worse than that , and said so , but he could not speak to her .

		Then she went away to her own room and locked herself in .

		When she knew by the cries and sobs in the court - yard that my Lord had been brought home , and when night was coming on , she ordered everybody away from her , and she looked on his face once more : but what my Lady did that night we none of us knew . ' ''

		There were those , however , who knew what Lady Waterford did that night , and the nights following , when the body lay in state in one of the state bedrooms of the castle .

		Throughout the week she remained locked in her chamber by day ; but when the night came , and the watchers were gone , taking her palette and brushes , '' she stole down the silent passages to 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, the room where he lay , and she painted her dead husband in his last sleep , '' patiently and lovingly transferring his features to the can - vas , till the coffin-lid shut them away from her forever .

		A letter written at this time by Lady
Waterford	ORGANIZATION	is a touching example of Christian resignation , and faith in the transitoriness of even the last of these earthly partings . ''

		I must tell you how merciful God has been to me , how tenderly He has dealt at this terrible time .

		I can say with truth that He has let me rest myself on His pitying breast .

		... I can feel that God has ordered all things rightly , and that I owe Him only the deepest thankfulness for the many happy years He gave me , and the recollections that I love to dwell on , and , in the fatal moment , how much mercy too .

		I feel sure there was no suffering ; there were no hopeless hours of agony ; and oh !

		his beautiful dead face !

		Dear
Jenny	PERSON	, you never saw such an expression of peace and happi - ness , and not a scar only a calm and lovely sleep , the face in perfect health , not even the hue of death . ''

		Soon after the burial of her husband , Lady Waterford left Curraghmore forever , taking up her residence at
Highcliffe	LOCATION	, in
Hampshire	LOCATION	, and afterwards at her seat of
Ford Castle	ORGANIZATION	, in
Northumberland	LOCATION	, where her last years were spent , and where she died
May 11 , 1891	DATE	.

		The good works begun at Curraghmore had been carried on at
Ford	ORGANIZATION	; and after her death they wrote from there of how her coffin was borne to the churchyard on the shoulders of her own laborers . ''

		When her things were being dis - tributed , the distributors were surprised to hear that ' the odd man ' most earnestly begged for something : it was for her old sealskin jacket .

		It was thought a singular request at first , but he urged it very much : he ' should treasure the jacket as long as ever he lived . ' '

		The '' odd man , '' it seems , had once been walking by her donkey-chair in the road , when they found a female tramp lying in the ditch , ill and deserted .

		Lady Waterford at once got out of her chair , and helped the man lift the poor woman into it .

		Then she took off her own jacket , and put it on the sick woman , and walked home by the side of the chair , '' tend - ing and comforting her all the way . '' ''

		But it was not , '' said the '' odd man , '' '' it was not my lady 's putting her jacket on the woman that I cared about , but that she did not consider her jacket the least polluted by having been worn by the tramp - for she wore it afterwards herself '' In sketching , in a slight way , the career of this truly good Samaritan , we have lost sight of the elder sister , Lady Canning a character no ss worthy of Mr.
Hare	PERSON	's liberal encomiums .

		Her husband ,
Charles John	PERSON	,
Viscount Canning	PERSON	, was Governor-General of
India	LOCATION	at the time of the mutiny , and her letters and journals cov - ering that period are of considerable dramatic and historical interest .

		We subjoin a letter -LRB- which is not without its analogies for the American reader -RRB- regard - ing the course of the Anglo-Indian Press at a time when tact and a soothing of popular anx - iety might well seem even to the promoters of a '' commercial enterprise '' to rise to the dignity of a public duty . ''

		The English Press has been very bad civil enough , usually , to C. himself , but running down others .

		That , however , is not the mischief : it points out all sorts of imaginary reasons and grievances as causes for mutiny , it spreads alarm , and shows up weakness , and gives in - formation , which , translated , may do untold mischief among the natives ... Treachery is not worse than such exceeding folly . ''

		The following extract is not without a cer - tain tragico-humorous aspect : '' Dr.
Leckie	PERSON	was on board the second flat to-day , and saw one of the American -LRB- Presbyterian -RRB- missionaries from
Allahabad	LOCATION	.

		Four of these and their wives were saved by taking refuge in the fort .

		They had a print - ing-press , and large schools .

		The printers ,
Moham	PERSON	- medan boys they brought up themselves , smashed the whole concern to atoms with delight !

		and hunted out the native Christians , and a great many , who were em - ployed as servants , were killed . ''

		To the varied mass of letters and journals entrusted to him , Mr.
Hare	PERSON	has supplied a thread of sympathetic , at times eloquent , nar - rative ; and his work as a whole affords a close and a very attractive view of English upper - class life , manners , and character .

		A feature of the work is the illustrations , several of them after original drawings from the gifted pencil of Lady Waterford .

		THE DIAL 207 is made striking and novel by the accompani - ment of the successive maps of the times .

		It is fascinating to follow upon these maps the slow development of correct ideas of the geog - raphy of our country , and to note the strange delusions in regard to it which so long held sway over the minds of men .

		By the aid of these charts can be realized , more forcibly per - haps than in any other way , the infinite toil and pains by which the truth was reached at last .

		With curious sensations one beholds the appear - ance and disappearance of rivers and lakes , their sudden shifting of locality , the upheaval and subsidence of mountains , and other start - ling changes of the map-makers , which seem to belong to the era of the formation of the globe and to be geological rather than histor - ical .

		And almost with a feeling of awe do we trace the development in human thought of the image of a New World from the chaos in which it lay , almost without form and void , to the par - tial perception of its magnificent proportions .

		At first believed to be only a group of islands on the shores of far Cathay , then but a barrier to the ocean approach to
Asia	LOCATION	almost as con - tracted throughout as at the
Panama Isthmus	LOCATION	, again simply a narrow rim of land inclosing a vast interior sea or an immense archipelago filled with channels , later a part of the Asiatic continent , and for almost two centuries deemed chiefly important because possibly affording a water-way to
China	LOCATION	, even in
Count Frontenac	LOCATION	's time the main outlines of the region east of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	alone were known , and the vast ter - ritory west of the Father of the Waters re - mained for later days to explore .

		It may be , as Mr.
Winsor	PERSON	suggests , that Co - lumbus , at his death in
1506	DATE	, was not ignorant that the geographical conditions revealed by his discovery were those of a new continent ; although the evidence seems hardly sufficient to establish this .

		At all events , the compre - hension of the fact came very slowly to his suc - cessors .

		The two great valleys of the Missis - sippi and the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, leading to the very heart of the New World , and practically unit - ing where
Chicago	LOCATION	now stands , lay invitingly open ; yet it was full forty years after the land - ing of
Columbus	LOCATION	before either stream was as - cended .

		The
Spaniard Pineda	PERSON	, seeing the mouth of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	in
1519	DATE	, did not enter it , because it was too far from the tropics to find gold therein .

		French and Portuguese fisher - men , and English sailors as well , made some claims to a knowledge of the
St. Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	very early in the sixteenth century , but our author does not consider them well founded .

		We ar - rive at certainty only when we come to the voy - ages of
Jacques Cartier	PERSON	, who made the circuit of the
Gulf of St. Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	and mapped its shores in
1534	DATE	, and ascended the river St.
Lawrence	PERSON	as far as
Hochelaga	LOCATION	, the site of Mon - treal , in
1535	DATE	, giving the name by which both river and gulf came to be known to a bay on the northern shore of the latter .

		Nine years passed before there was any recognition of
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	's discoveries in a printed map , and for the rest of the century there was little addition to the knowledge he brought back to
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Many maps were put forth based upon his descrip - tions and embodying various theories .

		One of these , published in
1570	DATE	, was by a famous Flemish geographer ,
Abraham Ortelius	PERSON	.

		A copy of this , lately presented to the
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	, has attracted attention because sup - posed to have a name like that of
Chicago	LOCATION	in - scribed near the site of our city .

		It is evident , however , that the word in question Chilaga is derived from
Hochelaga	LOCATION	; and it is placed on
Ortelius	ORGANIZATION	's map near the junction of the
Ottawa	LOCATION	and
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, in the neighborhood in which
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	found the Indian village of that name .

		Champlain 's era in
Canada	LOCATION	, from
1615	DATE	to
1635	DATE	, added the
Ottawa	LOCATION	route , the upper
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, the region of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	and
Lake Huron	LOCATION	, to the cartography of the period .

		Champlain visited what is now
Boston Harbor	LOCATION	in
1604	DATE	, and believed from the accounts of the natives that the River
Charles	PERSON	extended to the land of the Iroquois .

		Accordingly this stream appears , from his map of
1612	DATE	, as flowing from a source southwest of
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	and well within the present state of
New York	LOCATION	.

		His great map of
1632	DATE	, representing Lakes Cham - plain ,
Ontario	LOCATION	, and
Huron	LOCATION	, also shows the
Sault	LOCATION	Ste.
Marie	PERSON	, a great lake beyond it , and the be - ginning of the Straits of
Mackinac	LOCATION	, but with
Green Bay	ORGANIZATION	moved to the north Side of
Lake Huron	LOCATION	.


Lake Erie	LOCATION	, for a long time after
Lakes Ontario	LOCATION	and Huron were well known , eluded the explorer and the geographer .

		Champlain 's earlier maps ignored it ; his later ones made it a narrow river .

		This conception of it was accepted by
Ogilby	PERSON	and other English cartog - raphers for many years .

		Jolliet , in return - ing from Lake Superior in
1669	DATE	, was the first of white men to follow its northern shore , which
Galinee	ORGANIZATION	's map , drawn in that year , de - picted , but left its southern shore a blank .


Jol	PERSON	- liet 's maps of
1674	DATE	fairly show its whole out - line ; but Hennepin in
1683	DATE	, and even in
1697	DATE	, 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, extended it southward across the Valley of the
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		Franquelin showed it correctly in
1684	DATE	, but it was hardly relegated to its proper posi - tion in the general understanding until the sev - enteenth century had nearly closed .

		Cartier and Cham plain both seem to have heard of the Falls of
Niagara	LOCATION	, but there was no adequate idea of their magnitude until Hennepin saw them in
1679	DATE	.

		He atoned for any shortcom - ings of his predecessors by making them 500 feet high !

		The journeys of Nicolet to the Wis - consin country in
1634	DATE	; of the daring coureurs de bois ,
Grosseilliers	PERSON	and
Radisson	ORGANIZATION	, to Lake Superior and the upper
Mississippi	LOCATION	in 1658-60 ; of Jolliet and
Marquette	ORGANIZATION	in 16735 , and those of La Salle and Tonty and others of lesser note , are all chronicled in this volume .

		By degrees the information obtained by these venturesome explorers reached the cartographers and cor - rected their work .

		One of these was
Jean Bap	ORGANIZATION	- tiste
Louis Franquelin	PERSON	, at that time residing in
Quebec	LOCATION	, where he held the post of King 's hy - drographer , in which Jolliet succeeded him .

		In
1684	DATE	,
Franquelin	PERSON	, who zealously gathered every discoverer 's accounts , made a great map of the interior of
North America	LOCATION	, which Park - man considered the most remarkable of all the early maps of that region .

		On this the Chi - cago river is shown with the word ''
Cheagou	PERSON	- meman '' at its mouth , with a building resem - bling a chapel , and the inscription '' 80 h , '' doubtless referring to the number of Indian lodges there .

		In
1688	DATE	he reproduced this map , with some changes , and one of these is to note a '' Ft. Chicagou '' located on the same river .

		It is known that there was a fort on the site of
Chicago	LOCATION	as early as
1685	DATE	, and it probably was built in that year , as it does not appear on
Franquelin	ORGANIZATION	's earlier map .

		Many other things of interest to all who ap - preciate the momentous and romantic history of the interior of
North America	LOCATION	might be no - ticed in the text and cartographical illustrations of this handsome volume , did space permit .

		It is summed up in the author 's inscription of his work to President
Angell	PERSON	of
the University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, which describes it as relating to '' the great valley shared by the American people with others in the North , and the greater val - ley of the interior , all their own , almost becom - ing one with the other at various points , which carry the streams of national life back and forth between the gulf which
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	opened and that other gulf which
Columbus	LOCATION	failed to comprehend . ''

		THE DIAL 209 his pillow .

		Schoolboys have thumbed its pages , who needed a dictionary to decipher its endless stores of choice and doubtful latinity , and lacked experience of life to understand its un - dercurrents of humor .

		Scholars have vexed themselves to conjecture where in the wide field of literature might lurk a line quoted , without the usual clue in the crowded footnotes .

		One such scholar , the editor of this edition , has tracked , as with hawk or hound , numberless evasive fugitives to their lair in classic , patris - tic , scholastic , or renaissance folios .

		Had not ill-health forbade him to continue his chase , he had doubtless brought home many another brush in triumph .

		A very full index has light - ened the labor of all future explorers , who , not content with straying over the fragrant meadows , desire to go deeper and make a study of this curious treatise .

		The three volumes , very unequal in bulk , each containing one of the '' partitions '' of the work upon the causes and the cure of Melancholy in general , and upon Love Melancholy and Religious Melan - choly in particular , are admirably printed .

		Very many of the passages of his own and other writing which our author , from negli - gence or caution , left in their native Latin , have been for the first time pithily Englished .

		And many an ancient worthy may turn to his neighbor on the page emerging from three cen - turies of obscurity , and cry '' Bless thee ,
Bot	ORGANIZATION	- tom , thou art translated ! ''

		The above men - tioned schoolboys will be frankly , and some other readers , whose '' old Italian , '' as the Au - tocrat calls it , has grown rusty , will be covertly grateful .

		We all read Latin like English , but it is still pleasant to see another scholar 's version of it .

		If Mr.
Shilleto	PERSON	's health had not failed him , doubtless the work in this regard had been completed , and some lack of consistency in the placing of these translations been avoided .

		None the less , the present issue , if not the '' definitive edition '' which Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	is dis - posed to demand from Oxford scholars , may be pronounced by far the most elegant and ser - viceable edition now to be procured of one of the treasures of English literature .

		To be sure ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	did not relish the ''
Anat	PERSON	- omy of Melancholy , '' and doubtless many a nerveless reader will shelter himself behind that great critic 's shield .

		But
Hazlitt	PERSON	was fas - tidious and whimsical .

		His eccentric taste , his queasy appetite , found no savor in what others relished , while detecting a special tang that allured his palate in viands that were caviare to the multitude .

		I know that many a listless ruffler of the pages of the novels and magazines , the thin essays and compressed abridgements , of this present generation , will feel lost in the dense growths of
Burton	PERSON	's jungle , and sigh for barren asphalt or clear-swept cobblestones .

		I know that this stout haggis with its '' deal of fine confused feeding '' will be to many a one as the cold sirloin and strong tankard of good Queen
Bess	PERSON	's table , offered at breakfast-time to a modern club-man , as he sips his tea and tri - fles with his toast , a puny trencherman , over his morning paper .

		I know that there are those who will quote , at the expense of this enor - mous and catholic quoter , the words of his great contemporary , and tell him that he has been '' at a feast of languages and stolen the scraps , '' that his table is laden with cold vic - tuals begged all round the welkin .

		I recognize the relief that the modern mind , impatient of parentheses , with small leisure for loiterings , can not but feel when
Burton	PERSON	lets his own cur - rent flow unimpeded , nor delays to irrigate his crops by opening endless floodgates and letting on the rush of authorities from fifteen
Chris	PERSON	- tian , and some earlier , centuries .

		One is often tempted to say to him , as to some modest and kindly host , who persists in drawing out each of the guests , not all of his own calibre , about his table , '' Will you not talk yourself , dear sir , and let these minor fires flicker on , or out , without the persuasion of your hospitable bel - lows ?

		Give us
Burton	PERSON	in undiluted potency .

		We can spare for a while Fuchsius , and Fer - nelius , and
Hercules de Saxonia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cardan and
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	are workers of magic , but there is a certain Rector of
Segrave	PERSON	and scholar of
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	to whom we would listen gladly .

		A sentence from his mouth will be as weighty as if uttered by Cappivaccius or
Jason Pra	PERSON	- tensis . ''

		What an odd fantastic company of forgot - ten worthies the '' Anatomy of Melancholy '' brings before us !

		True ,
Virgil	PERSON	and
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Tully	PERSON	and Plato , have seats at the table ; but what a throng of unnoted wits and doctors be - side !

		As one might dine to-day with some whimsical Amphitryon who loves to collect '' characters '' about his board , and set their queer tongues wagging with his out-of-the-com - mon vintages , and surprise his chance guest with contact with persons whom one `` never meets in society , '' so a reader opens his Bur - ton to find himself cheek-by-jowl with writers nowhere else to be encountered .

		As the As - syrian invader tauntingly inquired , '' Where are the Kings of
Harmath	PERSON	and Arpad , and of the city 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, of Sepharvaim , of
Hena	ORGANIZATION	and Ivah ?

		and where are the peoples of Gozan and Haran and Re - zeph , and the children of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	which were in Thelasar ? ''

		so we are tempted mockingly to ask , Who are these imposing authorities that are dumped upon us by the dozen and the score as men of substance and consequence ?

		They are like
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's furred and bearded
Burgo	PERSON	- masters , of tremendous presence , but of no rec - ognized potency .

		Who is Rodericus a
Castro	PERSON	, to be distinguished from Rodericus a Fonseca ?

		Who are
Prosper Calenus	ORGANIZATION	and Trincavellius and
Zanchius Guianerius	PERSON	and
Hildesheim	LOCATION	and
John Baptista Silvaticus	PERSON	and Laelius a
Fonte Eu	ORGANIZATION	- gubinus , that great doctor ?

		Who has read
Saint Briget	PERSON	's revelations , or the dialogues of
Caesar Vanninus	ORGANIZATION	, or that pleasant tract of Machometes Bragdedinus , or the
Hodaepori	PERSON	- cons of Jod .

		a Meggen ?

		The very names take a modern man 's breath away .

		They suggest more than mortal wisdom .

		Yet their sayings are no such mighty things .


John Smith	PERSON	and
William Jones	PERSON	in their time have said better ones .

		We nudge our neighbor and ask , Who is yon ancient sage who sits beside you ? ''

		Never set eyes on him before , I assure you , '' is the answer . ''

		One meets strange comrades here .

		All is fish that comes within the range of our good
Burton	PERSON	's drag-net . ''

		You consult the en - cyclopaedias and the biographical dictionaries .

		Ten to one , there is no entry of the famous name , or some such record as this : '' A Dutch physician referred to in the ' Anatomy of
Mel	PERSON	- ancholy . ' ''

		Ten to one , also , that if by chance a fact or two to mark the man remains , he proves no longer half so weighty as
Burton	PERSON	himself , and when you turn back to his saying it proves neither epigram nor oracle , and you wonder why with all his haul of bigger fishes the author should have picked out this sprat or smelt and sent it to the frying-pan , and served it in his lordly dish .

		All that is true enough ; but presently your insignificant neighbor at the board mentions carelessly that at ''
Hammel	PERSON	in
Saxony	LOCATION	, on the
20th day of June	DATE	,
A. D. 1484	PERSON	, the devil , in the likeness of a pied piper , carried away one hundred and thirty children , who were never after seen , '' and at the word the
Pied Piper	ORGANIZATION	of
Hamelin	PERSON	town is making his magic music in your ears , and you know that
Robert Brown	PERSON	- ing has sat at that rich table , and repeated its stories afterwards in his own wonderful way .

		Or you catch a chance illusion to
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	and
Banquo	ORGANIZATION	, and prick up your ears for something wicked to come your way , and find it is not Shakespeare who is quoted , nor even
Hollin	LOCATION	- shed 's Chronicles whence the Avon poet drew his plot , but
Hector Boethius	PERSON	not by any means the
Boethius	PERSON	from whom Hollinshed drew the story first .

		As you listen , what de - licious old-time phrases fly about you !

		You hear of circumforanean rogues , of turgent and stupend titles , of pasquils and compellations , of parats and foliots , of kells and tunicles .

		You hear '' indecorum '' and '' catastrophe '' used with an air of apology , italicised as not yet fairly good English , not at all '' ingenite '' in the language , but only '' acquisite '' of late .

		If you offend , you may be bidden to '' go woll - ward , '' but , while trembling at the awful un - known penalty , receive '' so gentle and bart - able a pardon '' that you fear no more , and in the '' obnubilation '' from the burning of Sir
Walter	PERSON	's new plant from the
Americas	LOCATION	, the vis - ion vanishes , and you are back in the nineteenth century again .

		If you are a comfortable Latinist you have needed no interpreter .

		` The
Saxon	PERSON	and the Roman speech will serve .

		With all
Burton	PERSON	's varied and recondite learning , he makes little use of any other than the universal language of scholars and his own vernacular .

		In read - ing with care nearly or quite half his treatise , the reviewer has come across no single Spanish or Italian or German citation , but a dozen words of Greek -LRB- could
Burton	PERSON	have read his Plato or Thucydides with a '' pony '' ? -RRB-

		, and but two briefest phrases from the French , which any lad might have picked up from some trav - eled neighbor or monsieur in exile , sans argent and a la mort .

		But anything extant in choice or dubious Latin , anything on
Burton	PERSON	's own crowded shelves or in the alcoves of the Bod - leian , may Jbe drawn upon at any time , with quite undistinguishing regard .

		I do not think it was often the beauty , the fancy , the imagination of the passage that brought it to
Burton	PERSON	's mind .

		Like many an - other master of style , he was comparatively in - sensitive to the charms of style was seeking not for ornament but use .

		The line of
Ovid	LOCATION	or the sentence of Livy was no more welcome than the passage from Struthius or Curio .

		If it was in the line of his thought , that was all he cared for .

		The seeker for epigrams , for gems of verse or prose is not often gratified .

		Burton quotes to confirm what he has said or to lead up to what he wants to say .

		The wit - ness may talk twattle if he will only testify to the one point in question .

		For in those days , a book was per se an au -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 thority .

		What got in print was gospel until at least a conflicting gospel was revealed .

		There was a certain presumption in its favor , how - ever questionable that which it contained .

		An author was still not far removed from his old - time priesthood .

		It was not yet credible that words in type conveying the observations of learned men might be as valueless as old crone 's tales .

		The sifting , discriminating , critical judg - ment of science , that tests all things , that tries each antecedent plausibility by repeated exper - iment , that proceeds by cautious induction from selected facts , and not by brilliant deduction from axiom or postulate , was not yet in vogue .

		The contemporaries of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	still bowed to the authority of
Aristotle	LOCATION	, and the author of the '' Novum Organum '' was still an unaccredited innovator .

		So
Burton	PERSON	quotes , with varying emphasis indeed , and half sug - gestion of a hesitating credence , but on the whole with large acceptance , ancients and mod - erns , thinkers and pedants , philosophers and charletans , of
Italy	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, and lets them bear their quite unequal testimony to all sorts of marvellous events and opinions .

		That melancholy men are witty , Aristotle is authority ; that blind men never blush ,
Dandinus	PERSON	says it ; that the devil is an expert physician , so Godelman bears witness ; that a Spanish
Marquis	PERSON	made one of his slaves young again , as
Renatum Morey	PERSON	de - clares , all these things
Burton	PERSON	gravely re - cords , as what a sober mind would hardly deny , though an emancipated philosopher might hold his judgment in suspense as to some of them , where the doctors differ too widely .

		The me - diaeval identification of faith and credulity was not yet broken up .


Burton	PERSON	, though suspicious of a pagan or a Jesuit miracle , still allowed oc - cult causes generous playroom within the lim - its of his large belief .

		The same deference to authority is visible in
Burton	LOCATION	's homage to the royal pedant who fid - getted uneasily in the great queen 's seat .

		James I. had been eighteen years on the throne when the first edition of the '' Anatomy of Melan - choly , '' with its queer enigmatic frontispiece , appeared .

		And
Burton	PERSON	pays him tribute , not in a set dedication , a mere form of custom , courtesying even to small kings , but full in the body of the text , once as '' Another Numa , a second
Augustus	PERSON	, a true
Josiah	PERSON	, '' and again as '' our Amulet , our Sun , our Ptolemy , our com - mon
Maecenas	LOCATION	,
Jacobus	PERSON	munificus ,
Jacobus	PERSON	pa - cificus , mysta Musarum , rex Platonicus , grande decus , columeuque nostrum . ''

		And when , thus belauded , that earliest
English Stuart	PERSON	, with his tincture of honest scholarship but his unroyal pettiness of fibre , had gone over to the major - ity , in his next edition
Burton	PERSON	improves the occasion , and adds , '' But he is gone , this Sun of ours is set , and yet no night follows .

		We have such another in his room , '' and so makes his bow to that falsest of melancholy monarchs , Charles the First .

		Did shrewd and sturdy men like
Burton	PERSON	an - atomize and decipher character no better than this ?

		Did they believe and hope such things , or only say such things , as we use unmeaning social forms to-day ?

		It is hard to tell .

		Per - haps in the eyes of a recluse of loyal
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, the divinity that doth hedge a King made such hyperboles of homage decent and credible .

		The turning of the compliment from
James	LOCATION	to
Charles	LOCATION	reminds us how a greater than
Burton	PERSON	passed his plaudits on from
Elizabeth	LOCATION	to
James	PERSON	`` This bird of honour dies , this maiden phenix Her ashes new create another heir As great in admiration as herself '' Who from the sacred ashes of her honour Shall star-like rise , as great in fame as she was , And so stand fixed '' transfixed , indeed , in sheer amaze at such an apotheosis .

		Shakespeare wrote in verse with all a poet 's license , and his play was to be en - acted before the Court , which might account for florid adulation .

		But , after eighteen years of
James	PERSON	's inglorious reign , the thing is strange in
Burton	LOCATION	, who surely was no courtier .

		It is strange also that with all his quoting ,
Burton	PERSON	should have made comparatively little use of the brilliant literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean age .

		Had he read
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's immortal works ?

		There is a quotation from '' an elegant poet of ours '' in his '' Rape of Lu - crece , '' and another from the `` Venus and Adonis '' ; but the only reference to the plays is a quotation , mis-cited , of the doggerel couplet that ends the last scene of ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' '' For never was a story of more woe Than this of
Juliet	PERSON	and her Romeo . ''

		Of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	we have three brief pas - sages ; while of
Roger Bacon	PERSON	there are nine .

		Of
Beaumont	LOCATION	, of
Fletcher	PERSON	, of Massinger , of
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, of
Middleton	LOCATION	, there is not one .


Daniel	PERSON	is more a favorite , and '' the English Ovid ''
Drayton	PERSON	.

		Spenser , `` our modern
Maro	PERSON	, '' is quoted half a dozen times ;
Sidney	PERSON	's ``
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' once .

		Marlowe is noticed several times .

		But a treatise upon melancholy could have found its richest illustrations in
Hamlet	LOCATION	and Mac - beth and Timon and Othello and
King Lear	PERSON	, and all the world of diseased contemplations 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, that make up the sum of the Elizabethan drama ; and
Burton	PERSON	evidently hunted far afield , while regardless of much that lay close to his own door .

		After all , authors are not always '' up '' in the writings of their contemporaries .

		The '' Fable for Critics '' had been published half a dozen years before
Emerson	PERSON	had come upon the passage that concerned himself .

		It is comforting to note in any one direc - tion a probable gap in
Burton	LOCATION	's omniscience .

		It is far easier to guess what he had not read than what he had .

		Make a list of Greek and Latin classics , of the Fathers of the
Eastern and Western Church	ORGANIZATION	, of the Arabian sages , of the schoolmen , doctors seraphic and doc - tors angelic , of the voyagers on unknown seas and travellers in undiscovered countries , of the divines and the saints and the lawyers , the alchemists and the chemists , the physicians and metaphysicians of all lands and ages , then go to the index of ''
Burton	PERSON	's Anatomy '' as the likeliest place to encounter them every - one .

		As we turn the pages we forget that they are but print and paper .

		.

		We seem to be seated on a magic carpet , or mounted on the horse of brass , and to be borne across the world from
China	LOCATION	to
Peru	LOCATION	, threading our way past Do - donian groves and Babylonian gardens ,
Egypt	LOCATION	- ian temples and Roman palaces and Teutonic shrines , and listening to a Babel chorus of voices out of every nation under heaven .

		We cry , in
Burton	LOCATION	's own eloquent and
Jeremy	PERSON	- Taylor-like outburst , '' As a long-winged hawk , when he is first whistled off the fist , mounts aloft and for his own pleasure makes many a circuit ... so will I , having now come into these ample fields of air ... awhile rove , wander round about the world , mount aloft to those etherial orbs and celestial spheres , and so descend to my former elements again . ''

		As we descend , these former elements seem dull and paltry .

		When again shall we ride
Levia	LOCATION	- than , behold the
Phoenix	LOCATION	, talk with Prester
John	PERSON	, and live with the wits , the poets , the scholars of all time ?

		Only when once more we submit ourselves to
Burton	PERSON	's mighty spell .

		THE Turnbull lectures on '' Dante , '' by Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, are now in progress at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, the dates being from
March 29 to April 9	DATE	.

		The first had for its subject '' The Function of Poetry '' and `` The Thirteenth Century in
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		The remaining five are devoted , respectively , to the ''

		This is the fourth course of the Turnbull lectures on poetry .

		AMERICAN POTTERY AND PORCELAIN .

		* Mr.
Barber	PERSON	, the author of '' The Pottery and Porcelain of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' has been well known to china collectors for some years past as an indefatigable gatherer of items relating to the pottery and porcelain of this country .

		His little printed slips , asking for information and suggestions , are familiar to china-owners all over the country ; and the result of his un - wearied investigations may be found in this beautifully printed and illustrated book .

		As a work of the printer 's art , it leaves nothing to be desired .

		The graceful and beautiful vases and jars , and the portions of table services so carefully and perfectly depicted therein nota - bly those of the
Chesapeake Pottery	ORGANIZATION	and the Rookwood Pottery make one thrill with pa - triotic pride , and renew the sense of satisfaction felt at the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	at the sight of the beautiful exhibits of the American manu - facturers of pottery and porcelain .

		As in his preface Mr.
Barber	PERSON	avows that one of '' the main purposes of the work is to furnish an account of such of the earlier pot - teries as , for any reason , possess some histor - ical interest , '' it is to be deplored that the chapters on '' Early Pottery in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- seventeenth century -RRB- and '' Potteries of the Eighteenth Century '' are not fuller and more exhaustive .

		In the first-named chapter the author does not even refer to the possibility of pot-works existing in
New England	LOCATION	at that date .

		Yet in
1646	DATE	the
General Court of Mas	ORGANIZATION	- sachusetts ordered that `` tyle earth to make sale ware shall be digged before the first of 9 mo , and turned over in the last or first be - fore it be wrought . ''

		In
Connecticut	LOCATION	and Mas - sachusetts , potters were frequently on the list of freemen .


Higginson	PERSON	, writing of the town of
Salem	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, in
1629	DATE	, said : '' It is thought here is a good clay to make bricks & tyles and earthen-pot as may be .

		At this instant we are setting a brick kill to work . ''

		The Salem or
Danvers	LOCATION	kilns were certainly as early in operation as any pot-works in the col - onies .

		In Mr.
Barber	PERSON	's chapter on eighteenth century works he scantily notices the progress of ceramic manufacture in the
New England	LOCATION	col - onies .

		The
Danvers	LOCATION	potteries , unnamed by him , had become important .


Morse	PERSON	's Gazetteer of
1797	DATE	says of this town : '' Large quantities of * THE POTTERY AND PORCELAIN OF THE UNITED STATES .

		THE DIAL 213 brick and coarse earthen ware are manufac - tured here . ''

		It is said there were twenty pot - works in
Danvers	LOCATION	at that date .

		On
Long Island	LOCATION	many potteries existed , though Mr.
Bar	PERSON	- ber does not name them ; at
Whitestone	LOCATION	, Flat - bush , New Lots , and other
Long Island	LOCATION	towns , quite an extensive manufacture of coarse pots , pans , urns , etc. , was carried on .

		That con - siderable pottery was made in other parts of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, we can not doubt .

		In the adver - tisements of the ''
Boston News Letter	ORGANIZATION	, '' as early as
1716	DATE	, among the '' servants to be dis - posed of '' on board the ship on which these '' redemptioners '' came over , were `` earthen - ware Pottery-makers . '' ''

		Mangness '' for the use of potters was an article of barter .

		By
1769	DATE	much encouragement was given to the manufacture of various fictile wares , and good wages were offered to potters '' Twenty Dol - lars per month , with Victuals ,
Drink	ORGANIZATION	, Washing and Lodging . ''

		And the
Connecticut	LOCATION	newspa - pers , of dates immediately previous to and after Revolutionary times , contain many references to pot-works and potters .

		Doubtless all this
New England	LOCATION	pottery was simple porous stoneware milkpans , jugs , and pipkins , but quite as worthy of extended reference as the pottery of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, of which Mr.
Barber	PERSON	writes .

		I would also note , in passing , Mr.
Barber	PERSON	's rather confusing arrangement .

		In the chapter entitled '' The Eighteenth Century '' he places manufactories and manufactures of much later dates some
1809	DATE	; Sgraffiato ware marked
1826	DATE	;
John Nases	PERSON	wares ,
1812	DATE	and
1830	DATE	, and even as late as
1847	DATE	;
Jacob Shell	PERSON	's wares ,
1831	DATE	; and several others .

		The part of this chapter devoted to slip decorated and
Sgraffiato	PERSON	ware is perhaps the most interesting portion of the book .

		The succeeding chapters on wares of our own times have been prepared with great care and intelligence , and appear to be very exhaustive .

		The one on china-marks will cer - tainly be valuable in future time , and the ones on tiles and decorative terra cotta are very in - structive .

		It is certainly praiseworthy to preserve in such handsome form the actual accomplish - ments of the pottery manufacturers of the
United States	LOCATION	to-day , for facts are quickly for - gotten ; the history of the much disputed Lowestoft ware may be held up as an example of the short length of time in which authentic data of a certain pottery manufacture may be lost .

		Still , the Lowestoft wares were made be - fore the days of trade catalogues , before the vast advertisement of all manufactured materials .

		It would seem that such a contingency could scarcely arise in the future with regard to our present productions .

		Though this book is very valuable as a cata - logue or manual , it need not be criticised as literature .


Stopford Brooke	PERSON	says , '' Writing is not literature unless it gives to the reader a pleasure which arises not only from the things said , but from the way in which they are said . ''

		Mr.
Barber	PERSON	's `` way of saying '' his style is not interesting .

		This fact does not , of course , impair the worth as a book of reference .

		It might be argued that a technical work like this is usually rather dry reading ; but as an exam - ple of what such a book may be , or rather what a work on precisely similar lines is , let me call attention to
Llewellyn Jewitt	PERSON	's '' History of the Ceramic Art of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, '' a book univer - sally interesting even to the reader who cares nothing for china .


Ruskin	PERSON	says , '' Side - glimpses sometimes bring home better results than a broad stare . ''

		It is the side-glimpses at the potter 's art of early times that we miss in Mr.
Barber	PERSON	's book .

		We should like to have known a little of the amount of production and exportation of pot - tery and porcelain in
England	LOCATION	; somewhat of the condition and number of foreign-born pot - ters in
America	LOCATION	at that day ; to be shown more fully why so little was made of American re - sources in pottery materials , why so slowly they were developed .

		But we have only a very broad stare at the blank facts of the manufac - ture of china in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		And yet some side-glimpses are given .

		For instance , we are told much of one Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	; that he served in the army in the war of the Rebellion , that he has been postmaster of his town , that he is a warm personal friend of Gov - ernor
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , etc. , all very estimable traits , and then , after the index at the end of the book , we have also a very pretty advertise - ment of Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's hotel ware .

		But these scarcely answer our notions of what might be said on such an art-subject as china .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, STUDIES ix AMERICAN POLITICS AXD POLITICAL HISTOKY .

		* Mr.
Daniel Greenleaf Thompson	PERSON	's '' Politics in a Democracy `` is an incisive study of some features in our American political life from a point of view .

		The author has very pronounced partisan prejudices , and he sees facts accordingly .

		His characteriza - tion of the modern Republican Party reads quite like the indictment which
Callender	PERSON	or
Benjamin Franklin Bache	PERSON	were wont to draw against the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eralists .

		The trouble with any strong partisan is , not so much that he is blind , as that his eyesight gives out before the facts do .

		Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	has a way of seeing quite clearly facts which are conven - ient .

		But one who reads his discussion of Tam - many is apt to wonder whether a realizing sense of the value of that remarkable institution to the for - tunes of a national party may not perhaps envel - ope the tiger in a somewhat mellowing atmosphere of sweetness and light .

		Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	repeats some of the familiar things which
Lalor	PERSON	's
Cyclo	LOCATION	- paedia has to say about Tammany Hall , adds a few other equally familiar facts , and then proceeds to chat and generalize in a very entertaining way .

		While he points out the evils of Tammany , still he spends a large proportion of his strength in show - ing the good features .

		And really he makes out a pretty strong case .

		As one closes the book one is apt to feel a dawning suspicion that the standards of judgment taught in the colleges and churches and magazines are perhaps rather artificial and su - perfine that these stalwart liquor-dealers who make up half of the Tammany executive committee are on the whole an honest and amiable set of fel - lows ; that in managing politics with an eye single to the emoluments of office and contracts , there is after all nothing vicious , but merely a tendency .

		Of course no moral quality inheres in a `` tendency . ''

		And there may be something essentially mistaken in having high ideals at all .

Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		low-downness , and this is a democratic country , the only rational thing is to get down to the general level as soon as possible .

		But is it true that democracy and venality are inseparable ?

		If a man earns a living by driving a cart , is it so sure that he has more moral obtuse - ness and less rugged common-sense than his pol - ished neighbor in the brown-stone front ?

		There are two things which Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	makes plain , but the significance of which needs more em - phasis than he gives them .

		The essence of Tam - many Hall is venal politics .

		It is an organized con - spiracy to get and keep control of the public funds of the city of
New York	LOCATION	.

		All other matters sympathy with foreign-born citizens , affiliation with the Roman Catholic church , fellowship for the '' common people , '' alliance with one national party , support of the liquor business all these are inci - dental and subordinate .

		Of course , controlling the city funds does not necessarily mean stealing them though Mr.
Tweed	PERSON	showed quite plainly the pos - sibilities in that direction .

		But Tammany means , at best , getting the offices and the salaries and the con - tracts and the jobs of all sorts .

		How much more it means in that same line of pecuniary profit is one of those things , as Lord Dundreary would say , '' which no fellow can find out . ''

		But before and above all else , Tammany is the incarnation of the spoils sys - tem in politics .

		If that is a good and a necessary system , then
Tammany Hall	ORGANIZATION	is merely the natural and laudable efflorescence of our democratic society .

		If that system is radically needless and vicious , then
Tammany	ORGANIZATION	is simply one of its sheet-anchors to wind - ward .

		This fact of the identity of Tammany with the spoils system has an immediate bearing on another consideration .

		Tammany can not be overthrown by any mere revolt against the organization .

		An al - liance of anti-Tammany democrats with the Repub - lican organization of the city is no more than a tem - porary expedient .

		The victory of a rival machine such as
Fernando Wood	ORGANIZATION	's `` Mozart Hall , '' just before the war is merely the perpetuation of Tam - many methods under another name .

		In other words , the thing to attack is not the organization , but the system which is the life of the organization .

		Tam - many is not a disease ; it is merely a symptom a cu - taneous eruption indicative of poisoned blood .

		And if the system of spoils in city offices can be destroyed ,
Tammany Hall	ORGANIZATION	will vanish into the air .

		Whether such destruction is possible , may per - haps fairly be questioned .

		But it is quite sure that it will never be at all likely so long as city elections are conducted by the machinery of national politics .

		If we can get rid of national politics in local elec - tions , we may be able to find something better than the spoils system .

		If we can break down the spoils system ,
Tammany	ORGANIZATION	will at once become innocuous , and its braves may celebrate the season of flowers in peace .

		The ghost '' of
Tweed	ORGANIZATION	will be laid .

		Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's remedy for the evils of
Tarn	ORGANIZATION	-
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 215 many is increase in righteousness .

		No doubt that would do .

		But it will take considerable righteous - ness to purify
Tammany Hall	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new revision of Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	's '' Tri - umphant Democracy , '' with the numerous figures adjusted to the census of
1890	DATE	, is evidence that there is a demand for the canny Scotchman 's op - timism , notwithstanding Homestead .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	, in '' The Cliff Dwellers , '' speaks of a Chicagoan 's favorite occupation as talking about his city to a stranger .

		And fully a half-century ago , young Mar - tin Chuzzlewit was meaningly informed by one of the solemn Western Americans of that day that '' We has to be cracked up . ''

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	certainly pounds the drum and toots the horn with great skill and volume of sound .

		His theme is the general bigness of the Republic ; and he piles up figures and rattles off adjectives with the enthusiastic aban - don of a Western real-estate agent .

		The late Mr.
Disraeli	PERSON	once referred to Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	as '' a so - phistical rhetorician , inebriated by the exuberance of his own verbosity . ''

		One is inclined to fit the coat on Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, letting it out in spots : '' A sophistical statistician , inebriated by the exuberance of his own statistical fecundity . ''

		He oozes figures at every pore .

		He points on nearly every page to totals so tall that it makes one dizzy to look at them .

		The reader feels inclined to sympathize with the honest Englishman who set out from
New York	LOCATION	to cross the continent , but came back having gone no farther than Salt Lake , explaining that he was dis - couraged by '' the blarsted bigness of the country . ''


Wendell Phillips	PERSON	, in his lecture on '' The Lost Arts , '' reminds us of the German whom
Coleridge	PERSON	met at
Frankfort	LOCATION	.

		He always took off his hat with profound respect when he ventured to speak of him - self .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	adds , '' It seems to me the Amer - ican people might be painted in the chronic attitude of taking off its hat to itself . ''

		The achievements of the American democracy have been very great , no doubt .

		The world has never before seen a virgin continent occupied by a vast migration of civilized men armed with all the appliances by which human power has in these last decades been so vastly multiplied .

		There have been other historic race movements .

		But the German
Franks	PERSON	who went out west so many centuries ago and preempted homesteads in
Gaul	LOCATION	did not have railroads or newspapers or steam threshing-machines .

		They created a great nation , to be sure ; but it took a thousand years to do it .

		We have created a greater nation , and it has only taken us a hundred years .

		And we do enjoy bragging about it .

		But are we quite sure that it is a greater nation which we have made ?

		Are we sure that we have the right unit with which to measure greatness ?

		If the unit is square miles , or millions of people , or dollars , it is all plain sailing .

		A little of Mr. Car - negie 's arithmetic will do the business .

		And there is no manner of doubt that we do dearly love big - ness .


Chicago	LOCATION	has a greater area than
London	LOCATION	, has taller buildings than
Paris	LOCATION	, packs more hogs than
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Ergo .

		To be sure , the
Louvre	LOCATION	is lack - ing , and the British Museum .

		But we are big so big !

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's book needs to be read with cau - tion .

		The truth is that in
America	LOCATION	our real tasks have just begun .

		To succeed with them we shall need all the rude strength which we have thus far lavished so prodigally and we shall need fineness of mind and delicacy of touch as well .

		We shall need all the wide diffusion of knowledge which our schools and newspapers afford but we need knowledge much deeper and more exact than come from either .

		It would n't hurt us if we had less bragging and more books less show and fuss and more honest living less pork and more scholars .

		An old defi - nition was , '' Gentleman one who eats more than he earns . ''

		That fits exactly both extremes of our social organism the pauper tramp and the mil - lionaire tramp .

		The wise man will consider both with grave attention , not for themselves , but for what they mean .

		Material obstacles we have over - come easily .

		How will our materialistic democracy handle social difficulties which have perplexed the wisest men and the greatest nations ?

		A disputed question of our political history so re - cent as
1871	DATE	is the subject of an interesting little volume by Mr.
Bancroft Davis	PERSON	.

		It will be remem - bered that at the organization of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	in
March	DATE	of that year ,
Charles Sum	PERSON	- ner , long the chairman of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	on For - eign relations , was displaced in favor of
Simon Cameron	PERSON	.

		This act of the Republican majority in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	has been claimed by Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	's friends to have been in revenge for that gentleman 's stren - uous and successful opposition to President
Grant	PERSON	's policy of annexation in
San Domingo	LOCATION	.

		On behalf of the President and of Secretary Fish , on the other hand , it has been asserted that Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	was re - moved from the chairmanship on account of his rad - ical disagreement with the administration in refer - ence to the claims against
England	LOCATION	, the settlement of which was then pending .

		Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	had insisted , in a speech in the Sen - ate in
April , 1869	DATE	, that the English recognition of Confederate belligerency was itself an act which made that nation responsible for any resulting dam - age in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Then , in estimating the amount of damages , besides computing the direct value of the ships destroyed by the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	cruisers fitted out in
England	LOCATION	at about
$ 15,000,000	MONEY	, Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	added a claim for our loss of the carrying trade , estimating that at about
$ 110,000,000	MONEY	.

		And to cap the climax he declared that the action of En - gland had doubled the duration , and hence the cost , of the war .

		As that cost was about
$ 4,000,000	MONEY	, - 000 , it followed that half that was justly due from
England	LOCATION	, if the theory was correct .

		Of course for the
United States	ORGANIZATION	to insist on such claims would have meant that any peaceable settle - ment would be impossible .

		England would have 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, incurred the risk of war with the
United States	LOCATION	rather than pay amounts so enormous .

		President Grant and Secretary Fish were content to place the English responsibility merely on official negli - gence in allowing the Confederate vessels to sail in the first instance , and on aid given them subsequently in British ports .

		The damages they did not desire to extend beyond the direct loss .

		But in
January , 1871	DATE	, when negotiations with
Great Britain	LOCATION	were assuming shape , Secretary Fish consulted the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Senator to get a final statement of his views .

		These were embodied by Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	in a memorandum dated
January 17 , 1871	DATE	.

		He retained emphatically the extreme ground he had already assumed , and now added the sugges - tion that the readiest solution of all matters in dis - pute would be for
England	LOCATION	to cede
Canada	LOCATION	, in short , u To make the settlement complete , the with - drawal should be from this hemisphere , including provinces and islands . ''

		Such a scheme of settle - ment might have been practicable had it come at the close of a victorious war against
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		It was certainly chimerical under the conditions prevailing in
1871	DATE	.

		True , English relations with
Russia	LOCATION	at that time were such as to make a settle - ment of troublesome disputes with the
United States	LOCATION	highly desirable * .

		But to secure
India	LOCATION	against a possible danger by the surrender of
America	LOCATION	, or to avert the cost of a contingent war by a contribution equal to the cost of an actual one , was hardly to be expected .

		Under these circumstances it certainly made for the success of a peaceful settlement to have another chairman at the head of the
Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	.

		And Mr.
Davis	PERSON	makes a plausi - ble case in showing the development of the breach between Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	and the administration , and the apparently irreconcilable nature of those differ - ences .

		However , he does not attempt to prove which indeed might be difficult of proof that aside from this grave question of public policy the smart of the successful opposition to other administrative plans may have made it much easier for supporters of the President to realize the pressing importance of a change in the committee .

		And the precise fit - ness of Mr.
Simon Cameron	PERSON	to succeed Mr.
Sum	PERSON	- ner would be an interesting matter of inquiry .

		The political bearing of the quarrel between President
Grant	PERSON	and a portion of the Republican party did not become quite obvious till much later .

		The grotesque nomination of
Greeley	LOCATION	in
1872	DATE	prevented present danger to Republican ascendancy .

		But yet this break in the party was the '' beginning of woes . ''

		Ten years later it was followed by the second great quarrel among leaders .

		And these dissensions dis - rupted the party .

		The history of the Federalists in
1800	DATE	was repeated in
1884	DATE	.

		As to Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	's position on the main ques - tion , it must be admitted that it had the sympathy of the American people very generally .

		The un - friendly , selfish , and malicious conduct of
Great Britain	LOCATION	during our Civil War sank very deep into the public consciousness .

		There is no manner of doubt that the moral and material support which the South received from
England	LOCATION	did greatly pro- long the war , and did add largely to its cost in life and property .

		This was felt very bitterly at the North , and there was no time from
1865	DATE	until
1871	DATE	at which a war with
England	ORGANIZATION	would not have been an exceedingly popular measure .

		In fact , war would have been regarded by many as far prefera - ble to any money compensation .

		There are some injuries in private life for which it is commonly felt that law affords no adequate redress , and for which retribution in blood , stern and speedy , is the only possible atonement .

		This may not be the most advanced civilization , but it is an elemental instinct of human nature .

		And that feeling to this day modifies the regard of great masses of Americans for
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		The settlement affected by the treaty of
Washington	LOCATION	was undoubtably a wise act of statesmanship .

		Imperfect as it was , it was bet - ter to accept it as final , and to close the account .

		National revenges are better unsatisfied .

		But it is not easy to forget .

		And Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	in
1871	DATE	was a more accurate interpreter of the popular feeling than was Secretary Fish .

		Mr.
Tuckerman	PERSON	's life of Judge
Jay	PERSON	is a contribu - tion to the history of a peculiar phase of the aboli - tion movement .

		It exhibits the share in that move - ment taken by a man of excellent birth , of inherited wealth , of high religious and intellectual culture , and at the same time of great sanity and sweetness of character .

		Such men were not many among the agitators ; and the course of Judge
Jay	PERSON	throws in strong relief the erratic and fanatical tendencies which did so much to stamp the name Abolitionist with contempt .

		The son of Chief Justice
John Jay	PERSON	, a graduate of
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	in the year which witnessed the incep - tion of
Jefferson	PERSON	's embargo , a churchman high in the counsels of the Protestant Episcopal church in the
State of New York	LOCATION	, a jurist of so great purity and ability that for a quarter of a century he was con - tinued on the bench by appointment from govern - ors irrespective of party , these are the outward features of the life of
William Jay	PERSON	.

		Early inter - ested in the question of freedom for the slave , his pen was active in disseminating ideas of emancipa - tion .

		But he was from the outset firmly of the opinion that interference with slavery in the States in which it existed was wholly beyond the constitu - tional power of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		That power , he held , could be exerted only to abolish the institution in the
District of Columbia	LOCATION	and in the territories , and to put a stop to the inter-state trade in human beings .

		This constitutional doctrine was very conserva - tive in the view of the advanced abolitionists .

		It was essentially the ground on which the Republican party was formed later , and was the only possible ground for political action against slavery , short of revolution and civil war .

		But it was with great dif -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 217 ficulty that the
American Anti-Slavery Society	ORGANIZATION	was held to this view of the question .

		Reformers tend to become extremists , and Judge
Jay	PERSON	found his abolition associates becoming more and more rest - ive under any declaration of principles short of root-and-branch extermination .

		There was another difficulty .

		In the view of a variety of people , society needs reforming in a va - riety of ways .

		And a mind which has once for all adjusted itself to some radical social reconstruction has usually so effectually thrown itself out of adjust - ment with what is that it fits in readily with almost any scheme of alleged reform .

		And so all sorts of '' isms '' in which the decades before the Civil War were so prolific naturally attached themselves to the Abolition movement .

		Women 's rights , dress reform , food reform , temperance , table-tipping , com - munism , all sorts of odds and ends of social vaga - ries , become thoroughly mixed up with Abolitionism .

		The resolutions of Anti- Slavery societies became more and more turgid and multifarious .

		And peo - ple in general came to associate the Abolition cause with the general domain of crankdom .

		All this must be taken into account in trying to understand the odium which attached to the name Abolitionist among so many excellent people .

		It was not pure wickedness which caused the violent opposition to the Anti-Slavery movement in
New England	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	and other free States .

		If that cause could have been kept clear of '' entangling alliances '' with other '' causes '' good , bad , indifferent , immoral , whimsical , what not , Abolitionism would have quite a different savor .

		Judge
Jay	PERSON	devoted all his large influence and clear intelligence to keeping opposition to slavery independent of other movements , and within consti - tutional lines .

		When he saw that the American Anti-Slavery Society was hopelessly in the hands of the professional '' reformers , '' he withdrew , and aided in forming another association .

		He always opposed the disunion schemes of some Abolitionists and the `` no government '' policy of others .

		The Constitution , the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, lawful methods these he held adequate to a reasonable movement against the system of human slavery .

		And his constant efforts were given to the effort to hold the friends of Abo - lition in this impregnable position .

		He lived long enough to see a great national party founded on his principles a party destined to destroy slavery with - out destroying the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		His death in
1857	DATE	was too soon for him to share in the great events which at last made the Republic the home of free men .

		But it can not be doubted that his was a powerful in - fluence in giving shape to that wise popular view of the case which in the end was able to deal with slavery .

		Jay and Lincoln and
Seward	PERSON	, not
Garri	PERSON	- son and
Phillips	PERSON	and
John Brown	PERSON	, represent the Anti-Slavery force which put the Thirteenth Amend - ment into the Constitution .

		Twenty-five years ago , but little attention had been given to the study of political history in
America	LOCATION	.

		Since then there has been a renascence of patriotic scholarship , and the scientific method has been applied with energy and intelligence to the study of our own institutions .

		The patient and minute work which has been encouraged at
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	has already sufficed to amass material which will be of priceless value to the historian .

		Three of these studies are before us .

		Mr.
Bishop	PERSON	's '' History of Elections in the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can Colonies '' is a valuable compilation from the early laws and records , and will be of decided help in tracing the form taken by the elective franchise in our early State constitutions .

		Mr.
Steiner	PERSON	's '' His - tory of Slavery in
Connecticut	LOCATION	'' is a contribution towards a systematic and scientific study of that in - stitution in the
United States	LOCATION	a work which still remains to be done .

		The study of '' Local Govern - ment in the South and the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Prof.
E. W. Bemis	PERSON	and students of
Vanderbilt University	ORGANIZATION	, is an example of what may be done by college stu - dents when their work is directed to a purpose .

		A more exact bibliography would add to the value of the work .

		Mr.
Haynes	PERSON	' paper on '' Popular Election of
U. S.	PERSON	Senators '' is an argument for that method .

		It should be timely reading just now in many quarters .

PRATT JUDSON	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS .

		Dr.
William Wright	PERSON	's `` The Brontes A graphic picture in i re i an a -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a rarely oflnshhfe .

		.

		r i i I u interesting book , almost as much so , to our notion , as the best of the novels which have made the
Bronte	ORGANIZATION	name famous .

		-LRB- And touching this name we may add that Dr.
Wright	PERSON	decides once for all that it is and always was BrontS not '' Brunty , '' or the still more ignominious ''
Prunty	PERSON	, '' as some authorities have it . ''

		Brunty , '' however , seems to have been the local Irish pronunciation . -RRB-

		We have several Lives of the author of ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's , Mr.
Wemyss Reid	PERSON	's , and Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	's , each capital in its way ; but it has re - mained , we believe , for the present author to trace the current of
Bronte	LOCATION	life back to
Ireland	LOCATION	, and to explore its head-waters there .

		This he has done with patience , enthusiasm , and literary skill ; and the result is a book that is not only satisfactory from a biographical standpoint , but is a strikingly fresh and graphic picture of Irish rural life as well .

		The Doctor is a capital hand at a story .

		Thrilling indeed almost
Homeric	PERSON	is his account of the combat between
Welsh Bronte	PERSON	and
Sam Clarke	PERSON	of Ballynaskeagh an era-making event even in County Down , and , in a way , the Hegira of the local cal - endar . ''

		Women , '' he says , '' would speak of their children as born or their daughters married so many years before or after the fight , and old men in referring to their ages would tell how they had been present when
Welsh Bronte	ORGANIZATION	licked Sam .


Clarke	PERSON	, and that they must have been of such an age at the 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, time . ''

		We are glad to record , to the
Bronte	PERSON	honor , that the victor , more magnanimous than Achilles , bore the defeated
Samuel	PERSON	home in his arms , and put him to bed for bodily repairs .

		Striking , too , is the picture of stern
Hugh Bronte	PERSON	,
Charlotte	LOCATION	's uncle , as he prepared his new blackthorn and crossed to En - gland to wreak Irish vengeance on the scoundrel who traduced his niece 's honor in the infamous '' Quarterly '' review of ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' : ''
Hugh	PERSON	had for many years been watching over the growth of a young blackthorn sapling , as if it had been an only child .

		It had arrived at maturity about the time the diabolical article appeared in the ` Quarterly . '

		The supreme moment of his life had arrived , and the weapon on which he depended was ready ... His first act was to dig up the blackthorn carefully , so that he might have enough of the thick root to form a lethal club .

		Having pruned it roughly , he placed the butt end in warm ashes
night after night	TIME	to season .

		Then , when it had become sapless and hard , he reduced it to its final dimensions .

		After - wards he steeped it in brine , or ' put it in pickle ' as the saying goes ; and when it had been a suffi - cient time in the salt water , he took it out and rubbed it with shamois and train oil for hours .

		Then came the final process .

		He shot a magpie , drained its blood into a cup , and with the lappered blood polished the blackthorn till it became glossy black with a mahogany tint ... No Sir
Galahad	PERSON	ever valued his shield , or trusted his spear , as
Hugh Bronte	PERSON	cherished and loved his shillelagh . ''

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's memorable preparations for
Ossian Mac	ORGANIZATION	- pherson were nothing to this .

		Dr.
Wright	PERSON	adds an interesting chapter concerning the long-disputed identity of the rascally reviewer in question , and he seems to have solved the mystery satisfactorily .

		For the culprit 's name , and for the degree of his or her responsibility in the case , we must refer the reader to the original .

		Historical Professor
John Bascom	PERSON	's `` Histor - interpretations ical Interpretation of Philosophy '' of Philosophy .

		-LRB- p utn am -RRB- would make an excellent course of lectures for the senior class of a minor college , whom it was not desirable to feed on too strong meat .

		Are we mistaken in suspecting that much of the material of the book has already seen service in this way ?

		It presents a judicious but not burdensome selection of facts from
Ueberweg	LOCATION	, and a sensible pleasantly written commentary which warns the student against pernicious tendencies of thought , and directs him into the safe via media of an in - tuitionist realism , avoiding the dangerous extremes of monistic idealism and monistic materialism .

		The style is easy and flowing , and in places prettily fig - urative , reminding us occasionally of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	, to whom Professor
Bascom	PERSON	will not object to be compared .

		The various systems passed in review are judged mainly by their tendencies , and approved of or condemned according as they approach or di - verge from the standard of what the author , although he nowhere defines it , clearly feels to be the true philosophy .

		It is asserted in the introduction that '' all conclusions that lie beyond the primary con - victions of men will be found aberrations , vagaries . ''

		Punctilious historical accuracy was perhaps hardly compatible with the main design of the work .

		But it is a little startling to find
Berkeley	LOCATION	removed from his true position in the development between
Locke	PERSON	and
Hume	PERSON	, and classed with Lord
Herbert	PERSON	of
Cher	ORGANIZATION	- bury ,
Clark	PERSON	, and Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	among the dissent - ers from the predominant school of English philos - ophy .

		The exigencies of Professor
Bascom	PERSON	's method have led him , we fear , into unintentional injustice towards the estimable
Locke	PERSON	. ''

		He raised the ques - tion , '' we are told , '' ' Does matter think ? '

		Why not , pray , if the mind be material ?

		Can things fly ?

		Why not , if flying is being hurled from a catapult ? ''

		But surely Professor
Bascom	PERSON	is aware that
Locke	PERSON	never asserted the possibility of matter thinking as an ultimate metaphysical principle .

		He declared that , for aught we know , God might have arbitra - rily annexed to a certain arrangement of matter the power of thought , but he explicitly denied that the divine thought itself could result from any disposi - tion of material particles .

		In other words , he af - firmed that thought could ultimately originate only in mind . ''

		Dear old
Locke	PERSON	, '' as Professor
James	PERSON	calls him , has often before been misrepresented upon this point , and is likely to be so again . ''

		How to Study and Teach History , '' A practical look -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , a duodecimo of three for history teachers .

		, v , , ' , , hundred and forty-six pages , appears in the '' International Education '' series , whereof Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	is editor .

		This volume , by Professor
Burke A. Hinsdale	PERSON	of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, of
Michigan	LOCATION	, is introduced by a delicious bit of Hegelianism by Dr.
Harris	PERSON	, and a brief preface by the author , who says that he has had in mind more particularly the needs of teachers in element - ary and in secondary schools , though he thinks much of the work should interest teachers of history in colleges .

		He calls it a practical work , '' not indeed in the narrow mechanical sense of the word : no effort is made to tell the teacher just what he shall teach or just how he shall teach it . ''

		The wisdom shown in that statement appears throughout the book in many valuable suggestions of method , .

		the author recognizing the fact that every good teacher is his own method , while the best may learn from others .

		He discusses the educational value of his - tory ; its field ; its sources ; choice of facts ; organ - ization of facts into history : time , place , cause , and effect in history , both physical causes and spiritual or human .

		There are valuable chapters on histor - ical geography .

		Then , as the book is for the ben - efit of that large number of teachers who in that function are never called to go beyond the history of the
United States	LOCATION	, Professor
Hinsdale	LOCATION	proceeds to exemplify his methods and philosophy in one hun - dred and twenty-two pages on
North America	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There is an abundant suggestion of books to be read or consulted .

		We have thus
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219 given an outline of the book as the best beginning of a criticism of it .

		For the ordinary reader , and still more for the teacher , it is a very valuable book .

		We have read with interest many of its pages , and young teachers will find all the book helpful and instruct - ive .

		The chapter on the Slave-Power shows in a good light Dr.
Hinsdale	LOCATION	's judicial qualities of mind .

		He writes good English , not ornate or rhetorical , but clear and forceful .

		We have found but a sin - gle sentence to alter : on page 122 he says the sea was '' not too far off to prevent '' trade : he means the opposite `` not so far off as to prevent '' trade .

		And surely on the next page he should prefer Aqui - leia to the rarer and hardly correct form
Aquilia	LOCATION	.

		When a new edition is called for , will he not favor us with a bibliographical index ?

Anne C. Lynch Botta	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Botta	PERSON	was a conspicuous figure in
New York	LOCATION	literary cir - cles during a long period of years , and her drawing - rooms were the scene of many a brilliant gathering .

		She came as near , in fact , as any woman has done in this country to the maintenance of a salon in the Parisian sense .

		Her own literary work included a useful compendium of the history of general lit - erature , a considerable number of poems , and many productions of a more fugitive character .

		How happy she was in her friends appears from the list of those whose personal tributes make up the first half of this memorial volume .

		There are contribu - tions from Messrs.
A. D. White	PERSON	,
S. Parke Godwin	PERSON	,
James A. Froude	PERSON	,
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	,
E. C. Sted	PERSON	- man ,
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	,
R. W. Gilder	PERSON	, Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	,
Miss Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	, and many others .

		Professor
Froude	PERSON	, for example , writes : '' I have known many interesting women in my life , but about her there is a peculiar grace which I have never seen in any other person . ''

		This tribute may be taken as typical of all the collection , which leaves unstruck few notes in the whole gamut of possible praise .

		Mrs.
Botta	PERSON	, among other good works , it seems , `` discovered '' Miss
Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	.

		`` When Miss Thomas presented herself at Mrs.
Botta	PERSON	's door , she was entirely unknown ; but the portfolio of man - uscripts she had under her arm made it impossible for her to remain so any longer .

		Mrs.
Botta	PERSON	de - tected the divine spark , and passed the poet on to that other poet ,
Helen Jackson	PERSON	-LRB- ` H. H. ' -RRB- , who set herself to work at once to make Miss Thomas known to the world . ''

		The second half of this memorial volume includes letters to and from Mrs.
Botta	PERSON	-LRB- among her correspondents having been Kossuth ,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Henry Clay	PERSON	,
Daniel Webster	PERSON	,
George Ticknor	PERSON	,
Frederika Bremer	PERSON	, and `` Fanny Kem - ble '' -RRB- , and selections from her writings in prose and verse .

		The volume makes a pleasing impression , and enshrines a personality that was clearly of the most lovable sort .

		The editing has not always been done with accuracy , as is witnessed by the descrip - tion of
Frederika Bremer	PERSON	as a '' Norwegian , '' and by the curious reference -LRB- p. 203 -RRB- to `` Arnold 's scholar , Gypsey . ''

		Messrs.
J. Selwin Tait	PERSON	& Sons publish the work .

		A compact yet comprehensive Life ^ tnat an '' a kl e man an d , in his way , great painter , Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, has long been a desideratum .

		Such a life is that written by Mr.
Claude Phillips	PERSON	, and imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	is a competent art-writer , and his summary of Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's merits is , on the whole , just and discriminating .

		He notes en passant the grain of truth in shrewd
Horace Walpole	PERSON	's paradox contained in his par - allel between Sir
Joshua	PERSON	and
Allan Ramsay	PERSON	that `` Mr.
Reynolds	PERSON	seldom succeeds in women : Mr.
Ramsay	PERSON	is formed to paint them . ''

		To say that ''
Reynolds	PERSON	seldom succeeds in women '' is of course an over - statement .

		Says Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	: `` Where
Reynolds	PERSON	approached nearest to greatness , and showed a measure of that much-abused word genius , was in the presentment of the great men who were his friends , and for observing whom , in every phase and every mood , he had all through his career op - portunities unequalled by those afforded to any artist of his time . ''

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's observation is a very just one .

		Gracious and charming as Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's women and children nearly always are , they still fall short -LRB- not excepting even the superb ''
Nelly O'Brien	PERSON	'' -RRB- of such masterpieces as the por - traits of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	,
Sterne	PERSON	, Sir
Joseph Banks	PERSON	, and , farthest of all , of the pathetic picture of Gold - smith , in which the artist has succeeded , without sacrificing truth , in conjuring away the traditional homeliness , whim , and absurdity , leaving for pos - terity the underlying kindliness , modesty , and worth .

		`` I shall never think Dr.
Goldsmith	PERSON	ugly again , '' said a lady after reading '' The Deserted Village . ''

		Certainly no one could think him ugly after seeing
Reynolds	PERSON	's portrait .

		Every face , the plainest , lights up at times , under the proper emotion , into a de - gree of beauty and dignity ; and
Reynolds	PERSON	seemed to have the gift of evoking this look in his sitters , and of fixing it upon his canvas .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's book combines biography , criticism , and anecdote in due proportion , and the photographic plates after
Reynolds	PERSON	are pleasing and well-chosen .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ' neat A new edition .

		, of '' The Social and inexpensive edition ot
Rousseau	PERSON	s Contract . ''

		a g oc ial Contract '' is a useful and , in a special sense , a timely publication .

		Professor Huxley and others have pointed out the fact that
Rosseauism	PERSON	, so far from being dead , is coming to the front again , and bids fair once more to exert a grave influence on practical life .

		It is easy at this day to criticise , from the '' hard fact '' standpoint , the Contrat Social ; to point out its contradictions , its impracticabilities , the hopeless disagreement with ascertained facts of its theory of society .

		It is no less easy to show that , underlying its errors of lit - 220 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, eral detail , is a ground-work of moral truth , a body of logically-flawless abstract principles that to the end of time will continue , in one foi-m or another , to justify revolt against social and political injus - tice .

		In proportion as the natural inequalities of men ripen into the iniquities of caste and tyranny , so will the gospel of
Jean Jacques	PERSON	, or this or that rendering of it , grow in favor .

		Its errors of fact will finally be once more cast to the winds by those in need of a theoretical justification for the doing away of a greater by the perpetration of a lesser in - justice .

		Professor Huxley hints that
Rousseauism	PERSON	, with modern variations , has been coming into fash - ion at a rather alarming rate of late .

		If this be true , there is no surer sign of the growth of abuses which pave the way for it and render it acceptable .

		Certainly readers of the present volume will not fail to note that the views of our modern political a-pri - orists essentially coincide with those held long ago by the
Savoyard Vicar	ORGANIZATION	and applied by
Robespierre	LOCATION	and Saint Just with what results , immediate and net , the world knows .

		The present edition of '' The Social Contract '' is well translated by Miss
Rose M. Harrington	PERSON	, and Professor
E. L. Walter	PERSON	furnishes a really luminous critical and historical introduction .

		Dr.
Walter B. Scaife	PERSON	's '' Florentine 23SSJ 1 LifedringtheRenaissance '' -LRB-
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Press -RRB- is the work of an American who has spent some time abroad and been attracted by the charm which
Florence	LOCATION	has always possessed for '' those who live by thought . ''

		The volume derives its interest from the material which it contains rather than from any special ex - cellence of style or method of treatment .

		The au - thor 's style is awkward and at times obscure , and the generalizations which he deals out , in order to make the book '' helpful amidst the trials and com - plications of modern life , '' are usually of a common - place and superficial sort .

		Authorities are not always used with proper discrimination ;
Roscoe	PERSON	is frequently referred to , and in one case
Webster	PERSON	's Dictionary is quoted as a better authority than
Burckhardt	PERSON	.

		Even a slight acquaintance with the correspondence of the fifteenth century would have prevented such a mistake as occurs on page 84 , where the use of the common form '' I recommend myself always to you , '' at the close of a letter from the wife of Lorenzo de ' Medici to her husband , is said to show lack of conjugal affection , and the phrase characterized as '' an expression which a per - son seeking office or favor might adopt . ''


William Blake	PERSON	was a man who in his character and in his poetry was so unlike an ordinary genius -LRB- if so an - omalous an expression may be used -RRB- that it seems extremely hard to write a biography or criticism of him that shall be impartial and sympathetic too .

		Especially does sympathy with his work incline a writer to hold a brief for him .

		Mr.
Alfred T. Story	PERSON	's sympathetic study of his mystical subject is no exception to the rule .

		The book ''
William Blake	PERSON	: His Life , Character , and Genius '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is a special plea , full of animated super - latives whose very passion deprives them of per - suasiveness .

		The happenings of the poet 's life are rather diffusely told , and the rest of the book is given to a running commentary on his poems .

		Mr.
Story	PERSON	rightly praises the few beautiful things that
Blake	PERSON	wrote , and interprets , probably as well as anyone could , the incoherent mass that remains .

		Waiving
Blake	PERSON	's power as an artist , and thinking of him merely as a literary man , a reader who had previously deemed the mystic half-mad would rise from the perusal of the book deeming him three - fourths so .

		But that is only another way of saying that this book is not the final interpretation of the man .

		An attractive number of the pretty j * `` Dilettante Library '' series -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	's criti - cal and biographical study of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Jerrold	PERSON	writes with warmth as well as discrim - ination , and his pages are very liberally peppered with quotation and anecdote .

		From the verbal por - traits cited we select the following , which describes the Doctor as he appeared to a Scotchman who heard him lecture in the sixties : ''
Holmes	PERSON	is a plain little dapper man , his short hair brushed down like a boy 's , but turning gray now ; a trifle of f urzy hair under his ears ; a powerful jaw , and a thick , strong underlip that gives decision to his look , with a dash of pertness .

		In conversation he is animated and cordial sharp , too , taking the word out of one 's mouth . ''

		The last touch rather bears out '' the land - lady 's '' view of her Autocratic boarder : `` He was a well-behaved gentleman at table , only talked a good deal , and pretty loud sometimes , and had a way of turnin ' up his nose when he did n't like what folks said , that one of my boarders , who is a very smart young man , said he could n't stand , nohow , and used to make faces and poke fun at him , when - ever he see him do it .

		The remainder of the work will be issued in completed volumes only , and of these we assume there will be two , as the first volume covers the first five letters of the al - phabet .

Allyn & Bacon	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is one of the really practical books there are not many of them - on English composition .

		It is a book that has already stood the test of classroom use , and the theory on which it is founded must be deemed established .

		The theory is novel and definite : the way to learn to write English is first to learn to write paragraphs .

		To teach this art is the object of the book .

		Part I. deals with the nature and laws of the paragraph ; first , as an independent piece of discourse the isolated paragraph , and second , the paragraph as one of a series .

		Part II .

		briefly discusses the theory of the paragraph ; and Part III .

		furnishes the teacher with an abundance of material for classroom work selected paragraphs , hints on teaching , a list of about two thousand subjects , and useful references of many kinds .

		It is a book that successfully illus - trates the three articles of the rhetorician 's creed theory , example , and practice .

		The publication of Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	's col - Two new volumes i ecte -LRB- j essays -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is continued from Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	.

		i L j with two volumes devoted , respect - ively , to '' Science and Hebrew Tradition '' and '' Science and Christian Tradition . ''

		These volumes contain all of the author 's contributions to the con - troversy into which he has been drawn of late years by the over-zealous champions of an over-literal Christian theology .

		They exhibit the author 's po - lemic at its best , and will doubtless have a certain permanence as examples of brilliant controversial writing .

		The popular and unscientific forms of the - ological belief towards which Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	's attack is directed no longer , of course , claim the assent of really serious thinkers even among professional the - ologians , and it may be said that Voltaire suffit for all that sort of thing .

		But for the battle of truth with superstition each age must forge its own wea - pons , and Mr.
Huxley	PERSON	has shown himself an accom - plished artificer .

		Each of these volumes has a preface written for the collective edition , that of the latter volume being considerably the more lengthy of the two .

		.

		The pleasantly - Mr -
Richard Le GWlienne	PERSON	's account stated faith of '' The Religion of a Literary Man of an optimist .

		-LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a pleasantly-written es - say , which shows the author to have thought seri - ously if not deeply upon the most important of hu - man concerns .

		This religlo scriptoris is a very un - dogmatic sort of faith , so vaguely expressed that the most liberal-minded will find little difficulty in ac - cepting it , if , indeed , it do not appear to be made up of the merest truisms .

		Occasionally the author registers a most amazing judgment , as when he calls
Schopenhauer	PERSON	'' a small philosopher , '' with an '' in - effably petty and uncomfortable disposition . ''

		Un - comfortable , possibly , or rather uncomf orting , to the mild optimist of Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's type , but not exactly petty .

		Such vagaries , however , are not of the essence of the author 's doctrine , which is , for the most part , as sweetly reasonable as even Arnold could have wished .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
H. S. Salt	PERSON	's ''
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	'' -LRB- '' Dilettante Library , ''
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- is a concise and soberly-written study , critical rather than biographical , which may be read to advantage in connection with Mr.
Besant	PERSON	's de - lightful , if rather over-charged , '' Eulogy . ''

		The author discusses , very briefly , Jefferies as '' Man , '' as '' Natural - ist , '' '' Thinker , '' '' Writer , '' etc. , presenting what seems to be the net result of current criticism , with a due measure of shrewd comment and observation of his own .

		There is a useful appendix , and a portrait of
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	, the expression of which confirms in a way what has been said regarding his being a far less agreeable companion as a man than as a writer .

		M.
Paul Gaulot	PERSON	's spirited
Life of Count Fersen	ORGANIZATION	,
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	's chivalrous Swedish ally and admirer , loses little if anything of its charm in Mrs.
Cashel Hoey	PERSON	's capital translation , lately issued by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the title '' A Friend of the Queen . ''

		Re - cent disclosures have enabled
M. Gaulot	PERSON	to throw addi - tional light upon the romantic episode upon which his narrative naturally hinges , as well as upon the charac - ters of those most concerned in it .

		The story of the ill-starred flight to Varennes is admirably told , and the book altogether forms a not unimportant contribution to the annals of the period .

		There are portraits of
Count Fersen	ORGANIZATION	and the Queen .

		Professor
Rawlinson	PERSON	's '' Story of Parthia '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is an adaptation and in many places a close paraphrase of his '' Sixth Great Oriental Monarchy , '' which first ap - peared more than twenty years ago .

		The importance of the story lies in the clearness with which it brings out the character and position of the power which for three centuries '' balanced
Rome	LOCATION	, acted as a counter - poise and a check , had to be consulted and considered , held a place in all men 's thoughts , and finally furnished a not intolerable refuge to such as had provoked
Rome	LOCATION	's master beyond forgiveness . ''

		Such negative forces have an influence in history which we too often overlook .

		Mrs.
Frances Elliot	PERSON	's `` Old Court Life in
France	LOCATION	, '' which was published some twenty years ago , enjoyed a considerable popularity with readers who were not ex - acting as to accuracy of statement , and who liked to take their history well-diluted and strongly flavored with romanticism .

		The author now puts forth two vol - umes of `` Old Court Life in
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , similarly told , and likely to attract the same sort of audience .

		It tells us of the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	, of
Bernardo del Carpio	PERSON	and the Cid , and of various kings and other potentates down to the times of Ferdinand and
Isabella	LOCATION	.

		The manner of the telling is both incoherent and stilted , and serious readers will not care for the work .

		Modern language texts are multiplying at the usual rate .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an attractive little volume of letters from

		Mr.
Leslie	PERSON	's letters teem with original and curious observations on plant and animal life in the southern counties of
England	LOCATION	, with occasional '' asides '' on art topics and on the life bu - colic in general .

		The letters are crisply and pleasantly written , and there are many wood-cuts , mainly corrected reproductions of the original pen-and-ink scribbles .

		Mr.
St. George Mivart	PERSON	's `` Introduction to the Ele - ments of Science '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a book in - tended for the general reader , and not at all like , for example , the '' Elements of Science '' of Professor
Jevons	PERSON	, although having the same universal scope .

		Mathematics , mechanics , physics , biology , logic , and his - tory are the main subjects taken up .

		Neither Mr.
Mi	PERSON	- vart 's psychology nor his philosophy of history is likely to find general acceptance , for the personal equation of the writer gives them too marked a coloring ; but in the simpler matters of physical and biological science he is a competent , and usually a trustworthy , guide .

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
March 36 , 1894	DATE	.

		The publication of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's '' Marcella '' will be the most significant literary event of the coming week .

		Doubtless this third work of importance will be made the criterion of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's success as a novelist .

		The general impression seems to have been that ``
David Grieve	PERSON	'' did not quite fulfil the promise of `` Robert Elsmere . ''

		To my mind , ''
Marcella	PERSON	'' is an a ` dvanee , in the art of novel-writing , upon both of the former books .

		The story is more connected , and the characters as a whole are drawn with greater clearness , although there is no one character which equals that of the Squire in ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	. ''

		The girl of the period , either with or without a purpose , seems just now to engross the attention of the English-speaking race , and Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has hit the spirit of the times very happily with her `` Marcella . ''

		The latter young woman is decidedly purposeful , and sets out to reform her part of the world , an English country village , along the lines of the new Socialism .

		An engagement to the son of a lord is not allowed to interfere with this work , and it is the en - gagement and not the work that comes to an end when interests clash .

		I am not sure , however , that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	makes the new Socialism attractive , or does it full justice .

		She seems to have studied it '' from above , '' as
Marcella	PERSON	accuses her lover of doing in the case of a condemned poacher .

		The book is quite as long as the two which preceded it , but it is well proportioned , in - teresting , and full of material for reflection .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has evidently taken the advice of her critics , for the action of the story is not interrupted by long de - scriptions of unimportant characters or by digressions into the fields of religion and philosophy .


Edgar Stanton Maclay	PERSON	, whose '' History of the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' is just about to be published , is the son of the president of the
Maclay Theological Seminary of Los Angeles	ORGANIZATION	,
California	LOCATION	.

		He graduated from
Syracuse University	ORGANIZATION	in
1885	DATE	, having devoted himself particularly to the study of history .

		Since his graduation he has been constantly engaged upon this history of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has spent much time in
France	LOCATION	, where the Minister of
Marine	ORGANIZATION	opened the official archives to him , and also in
England	LOCATION	, where he was aided by the late Admiral
Provo Wallis	PERSON	, a survivor of the Chesapeake-Shannon fight .

		In this country Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	has been given ac - cess to many family papers and unpublished documents , and has been assisted by Admiral
Jouett	PERSON	and other naval officers .

		Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	will have an article de - scriptive of the cruise of the
United States	LOCATION	frigate '' Po - tomac '' for the chastisement of the Qualla Battooans in

Walter Crane	PERSON	, '' Modern Book Illustration , '' by
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, and '' Decorative Heraldry , '' by
G. W. Eve	PERSON	.

		The in - terest in book-lore seems to have culminated with the proposed new English bibliographical magazine .

		Interest in
Napoleon	LOCATION	seems to increase with each suc - cessive work relating to his life and surroundings .

		The latest
Napoleon	PERSON	volume is the '' Memoirs of the Baron de Meneval , '' which Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	are about to pub - lish .

		As private secretary to the emperor from
1802	DATE	to
1814	DATE	,
Baron de Meneval	PERSON	had , of course , special op - portunities for observation , which he did not neglect , as these selections from his diaries and notes plainly show .

		They have been edited by his grandson .

		The poems of the unfortunate
Richard Realf	PERSON	are at last to be collected in a volume .

		Since his suicide at
Oakland	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, in
1878	DATE	, there have been several announcements of proposed volumes of his poems , but none of these has appeared .

		Meanwhile ,
Realf	ORGANIZATION	's liter - ary executor and former comrade , Col.
Richard J. Hin	PERSON	- ton , has gathered together copies of all the poems that could be found , and has awaited a favorable opportunity for publication .

		This has now come about through the instrumentality of Col.
Alexander T. Hawes	PERSON	, of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, also a comrade of Realf , having commanded a regiment in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Cumberland . ''

		The Po - ems of
Richard Realf	PERSON	, '' with a brief biography by Col - onel
Hinton	PERSON	, will be issued in the Fall under the direc - tion of Colonel
Hawes	PERSON	, to whose address in the
Mills Building	LOCATION	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	, subscriptions may be sent .

		A large number has already been received .

		Colonel
Hin	PERSON	- ton has collected nearly two hundred poems by
Realf	ORGANIZATION	,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 223 and the volume will also contain the latter 's youthful verses originally published in
London	LOCATION	as '' Guesses at Truth . ''

		There will be three portraits , one taken dur - ing the
John Brown	PERSON	period in
Kansas	LOCATION	, another during the War , and the third at a later date .

		In ``
Joanna Traill	PERSON	, Spinster , '' Miss
Annie E. Holds	PERSON	- worth , one of the most popular of the younger English novelists , has drawn an interesting picture of rescue work in the
London	LOCATION	slums .

		Much is expected of this book , which will be published in
London	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	simultaneously on the first of the month .

		Mr.
W. T. Stead	PERSON	, who is particularly interested in this author and her work , has said of the book , which he saw in manu - script , that '' It is a tale of
London	LOCATION	life , painted from life , full of the pathos and tragedy and also of the brightness and vitality of modern
London	LOCATION	. ''

Sawyer	PERSON	Abroad . ''

		The latter vol - ume will be illustrated by Mr.
Dan Beard	PERSON	.

		The following Blilow story is from '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' : `` It will be remembered how , some two or three years ago , the German Emperor in a speech re - ferred rather rudely to the < Grumblers ' -LRB- Norgler -RRB- at the existing regime , and advised all such to shake off the dust of the
Vaterland	LOCATION	's soil .

		The speech created an unusual stir in all circles , and there was a large con - tingent of officials and others who took the hint , and became known forthwith as Staubdbschuttler .

		Btilow , who had always something to say or to write , held his tongue this time ; but , at the first Philharmonic Concert he conducted in
Berlin	LOCATION	, as he stepped on the platform he took out a very large handkerchief and in full view of the audience began to dust his shoes , just to show that he was not satisfied with the existing state of things !

		He took it also musically out of Count
Hochberg	PERSON	when that amiable despot had him turned out of the
Berlin Opera House	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was at a pianoforte recital at the
Singacad	LOCATION	- emie , where , by way of a prelude , Billow just played the first few bars of Figaro 's aria , ' Se vuol ballare , Sig - ner Contino ! ' ''

		Perhaps the most extensive literary work ever under - taken in this country is the military history now being produced by the government of the
United States	LOCATION	, un - der the title of '' War of the Rebellion , a Compilation of the
Official Records of the Union	ORGANIZATION	and
Confeder	PERSON	- ate Armies . ''

		It was begun just
twenty years ago	DATE	, and will be practically finished at the end of the next fiscal year .

		The work when completed will embrace 120 large royal octavo volumes of 1000 pages each , and a gigan - tic atlas , and the ultimate cost will be something like
$ 2,500,000	MONEY	for the 11,000 copies printed .

		Up to this date eighty-nine serial volumes have been published , and about
$ 1,800,000	MONEY	has been spent in all branches of the work , or about
$ 20,000	MONEY	per volume .

		The printing and binding alone cost
$ 10,000	MONEY	per volume , while the previous preparation of each volume for the printer 's hands cost an equal sum of
$ 10,000	MONEY	.

		Something like a thousand copies of this work are offered for sale at a trifle above actual cost .

		The price of the eighty-nine parts now published is
$ 56.10	MONEY	in cloth , and
$ 145.10	MONEY	in half morocco .

		A remarkable literary find has been made by the
American Press Company	ORGANIZATION	of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, in the shape of an original first edition of the poems of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, one of the rarest books in the world .

		For many years this unique volume was sought in vain by collect - ors of rare books , the only copy known to be in exist - ence being an imperfect copy in the British Museum .

		Two years ago , a copy was offered at a book auction sale in
Boston	LOCATION	, and , after a lively bidding , was bought by a
New York	LOCATION	dealer for
$ 1,850	MONEY	; it was then sold to a private buyer for
$ 2,500	MONEY	, who sent the treasure to
Paris	LOCATION	, where it was exquisitely bound at a cost of
$ 300	MONEY	.

		The copy just discovered by the American Press Com - pany was picked up at a second-hand bookstore some sixty years ago , and has since remained in the posses - sion of the purchaser .

		It is in an excellent state of preservation , and is worth its weight in gold ten times over .

		The title-page reads as follows :
TAMERLANE	LOCATION	, and Other Poems .

		By a Bostonian .

		Young heads are giddy , and young hearts are warm , And make mistakes for manhood to reform .

		Cowper .

		A new work by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	is just being published , entitled ''
Verona	LOCATION	, and Other Lectures , '' and illustrated with frontispiece and photogravure plates from draw - ings by the author .

		Of its five chapters , four were pre - pared to be delivered as lectures , during Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's tenure of the Slade Professorship at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		One has been written since his resignation .

		The lecture which gives its title to the volume , ''
Verona	LOCATION	and Its Rivers , '' was delivered at the Royal Institution in
1870	DATE	, and is now printed in extenso for the first time .

		The second , '' The Story of Arachne , '' dealing with Greek mythology , was read at
Woolwich	ORGANIZATION	in
1870	DATE	, and has hitherto been represented only by a brief report in a daily newspaper . ''

		The Tortoise of
Aegina	LOCATION	'' was prepared for the Ox - ford course on Greek sculpture , known as '' Aratra Pen - telici , '' but it was not delivered , and has remained until now in manuscript .

		The last two chapters of the book are connected with the projected series of '' Our Fathers 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, Have Told Us '' ; ``
Candida Casa	PERSON	, treating of the be - ginnings of Christianity in
Britain	LOCATION	, '' and '' Mending the Sieve , '' a lecture on the Cistercians and their architec - ture , given at the
London	LOCATION	Institution in
1882	DATE	.

		The
Department of Philosophy and Education of Co	ORGANIZATION	- lumbia
College	ORGANIZATION	announces the early appearance of the first of a series of contributions on philosophical , psy - chological , and educational subjects that are to appear under the editorship of the members of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		These contributions are not intended to interfere in any way with existing journals , to which the members of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	will continue to lend their cordial support as heretofore , but the new series will contain : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the longer and more important dissertations submitted by advanced students in philosophy and education , in par - tial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- , occasional longer and more technical studies by the professors and instructors them - selves ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- reprints from other journals of contributions made to them by members of the
Department of Phil	ORGANIZATION	- osophy at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The contributions will appear at irregular intervals , and will be numbered consecutively for binding and preservation .

		The editors propose to conform in every respect to the directions regarding such publications recently formulated by the Trustees of the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The new contribu - tions will appear under the editorial direction of Pro- fessors
Butler	PERSON	and
Cattell	PERSON	and Drs.
Hyslop	PERSON	and Far - rand .

		The first of the contributions to appear will be entitled ''
Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi	PERSON	: A Study in the Origins of German Realism , '' by Mr.
Norman Wilde	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	.

		The second will be ''
Kant	PERSON	's Inaugural Disserta - tion of
1770	DATE	, '' including a translation of the dissertation , together with an elaborate introduction and notes , by Professor
W. J. Eckoff	PERSON	of the
University of Colorado	ORGANIZATION	.

		Orders for these numbers , or requests for information concerning them , should be addressed to the
Department of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE EDITOR : A STUDY IN NATURAL HISTORY .

		The following notes upon that interesting specimen , the common editor , are taken from '' The Author '' of Lon - don : `` The common editor is chiefly remarkable for the mixture of ferocity and cunning which he displays .

		He lives in a remote cave , or cell , situated in almost inac - cessible places , and extremely difficult to find .

		The approach to his lair is commonly invested with swarms of the Office-Boy Hornet -LRB- see Chapter LXIL -RRB- , which do all in their power to prevent the intrusion of a stranger .

		Strychnine , done up in the form of chocolate drops , is probably the best means of destroying these .

		But even when they have been overcome , the zoologist is not unlikely to find the lair deserted ; for it is a habit of the editor to roam forth in search of food , which he does at frequent intervals .

		Those scientists who have made a determined effort to capture an editor , declare they have approached his den at all times , from eleven in the morning to late in the afternoon , and that they have been informed on each occasion that their prey has ' just stepped out to luncheon , ' and is not expected to re - turn for several hours .

		Another well-marked trait in the creature 's character , and one upon which all writers are agreed , is his passion for unused postage stamps , which he obtains from innocent contributors in enormous quan - tities .

		Hence a learned Professor has conjectured that it is the habit of the editor to lie concealed in his den until such time as he has accumulated sufficient stamps to secure him a meal , and that he then sallies forth to spend these , after which he again rests in hiding until another supply of stamps has been obtained .

		When in his den , his favorite employment is tearing up manu - script , with the exception of a few especially worthless articles , which latter he uses for filling his paper .

		It is also a well-known fact that he puts all the poems he receives into a hat , and draws out one or two at random for vise from time to time ; the rest he destroys .

		A further point observed by many zoologists is the edi - tor 's fondness for cliques ; they do not explain very clearly what these are , or how they are formed , but their existence is denounced by almost every writer on editors .

		Some facts concerning them will be found in a later chapter .

		It is sufficient to say here that they are represented as herds of selfish and incompetent monsters , whose only aim is to prevent any recognition being given to true genius . ''

		In two volumes , small 12mo , cloth , in a box ,
$ 2.00	MONEY	. ''

		In '
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	' and '
David Grieve	PERSON	' a great talent was at work ; but the question whether behind the talent there was that originating force which we call genius , was left unanswered .

		In '
Marcella	PERSON	' that question is answered beyond a doubt ... '
Marcella	PERSON
' marks	MONEY	a long advance in the art of novel-writing ... Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has worked through her culture , and found herself ; she speaks at last , in clear , resonant tones , out of the depths of her own nature , and her voice is the voice of an artist by the grace of God as well as by the nurture of the schools .

		In '
Marcella	PERSON	, ' as in the earlier stories , Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's task is to dramatize the strife of the soul with its inheritance and its conditions ... It is certainly no accidental interest in what are called burning questions which drew Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	... to that social problem which overshadows society , and lies on so many hearts not only as an intolerable mystery but as an intolerable burden ... Her real interest is in the problem of the personal life .

		... In '
Marcella	PERSON	' Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	presents the question of the day in strict subordination to its influence on the nature and destiny of a girl of brilliant temperament , deep feeling , intense idealism , and noble but impetuous and untrained character .

		She exhibits the social revolution as it touches a personality of native force and artistic sensitiveness .

		... It is with these subtler contacts ... that art legitimately deals ; and it is these aspects of the modern problem which are set forth with marvelous vividness and power in the story of Mar - cella 's career . ''

		Mr.
HAMILTON W. MABIE	PERSON	, in The Forum for
April	DATE	.

		By Mrs.
HUMPHRY WARD	PERSON	.

		MARCELLA . ''

		So many words about the problem with which the story deals must not be suffered to convey the impression that '
Marcella	PERSON	' is only another social study ; it is dramatic in the deepest sense from beginning to end , and more than once its dramatic movement rises to a great height .

		There are passages and scenes in it which in force and intensity come very near the greatest things in English fiction .

		Indeed , the special quality of the story is the passion which vibrates through it ; a passion for truth , a passion of sympathy , and at the end a passion of love .

		The narrative is full of strongly-drawn figures ; men who live in their emotions , no less than in their convictions and interests , and whose processes of thought are disclosed with a force and reality that constantly recall the masters of the novel . ''

		253 EDUCATED MEN IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE .

		The gravest of the charges brought against democracy declares it incapable of selecting suitable representatives for the performance of its public functions .

		This charge is no mere speculation , but rather an induction from suf - ficient experience to give it considerable weight .

		Our own experience of a century joins with the briefer but no less emphatic experience of the more democratic among the European com - munities in showing , or tending to show , that the rule of average opinion in a country results in putting the average man into public office , and that the average man is not often compe - tent to perform the delicate and highly spe - cialized work of administration .

		Even the Athenian democracy , at the time when its rep - resentatives were chosen by lot , was in better case than our more modern examples , for the average Athenian had a better training in the duties of citizenship than is got by the average Frenchman or American of to-day .

		If our modern democracy can not solve the problem of making the common suffrage result in the se - lection of uncommon men for public office , its future is not promising , and its boastful pre - dictions will prove anything but justified .

		That the problem eventually will be solved , we firmly believe ; but the first step towards its solution must be taken by forcing the popular conscious - ness to a recognition of the fact that the prob - lem exists , by getting a healthful spirit of un - rest at work , instead of the complacent but deadly optimism that has come to be thought patriotic .

		Civil service reform is , of course , one of the agencies whereby thoughtful people expect to see brought about the performance of work for the public by persons selected upon a basis of fitness for the work to be performed .

		But what is at present practically understood by reform in the civil service is only the beginning of what must be accomplished before democracy can safely lay aside that problem to engage upon some of the others that will be certain to confront it .

		When we shall have found out how -LRB- or rather agreed , for we perfectly well ' 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, know how -RRB- to organize without any reference to politics the clerical forces of our municipal , state , and national governments , we shall still have to face the difficulty of getting the right men into the elective and higher appointive offices .

		If these are to remain what they now are , the stake of the professional politician and the sport of popular caprice , the cause of civil service reform , even if triumphant upon the lines now laid down by its devoted champions , will have won but a dubious and imperfect vic - tory .

		The stability of its triumph will , more - over , remain uncertain , constantly menaced by powerful adverse influences .

		It is because of these considerations that we welcome , as a step in the right direction , the bill for a reorganization of our diplomatic and consular service , just introduced into the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	.

		Our foreign service is not numerically important , but a great deal depends upon its efficiency , and it is peculiarly well fitted to serve as an object-lesson in administration .

		How completely demoral - ized it has been in the past , and still is , may be read in many a paper upon the subject -LRB- such , for example , as Mr.
Wharton	PERSON	's recent review article -RRB- , and illustrated from the recollections of every intelligent American who has kept an eye upon public affairs for a few years past .

		What it might become is well enough shown by a glance at the similar service of
France	LOCATION	, or
England	LOCATION	, or any other nation of the first class .

		Senator
Morgan	PERSON	's bill proposes to take the for - eign service out of politics , and make of it a professional career that may be chosen by a young man just as he chooses law or divinity .

		It provides for a systematic classification of the diplomatic and consular posts , for entrance ex - aminations in foreign languages and such sub - jects as history and political science , for promo - tions based upon merit , and for fixity of tenure unless incumbents shall prove inefficient .

		Such an organization of our foreign service would certainly attract the best sort of men , for it would insure the proper qualifications , and would open as definite a career as is now of - fered by the military and naval services .

		The two highest grades of diplomatic appointments are not included within the proposed scheme , and it is not well that they should be at pres - ent .

		But twenty years from now , with such a reformed service in full operation for that pe - riod , there would be no good reason for going outside the ranks even for the selection of am - bassadors and ministers plenipotentiary .

		Such a plan as
Senator Morgan	ORGANIZATION	contemplates has for many years been urged by all thought - ful persons having regard for our national dig - nity and honor .

		It is entirely practicable , for it is what every other important nation does as a matter of course , and what we ourselves do in the naval and military branches of our public service .

		We might criticise some of the details of the bill , such as the low scale of salaries pro- posed , the failure to recognize certain univer - sity degrees as evidence of fitness in lieu of examination , the proposition to examine exist - ing incumbents , and some aspects of the ma - chinery suggested for the work of reorganiza - tion and of examination .

		But the plan as a whole is so commendable , and its adoption would prove of such incalculable value to the nation , that we are not disposed to dwell upon minor objections .

		That almost anything would be better than the state of things existing in our foreign serv - ice is apparent to most serious people , and to all who have had occasion to observe the work - ings of that service in foreign countries .

		Our recent experiences with a South American re - public provided a humiliating object-lesson in the consequences of using diplomatic appoint - ments for the payment of political debts .

		Every American who has lived for any length of time in foreign capitals knows how we suffer as a nation from the frequent incompetency of our representatives .

		The American minister or consul and his queer doings furnish in almost every important European city the subject of a choice collection of anecdotes to which every newly arrived American colonist is called upon to listen with feelings of mingled amusement and shame .

		In some cities , the antics of a suc - cession of American representatives becomes fused into a sort of legendary epic , from which the type alone emerges , the individual being lost to sight .

		That he is not dear to the mem - ory of self-respecting Americans goes without saying .

		Of course , our haphazard system of pitchforking office-seekers into diplomatic and consular offices , with regard to neither their training , nor their culture , nor the peculiar re - quirements of the posts to which they are re - spectively assigned , sometimes results in a for - tunate selection .

		But in view of the whole measure of our offending , there is little conso - lation in the thought that we did contrive to send
Taylor	PERSON	to
Germany	LOCATION	, Motley to
Vienna	LOCATION	, and
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	to
Madrid	LOCATION	and
the Court of St. James	ORGANIZATION	.

		And for the sake of having a body of thoroughly educated and cultivated gentlemen in our foreign service , of providing them with an 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 occupation that they might honorably select to follow as a life-calling , most of us would gladly consent to see even the highest posts filled by regular promotion from the ranks , and to re - nounce the privilege of occasionally honoring a distinguished man of letters by making him our officially accredited representative in some foreign capital .

		ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
VIRGINIA	LOCATION	* It has been pointed out by Professor
March	DATE	that the study of English in
America	LOCATION	may be traced to two men ,
Noah Webster	PERSON	and
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	.

		It is well known that as early as 1818 Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	included Anglo-Saxon '' as a part of the circle of in - struction to be given to the students '' of his pro- jected
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		When
the University of Vir	ORGANIZATION	- ginia was finally opened , in
1825	DATE	, Anglo-Saxon was included in the courses offered , and from that day to the present it has always been given .

		But it was intrusted , along with some eight or ten modern lan - guages , to Dr.
Blatterman	PERSON	, whose time must have been very fully occupied .

		After him , Dr.
Kraitsir	PERSON	occupied the chair for two years ; and in
1844	DATE	Dr.
M. Schele DeVere	PERSON	entered upon his distinguished career , which with the end of the present session rounds out its fifty years .

		It is computed that since the establishment of the
University	ORGANIZATION	about seven hundred students have elected courses in
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	LOCATION	.

		But the influence of
Jefferson	PERSON	was not lim - ited to the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
March	DATE	, trained under the Websterian influence , but ac - quainted by residence in
Virginia	LOCATION	with the work of
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, was called in
1857	DATE	to
Lafayette College	LOCATION	, where `` English and
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	as a separate department of philological study coordinate with Latin and Greek '' was first recog - nized .

		The influence that had previously led to the study of English at
Lafayette	LOCATION	was Jeffersonian .

		Professor
March	DATE	says : '' Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	's plans for his
University	ORGANIZATION	attracted attention through the whole country , and it was very likely on their suggestion that the founders of
Lafayette College	ORGANIZATION	, which was chartered in
1826	DATE	, made the study of Anglo-Saxon and English prominent in their proposed curricu - lum . ''

		There is a tradition how well-grounded it is impossible to say without further examination that the first distinctive course in English Litera - * This article is the sixth of an extended series on the Teach - ing of English at

		ture ever offered in
America	LOCATION	was planned and car - ried out by three
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	graduates , who were associated in the management of a school for young ladies .

		But the interest in the English language and literature , indicated by the import - ance attached to them by the founder of the Uni - versity and her sons , did not manifest itself in any very active development of their study .

		These sub - jects , at first assigned to the chairs of Modern Lan - guages and of Philosophy , and later grouped in part with History , were not recognized as a distinct de - partment until
1882	DATE	, when Professor
James M. Gar	PERSON	- nett was elected Professor of English Language and Literature .

		Ten years later , in
1892	DATE	, the
Board of Visitors	ORGANIZATION	created the
Linden Kent Memorial School	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature .

		The establishment of this chair enables Professor
Garnett	PERSON	to devote his entire time to English Language , while the new chair in - cludes Rhetoric and Belles Lettres besides English Literature .

		With the full freedom of election characteristic of this institution since its foundation , young men may pursue courses in either or both of these schools .

		In the School of the English Language ,
B. A.	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, and Ph.D. courses are offered .

		A synopsis of these courses is herewith given :
B.A.	LOCATION	Course : Modern English .

		In this class , the study of the English drama and of the descrip - tive history of the language is pursued .

		Shake - speare is made a special subject of study .

		The critical study of one or two plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, with private reading of about a fourth of the plays , is followed by similar study of selected works of other dramatic authors .

		Lectures on the history of the Elizabethan drama are given in connection with the study of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		These treat the early dramatic forms prevalent in
England	LOCATION	, the rise of regular comedy and tragedy , the Pre-Shakespear - ian dramatists , the Shakespearian period , and the Post-Shakespearian dramatists to the close of the theatres in
1642	DATE	.

		The study of the English drama occupies the first half-session ; that of the history of English treated from an elementary point of view , the second half-session .

		The course closes with the reading of some work in practical illustra - tion of the formation of English .

		The aim is to give such a knowledge of the history of the lan - guage as every educated man should possess .

		Three ectures a week are given .

		The object of the
B.A.	LOCATION	course is to treat specific jeriods of the language from both a philological and iterary point of view , stress being laid upon the r ormer ; and the Shakespearian period has been se - ected as that best suited to the beginner , and per - laps the most interesting .

		M. A. Course : Old and Middle English .

		In this class the historical and philological study of the anguage is pursued , the class beginning with its oldest forms , and tracing the language , by the study of specimens , through its different periods to he formation of modern English .

		After a thorough 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, study of the grammar , selected pieces of Old and Middle English prose and poetry are read , with a view to acquiring a philological knowledge of the origin and structure of English .

		Lectures on the position of English in the Indo-European family of languages , and on the history of the language , are also given .

		These treat in outline the other branches of the Indo-European family of languages , and in detail the Teutonic branch .

		Special stress is laid upon the development of the language during the Old and Middle English periods , and the infusion of the Romance elements which so greatly affected its character .

		The study of Old English -LRB-
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	LOCATION	-RRB- occupies the first half-session ; that of Mid - dle English the second half-session .

		In addition to what is read in class , assigned parallel reading of Old and Middle English works is also required .

		It is well for the student to have studied the his - tory of English as given in the class of Modern En - glish , or some similar course , before entering upon the study of the course in Old and
Middle English	LOCATION	, although this is not essential , as the two may be studied together .

		Some antecedent philological study is , however , necessary .

		The aim is to lay the foundation for more advanced studies in English Philology .

		There are three lectures a week .

		Ph.D. .

		Course .

		In this course , to which the M. A. course is a necessary preparation , the method pursued is freer , and the taste of the individual stu - dent is consulted to a greater degree .

		The more advanced study of English Philology is the general subject ; and whether the students shall accomplish this by a more extensive reading of Old and Mid - dle English works , or by a study of Gothic as the basis for comparative study of the Teutonic lan - guages , is left to the student himself .

		In either case , encouragement to individual research is given by the requirements of a dissertation on some sub - ject cognate with the course pursued .

		In all classes the work is not limited to that assigned for class - preparation , but a course of parallel or private read - ing is prescribed , on which also the class is duly examined .

		In the
Linden Kent Memorial School	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature , as in the School of the English Lan - guage , three courses are offered .

		B.
A. Course	ORGANIZATION	.

		The class meets three hours a week throughout the session .

		For convenience of presentation , the course is divided as follows : 1 , Rhetoric .

		This comprises a careful study of the principles of style and of invention in prose dis - course , with exercise in essay-writing and in the crit - ical analysis of selected specimens of English prose .

		2 , Versification .

		This course is based on the Pro- fessor 's notes on Poetics .

		The lectures discuss the - ories and principles of versification , morphology of verse , history of verse forms , kinds of poetry , etc. .

		Class exercises of various kinds are assigned from time to time .

		3 , History of English Literature .

		This course comprises : -LRB- a -RRB- Lectures on the Development of English Literature prior to Chaucer ; -LRB- b -RRB- English Literature from Chaucer to
Dryden	LOCATION	; -LRB- c -RRB- English Literature from Anne to
Victoria	LOCATION	.

		Besides general references published in the Cata - logue , numerous special references for authors , pe - riods , works , etc. , are given throughout the course .

		In addition to the various written exercises of the class , five essays are required of each student ap - plying for graduation in the B. A. course .

		M.
A. Course	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this course there are occa - sional lectures , but in general the exercises of the class are conducted by means of questions , conver - sations , and conference .

		Readings are assigned , independent investigations insisted upon , and writ - ten reports required from time to time .

		The stu - dents are encouraged to form their own judgments , and to express these orally and in writing .

		Refer - ences for each author or period studied are given , and the free use of the library in this and all courses is cordially recommended .

		There are four and a half hours a week .

		As an essential part of this course a dissertation showing independent and orig - inal work is required .

		Ph.
D. Course	ORGANIZATION	.

		This course will be , in some measure , adapted to the needs of the students de - siring to pursue it .

		Its purposes will be to culti - vate more fully the love of letters , to encourage in - dependent and scholarly research , and to further the art of literary expression .

		It will include the study of some writer , or school of writers , or of some period or movement of literature , and will take into consideration the political , social , and lit - erary characteristics of the time under discussion .

		In conclusion it may be said that the relations existing here between students and professors is so cordial and frank that there is no lack of oppor - tunity for personal contact and conference .

		This enables the Professor of Rhetoric to supplement the written correction of essays and the general re - marks before the class by private conversation and individual advice .

		On the other hand , some of the best of these essays are published in the `` Univer - sity of
Virginia	LOCATION	Magazine . ''

		This students ' publica - tion and their weekly '' College Topics '' are appre - ciated adjuncts to the work in composition ; while the debating societies , in lieu of systematic training in oratory , give abundant opportunity for practice in speaking .

		The foundation for the library -LRB- now about 52 , - 000 volumes -RRB- was judiciously laid by the purchase of works of permanent and substantial value , and the wisdom which characterized the selection made by the first professors has in the main been exhib - ited by later literary committees .

		The library is stronger in English Literature prior to the nine - teenth century than it is in the products of this cen - tury or of our own country , but the deficiencies are fully recognized and the want is being supplied as fast as limited means allow .

		THE DIAL 235 COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE EARLY HOME OF THE ARYANS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Your issue of
March 16	DATE	contains a review of
Clark	PERSON	's '' Manual of Linguistics , '' under the heading of '' Pop - ular Studies in Language , '' in which the following state - ment is made : '' As regards the early home of the Aryans , our author wisely contents himself with stat - ing the various arguments in favor of a European and an Asiatic site , and leaves the choice to his readers .

		He seems to show , however , a leaning towards
Schrader	PERSON	's selection of
Eastern Iran	LOCATION	. ''

		Knowing that
Schrader	PERSON	abandoned the Asiatic theory a number of years ago -LRB- see his Sprachvergleichung und Urgeschichte ,
1883	DATE	-RRB- , I was somewhat startled at the above statement , and upon examining
Clark	PERSON	's work was surprised to find that the author not only showed no predilection for the Asiatic theory , but did not even rep - resent
Schrader	PERSON	as favoring it .

		This the following ex - tracts from his book will show : '' If it be right to locate , with
Schrader	PERSON	, the original home in the district of the
Middle Volga	LOCATION	, '' etc. -LRB- P. xxix . -RRB- ''

		The absence of common names for ass and camel does not suggest an Asiatic site for the original home . ''

		-LRB- P. liii . -RRB- ''

		It falls now to utilize all that has been learnt regard - ing Aryan culture to assist in determining the scene of the joint-life .

		This used to be laid in
Asia	LOCATION	.

		The prim - itiveness of Sanskrit , the ancient civilization and tradi - tional antiqueness of the
East	LOCATION	, the reputation of
Asia	LOCATION	as the officina gentium , all tended to the allocation of an Asiatic site as the scene of the joint life .

		Primitiveness of language proves nothing as to primiti-ve home , and the presence of archaic traits in a language manifestly does not prove its speakers autochthonous in the dis - trict or zone . ''

		-LRB- P. Iviii . -RRB-

		Concerning
Schrader	PERSON	's contention for a European ori - gin ,
Clark	PERSON	says : ''
Schrader	PERSON	's theory of the original home is plausible , well-reasoned out , and merits attention . ''

		After having given a brief account of it , he adds : `` A good case is thus made out for the site tentatively chosen as the scene of the joint-life .

		The inductions that an examination of the language caused to be drawn are fairly well borne out by the objective realities of the steppe country of the
Middle Volga	LOCATION	. ''

		-LRB- P. Ixiii . -RRB-

		But the author goes on to say : `` It seems to me that
Hirt	PERSON	-LRB- ` Die Urheimat der Indogermanen , '
Brugmann	PERSON	's Journal , Vol .

		I. , p. 464 -RRB- has picked some holes in this theory .

		... If this presentation of cognates is correct , the site chosen for the original home must be one where the four Indo-European trees -LRB- the birch , the willow , the pine , and the oak -RRB- grow together .

		Such a condi - tion throws out of count not only
Asia	LOCATION	, but
Schrader	PERSON	's steppe country .

		The site must be European and wooded , and
Hirt	PERSON	pitches on the country on the Baltic just out - side the
N. E.	ORGANIZATION	corner of the beech zone . ''

		-LRB- P. Ixix . -RRB-

		Would it not seem from this that
Clark	PERSON	rather has a '' leaning towards ''
Hirt	PERSON	's selection of the Baltic country ?

		After having read
Clark	PERSON	's book I was at first at a loss to account for Professor
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's slip , but I think the following sentence from
Clark	PERSON	-LRB- p. Ixi . -RRB-

		will show what , in a hasty reading , has misled him : '' The choice of
Eastern Iran	LOCATION	as the scene of the Indo-Iranian period of common culture has much to recommend it . ''


Evi	ORGANIZATION	- dently he has read Indo-Iranian as being synonymous with Indo-European .

		Just a word more : Professor Dodge says that the author '' wisely contents himself with stating the various arguments in favor of a European and an Asiatic site , and leaves the choice to his readers . ''

		Now , as a mat - ter of fact ,
Clark	PERSON	does not state the arguments in favor of an Asiatic site any more fully than is given in the extract from
p. Iviii.	LOCATION	, and there only to pronounce against it .

		The time has come for repudiating the Asiatic the - ory .

		There is not one single indisputable argument to commend it .


JULIUS E. OLSON	PERSON	.


University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	,
April 5 , 1894	DATE	.

		Two jurists of the highest eminence , a great English orientalist , and a popular American novelist crowd the literary death-roll of the closing days of last month .

		Sir
James Fitzjames Stephen	PERSON	-LRB- born in
1829	DATE	-RRB- found time to do the work of a journalist for many years , contrib - uting , among other things , to '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' those remarkable historical papers that have recently been published in book form as `` Horse Sabbaticse . ''

		He also wrote a profound treatise on '' Liberty , Fra - ternity , and Equality , '' a '' History of the Criminal Law of
England	LOCATION	, '' and '' The Story of Naucomar , '' which lat - ter work showed the career of
Warren Hastings	PERSON	in its true light , and relegated
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's famous essay to the realm of fancy or of fable .


George Ticknor Curtis	PERSON	-LRB- born in
1812	DATE	-RRB- was the author of many legal works of standard value , as well as of biographies of
James Bu	ORGANIZATION	- chanan and
Daniel Webster	PERSON	, ''
John Charaxes	PERSON	, a Tale of the Civil War in
America	LOCATION	, '' and a '' Constitutional History of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''


William Robertson Smith	PERSON	-LRB- born in
1846	DATE	-RRB- was of the first eminence as a student of Hebrew and Arabic .

		As the former , he pub - lished `` The Old Testament in the Jewish Church , '' `` The Prophets of
Israel	LOCATION	and their Place in History , '' `` Lectures on the Religion of the Semites , '' and the Old Testament '' article in the '' Encyclopaedia Brit - annica , '' which brought him into bad odor with the or - thodox and into high esteem with scientific theologians .

		In Arabic , he succeeded the lamented
Palmer	PERSON	at Cam - bridge , and occupied the chair of Arabic at the time of his death .

		Mrs.
Jane G. Austin	PERSON	will be remembered as the author of a remarkable series of novels of early life in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, `` Standish of Standish '' being perhaps the best of them , although many votes will be recorded for '' A Nameless Nobleman . ''

		She depicted the Puritan life and character with both knowledge and sympathy , and endeared herself to all readers having
New England	LOCATION	blood in their veins .

		Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	is reported to have said in a recent conversation , apropos of his autobiography : '' I work at the memoirs an hour or two each day , and am making satisfactory progress .

		That is , I have about one-half completed of all I shall write .

		Then I shall place the manuscript in the hands of my publishers , and they will keep it in their safe until I shall have passed away .

		My belief has always been that a man 's memoirs should be distinctly posthumous , and I shall carry out that belief in my own case . ''

		236 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, IlEXRIK With respect to the fundamental classifica - tion of poets , the classification based upon the distinction between poetic form and poetic thought , between energy and beauty of expres - sion , Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	must be ranked with the in - ferior class , with the class of poets who aim to say things forcibly rather than to say them beautifully , with the Brownings rather than with the Tennysons .

		Like all the greater poets of this class , he offers abundant evidence of the ability to express himself in supremely ex - cellent form , but obviously does not care to make the effort except upon rare occasions .

		Nearly always his chief purpose is to say some - thing forcibly ; hence he uses prose or verse indifferently as the vehicle of expression .

		With what energy he is able to embody an idea , how provocative of thought and discussion is his di - rect and compact mode of speech , we have all seen in the little drama of `` A Doll Home , '' and in the eager interest with which that compara - tively unimportant play was received a few years ago by our reading public .

		And it excited the same eager interest in the Scandinavian coun - tries when it first appeared .

		It is stated upon excellent authority that in
Stockholm	LOCATION	, the win - ter of the production of this piece , invitations to social gatherings often included a particular request that guests should abstain from dis - cussing '' A Doll Home . ''

		How often we all wished that some such practice might obtain during the acute stages of the ``
Robert Els	PERSON	- mere '' fever !

		This incident shows very clearly how imperative is the demand made by Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	upon the attention of his readers .

		Far more , even , than the play mentioned do such works as '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt , '' the poet 's real masterpieces , rivet the attention and stimulate the thought .

		For their author is dis - tinctly a poet with a message .

		To borrow a phrase applied by Professor
Royce to Hegel	PERSON	, and far more truly applicable to the subject of these remarks , he '' is one of the most note - worthy of all the chosen instruments through which , in our times , the Spirit has spoken . ''

		Nearly all nineteenth century poetry has * BRAND .

		been laden with some message .

		This is per - haps the chief characteristic of modern , as distinguished from earlier , poetry .

		Goethe 's message was that the experience a man gets is the experience he needs , that we may find in our environment the means of the broad - est culture if we will but determine , once and for all , to do away with half-measures and all forms of incompleteness , and live with fixed resolve in the whole , the good , and the beauti - ful .

		Hugo 's message was that of the Gospel repeated , of the brotherhood of man and the freedom of the soul .

		Shelley 's message took the form of a dazzling dream of the future , held up for the comfort and the inspiration of men battling with the darkness and the folly of the present .


Wordsworth	PERSON	's message was one of healing and consolation .

		Arnold shall tell us what it was : '' He found us when the age had bound Our souls in its benumbing round ; He spoke , and loosed our heart in tears ; He laid us as we lay at birth On the cool flowery lap of earth , Smiles broke from us and we had ease ; The hills were round us , and the breeze Went o'er the sun-lit fields again ; Our foreheads felt the wind and rain .

		Our youth return 'd ; for there was shed On spirits that had long been dead , Spirits dried up and closely furl 'd , The freshness of the early world . ''

		It takes no
Browning Club	ORGANIZATION	to discern what
Browning	PERSON	's message was .

		We may find it any - where in his pages , and perhaps as well as any - where else in ''
Pippa	PERSON	Passes '' : '' God 's in his Heaven , All 's right with the world . ''

		And
Tennyson	PERSON	's message ?

		That , too , seems clear enough .

		It is , if anywhere , in the sec - ond ''
Locksley	PERSON	Hall '' : `` Follow Light , and do the Right for man can half - control his doom Till you find the deathless Angel seated in the vacant tomb . ''

		Now , Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's message may be described as an intensified form of
Goethe 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The in - junction of both alike is to live wholly , to make life as complete as possible ; but Goethe lays more stress upon range , upon wideness and di - versity of interest .

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, on the other hand , with all the emphasis at his command , enjoins an absolutely consistent and unflinch - ing persistence in some definitely chosen path of life .

		Both
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	appeal to us to do away with incompleteness , with vacil - lation , with '' halfness , '' to use the latter poet 's favorite word ; but
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's meaning is that we should be broad and catholic in our view , while Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's meaning is merely that we should follow out logically whatever course we
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 have chosen .

		With him , the distinction be - tween good and bad is not half so important as the distinction between hesitancy and firm - ness , between the haphazard life and the life that has a purpose of some sort . ''

		If pleasure 's thrall Thou art , be that from year to year ; But be not that to-day , to-morrow , And then next year a prey to sorrow ; Be altogether what thou art , Be something wholly , not in part ! ''

		We moderns bungle our lives so unspeakably because we are so ready to make concessions ; because we bow down to the spirit of compro - mise in order to get along comfortably with our fellow-men .

		What Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	says upon this point has no uncertain sound .

		Being a dramatist , his characters do not always give expression to his own opinions ; but we may be sure that Brand is speaking for the author when , after a vehement harangue addressed to the wavering multitude , he tells them that the Spirit of compromise is no other than Satan him - self .

		In other words , Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	stands for indi - vidualism first and last .

		A man 's first duty to himself and to the world is to make sure that he is an individual ; not a thing of cross-purposes and wavering impulses , a caricature of human - ity .

		The modern State especially the mili - tary
State	ORGANIZATION	with its paternalisms and its arti - ficial class distinctions , is the curse that rests upon individualism at present .

		Revolutions do not accomplish much , for they only substitute one form of machinery for another , and the in - dividual remains almost as trammelled as ever .

		The only revolution that ever amounted to any - thing , that was not hopelessly mismanaged from the start , was the Deluge ; and even that re - sulted in
Noah	LOCATION	's assumption of a dictatorship , affording a prototype for the action of the
First Consul	ORGANIZATION	some thousands of years afterwards .

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	watched with much interest the de - velopments of the War of
1870	DATE	and the crea - tion of the new French Republic .

		Here at last seemed to be the opportunity for a new order of things .

		He wrote to a friend : `` The old illusory
France	LOCATION	has gone to pieces ; when the new actual
Prussia	LOCATION	likewise shall go to pieces , we shall advance with a leap into the coming age .

		Hej !

		how ideas will tumble about us !

		And it will be high time , in truth .

		For up to date we have been but living upon the crumbs from the revolutionary table of the
last century	DATE	, and that food has been long enough chewed and re-chewed .

		Our concepts call for new meanings and new explanations .

		Liberty , equality , and fraternity are no longer what they were in the days of the guillo - tine , of blessed memory .

		This is just what the politi - cians will not understand , and for that reason I hate them .

		Men still call for special revolutions for rev - olutions in politics , in externals .

		But all that sort of thing is trumpery .

		It is the human soul that must re - volt . ''

		But the
Paris	LOCATION	Commune came with its excesses ; then the inevitable reaction , and the hopes thus expressed were rudely dashed to the earth .

		This plea for individualism , one of the strong - est that have ever been made , is chiefly embod - ied in two great dramatic poems , '' Brand '' and `` Peer Gynt . ''

		Nothing could be more instructive than a detailed analysis of these two works ; but such an analysis would take us far beyond the limits of this brief paper .

		The barest outline must content us here . ''

		Peer Gynt '' is a semi-allegorical creation , suggestive , with its richness of incident and bewildering scene-shifting , with its variety of figures real and fanciful , of nothing so much as of the sec - ond part of Goethe 's `` Faust . ''

		Peer Gynt , like
Faust	PERSON	, sees something of the lesser and the greater world , and works out a rude sort of salvation for himself ; although the certainty of any sort of salvation for him remains problem - atical enough at the end , for the drama closes with the menace of the melting-pot into which all souls that have frittered away their individ - uality are cast to be melted over for the sake of the raw material hanging over him , and the suggested possibility of redemption is , as with
Faust	PERSON	, through the instrumentality of a woman 's faith and unswerving devotion .

		For in
Peer Gynt Dr. Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	has presented , with all the satirical energy at his command , what he conceives to be the essentially modern type of character : the soul that has stood for nothing positive , either good or bad , that has failed to assert its individual dignity , that has lived in dreams and in concessions , not in act and con - sistent purpose .

		In Brand , on the other hand , the poet pre - sents us with what is clearly his ideal type of character .

		He pictures him as a village priest , although he might just as well , for the purpose of the work , have pictured him as engaged in any other calling .

		But , since he is a priest , a priest he will be with all his heart and soul . ''

		All or nothing '' is the stern formula which sums up his creed , and in the light of which he shapes his own life .

		Thrown by chance or
Providence	LOCATION	into a little mountain village far to the north , he renounces the ambition that would impel him to seek a wider field for his activity , and devotes himself utterly to his mission .

		His mother lies at the point of death , but is un - regenerate , according to his strict interpreta - 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, tion of the divine behest ; he refuses to bear the consolations of religion to her bedside , and she dies in despair .

		His child falls a victim to the severity of the climate , but Brand will not forsake his mission for the chance of saving its life .

		Last of all , his dearly beloved wife pines away and dies in the struggle , strong in spirit but weak in the flesh .

		No amount of suffering can make him swerve one inch from the path of duty as he understands it .

		Yet he is not hard-hearted ; on the contrary , there is something quite ineffable in the depth and tenderness of his human feelings .

		But his call - ing demands absolute and unflinching devo - tion , and / shall have it as long as life endures .

		He cries in the hour of his anguish : '' Be steadfast to the end , ray soul , All to renounce is victory 's goal ; What we gain is ours never , What we lose we gain forever ! ''

		And , contrasted with the splendid heroism , moral and physical , of his life , we have all the petty and provincial types of character that abound in such a village , and one by one they come under the lash of the poet 's merciless satire .

		There is the sexton , the type of petty officialdom , who does not dare to exhibit ordi - nary human feeling '' Not even he who would be can At once official be , and man . ''

		There is the bailiff , who has no conception of any higher life-purpose than that of perform - ing , with strict regard to rule , the functions of his office .

		And then there is the dean , Brand 's ecclesiastical superior , who looks upon religion as a convenient instrument for the preservation of the social order , and upon the Church as being merely a part of the mechanism of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Against all these narrow theories and influences Brand pits himself , single-handed , and wages with magnificent energy and single - ness of purpose the hopeless fight .

		There are few more impressive things anywhere in litera - ture than the story of the words and acts of this man this type of what the poet conceives man could and might make himself , had he but the will to do so .

		To us , at least , this work has for nearly twenty years past been a source of consolation and inspiration .

		We have often recurred to it , and each time with a deepened sense of its almost matchless energy and eleva - tion .

		As a moral tonic , the work has few equals in literature .

		It is , then , with peculiar gratification that we welcome the English translation of `` Brand '' that has just been made by Professor
Herford	PERSON	, and provided with notes and an elaborate in - troduction .

		The prose translation published by Mr.
William Wilson	PERSON	two years ago , was , from the very fact of being in prose , hopelessly inadequate to embody the passionate energy of the original .

		Professor
Herford	PERSON	's translation gives us both the substance and the form , and everyone acquainted with the original knows them to be inseparable .

		Moreover , he has re - produced the form with singular fidelity , al - though it is so difficult to put into English mould that we frankly admit having doubted the possibility of anyone doing at all what Pro- fessor
Herford	ORGANIZATION	has now so triumphantly accom - plished .

		His version reads , for the most part , like an English poem , and many of its passages seem to us quite as strong and as beautiful as the original .

		We will not cavil about a few trifling defects here and there , when the work as a whole is deserving of such cordial com - mendation .

		To one slight matter , however , we must call a moment 's attention .

		The two bits of macaronic verse that occur in the poem have been translated into plain English ; and we can not but think that much of the intended ef - fect has thereby been lost .

		There is something too characteristic to be spared about Brand 's last passionate cry : '' Svar mig ,
Gud	ORGANIZATION	, i doden 's slug !

		Gselder ej et f relsens fnug Mandeviljens qvantum satis ?

		and the voice that calls from above , as the ava - lanche overwhelms him : '' Han er deus caritatis ! ''

		The ending is thus translated : BKAND . ''

		God , I plunge into death 's night , Shall they wholly miss thy Light Who unto man 's utmost might Will 'd ?

		A VOICE . ''

		He is the God of Love . ''

		Since the translator has given us one macar - onic bit of his own devising '' My worthy friend , I needs must hold His breeding scarcely quantum suff .

		For whom it is not great enough '' he might have kept for us the Latin phrases that Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	saw fit to employ upon two crit - ical occasions .

		It only remains for us to exhibit the quality of Professor
Herford	PERSON	's work by an extract or two .

		The satirical aspect of the poem appears to advantage in a conversation between Brand and the Bailiff -LRB- Fogden -RRB- .

		The latter seeks to condone the degeneracy of his townsmen by recalling the fact that their ancestors made for themselves a name in history .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 THE BAILIFF . ''

		Now the land 's dwindled and decay 'd , But our renown still lives in story .

		The days of our reputed glory Were when the great
King Bele	ORGANIZATION	sway 'd .

		Many a tale is still related About the brothers
Wulf	PERSON	and Thor , And gallant fellows by the score , Went harrying to the British shore , And plunder 'd till their heart was sated .

		The Southrons shriek 'd with quivering lip , * Lord , help us from these fierce men 's grip ' ; And these ` fierce men , ' beyond all doubt , Had from OUR harbours sallied out .

		And how these rovers wreak 'd their ire , And dealt out death with sword and fire !

		Nay , legend names a lion-hearted Hero that took the cross ; in verity , It is not mentioned that he started BRAND . ''

		He left behind a large posterity , This promise-maker ?

		THE BAILIFF . ''

		Yes , indeed ; But how came you to ?

		BRAND . ''

		O , I read His features clearly in the breed Of promise-heroes of to-day , Who take the cross in just his way . ''

		Satire gives way to indignant scorn , when , in the subsequent scene with the Doctor ,
Brand	ORGANIZATION	is told that to be humane is the first of the mod - ern commandments . ''

		Humanity !

		That sluggard phrase Is the world 's watchword nowadays .

		With this each bungler hides the fad That he dare not and will not act ; With this each weakling masks the lie , That he '11 risk all for victory ; With this each dastard dares to cloak Vows faintly rued and lightly broke ; Your puny spirits will turn Man Himself Humanitarian !

		Was God ' humane ' when Jesus died ?

		Had YOUR God then his counsel given , Christ at the cross for grace had cried And the Redemption signified A diplomatic note from Heaven ! ''

		The height of passionate expression is reached in the last act , when Brand , spurned by the people whom he has sought to lead to a higher life , and driven out into the ice-bound moun - tain wilderness , reviews the past and forecasts the future in the magnificent soliloquy of which these are the closing verses -LRB- the particular his - torical reference being to
Norway	LOCATION	's virtual re - fusal to join with
Denmark	LOCATION	in repelling the Prussian and Austrian invasion of
1864	DATE	-RRB- : '' Direr visions , direr doom , Glare upon me through the gloom .

		Craft , the wolf , with howl and yell , Bays at Wisdom , sun of earth ; Cries of ruin ring to North , Calls to arms by fjord and fell ; And the pigmy , quaking , grim , Hisses : ' What is that to him ? '

		Let the other nations glow , Let the mighty meet the foe , We can ill afford to bleed , We are weak , may fairly plead From a giants ' war exemption , Need not offer All as meed For our fraction of Redemption .

		Not for us the cup He drank , Not for us the thorny wreath In His temples drove its teeth , Not for us the spear-shaft sank In the Side whose life was still .

		Not for us the burning thrill Of the nails that clove and tore .

		We , the weak , the least accounted , Battle-summons may ignore !

		Not for us the Cross He mounted I Just the stirrup-slash 's stain , Just the gash the cobbler scored In the shoulder of the Lord , Is our portion of His Pain ! ''

		These extracts sufficiently illustrate the spirit and the manner of Professor
Herford	PERSON	's trans - lation , and hardly less the spirit and the man - ner of the original poem .

		We may add that the translator 's introduction is an admirable piece of thinking .

		This , for example , is a sin - gularly profound saying about Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's work : '' His most vehement teaching is apt to be coupled with the materials for criticising it .

		His most definite and dominant thoughts come to the surface laden with that tangle of counter - thought which gathers about every peremptory conclusion in the depths of a critical mind . ''

		Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	's recent '' Commentary on the Writings of
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	'' consists of a lengthy introduction , followed by a dozen or more chapters upon as many separate plays .

		These chapters were originally written with lit - tle reference to one another , and published in THE DIAL and other periodicals .

		Taken sep - arately , they are interesting ; but taken as a whole , they do not make a very satisfactory book .

		There are many evidences of haste in the preparation of this '' Commentary , '' and some of the verse translations interspersed are quite unworthy of the translator .

		Still , it is well that such a critical review of the whole of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's work should have been placed be - fore English readers , many of whom base a distorted notion of the Norwegian poet upon a few of the social dramas , these being , to one who knows his
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, relatively unimportant .

		Occasionally Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	says a notable thing , as when he remarks that in writing '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt '' the author polar - ized himself .

		And thoughtful readers of the great Norwegian will assent to our commenta - tor 's closing words : '' Though not always agreeing with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, I am greatly indebted to him for having kindled in my mind many 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, sparks of vital thought , and aroused my interest in sub - jects of vast concern which formerly I passed by with the Pharisee , and the
Levite	PERSON	, and the rest of the re - spectable herd .

		He has the courage to look the ugli - est truths in the face without flinching , and to record what he sees and feels with a relentless disregard of revered conventionalities .

		What he offers is not food for babes ; but to a mature mind it is wholesome and stimulating reading . ''

		THEORIES CONCERNING ART .

		* The garden of art has been rather invaded , in these latter years , by the lovers of wisdom from the one side and by the lovers of man - kind from the other .

		The philanthropists have urged that the flowers be cut for baskets to send out to the hospitals , or else decocted into herb-teas for suffering humanity , or even that essences might be distilled from them for the making of panaceas .

		The philosophers , at first content with mingling reminiscences of the gar - den with their other dreams , have now conde - scended to more particular acts of usefulness .

		Some of them analyze the flowers after the most rigid botanical methods ; others devise the most scientific means for improving their growth ; and others , finding the garden agreea - ble to such as happen past , explain to those for - tunates why such should be the case .

		As to the gardeners , they view this irruption in vari - ous ways .

		Some of them retire to their own private arbors , where they either forget the strangers entirely , or else -LRB- sometimes -RRB- call out injurious names at them or make faces .

		Others , however , are a good deal fascinated by the philanthropists , and busy themselves with the hospital baskets and the herb-teas .

		And others still take council with the scientists , and by means of their phosphates and nitrates pro- duce new blossoms of very strange loveliness .

		Meanwhile the world travels by on the high - way outside , enjoys the flowers to some extent , but does not allow itself to become painfully excited at what is going on within .

		At bottom there is good reason for all this .

		Ethics and science certainly have something to say here .

		A man can not well make him - self independent of duty or of facts by being an artist .

		So , on the whole , good will come of the matter in some way or other .

		LA SUGGESTION DANS L' ART .

		Par
Paul Sonrian	PERSON	.


Paris	LOCATION	:
Alcan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Leaving ethics on one side , as far as the present article is concerned , there are several books among the recent publications which are interesting from the scientific point of view .

		Just at present the scientific sesthetician is very scientific indeed .

		In fact , it is often quite im - possible for the average unscientific reader to understand a word of what he is saying .

		One is inclined at first to resent this difficulty , as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	resented his inability to understand Kant : it may be that the reason is the same .

		Whether this be or no , Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	, in his treatise on `` Pain , Pleasure , and ^ Esthetics , '' realizes the situation and provides against any such protest .

		His book is , first and foremost , # treatise in Psychology ; but , as he himself remarks , he hopes to interest the artist and the general reader .

		For these last , therefore , he has resumed the sum of each chapter in lan - guage that they can understand .

		Elsewhere he feels free to be technical ; but even here '' the average reader '' can sometimes follow him , although it must be confessed that he will often find himself beyond his depth .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's book is a special treatise , and
M. Souriau	PERSON	's '' La Suggestion dans 1 ` Art '' is an - other .

		But the latter , perhaps because the au - thor is a Frenchman , is not only expressed in terms comprehensible to the majority , but is written in a very agreeable manner .

		It is based on a theory quite fascinating in itself , and worked out into a very interesting presentation .

		More general in scope than either of these is '' Art in Theory , '' by Professor
G. L. Ray	PERSON	- mond .

		In this book the author 's previous works are seen to have their place in a definite system , the general plan of which is now for the first time , I believe , made - public .

		This particular book , the third in publishing , would be the introductory volume .

		Next would come '' The Genesis of Art-Form , '' which appeared last year ; a volume on '' Rhythm , Proportion , and Harmony in Art '' is promised ; and lastly , I should suppose , are special treatises on the various arts , of which that on Poetry was pub - lished some time since .

		But whatever be the order in which Professor
Raymond	PERSON	arranges his work in his mind , he has done enough al - ready to show that he intends a systematic view of Art , both in its general characteristics and in particular .

		Of such a view `` Art in Theory '' supplies the standpoint .

		It is , in general , on the nature of the fine arts -LRB- including , of course , music and poetry -RRB- , considering also , of neces - sity , the theory of beauty and the relation of the arts among themselves .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 Perhaps the first thing to be said of this book is that in general structure it is an exceedingly nice piece of argument and exposition .

		One may differ on particular points , one may even hold that the logic is not always severe , but I think every careful reader must be delighted at a handling of the subject at once so harmonious and symmetrical as well as natural .

		It is not the easiest of reading , naturally enough ; but there is a pleasure in considering the general plan of what one has read when it appears in a form which one may almost call artistic in itself .

		The basis of Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's work is the idea that so long as we consider art as the mere representation of the forms of nature or as the mere expression of the conceptions of the mind , we take a view that is wrong , not only because it is partial but also because it is indiscriminating .

		And even if we recognize both elements , so long as we recognize them as independent we fail of a full understand - ing .

		The representation of nature in the arts involves the ideas of the mind , and the expres - sion through the arts of mental conceptions demands the forms of nature .

		The two are in - terdependent .

		On this basis is worked out a de - termination of the Higher Representative Arts .

		Here the subject divides .

		On the side of the forms of nature , we come to a consideration of beauty , and reach a definition involving a rec - ognition not only of nature but of the mind .

		On the other hand , in a study of the modes of representation as affected by the conditions of the mind we are led through a discussion of the characteristics of the different arts and their relations to each other .

		Here the treatment terminates as far as this particular book is con - cerned , but the two lines of study are continued in the other volumes of the series .

		One will hardly be expected , in an article like the present , to offer special criticisms .

		It must be enough if one can give a general notion of the purport of a book and indicate its relation to other lines of thought .

		Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's work has one value which some systems of a3s - thetics by no means possess : that of laying out the ground in such a way that one can readily find a local habitation for such other notions as one may have on hand .

		This is an excellent thing ; until one has such a basis it is difficult to feel that one has any consistent ideas at all .

		It will be useful , therefore , to show what relation to Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's theory is borne by the studies already mentioned of
M. Souriau	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	.

		When Professor
Raymond	PERSON	reaches the conclu - sion that the Fine Arts are arts which -LRB- among other things -RRB- represent the effects of nature upon the mind , he uses a phrase which , although necessary to his line of thought , rather veils an interesting branch of inquiry .

		If we said , rather , that art was the presentation of that which will cause in the mind of another the ef - fects which have been caused in the mind of the artist , we should at once see that it was of importance to know what it was that was pre - sented and how it caused its effects .

		This , re - marks Professor
Raymond	PERSON	in a later part of his book , is the subject of other volumes of the series .

		It is also the subject of
M. Souriau	ORGANIZATION	's book a book extremely interesting , compre - hensive , and entertaining .

		How do works of art induce in our mind the ideas which nature has called up in the mind of the artist ?

		For one thing ,
M. Souriau	PERSON	propounds a curious theory .

		The mental state caused by a work of art , he argues , is physiologically akin to the state of hypnosis : a state in which the imag - ination works powerfully while the will is re - duced .

		Hence , however art creates its effects , the matter is rendered more easy by the phy - siological condition of whomever is affected .

		But this idea , although it is wrought out in some detail in the book , is not necessary to the main theme , which is an inquiry into the means whereby the artist suggests -LRB- to use the word in the technical sense -RRB- to another mind such things as he desires .

		And here developes a most interesting study of the methods and ef - fects of the arts , which , unfortunately , can be followed no farther just here .

		M.
Souriau	ORGANIZATION	's book , then , covers a field that is not treated in the present work of Professor
Raymond	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	, on the other hand , studies some matters which Professor
Raymond	PERSON	has treated very differently . ''

		Pain , Pleasure , and Esthetics '' is a special work in
Psychol	LOCATION	- ogy ; its general purport has for some time been known through the author 's articles in '' Mind . ''

		It will therefore call for no elab - orate notice here ; an indication of its drift will be enough for our purpose .

		Here we have a new theory of art , of beauty ; a theory which differs from Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's in that it arises from a consideration of the causes of art and its effects , while Professor
Raymond	PERSON	considers chiefly its character and conditions .

		Not that either view excludes the other ; in - deed , the theories may be compared .

		Accord - ing to Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	, the impulse to art is an instinct that leads us to wish to attract others to ourselves , and beauty is that which causes 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, in us pleasure which exists not only in the mo - ment but in revival .

		According to Professor
Raymond	PERSON	, the impulse to art is an instinct that leads us to exercise our faculties in ways not needful to our existence -LRB- the so-called '' play impulse '' -RRB- , and good art is that which gives us in a great degree apprehensible unity of varied effects upon the sensation or the imagination or upon both .

		Without going into details , it is not hard to see that where the two theories come into contact there is a clash -LRB-
Marshall	ORGANIZATION	, pages 103-5 , 332-3 -RRB- .

		Of the two , in spite of the value of Professor
Raymond	PERSON	's basis , Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's is by far the stronger , and it is probable that when fully apprehended and applied it will prove the more vital and preg - nant .

		At present , however , it stands in great need of an interpreter before the public ; not on account of its technical expression only , but because its very ideas , both in premise and con - clusion , are such as can be fully appropriated by the psychologist alone .

		Interesting as the study of such books is , one is led in reading them to ask , What is the use of it all ?

		They are as a rule pretty hard reading , and it hardly seems as if an increased knowledge concerning the nature of art resulted in any increase in our enjoyment of art itself .

		Mr.
Pater	PERSON	remarks that '' the value of such at - tempts has most often been in the suggestive and penetrating things said by the way . ''

		If such were certainly the case , it would be a great saving of time if someone would go through the great tract of aesthetic writing in order to pick out the suggestive and penetrating things and make a little book of them .

		But it may be that such is not the only value .

		The intel - lectual exercise we may set aside , for the phil - osophy of art as philosophy gives no more pleasure and no less than other branches of the science .

		The question may be , rather , Is our power of artistic enjoyment made greater , more vigorous , by such reading ?

		There are certainly not a few who would say that the case was quite the reverse , that our power of artis - tic enjoyment was crowded to the wall and smothered by the force of scientific inquiry .

		To the point is the remark of Sir
Joshua	PERSON	, who once said that a reason which lessened his af - fection for the study of criticism was that crit - ics , so he had observed , `` debar themselves from receiving any pleasure from the polite arts , at the same time that they profess to love and admire them . ''

		I do not think he is right about all critics , but there is certainly some - thing in his view .

		Whether one gains greater artistic pleasure or not may be doubtful .

		What is not doubt - ful is that , whatever may be our artistic pleas - ure , we all love to talk about art .

		Rightly or wrongly , people can not be restrained from talk - ing about it .

		And such being the case , it is , on the whole , a thing greatly to be desired -LRB- if people are to be still allowed to talk to others on the subject or to write about it -RRB- that they should talk or write sense instead of nonsense , which end may possibly be attained by the dif - fusion of a more accurate knowledge of the na - ture of beauty and of the conditions under which only the arts can be rightly pursued and en - joyed .

		In other words , we all tend to think about those things which delight us , and hence every real step toward clearer and surer thought on such matters is of some general interest .

		THE DIAL 243 by Mr.
John M. Bonham	PERSON	.

		The author is earnest , thoughtful , and means to be candid ; he has also a real contention : yet his oversight of the world the entire world to which we belong is so narrow that he has added one more book of dogma to the many books of dogma which he was striving to thrust aside .

		He understands by secularism , knowledge of the physical world which finds its most accurate expres - sion in physical science ; and he regards this knowl - edge , with the feelings and methods connected with it , as silently taking possession of the human mind to the ultimate exclusion of all other forms of thought .

		He accepts this tendency as both inevitable and de - sirable . ''

		The hope of the theologian to make any final adaptation of theology which shall enable the - ology to remain permanently in such adaptation , must therefore be illusive '' -LRB- p. 48 -RRB- . ''

		The whole movement of her law determines that there is one path , and only one , which marks the course from ignorance to the highest attainable knowledge , and that this path lies in the line of the ultimate subjec - tion of all ideals to the tests of progressive knowl - edge '' -LRB- p. 375 -RRB- .

		Is it not a little strange that one who believes that all labor devoted to theology and metaphysics is futile , that there is but one form of real knowledge that known as science , should add to these worthless discussions a volume of four hun - dred pages , containing hardly a trace of science , and resting exclusively on a philosophical basis ?

		This incongruity of method is hidden from the author by the superficial fact that his conclusions are negative in form .

		He is forgetful of the fact that it requires essentially the same knowledge to deny as to affirm , and that his entire method of reasoning , from be - ginning to end , is at one with that which he would reject as infinitely variable and wholly uncertain in its issue .

		The dogmatism of theology has often been battered ; he batters it once again , but seems utterly oblivious of the large candor which has taken its place in many minds .

		He has evidently felt the powerful drift of secularism , the force and value of which , in its own limits , we fully admit , but hardly at all the strength of those deeper under-cur - rents which are restoring the balance of our lives .

		He personifies theology , metaphysics , nature , sci - ence , in so positive a form that they seem to become malign and benign spirits in the world , having their way with it for good or for evil .

		He forgets that it is man alone , and precisely the same man , who has busied himself respectively with theology and science ; and that if man has made of theology that complete mess the author supposes him to have made , it would be a most unexpected result to find him wholly and finally right in his second inquiry .

		Here is a single leap from darkness into absolute light .

		There is a class of physicists who do not understand their own doctrine of evolution in its bearing on spiritual life ; and I know no better proof of the general validity of the spiritual move - ment among men than the way in which it con - stantly extends and renews itself .

		The volume entitled '' Religion '' is written with a very different estimate of faith from that which pervades '' Secularism . '' ''

		It is religion , rather than the aptitude to invent tools , that has created civili - zation '' -LRB- p. 29 -RRB- .

		`` If religion shows itself too obstinate in maintaining its traditions and pre - scriptions , science , in its turn , shows itself too eager to impose theories whose truth it has not - as yet verified , and practices whose morality is as yet doubtful '' -LRB- p. 188 -RRB- .

		The author looks upon re - ligion as a permanent school of human thought , a most pervasive and powerful incentive in conduct , and one , in common with all other natural tenden - cies , slowly purifying and perfecting itself as civil - ization progresses .

		The discussion is clear , concise , and cool to the point of frigidity .

		It expresses the conclusion of one who looks upon religious evolu - tion in the world from the outside , but is not dis - posed to underrate the importance of the phenom - ena involved in it .

		It does not identify religion with any one faith , but treats in a critical way the successive phases through which it has passed , and the successive difficulties it has encountered .

		The discussion leads up to one conclusion the separa - tion of religion from the State as a necessary con - dition of its own liberty and highest development .

		The aloofness of the author makes the work the more effective in enforcing this one purpose the ultimate independence and freedom of religious life .

		It is a book that is local in its atmosphere , in the sense that it is fitted to enforce on Frenchmen the respect which is due to religious evolution , and the free form it is destined ultimately to assume .

		Dr.
Sanday	PERSON	's lectures on '' Inspiration '' are com - prehensive and liberal .

		The author deals with the history and construction of the canon of the Old and of the New Testament with reference to a more definite and admissible doctrine of inspiration .

		He accepts , in a conservative way , the results of crit - icism as expressed in the works of Kuenen and
Wellhausen	ORGANIZATION	.

		He thinks , however , that this criti - cism is pushed too exclusively in the interest of naturalism , and is not sufficiently free in recogniz - ing the divine element in the sacred history .

		Inspi - ration , in the author 's view , finds its typical highest expression in the words of the prophets , and from this point shades down in various parts of the canon till it quite disappears . ''

		How do we know that they are not projecting their own thoughts out - side themselves , and ascribing them to an external cause ?

		This is the heart of the matter .

		And the one point on which we must firmly take our stand is the belief that in this contention of theirs the prophets were not mistaken , that their utterances had a cause outside themselves , a real objective cause , not to be confused with any mental process of their own '' -LRB- pp. 145 , 146 -RRB- .

		The theory of the author would seem more consistent if he were con - tent to yield this objective source of inspiration and accepted the fact of inspiration on the personal side , with whatever limitations this may impose .

		The objective fact , whatever it may be , is very obscure , very troublesome , and very much out of harmony 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, with a truly spiritual method .

		The mind itself is the only medium of truth .

		Truth and the
Spirit of Truth	ORGANIZATION	must finally work in and by it ; and we gain nothing by delaying the process .

		The object - ive declaration must submit itself at once , in its spiritual uses , to the mind that receives it .

		The spirit alone is the vehicle of truth ; it alone is ca - pable of a true inspiration , an elevation into the re - gion of spiritual light .

		God works under his own laws , according to his own methods , in quickening the thoughts of men ; and this process loses charac - ter rather than gains it by any objective constrain - ing cause whatever .

		Truth is not truth , nor inspi - ration inspiration , till the mind , by its own powers in its own right , grasps the revelation .

		We gain nothing whatsoever by delaying this consummation .

		The prophet is prophetic by virtue of his superior insight .

		The inspiration which blesses us is the in - spiration of
Christ	LOCATION	, which enabled him to lift the familiar texts of Scripture into a new meaning , and run his lines of exposition parallel , indeed , with fa - miliar ideas , but on a much higher level .

		The au - thor might the more readily make this concession , as he regards the Messianic prophesies not as historic foresights , but rather as spiritual insights , a fore - shadowing of the things sure to be contained in the providence of God .

		Whatever trouble the super - natural may give us elsewhere , it ought not to give us trouble in inspiration , since the natural is here the best possible vehicle of the supernatural .

		The truth can declare itself no otherwise than by its own medium , the human mind .

		The volume entitled '' Speculum Sacerdotum '' contains a series of addresses intended to present the true function and temper of the minister of Christ .

		The author is guided chiefly by
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	; and under such titles as '' Self-Denial , '' '' Purity , '' '' Long-Suffering , '' '' Reputation , '' `` Self-Surrender , '' he defines on various sides the spirit of service in holy things .

		The temper of the work is conven - tional , very devout , and fairly penetrative .

		The conventionalism of the book is real , though decis - ively of the better order .

		It is in a distinctively religious method , though in a broad way , that the author would render his word and work .

		The preacher is not to bring social and political truth , but divine truth to his hearers .

		The region has not been attained in which the two are inseparable .

		Sacred things are still to be spoken as sacred things , and secular things as secular .

		In this method , neither is well spoken .

		We must , like our Lord , have the parables of life on our lips , before we can either deeply see divine things , or adequately ex - pound them , or correct the world by them .

		The volume of Hulsean Lectures , by Dr.
Hort	PERSON	, is one of genuine insight .

		The passage , `` I am the way and the truth and the life , '' must return fre - quently to every spiritual mind as a most compre - hensive summation of the Gospel .

		Indeed , to me it seems a declaration so explicit , to put our faith so thoroughly and so exclusively within the range of an interior personal life , as to exclude all the for - mal doctrinal renderings of the words of Christ .

		He is the way and the life because he is the truth .

		He , in his thought , character , and action , becomes such a disclosure of the spiritual world that he is henceforth and forever a guide in it ; he deepens and widens all our experiences of it .

		Dr.
Hort	PERSON	conceives very fully and tenderly the circumstances under which the words were called out ; th * sense of hopeless loss and confusion that was overtaking the disciples , as
Christ	LOCATION	, in bodily presence , seemed ready to slip away from them , leaving no sufficient clue , either to their thought or their action , by which they could follow him .

		Thomas , with dis - turbed and narrow vision , exclaims , '' We know not whither thou goest ; how then can we know the way ? ''

		To lift the disciples off from a semi-sen - suous life into a purely spiritual one , was what Christ assayed to do in the words , '' I am the way , the truth , and the life . ''

		His departure demanded the transition ; and the transition was secured by his departure .

		The spirit of this comprehensive text is rendered with great fulness , and often with much depth .

		The only criticism we make upon the book is that at times the connections of thought be - come thin and slight , and do not fully sustain the general force of the exposition .

		This may arise from the fact that the contents of the volume were first given as lectures .

		Something of the same difficulty appears in the next volume , '' Natural Theology , '' also delivered on a lecture foundation .

		The lecturer spins his thread thin , a little according to his exigencies .

		One can not now write profitably on
Natural Theology	ORGANIZATION	without a truly scientific temper ; a thorough appre - hension of how the world has come together , part with part ; and without also being quite free from a disposition to fall back readily on the supernatural .

		Professor
Stokes	PERSON	, being thoroughly versed in physics , meets well the first requisite , and fairly well the second requisite .

		There are two tendencies that are barren , though not equally barren , in discussing physical things in their spiritual bearings : a dis - position to be satisfied with a mechanical explana - tion of them , leaving out of sight all the inner mys - tery of construction .

		The mind darts about , like a water-fly , just dimpling the surface of things , dis - turbing nothing and disturbed by nothing beneath .

		This tendency Professor
Stokes	PERSON	wholly escapes , and is an earnest theist because of his deep sense of the ultimates our explanations are constantly reaching .

		The second impediment to any adequate growth of thought is an easy solution of all dependences by referring them at once to the will of God .

		I can - not feel that the author has come quite as fully into the light in dealing with the supernatural as in deal - ing with the natural .

		The two seem to remain some - what in collision with him , as they still do with most minds .

		A reconciliation of the natural and supernatural in one coherent system of thought is a very urgent demand .

		It is not unlike that by
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 245 which we unite in man causal and free dependences .

		The universe can no more have spiritual life with - out that immediate presence of the
Divine Spirit	ORGANIZATION	which is shadowed forth by the supernatural , than the brain of man can be the seat of the soul of man , obeying no causes except physical ones .

		Professor
Stokes	PERSON	thinks there is a different force of proof in the pleasing marking of flowers and birds from that found in the colors of the rainbow .

		That is , phy - sical law in its apparent necessity and permanence yields less proof , at least less impressive proof , than physical law in connections not involved in the en - tire system of things .

		The immanence of the mind of God the supernatural at the centre of the nat - ural seems to be overlooked by this opinion .

		The book , especially in its treatment of physico-spiritual questions , is one of insight and feeling .

		The volume by the Rev.
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	is made up of essays , published in English reviews .

		Though not formally united , they are united in their gen - eral drift .

		They are very able and interesting .

		This volume , like previous works by the same au - thor , has been called out by his intimate connection with the Catholic revival known as the `` Oxford Movement . ''

		He aims to show , and does show , the extreme overruling force which a sceptical or ag - nostic movement for the moment acquires , leading to the oversight of truths and tendencies equally permanent and more powerful than those with which it itself is dealing .

		There is no disparagement of the critical temper , there is simply an assertion of the under counter-current that is deeper and no less inevitable .

		The work is well-fitted to awaken a more catholic temper by imparting a broader and more appreciative one .

		Its closing essay , `` The Wish to Believe , '' is the longest one , and enters fully into those conflicting feelings which mingle with our beliefs and unbeliefs , inclining us to ac - cept or reject conclusions even in the very act and attitude of asserting the power of pure reason .

		In - deed , outside of mathematics there is no pure rea - son .

		Reason , as it deals with the facts of being , dissolves at once into feeling , as certainly as light breaks into color when it falls upon this changeable world of ours .

		As color brings additional disclos - ure , so do feelings help to give us the very terms in life with which we are dealing .

		Half our errors come from the want of those truly empirical data which are due to the emotions .

		This volume touches deeply , interestingly , and instructively that true spir - itual equilibrium that arises from both partaking of the spiritual world and thinking about it .

		It is a very admirable and instructive work , and cuts deeply into a great deal that is self-confident yet superficial in human thought .

		It puts a true logic of life over against the formal logic with which it is often con - fronted and apparently overthrown .

		The trial of Professor
Briggs	PERSON	before the
General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church	ORGANIZATION	proved less significant , less of a landmark in our progress to - ward liberal faith , than it gave promise of being .

		When it was first foreshadowed it seemed about to become one more sharp contention for religious lib - erty .

		It turned out rather a muddle , in which men , like disturbed bees , confusedly sought their enemy and inflicted their wounds at random .

		The some - what voluminous account of the trial , now before us , is written with perfect candor by one in full sym - pathy with Presbyterian belief , who is prompted to his task by the feeling that Professor
Briggs	PERSON	in no material way departed from that faith .

		He is convinced that the Assembly misapprehended the grounds of contention and fell into an act of injus - tice .

		This conclusion is carefully , quietly , and thor - oughly presented .

		In tracing the history of the trial , we draw attention simply to the first charge , as indicating the kind of confusion which charac - terized it .

		This charge rested chiefly on the words in the inaugural of Professor
Briggs	PERSON	. ''

		There are historically three great fountains of divine author - ity , the
Bible	LOCATION	, the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and the Reason . ''

		Most men , inclined to accept liberal beliefs , looked upon this affirmation , when it was made , as a clear and earnest assertion of relatively independent lines of revelation in the minds of men , in human history and in the Scriptures .

		It was this conviction that aroused interest everywhere in the action of the Presbyterian Church toward so salient and suggest - ive a position .

		It is not strange that that church looked on the declaration taken in connection with the universal movement toward liberality as break - ing with the authority of the creed , and was dis - turbed by it .

		The only surprising thing is that this adverse prepossession was so strong ; that the As - sembly gave no weight to the words of Professor
Briggs	PERSON	discarding explicitly and repeatedly the or - dinary interpretation , and putting in its place a rendering of the assertion to which the most rigid doctrinaire could hardly object without self-stulti - fication .

		The natural conclusion of the trial would seem to have been , '' How great a matter a little fire kindleth . ''

		Events , however , did not take this turn .

		The Assembly was disposed to force on Pro- fessor
Briggs	PERSON	's incautious expression the obnoxious meaning first attached to it ; and thus the trial added to its mediaeval character a touch of the ludicrous .

		The Assembly was in haste for the auto-ddrfe , and was not to be balked by any state of mind or change of mind on the part of its victim .

		It was in vain that Professor
Briggs	PERSON	denied that he intended to assert any independence in these three sources of truth ; in vain that he affirmed the dependence of each and all of them on the spirit of God ; and in vain that he affirmed infallibility as attaching to the Scriptures alone .

		Instead , there - fore , of a stimulating contention for higher forms of truth , we have , in the trial of Professor
Briggs	PERSON	, a peculiarly perverse presentation of the narrowness of the human mind .

		There has been , perhaps , no event on this con - tinent in the religious world so simple , so spectacu - lar , and so significant as the
Parliament of Relig	ORGANIZATION	- 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, ions .

		It was not a more thorough disclosure of facts nor a sharper enunciation of principles that made it remarkable ; but rather the direct address to the eye , ear , and heart , due to the spectacle of men from all parts of the world , and with great va - riety of faith , in warm and respectful conference with each other on the same platform before an en - thusiastic audience .

		This is a fact reached by many years of preparation , and one which will define a point for many subsequent years of fulfilment .

		The more conservative minds those who in cool relig - ious decorum held back from participation , or were not willing by implication to weaken the infallibil - ity of their own faith can not fail to feel the gen - tle sympathetic stir of thought which has gone forth from that assembly to the very corners of the earth .

		The religious world is altered by it .

		Its hostilities are softened ; its spiritual penetration and power are enlarged .

		The call for a muster of the forces of faith , one and all , has been heard through all the land .

		Two works , now before us , spread out fully this great event , and preserve , as far as possible , by a detailed report and by many illustrations from far and near , its sensuous power .

		The same marvel - lous executive ability that was everywhere present in the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	was also present in full measure in the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
John Henry Barrows	PERSON	, the efficient Chairman of its
Executive Committee	ORGANIZATION	, has summed up and finished , in two affluent volumes , his great labor in devising and securing this assembly .

		The review by the Rev.
L. P. Mercer	PERSON	necessarily suffers somewhat in the presence of the larger work .

		It has , however , a distinct purpose , and may meet the wants of many .

		It aims , by a careful analysis of the subjects involved in the speeches and papers presented , and by offering only those portions of them which bore most directly on these topics , to put in a brief , manageable compass the thought and intellectual force of this grand occasion .

		Those who are confused and wearied by the miscellaneous and multitudinous character of the complete event may be glad to sample it in this book .

		Those who wish the feast entire will prefer the larger volumes , even though they burden the table with 1600 compact pages .

		A book that has grown immediately out of the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	is '' Heart Beats , '' by
P. C. Mozoomdar	PERSON	.

		It opens with a brief but very in - teresting biographical sketch of its distinguished author .

		It is in all respects a spiritual gem .

		Mr.
Samuel J. Barrows	PERSON	says of it , at the close of the biography , '' To me it seems the most remarkable devotional book since that of
Thomas & Kempis	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The work is made up of brief detached spiritual experiences , carefully treasured as they have oc - curred in the life of the author .

		They denote a keen , incisive intellect , strong and delicate spiritual sensibilities , and a practical , proportionate bent of mind .

		They are widely theistic .

		They escape the warping force of dogma , and the perverting power of asceticism .

		They are the wholesome experiences of a healthy spirit , and yet of one that has the vis - ion and impulse of the prophet .

		They contrast very favorably with the carefully reproduced devo - tions of the good Bishop Hall .

		Another volume by Mr.
Mozoomdar	PERSON	, entitled `` The Spirit of God , '' gives expression to such a rhapsody of spiritual life that one needs to take it a little at a time , in an elevated mood .

		The soul is simply rising and riding , like a wide-winged bird on a strong wind .

		The immanent mind of God is most fully and freely present to the author under the term Spirit : Spirit in Nature , Spirit in Life , Spirit in Reason , Spirit in
Christ	LOCATION	, Spirit in History , Spirit in All Religions .

		Mr.
Mozoomdar	PERSON	escapes mysti - cism more perfectly than most who are possessed of a like sweep and elevation of feeling .

		It is im - possible that some things should not seem mystical in an author whose experiences are so remote from those of the average man .

		His own firm hold on things is especially seen in the chapter on '' The Spiritual Power of the Senses . ''

		The coherence of the volume does not lie in any nicety of delineation , any orderly accumulation of thought , but in the sin - gle centre to which the eye is always turning the spiritual glory of God in all his works .

		We have united these brief notices under the title , `` The Natural and the Supernatural . ''

		The first volume , '' Secularism , '' rests very flatly on the physical world .

		The last volume , '' The Spirit of God , '' rises very freely and serenely into the empy - rean of spiritual life .

		Naturalism is the soul of the one ; Supernaturalism of the other .

		Are these two things antagonistic ?

		Not if our vision is single and wide .

		The supernatural is the inner force of the natural ; the natural is the clear , definite expres - sion of the supernatural .

		We have the same para - ble in many forms .

		Life does not work beyond the chemical and physical powers at its disposal ; yet it disposes them in a way all its own .

		The mind of man does not transcend the nervous conditions which are its instruments ; but it uses these condi - tions , wields this instrument , for objects hidden in itself alone .

		The world is God 's chosen rational term of expression ; but it is only an expression .

		The sub - stance of spiritual being lies deeper in the mind of God .

		The natural is thoroughly supernatural , not a bar to it , nor restraint upon it .

		When the super - natural pushes farther than it is wont , it is in no way other than itself .

		It is still the visible made vital by the invisible .

		Our first author has no more right to deny as hallucination the experiences of our last author , than the unpoetic mind has to charac - terize the impressions of the poetic mind as idle rhapsodies .

		The worlds in which the two live are very distinct , yet one world ; no more distinct , nor less distinct , than are the dark day dying out in the cold gray light of evening , and the morning breaking through a golden and roseate mist on the earth which it claims as all its own .

		The one au -

Lockyer	PERSON	finds that different temples were erected for observing the rising and setting of different objects at certain seasons of the year .

		Since the
Egyptian Temples	ORGANIZATION	are very numerous , and are oriented in all possible directions , it follows that they could not all be Temples of the Sun .

		Hence the author concludes that the various shrines were sacred to their respective deities , which were represented in the heavens by certain stars or con - stellations .

		In order to make his theory fit the facts , he takes account of the effects of Precession in changing the amplitudes at which the stars rise , and in this way , by taking stars small enough and spaces of time long enough , he can find some ex - planation of the orientation of nearly all the im - portant temples in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The whole argument seems to proceed upon the supposition that the tem - ples were erected mainly for astronomical purposes .

		But it will be evident to those who are at all fa - miliar with the religions of antiquity that this view is untenable .

		It is certain that the temples were erected mainly for religious purposes ; but since , in later times , the priesthood became a learned hier - archy , it is natural to suppose that some of the tem - ples served incidentally to secure astronomical ob - servations , and thus enabled the priests to discover the length of the year , and to institute the calendar , so that the religious and state festivals might be regularly observed .

		Most of that part of the work which treats of the year , the calendar , the Sothic period , etc. , appears to be reasonably sound .

		It will also readily be conceded that a number of the temples may have been so oriented as to receive on their sacred altars -LRB- at sunrise -RRB- the light of the sun at the equinoxes or solstices .

		And it may be that some of the temples were so oriented as to receive the light of certain bright stars , such as Vega , Arc - turus , the
Pleiades	LOCATION	,
Aldebaran	ORGANIZATION	,
Sirius	ORGANIZATION	, and Canopus ; but when Mr.
Lockyer	PERSON	contends that the Egyptians oriented temples to such small stars as a Ursae Majoris , and g Draconis , his argument can hardly be deemed worthy of serious consideration .

		It is known that the Egyptians worshipped the sun under the name of Ra , because they were aware that the whole world depends upon the light and heat of the sun ; they also worshipped
Sirius	ORGANIZATION	under the name of Isis-Sothis , because the heliacal rising of
Sirius	ORGANIZATION	heralded the rising of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, upon which all life in the
Nile Valley	ORGANIZATION	depended .

		It would therefore be natural to expect to find temples oriented to these fundamental celestial objects ; but Mr.
Lock	PERSON	- yer 's logic would imply that the temple-builders were primarily astronomers , and secondarily priests .

		Hence we may remark that while a number of the suggestions in '' The Dawn of Astronomy '' are in - teresting , and some of them doubtless correct , many of them are hypotheses pure and simple .

		The idea that astronomical considerations entered into the orientation of the Egyptian Temples is by no means new , and it had been treated in a scientific manner at an earlier date by Professor
Nissen	PERSON	-LRB- '' Reinisches Museum fur Philologie '' 1885 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Lockyer	PERSON	, however , deserves credit for presenting in a popu - lar form the results of scientific research , and for personally inspecting the temples and securing rough measures of their orientation , in some cases where such data were wanting .

		It is unfortunate that the book is somewhat permeated by small incidental errors , which would of themselves prevent the work from taking high rank as a scientific contribution .

		For instance , on page 8 , the author says : ''
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, on the ground that the cube was the most perfect geometrical figure , imagined the earth to be a cube , the part of the earth known to the Greeks being on the upper surface . ''

		It has long been recognized by all critical scholars that Plato fully understood that the figure of the earth was spherical -LRB-
Zeller	ORGANIZATION	's Grundriss der Geschichte der
Griechischen Phil	PERSON	- osophie , page 131 -RRB- ; the same was known to Par - menides and many other philosophers who preceded Plato .

		Mr.
Lockyer	PERSON	's work does not treat of the beginning of the Greek Astronomy ; and since this is the real source of Astronomy proper , which de - pends upon exact observation and measurement , many will think that the title of the work should have been less comprehensive .

		It is well recognized by such authorities as Professor
Zeller	PERSON	that Greek philosophy originated in
Greece	LOCATION	, and was not im - ported from the
East	LOCATION	, as the early and obscure tra - ditions declared .

		In like manner , contrary to gen - eral opinion , it has been shown by Whewell and others that Astronomy proper did not arise from the Astrology of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	; Astronomy originated with the Greeks , at
Athens	LOCATION	and
Alex	PERSON	- andria , whence it was spread throughout the Roman Empire .

		We conclude , therefore , that whilst Mr.
Lockyer	PERSON	's work is not critical or exact , it deals with 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, an interesting topic which is deserving of study and investigation , and the general reader will find in it a fairly complete presentation of the results of the studies of Egyptologists .

		by Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	, is sure of its welcome .

		Mr.
Davis	PERSON	is an entertaining writer , clever , off-hand , pungent , not profound cer - tainly , yet not exactly superficial .

		No good ob - server is superficial ; and Mr.
Davis	PERSON	is , after the rapid journalistic fashion , a very good one .

		If asked to define Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's special genre , we might say that he is , in current parlance , an eminently `` up to date '' writer in phrase , tone , and equip - ment .

		Certainly the trait goes far to explain his vogue with the younger generation , whose literary dulce decus he now seems to be .

		They have de - cided unanimously , if not elegantly , in their figur - ative way , that Mr.
Davis	PERSON	is '' no back number '' ; which is high praise .

		He is master of their shib - boleths , knows their ways , understands their ideals , and embodies them -LRB- say in `` Van Bibber '' -RRB- to an iota ; therefore they rejoice in him , and read him .

		They might do worse .

		In the present volume Mr.
Davis	PERSON	presents the literary results of his recent jaunt to
England	LOCATION	, and it must be admitted he hits off
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	remarkably well .

		He writes of En - glish Race Meetings and
General Elections	ORGANIZATION	; of the
Oxford Undergraduate	ORGANIZATION	, the
London Season	LOCATION	, and the West and the East Ends of
London	LOCATION	; and his sketches are brimful of incident , local color , and character .

		Especially good are the reproductions of dialect .

		Here is a sample of oratorical '' chaff '' from two rival clothes-dealers in '' Petticoat Lane '' : '' Go on , '' one of the men will cry from the back of his cart '' go on an ' buy ` is rotten clothes .

		0 ' course he sells 'em cheap .

		` Cos why !

		` Cos he never pays his pore workin ' people their waiges .

		He 's a bloomin ' sweater , ' e is ; ' e never gives nothink to his workers but promises and kicks ; that 's all ` Ammerstein gives .

		Yes , you do ; you know you do .

		And wot ` appens , why , ` is clothes is all infected with cholera , and falls to pieces in the sun and shrinks up in the rain .

		They aint fit for nothink but to bury folks in , ` cos if yer moves in 'em they falls to pieces and leaves yer naked .

		I do n't call no names , but I will say ` Ammerstein is a thief , ' e is , and a liar , and ` is clothes is moth-eaten cholera blankets , robbed from ` ospitals and made over . ''

		To which the accused '' ` Ammerstein '' -LRB- on the next cart -RRB- , cheerfully replies : `` You musd egs - cuse dot jail-birt on the nexd cart .

		He vas a clerk of mine , but he stole oud of der till , und I dis - charged him , und he feels bat aboud id . ''

		In the capital paper describing a
General Election	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Davis	PERSON	says , apropos of the part taken by women in the canvass : '' I have seen women of the best class struck by stones and eggs and dead fish , and the game did not seem to me to be worth the candle .

		I confess that at the time I was so intent in admir - ing their pluck that it appeared to me rather fine than otherwise , but from this calmer distance I can see nothing in the active work of the English wo - man in politics which justifies the risks she volun - tarily runs of insult and indignity and bodily injury .

		A seat in the
House	ORGANIZATION	would hardly repay a candidate for the loss of one of his wife 's eyes , or of all of his sister 's front teeth , and though that is putting it brutally , it is putting it fairly . ''

		Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's book is a long way the brightest and freshest one of its kind that we have seen of late , and it is capitally illustrated .

		Until the appearance of Mr.
Fal	PERSON	- con .

		er
Madan	PERSON	' s '' Books in Manu - script '' -LRB- imported by
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons -RRB- , we had nothing on the subject , in handy - volume form , that served as adequate guide to the amateur .

		As Lecturer in Mediaeval Palaeography in the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and Bibliographer to the
Bodleian Library	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Madan	PERSON	has placed his rich store of knowledge at the service of those who wish to study the subject , and in the appendices to his book he has given us an ample bibliography compiled with great care and discretion .

		A list of Public Libraries that contain more than four thou - sand manuscripts each ; another of Printed Cata - logues of Manuscripts in European languages in the British Museum , the Bodleian Library at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, the
Cambridge University Library	ORGANIZATION	; and still an - other list of books useful for the study of manu - scripts , enable us in a moment to find reference to the most minute and out-of-the-way information bearing on the subject .

		The printed book has so completely supplanted the work of the scribe that it is hard for us in the new world to realize what a wealth of manuscript material still rests in the de - positories of the eastern hemisphere .

		With the thousands upon thousands of printed books in American libraries , we are somewhat startled , on referring to Mr.
Madan	PERSON	's work , to find we have no place in his list of Public Libraries containing more than four thousand manuscripts each .

		That there are manuscripts in the
Lenox	LOCATION	and Astor Li - braries of
New York	LOCATION	, and in our own
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	, as well as in our private libraries , goes without saying ; but our poverty would be appar - ent on comparison with the
British Museum	ORGANIZATION	and its 52,000 manuscripts , the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Paris	LOCATION	and its 80,000 , or the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	and its 25,600 .

		The manuscript treasures housed in the great in - stitutions of learning in the British Isles constitute one of the richest legacies left to an ungrateful pos - terity .

		A single instance of the wonderful human interest possessed by some of these relics of art and letters , described by Mr.
Madan	PERSON	, is the '' Book of Kells , '' the chief treasure of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	, Dub - lin .

		The book takes its name from the
Monastery of Kells	ORGANIZATION	, founded by
St. Columba	ORGANIZATION	, and was written apparently in the seventh century .

Sidney Smith	PERSON	at once knew the '' mean - ing of the word grotesque . ''

		He tells us that Lady Cork was so moved by his sermon on the subject of charity that she begged a guinea of him for her contribution , and then spent the money on herself .

		Carlyle found Lamb 's fun a '' strain of the affec - tions , '' but this verdict will hardly be assented to by readers of these volumes .

		The publishers have done well in putting them into portable form ; either of them may be recommended for one 's vest-pocket to be taken as medicinal pellets , '' as often as needed . ''

		Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	's '' Studies of the Stage '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , though a book small as to size , is not small or insignificant as to contents , since it deals with some of the most interesting subjects now under discus - sion in relation to dramatic art .

		Professor Mat - thews announces in a prefatory note that he is '' quite willing to have this little volume considered as an argument in favor of the contention that dra - matic literature must approve itself as drama first , before it need be discussed as literature . ''

		The first of the ten essays composing the volume considers the subject of '' The Dramatization of Novels , '' and shows the reasons why a good novel frequently fails to make a good play ; in fact , how the difficulty in dramatizing it is increased in proportion to its del - icacy and delightf ulness in workmanship , its subtlety in psychology , and its fineness of treatment .

		The dramatist works under much greater limitations than the novelist .

		He is restricted as to subject , since he is obliged to choose such an one as will in - terest the broad public ; as to treatment , since he Studies and essays on dramatic art .

		must adopt that which the broad public will accept ; as to dimensions , since his work must be bulky enough to last * from half-past eight to half - past ten at the shortest , or from eight to eleven at the long - est ; as to characters , since there must be so many that no one shall seem unduly obtrusive , and , al - though sharply contrasted , most of them must be sympathetic with the spectators ; and , above all , he is restricted as to external aids , since neither de - scription nor comment nor analysis is available to him for showing the progressive and well-nigh im - perceptible disintegration of character under the influence of its environment or circumstance .

		But the drama , notwithstanding these metes and bounds in fact , because of them has always had a fas - cination for the literary artist ; it is really the no - blest form of literature , because the most direct .

		Other important subjects discussed by Professor
Matthews	PERSON	are : '' The Dramatic Outlook in Amer - ica , '' which is regarded as highly favorable ; '' The Old Comedies '' - which seem less wonderful than they are commonly considered , when we note that only about twenty-five survive to-day , out of a list of five thousand written during the century and a half preceding our own generation ; and two de - lightful bits of comment and analysis of the two French theatrical critics ,
M. Francisque Sarcey	PERSON	and
M. Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	.

		Venetian painters and paintings .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons have made an exceedingly pretty volume o f Mr
Bernhard Berenson	PERSON	's essay on `` The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance . ''

		Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's essay owes its origin to his belief that Venetian painting is the most complete expres - sion in art of the Italian Renaissance ; and in order to keep his main idea clearly before the mind of the reader he has written as succinctly as possible , pruning away all matter not strictly relevant to his thesis .

		The main points once grasped and con - nected with the more important painters , the reader will find little difficulty in seeing the proper place of any given work by a great master , or the relative importance of second-rate and third-rate painters of whom no special mention has been made .

		Apart from its purely critical value , the work makes a useful handbook to Venetian painting to which end lists are appended of the chief works , in and out of
Italy	LOCATION	, of the Venetian school .

		There is an especially attractive frontispiece after
Giorgione	PERSON	's '' Shepherd '' at

		The first of them , entitled '' Romance of the Insect World '' -LRB-

		In half a dozen pleas - antly-written chapters the author treats of the food , the homes , and the metamorphoses of insects , and of the various cases of protective mimicry that so puz - zled the observer until

		They are all here , the name - able and the unnameable species , and their ways and propensities are minutely described .

		But amateur naturalists will find it both instructive and entertaining .

John Bell	ORGANIZATION	and
Jedidiah Morse	PERSON	-RRB- having been freely used by
Condie	ORGANIZATION	.

		They range from
1760	DATE	to
1795	DATE	, the first being from a letter written to a friend in
Europe	LOCATION	by Captain
George Mercer	PERSON	, descriptive of
Washington	LOCATION	's per - sonal appearance at twenty-eight .

		Among the sketches are some from Tory pens ; and it is inter - esting , for example , to read in one of them that

		An altogether capital sheaf of war stories , each by one specially quali - ified to tell it , is the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Famous Adventures and Prison Escapes of the Civil War . ''

Century Magazine	ORGANIZATION	.

		Notably graphic and stirring are the accounts of '' The Locomotive Chase in

		The last named paper , by
Frank E. Moran	PERSON	, gives , we believe , the only accu - rate and circumstantial account yet published of this most ingenious and daring escape an adven - ture before which the half-mythical feats of

		The '' Athenaeum Press '' series , published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' is intended to furnish a library of the best English literature from Chaucer to the present time , in a form adapted to the needs of both the stu - dent and the general reader . ''

		This is perhaps a trifle misleading as an account of a series of books which , if we may judge from the one now before us , would be better described as a series of critically edited texts se - lected from the best English literature , and mainly use - ful for college study .

		The volume just issued is a '' Se - lection from the Essays of

		THE DIAL 251
NEW YORK	LOCATION	TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
April 10 , 1894	DATE	.

		Readers of '' Scribner 's Magazine '' will remember a notable article in one of the earlier numbers , in
1887	DATE	, I think , on '' The Ethics of Democracy , '' written by Mr.
Frederic Jesup Stimson	PERSON	, who is a lawyer and a writer of law books as well as of novels .

		In the course of his studies it had devolved upon him to examine and com - pare all the statute books of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This examination and comparison bad called his attention to certain socialistic tendencies in our legislation , and led him to the conclusion that '' measures of universal social - ism , although in no case yet enacted , appear to be on the verge of a trial '' ; also , to '' the perhaps unforeseen result , that democracy , when crowned with power , seeks rather what it considers the well-being of the community than the liberty of the individual . ''

		This article of Mr.
Stirn	PERSON	- son 's created a good deal of discussion at the time .

		It was quoted in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, and it brought the author a complimentary letter from Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	, who was then just completing his '' American Commonwealth . ''

		The enormous success of Mr.
Ed	PERSON	- ward
Bellamy	PERSON	's '' Looking Backward '' in the following year would seem , in a certain way , to have confirmed Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	's discovery .

		Without expressing any opinion as to the merits or demerits of universal socialism , it is interesting to state that Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	will have in the
May	DATE	'' Scribner 's '' another equally pertinent article on the same subject .

		He has examined and tabulated all the laws passed by all the States and Territories during the years
1889	DATE	and
1890	DATE	with reference to their socialistic character .

		Leav - ing out all private laws , regulative acts , etc. , which in - volve no principle of social science , he has examined some twelve hundred laws , and of these he finds that almost thirty per cent are distinctly socialistic in char - acter .

		The percentage varies , according to the section , from twenty per cent in the
New England States	LOCATION	to over forty per cent in the
North and Northwestern States	LOCATION	.

		In the light of these facts , Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	asks , Are we still in possession of our liberty ? ''

		Yes , '' he writes , '' we are still free .

		But no candid mind can rise from the perusal of these twelve hundred laws which a single period of two years brings upon us with - out the desire to call attention , if not to warn . ''

		Grant - ing Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	's premises , his article is extremely in - teresting . ''

		Chronological Outlines of American Literature , '' by Mr.
Selden L. Whitcomb	PERSON	, which
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will bring out late in the
Spring	DATE	, is , I am told , the first really scientific work of the kind yet published .

		It is , of course , uniform with
Ryland	ORGANIZATION	's '' Chronological Outlines of English Literature , '' and it contains tables of comparison with English and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literature as well as with historical events .

		Mr.
Whitcomb	PERSON	is a fellow in literature at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, and Prof.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	of that institution has written an in - troduction for the volume .

		Professor
Mattbews	PERSON	's own book , '' Vignettes of
Manhattan	LOCATION	, '' will be published later in the season , from the press of the Harpers .

		Some of these '' Vignettes '' appear first in the magazine , but there are twelve of them in all , the aim being to pre - sent a picture of
New York	LOCATION	for each month in the year .

		Mr.
Luther J. B. Lincoln	PERSON	's '' Uncut Leaves '' readings end the season with next
Saturday	DATE	's meeting , when Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	will give her first reading in
New York	LOCATION	, and other writers will take part .

		This has been the most successful year of '' Uncut Leaves '' yet , and what at first seemed a slightly unpractical plan has turned out to be eminently practical and the means of bringing together under pleasant circumstances a large number of highly cultured people .

		A few friends of the English poet and novelist Mr.
William Sharp	PERSON	have received from him copies of his last book , `` Vistas . ''

		It is composed of a series of dra - matic sketches , in which the descriptive text occupies as much space as the dialogue . ''

		Vistas '' is the second volume of the '' Regent Library , '' a series of books of romance by various authors , which deal with human emotions and passions in an unconventional spirit .

		Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	in his dedication speaks of '' Vistas '' as '' ce livre d'ame et de reve , '' and this description is wonderfully accurate .

		The succeeding volume of the '' Regent Li - brary '' will be Pharais '' by
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, the scene of which romance is laid among the lonely islands which lie between the Hebrides and
Argyll	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems that a '' Celtic Renaissance '' is now in progress in
England	LOCATION	, and this book is a manifestation of the Scottish side of the movement , the Welsh side of which is represented by the experiments of Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	in Kymric pros - ody , already mentioned in this correspondence .

		The
Cymmrodorion Society	ORGANIZATION	has , I learn , just reprinted Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	's paper on ''
Welsh Bards	PERSON	and English Reviewers , '' which created some discussion on its original delivery , and in which there is a prediction of the brilliant ca - reer open to Celtic literature under modern conditions .

		A long-time literary friend of
Constance Woolson	PERSON	has asked a lady now visiting in
Rome	LOCATION	to place a wreath for him on Miss
Woolson	PERSON	's grave in the Protestant cem - etery .

		The letter he received in reply is so interesting that I have obtained permission to quote a few lines from it : `` The cypress-sentineled garden , with the filtered golden light caught up by the new green of the budding willows be - neath , the heavy velvet fall of violets flung everywhere , can never be more beautiful than it was this afternoon .

		The flowers here are as plentiful as dust anywhere else , and our man caught our idea and made a lovely thing , all violets , white azaleas and camellias , with an outer fringe of fern and white hyacinth ... Her grave is purple with the violets that flood everything they flow up like waves over each new wreckage ... I send you two from
Shelley	LOCATION	's grave under the shadow of the crumbling wall two from your friend 's , and the box leaves from
Keats	PERSON	' , most touching of all with its piteous epitaph , but very beautiful , almost joyous , in the royal Italian sunshine .

		Over the ripe old wall , and all along the foot of the Aventine Hill , the almond and cherry trees are in bloom , and still the west wind ' sends sweet buds like flocks to feed in air . ' ''

		This manuscript is one of the treasures of the

		The following quatrain is from ''

		3 30 Ditto being sentimental , and not exceeding six lines .550 Ditto being humorous 7 17 6 Ditto being complimentary 10 10 N.B. All warranted original . '

		OUTLOOK IN THE PUBLISHING TRADE .

		The following interesting remarks on '' The Spring Outlook '' are quoted from a recent editorial in the '' Publisher 's Weekly '' : '' The book trade through all the panic has suffered less than almost any other branch of trade from which we have had reports .

		Publishing activity during the past six months , or , more strictly speaking , up to within two months , has been without abatement ; if anything , it has been a trifle more than normal .

		Since the begin - ning of
February	DATE	there has been a tendency to put on the brakes , which can but be considered a healthy sign . ''

		We think there has been decidedly too much un - healthy activity in the publishing world here as well as abroad .

		A few weeks ago we gave a glimpse of the conditions of the book trade and literature in
France	LOCATION	.

		They are not much better in
England	LOCATION	, nor anywhere else , excepting possibly in
Germany	LOCATION	, where a rigid trade organization , and more conservative and scientific pub - lishing methods generally tend to preserve the equilib - rium . ''

		The tendency of modern publishing , as in other trades , has been towards over-production , without re - gard to the capacity for consumption .

		This has brought about a congestion that has entailed unnumbered hard - ships upon the bookseller , has rendered the public apa - thetic , and is beginning to react on the publisher .

		So , for instance , during the past season the publishers have had no trouble in disposing of the new books the fads of the hour while their best books of previous seasons rested idly in their bins .

		There is no overlook - ing the fact that books require leisure to read , and that the publisher who markets a few books well will in the end fare better than the one who indifferently tumbles many into the market . ''

		... 281 CAN A DIAN LITERA TURE .

		Our esteemed contemporary over the north - ern border , '' The Week '' of
Toronto	LOCATION	, has re - cently been publishing a series of letters from Canadian writers of more or less repute , upon the subject of the Canadian literature which they unite in thinking ought to result from the literary activity of the younger generation , but which they regretfully admit to have given as yet hardly any signs of existence .

		The term litera - ture has many meanings , but we are now using it -LRB- as these anxious inquirers seem to use it -RRB- for the purpose of designating such writings as produce a distinct impression upon the mass of the people in whose language it is written .

		In this sense , no production of merely local interest or appeal may be called literature , how - ever vehemently its friends may put forward a claim to the title .

		In this sense , the
United States	LOCATION	has not yet produced any great quantity of literature , while
Canada	LOCATION	and
Australia	LOCATION	have produced , we may almost say , none at all .

		En - gland can still claim most of the writers whose audience is coextensive with the English-speak - ing world ; there are a few names from our own country , such as those of
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	, upon the list ; the other English - peopled lands remain unrepresented .

		The test that we have suggested is doubtless a severe one , and there is no other language whose literature must , as a condition of success , answer to the wants of so many communities geographically so far apart .

		On the other hand , there is no language comparable with our own in the compensations which it offers to the suc - cessful man of letters .

		He who gains the ear of the English-speaking world commands an audience so vast that the imagination does not easily grasp it , and his reward , whether in profit or in fame , is proportional to the numbers of those whom he addresses .

		It is vain to deny the unifying effect of a language upon the com - munities that share its use ; however alien the race - elements concerned , a common bond of speech must make them one in sympathy and in ideals .

		Looked at from this point of view , the ques - tion of Canadian literature is very simple .

		There are not many Canadians altogether -LRB- for 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the French are not to be included in this cal - culation -RRB- , and it is only within a very few years that the conditions have been found under which the very existence of literature is possible .

		When the '' epic passion '' of a people has to vent itself in the felling of forests and the building of cities , there is little chance to cul - tivate the rather exotic flower of literature , and poets are likely to be of the inarticulate sort so dear to Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	.

		Other reasons for the non-existence of a Canadian literature are fur - nished by the contributors to `` The Week . ''

		One of these reasons is found in the fact that there is no recognized intellectual centre for English
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Toronto comes nearer than any other city to being such a centre , but To - ronto is still so provincial , we are told , that it seems to have a prejudice against books pro- duced outside of
Ontario	LOCATION	.

		Another reason is the absorption of Canadian literary talent by the publishers and magazine editors of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Still another reason is the ten - dency of Canadian writers to produce hasty and slovenly work .

		This is brought forward by Dr.
Bourinot	PERSON	, who certainly speaks with authority .

		But no reasons are really needed to explain so natural a fact as that of a small and struggling community , as yet hardly in - fused with national feelings , having produced no distinctive literature of its own .

		Of course we do not ignore the fact that many Canadian writers have done excellent work in prose and verse .

		Haliburton and De
Mille	LOCATION	, for example , among those who have passed away , Professor
Roberts	PERSON	and Mr.
Car	PERSON	- man , for example , among the younger men , are widely known , as widely in this country as in their own .

		And
Canada	LOCATION	has at least half own - ership in that great scholar and profound polit - ical thinker , Professor
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	.

		But these excellent writers , and a dozen more whose names at once occur to any well-informed per - son , are not enough to make a literature , at best they add but a slender rill tributary to the broad stream of English letters .

		One thing is quite certain : Talking about a national literature and the desirability of hav - ing one will not do anything to stimulate its emergence .

		Literature is almost never the pro- duct of self-consciousness ; self-conscious pe - riods in the life of a nation may precede or fol - low periods of productivity , but the two are not likely to coincide .

		Some day , when our Canadian friends have ceased to scan the hori - zon for the coming literature , and have turned to thinking about other things , they may make the happy discovery that a literature has been growing up unnoticed in their midst .

		But we do not expect it for some time , and we are sure that it will not come with observation .

		There is a good deal in this discussion of '' The Week '' to remind us of discussions not unfamiliar in our own country .

		With us the question is somewhat more complicated , for we have not only loud outcries for an American literature , but still louder and more blatant demands for a Western , or a Southern , or a
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, or a
Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	literature .

		Reduced to this absurdity , the contention be - comes merely amusing , and is made none the less so by the efforts of our too-zealous section - alists to decry the work done in older and more cultivated intellectual centres , and to exalt , by all the devices of the clique for mutual admir - ation , every petty local performance .

		We are not even sure that the demand for a distinct - ively national literature of our own is a justi - fiable one , and we may certainly be permitted to doubt the wisdom of a similar demand for a Canadian literature .

		One of the '' Week '' corre - spondents speaks of certain causes which '' tend to intensify the general movement towards literary centralization throughout the English - speaking world , and to choke the independent literary life of the smaller communities . ''

		In - stead of deprecating this tendency , as the writer seems to do , we are inclined to think it a fortunate one .

		The best literary life for the small community is likely to be a life fed from the best sources of inspiration , and drawing its nourishment from the common stock of English literary achievement .

		It seems to us that no other than a stunted literary life would be pos - sible for a community that should seek a strictly independent development .

		The great tradition of expression , as embodied in the five centuries of our literary production since Chaucer first fashioned English speech for the purposes of art , is too splendid a heritage to be disdained or lightly cast aside .

		There is but one English literature at present , and we hope that there will never be more than one .

		Of the many things that make for unity among all English - speaking people , literature is the most import - ant , and experience affords no warrant for the apprehension that unity may ever generate into mere uniformity . ''

Goethe	PERSON	.

		ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
ILLINOIS	LOCATION	.

		* The courses in English at the
Illinois State Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity being at present confined to the undergrad - uate classes , an account of the work must differ ma - terially from one dealing with the full university curriculum .

		The aim of such a course is , or should be , the development of general culture rather than the preparation for later scientific research .

		It aims to be , as far as possible , complete in itself .

		Keeping this end in view , we devote the whole of the first year to a general survey of English and American literature , dwelling particularly on the great names and the significant periods .

		From this as a centre all the subsequent courses are made to radiate .

		Those students , furthermore , who wish to devote only a single year to the subject are thus given a bird 's - eye view , which , while necessarily in - complete and superficial , is the best substitute for an extended course .

		In connection with this sub - ject , as with all others , much outside reading is re - quired .

		In the three succeeding years the time is divided as equally as possible between two subjects , so that the students may have variety without distraction .

		In the junior and senior years the line is drawn between language and literature , and anyone so de - siring may elect only one of these .

		As might be expected , the preference in the large majority of cases is given to the latter subject .

		This compara - tive unpopularity of language-study suggests the advisability of providing a special course of one or two terms in elementary Old English -LRB-
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	-RRB- grammar and prose for literary students .

		This is the more desirable as the earliest period of our literature can not satisfactorily be included in the general survey , and yet some knowledge of it is essential to a comprehensive knowledge of our lit - erary development .

		It is also a serious question whether Chaucer should be studied in the language course , as at present .

		But in any case , stress should be laid , in an ordinary college course such as ours , * This article is the seventh of an extended series on the Teaching of English at

		upon his artistic and ethical qualities , rather than upon the language in which these find expression .

		But of far greater importance is the question of how to approach Shakespeare .

		It is bad enough to confine ourselves to the grammatical forms of Chau - cer ; it is little far from criminal to do so with our mighty dramatist .

		Not that the grammatical and linguistic side shall be ignored ; it must , however , be reduced to a minimum , as a means to a greater end .


Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	to the contrary , Shake - speare requires much annotation of various kinds , in order that the study may yield its full return .

		Our Shakespeare class devotes two hours a week throughout the year to the detailed investigation of four plays a comedy , an historical play , a tragedy , and one of the so-called romances .

		One hour a week during the first term is devoted to the pre-Shake - spearian drama , and the same time during the last two terms to the reading of eight or ten of Shake - speare 's plays in the order of
Furnivall	ORGANIZATION	's chronolog - ical table , bearing chiefly in mind the development of the author 's genius .

		In these '' Hamlet '' is in - variably included .

		Free discussion by the members of the class is heartily encouraged .

		Special stress is laid upon the different conceptions of characters and situations by leading actors , and upon the stage requirements of the plays , the student being never allowed to forget that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	wrote primarily for the stage and not for the closet .

		Textual crit - icism is treated even more sparingly than grammat - ical study , its proper place being in the advanced courses .

		The results of this method of Shake - speare study have been very encouraging , many of the pupils seeming to develop from it a real love for the subject , which it is to be hoped may be car - ried still further outside of the college walls .

		The other courses offered are the prose of the nineteenth century , the poetry of the nineteenth century , special stress being laid in the former on the novel , in the latter on ``
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	, eighteenth century literature , the lit - erary study of history , and Old and Early English , including Chaucer .

		There is also a special course of one year for scientific and engineering students , consisting of a general survey of the literature , En - glish grammar , and the critical study of scientific prose .

		In addition to the instruction in language and lit - erature , which is elective , a certain amount of work is required in rhetoric and theme-writing of all mem - bers of the university , the object of which is the practical one of endeavoring to give training in the use of English .

		Much freedom is left to the stu - dents in the choice of subjects , and satisfactory ar - ticles in the college paper and the various college societies are accepted as equivalents for the regu - lar class themes .

		This latter plan has yielded ad - mirable results this year , the first of its trial .

		It may be added that while , as has been stated , no attempt has yet been made to offer systematic instruction in English for graduates , provision is 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, made for all those desiring to pursue higher studies in this subject .

		The time is not far distant , it is hoped , when this deficiency will be remedied .

		INTERPRETATIONS OF IBSEN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the recent review of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's '' Brand '' in THE DIAL there are two statements that to my mind do not quite do justice to the work , nor to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		It is not always possible for foreigners , even if they are fa - miliar with a language , to appreciate its nature thor - oughly ; and thus it may be permitted me to express a different opinion concerning some things stated in the review .

		For example , at the beginning , where the dis - tinction is made between authors of poetic form and those of poetic thought ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is classed with the lat - ter , and somewhat categorically denied beauty of form .

		Now , to all Norwegians , nay , to all Scandinavians , with - out exception ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is the master of form par excel - lence ; none of our poets being , as is he , the absolute ar - tist that bends and shapes the language into perfect rhyme and perfect rhythm alike .

		Surely he is no Ten - nyson ; he carries the sword rather than the wreath of roses ; but his weapon is as finely - wrought and well - tempered a blade as any masterpiece of
Damascus	LOCATION	.

		The question of his superiority of form may safely be left with his people , who have long deemed him beyond criticism on that point .

		The English-speaking nations naturally have a standard of form of their own , but it would be rather unfair to apply this to other languages .

		Besides , the miserable translations in which
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's works have suffered in almost every foreign tongue have done their utmost to obscure the excellence of his style .

		Those that understand his ''
Terje Viken	PERSON	'' and his '' Comedy of Love '' know better what to think .

		The Norwegian tongue , with its stock of good dialect words , is capable , we are proud to say , of expressing whatever an artist may choose to confide to it ; and
Ib	ORGANIZATION	- sen has been able not only to use it with virtuosity , but also to increase even further its capacity of expression .

		But as the tongue is spoken by only two millions of people , students of European literature , naturally , do not generally take the trouble to learn it ; but in order to gain some acquaintance with the leading ideas in works that have caused such stir as have
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's , they turn to translations that are often translated from other translations , both alike being misrepresenting and poor .

		Another remark concerning the idea and bearing of '' Brand . ''

		The author justifies his hero less , perhaps , than the reader is apt to think .

		Ibsen is anything but dogmatic ; his satire is entirely too keen and clear - sighted for that , or , as the translator so well puts it , '' His most definite and dominant thoughts come to the surface laden with that tangle of counter-thought which gathers about every peremptory conclusion in the depths of a critical mind . ''

		We wish the reader could always keep these lines in mind .

		Humanity has no heroes to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, unless it be his women ; but there he is probably influenced from other sources .

		The figures are never seen with a naive , admiring glance , but rather with a searching eye , in order to bring out their whole charac - ter , to give us the sense about them , if you will .

		Neither does the poet so absolutely `` stand for individualism first and last , '' as the reviewer seems to think ; that sounds a little too much like celebration of egotism , and to this
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is vehemently opposed .

		His demand is much more strictly ideal .

		He asks for the true man as '' God saw him in his mind on the day of creation , '' the man with character and yet humble , the man that knows his will and is still obedient , the man that has learned and broadened his spirit and grown in mind and body .

		Herein is his point of contact with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		That he does not remain in this serene tranquillity and men - tal elevation that characterizes the teaching of Goethe , but wages incessant warfare , is due to the critical fault - finding and active idealism of his spirit .

		In this , per - haps , is found the reason of his chief distance from the great Olympian father and the source of his own abund - ant originality : that where Goethe is always synthetic ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is the born revolutionary and analyst .

		But to return to '' Brand . ''

		The book itself dates from the period of the great pietistic movement in
Norway	LOCATION	, and is in the widest sense a poetical-philosophical summary of the interest for life of such a wave of strong religious feeling and fanaticism as that period witnessed .

		This great ques - tion certainly touched
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's searching mind more than any other man 's , far and wide .

		It is with the glaring light of his
Diogenes	PERSON	' lantern that he reveals the scene as it is stereotyped in '' Brand . ''

		If any moral sentence should be the motto of the book , it might be that of Goethe : '' Licht , mehr Licht I '' Broader views , better understanding !

		Ibsen is here questioning the right and value of the spiritual supremacy that some ardent na - tures claim -LRB- in religious matters -RRB- over their fellow - beings , and he shows the form such spiritual supremacy takes when the mind is powerfully agitated .

		Brand is the type of a leader , a prophet , a spiritual fire , as his name indicates , the reformer that will strike down and annihilate by the blaze of his wrath the dull and vicious vermin that poison the world and infect the pastoral herd , and will put up instead a new altar and establish a new devotion to God .

		He means to wake them up with his word as well as with his example .

		He is of unflinching belief in his right and his mission , a zealot with as narrow a view of Christianity as any of the fa - natics fostered in those valleys where the mountains crowd out the sky and the hardships of life seem to lie in wait for one 's very soul .

		As severe as is existence are the views of all those that strive for it .

		The word '' sin '' covers such a vast field of harmless enjoyment !

		The minds are shy and bitter , the deadening of the flesh is the highest achievement comprehended .

		The most innocent play incites severe reproof how can feeling or compassion , warmth of heart and spontaneity , but freeze and crystallize in such surroundings ?

		Brand is as erring in his converting frenzy as are those that beguile him and finally drive him out beyond the boundaries of his parish into the lonely wilderness , to perish in the cold and snow .

		This utter lack of re - sponsiveness , the absolute failure of his mission , strikes a harder death-blow than his exposure and his un - happiness .

		The doubt , the feeling of inability to un - derstand more than one side of the reforming work , gnaws on his conscience ; he feels overcome , and in the anguish of death the cry goes up to heaven whether after all , he has not been mistaken , whether the un - swerving energy of his man 's will shall not be the fea - ture that redeems him ; and he receives as an answer that God is not the God of law but of love .

		Thus

		THE DIAL 263 Brand sinks perishing at the feet of the mercy he has not understood , and the snow-storm that has swept around him covers him up and extinguishes the last sparks of the fire that burned so fervently .

		To translate
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, we may safely say , is by no means an easy task .

		How many efforts have been made in earlier times to interpret other masters of thought and fiction such as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	without succeeding in making the authors at home in a foreign literature .

		If Professor Hereford in his ren - dering of Ibsen is able to introduce him at his best to the American world of readers , the admirers and friends of the great poet can not but be deeply beholden to the translator for his noble work .

		LOCAL USAGE IN AMERICAN SPEECH .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The systematic study of American speech and cus - toms is made difficult by the fact that no map has yet been made of the centres and currents of diversity of usage .

		In order that this may be done it is necessary that as many answers as possible be obtained to a num - ber of test questions .

		Such a list has been prepared from questions suggested by members of the
Modern Language Association of North America	ORGANIZATION	.

		I would call the attention of readers of THE DIAL to this list , and urge those that have interest in the matter to answer as many of the questions as they conveniently can , and for - ward the answers to me ; or hand the list to some one who has the time and inclination to do so .

May 1	DATE	, PASQTJIER 'S PICTURES OF NAPOLEONIC TIMES .

		* Chancellor
Pasquier	PERSON	's second volume , cover - ing the period -LRB- 1812-1814 -RRB- from the French advance on
Moscow	LOCATION	to the first Bourbon res - toration , serves on the whole to strengthen the favorable impression left by the first .

		As a picture of Napoleonic times it is of special value partly in that it is the account of a fresh witness and not a mere editorial pouring of old wine into new bottles , and partly because the witness himself is a rarely competent one .

		As prefect of police under the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	and the Empire , it was his official duty to keep himself informed on public matters and to care - fully sift and generalize his information .

		Po - lice business , too , at that time of civil unrest and shifting opinion , took on a color strongly polit - ical .

		Briefly , then , we are to regard Pasquier as a first-rate authority on the questions handled in this volume , and not as the mere quidnunc and retailer of the current political chit-chat of the period of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's waning fortunes .

		The narrative opens , as we have said , at the outset of the Kussian campaign .

		The early optimistic bulletins from the
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	did not , says
Pasquier	PERSON	, impose on those at
Paris	LOCATION	in a position and a temper to judge coolly of the Fabian policy of the Russian commanders .

		The continuous retrograde movement , from which many drew the brightest conclusions , was rightly viewed by others as the result of a system the primary object of which was to exhaust the French army by long marches through a country in which it had no base of supplies , and to draw it away from its stores and reinforcements .

		It was even feared and with reason , as the event proved that
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon himself would end in sharing the illusions he sought to disseminate .

		His situation was , even at the outset when he had most to hope , and irrespective of the inherent dangers of a Russian campaign , a serious one .

		The peace concluded between
Russia	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	had re - leased a Russian army corps and left it free to attack the French in the rear .

		It was known , moreover , that a meeting had taken place at Abo between the Emperor of
Russia	LOCATION	and the Prince Royal of
Sweden	LOCATION	, and that an under - * A HISTORY OF MY TIME : Memoirs of Chancellor Pas - quier .

		standing was reached allowing the Russian troops to leave their cantonments in
Finland	LOCATION	and march to the rescue of
Riga	LOCATION	; to this was to be added the diversion likely to be made in
Pomerania	LOCATION	by a Swedish army .

		Yet in the face of it all
Napoleon	PERSON	decided , after taking
Smolensk	LOCATION	, not to halt his sorely fatigued troops for rest , but to move on to
Moscow	LOCATION	!

		Had he halted for the winter on the
Diina	LOCATION	, he might , Pasquier thinks , have organized in his rear the old Polish provinces , and have thus placed him - self in a position either to dictate a peace or begin a decisive campaign in the
Spring	DATE	.

		The apparent infatuation of the Emperor was freely censured by his officials at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Said
M. Decres	PERSON	, the
Minister of Marine	ORGANIZATION	, after detailing the facts just noted : '' What everybody sees the Emperor does not see , or else he is mad enough to cast from him all that seems to run counter to his presumptuous hopes .

		In the mean - while
Marmont	ORGANIZATION	is being beaten in
Spain	LOCATION	, and , within six months , the result of his defeat may be the loss of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		... All this , moreover , has not and will not have any effect on him .

		He will imagine that he can find a way out of the difficulty , by making a further demand for conscripts ; the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	has just turned over one hundred and forty thousand of them to him , which makes four hundred and forty thousand for the year ; and do you think that a rope on which there is such a tension can endure for any length of time ?

		No , I tell you he is a lost man . ''

		Evidently the Napoleonic superstition , like the Napoleonic star , had already begun to wane .

		Meanwhile the Emperor pursued his fatal jour - ney .

		On
September 7	DATE	the battle of the Mos - kowa was fought , and a victory was won , which , however , at
Paris	LOCATION	, '' struck consternation into the hearts of the most steadfast of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's friends , and produced a sort of stupor in the public mind . ''

		The road to
Moscow	LOCATION	lay open ; but never , in twenty years of stubborn combats , had so many generals and officers of note been killed or wounded .

		The substantial fruits of victory , moreover , were lost through default .

		All are agreed that the battle of the Moskowa was wrongly engaged by the Emperor who was , however , it is fair to say , indisposed , and consequently obliged to act largely on the ad - vice of his generals .

		Moreover , after the day was won , argues Pasquier , by refusing to send his guard into action , he failed to complete the rout of the Russians and allowed them to or - ganize their retreat and to re-form their lines without hindrance .

		`` He therefore , through his own fault , reduced almost to nothing the result of this so eagerly sought for battle . ''

		The truth is that
Napoleon	PERSON	's situation , after crossing the
Niemen	PERSON	, was such that he had no
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 265 knowledge whatever of the disposal or numbers of the forces opposed to him .

		He had com - pletely lost his reckoning , or was , at least , feel - ing his way by the roughest of dead-reckoning .

		Perhaps , like
Wallenstein	PERSON	, he trusted to what he called his '' star '' an astronomical or as - trological figment whose baleful influence on the fortunes of
France	LOCATION	culminated in
1871	DATE	.

		The swarms of Cossacks did not permit him to extend his reconnoitring beyond a league or so , and as the peasantry fled at his approach all means of getting information were shut off .

		It is known that he was for two days after the battle of Moskowa unable to discover the road by which the Russian army was retreating .

		Is it not , then , asks Pasquier , '' Perfectly just to conclude that his enterprise , con - ceived with the greatest rashness , was no less madly ex - ecuted , without any settled plan of campaign , without any assured means of communication with the rein - forcements of which he daily stood in greater need ?

		Pursuing , as he was , an enemy whose strength was un - known to him , he was marching on
Moscow	LOCATION	without be - ing able to say what he would do when he reached there , seemingly under the impression that everything depended on his occupying that capital . ''

		While thus severely and justly criticising
Bonaparte	PERSON	's Russian venture ,
Pasquier	PERSON	does not fail to note his returning energy and resource - fulness amid the thickening disasters of the re - treat .

		He says : `` If , on the one hand , no other man but
Napoleon	PERSON	could have conceived and ventured on so mad an expe - dition , on the other he was the only man whom it could not crush .

		So magnetic was the power which he exer - cised over the men who perished while following him , that not the slightest sign of disobedience manifested itself , that not a murmur arose from the ranks of an army which was dying of cold and hunger .

		Such an ex - ample has never been set the world , and
Napoleon	PERSON	has never appeared greater than to those who saw him on the banks of the
Beresina	LOCATION	, walking along those unknown shores , stick in hand , absorbed in a study of the chances remaining to him of concealing from the enemy the crossing of the river by his army , giving his orders with undisturbed , unruffled coolness , and finally triumphing over a difficulty which would have seemed insurmount - able to any other man . ''

		Napoleon left
Moscow	LOCATION	in
October , 1812	DATE	, and reached
Paris	LOCATION	on the 18th of
December	DATE	, at mid - night .

		On the following
Sunday	DATE	, at his usual levee , says
Pasquier	PERSON	, '' he approached me most affably , and whispered to me so that I alone should hear his words : ' And so , JMonsieur le ' Prefet , you too have had your day of tribula - tion ; there is no lack of such in a man 's life ! '

		To explain this allusion of the Emperor 's , let us a retrace our steps a little .

		The discontent awakened at
Paris	LOCATION	by the later bulletins from the
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	naturally inspired the Gov - ernment 's enemies , of whatever political stripe , with the hope of overthrowing it ; and towards the end of
October	DATE	a most audacious scheme to that end came to the surface .

		We allude , of course , to the famous Malet conspiracy .

		As this episode falls peculiarly within
Pasquier	PERSON	's competency as a witness , and as he avers , more - over , that received accounts of it are more or less falsified , it may be worth while to devote some space to his version .

		The hero of the plot ,
General Malet	ORGANIZATION	, a rest - less spirit whose ardent -LRB- `` virulent '' is Pas - quier 's word -RRB- republicanism neither the woes of the Terror nor the glories of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	could shake , was at the time no longer a young man .

		He began his military career in the mousquetaires ; with the Revolution he became a zealous patriot ^ and he rejoined the army in
1792	DATE	; in
1799	DATE	he was a general de brigade .

		His services were dispensed with in the first days of the Empire , when he settled in
Paris	LOCATION	and at once began plotting against the man whom he regarded as the assassin of the lib - erties of
France	LOCATION	.

		Probably , at bottom ,
Malet	PERSON	was one of those chronic malcontents who nat - urally constitute the radicals of any given pol - ity or arrangement whatsoever provided only it exists .

		As with the newly-arrived Hibernian immigrant of the story , the phrase '' agin the government '' might at any time and under any conditions have precisely defined his political attitude .

		At any rate , about
1809	DATE	, the Gen - eral 's sinister activities landed him in the prison of
La Force	ORGANIZATION	, whence , in
1812	DATE	, he was trans - ferred , through the indulgence of
Fouche	PERSON	, who owed him a kindness , to a private hospital in the
Faubourg Saint-Antoine	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here he was only nominally a prisoner ; escape was easy , and there was no obstacle in the way of inter - course with the outer world .

		Naturally , he did not neglect his opportunities .

		On entering the hospital he found there several kindred spirits , MM .

		de Polignac ,
Berthier de Sauvigny	ORGANIZATION	,
M. de Puyvert	PERSON	, and the Abbe
Lafon	PERSON	the last of whom , only , it is important for us to note .

		As this coterie were held as participants in a royalist plot , it will be seen that the General and his fellow captives were by no means birds of a political feather , the bond between them being rather a common hatred than a common ideal .

		The tie , however , sufficed ; a comfort - able modus vivendi was established , and things went merrily forward .

		In
M. Lafon	PERSON	,
Malet	PERSON	found a zealous ally one , it is said , who , de - spite his cloth and his politics , did not scruple to diligently fan the flame of his friend 's repub - 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, lican ardor .

		About this time , as we have seen , events in
Eussia	LOCATION	were exciting the gravest alarm at
Paris	LOCATION	, and it naturally occured to Ma - let that the moment had come to strike .

		He persuaded himself that the downfall of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon might be compassed by a very slight action , and it was on the basis of this idea that he laid his plans .

		These were very simple : '' They consisted in taking advantage of the night to make an appearance at the gates of a couple of bar - racks , make announcement of the death of
Napoleon	PERSON	, read out an alleged senatus-consultum repealing the Im - perial Government , establishing a provisional govern - ment , and investing General
Malet	PERSON	with all the powers necessary to take command of the armed force , to re - quire and command it as he should see fit ; to thus get for his use a cohorte and one battalion of the regiment ; to lead and send detachments of these two bodies to such points as it was most important to occupy ; to em - ploy it in arresting public functionaries whose resist - ance was most to be feared ; this done , to publish and proclaim the spurious senatus-consultum throughout the city ; call to them the discontented men of whatever shade , of whatever party , and assemble at the
Hotel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	the most important among them ; form a pro- visional government with them , with the aid of which they fondly expected to conquer every kind of opposi - tion and win the obedience and assent of all
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Such were in their entirety the operations to be carried out by
General Malet	ORGANIZATION	and
M. Lafon	PERSON	after leaving the hospital at eight o'clock on the
night	TIME	of
October 23	DATE	.

		The scheme -LRB- '' an .

		act of madness , '' Pasquier calls it -RRB- had , of course , a hundred inherent difficulties ; and there was one very patent obstacle which alone should have given the conspirators pause .

		This was the presence , in the environs of
Paris	LOCATION	and within easy call , of some 5,000 troops of the Imperial Guard a corps devoted to the Em - peror , the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	, and the King of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Malet should have known , moreover , that the Guard was not subject to orders he proposed to have sent from staff headquarters .

		When the plot burst there remained in the hospital only
Malet	PERSON	,
Lafon	PERSON	, and de
Puyvert	LOCATION	, the last of whom took no part whatever in its execution .

		Its responsibility , therefore , falls entirely upon the General and the Abbe , the latter 's assertion that he had many correspond - ents and that extensive preparations had been made for a rising being formally disproved by our author .

		In a word , surprise , bewilderment , was to be the order of the day , the conspirators trusting that in the political chaos following the news of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's death , their own swift , concerted , and definite action would effect the ends they desired .

		They found no difficulty in leaving the hospital on the
evening	TIME	named , and proceeded at once to a room in the Rue Saint-Gilles , where they found two confederates awaiting them ,
Boutreux	LOCATION	, a young advocate of Angers , and
Rateau	PERSON	, corporal in the 1st bat - talion of the
Paris	LOCATION	garde , who brought the watchword .

		These two men , says
Pasquier	PERSON	, together with a Spanish priest who occupied the room where the meeting was held , '' are the only persons who are clearly known to have been entrusted in advance with the secret of the conspiracy . ''

		The business of drawing up the spurious documents was at once begun .

		These were the senatus-consultum , the procla - mation , an order of the day signed by
Malet	PERSON	, and two letters of instruction as to the distri - bution and duties of the troops , the one ad - dressed to
M. Soulier	PERSON	, commanding the 10th cohorte , the other to
M. Rouff	PERSON	, commanding the 2d battalion of the garde de
Paris	LOCATION	.

		These papers were not only faulty in point of form , but they provided for a regime which was , to say the least , extraordinary .

		The senatus-con - sultum , on the one hand , named as members of the provisional government men known for their royalist and anti - revolutionary senti - ments ; while the order of the day handed over the army to Generals Guidal ,
Desnoyers	PERSON	, and Pailhardy , all pronounced revolutionaries , and it appointed to the command of a central
Paris	LOCATION	- ian force General Lecourbe , a violent Jacobin , and a personal enemy of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		Plainly , the astute Abbe was the author of the senatus - consultum , and General
Malet	PERSON	of the order of the day .

		The greater part of the night was spent over these sufficiently clumsy writings , and it was half - past three when
Malet	PERSON	, with
Rateau	PERSON	, reached the Popincourt barracks , the quarters of the 10th cohorte .

		Soulier , the com - mander , was ill with fever . ''

		The announcement of the Emperor 's death , super - added to his sickness , upset his faculty of reasoning ; he believed without hesitation and without verification all that was told him , and gave orders that the senatus - consultum and the proclamation should be read to the troops , which he then placed at the general 's disposal . ''

		A like success awaiting Malet at the Min - imes barracks , he presently had at his disposal about
1200	DATE	soldiers .

		To direct and handle these soldiers resolute and experienced men were required , and our hero at once set about getting them , with an energy and a fertility of resource worthy of the great Emperor himself .

		In the prison of
La Force	ORGANIZATION	were two political captives , Generals Lahorie and Guidal , who , once at liberty , could undoubtedly be relied upon for cooperation ; and Malet at once re - solved to secure them . ''

		In their case , also , he made use of the senatus-con -

		THE DIAL 267 sultum , and he confirmed to them the news of the Em - peror 's death , successful in this as in his previous un - dertakings .

		... It was half-past six o'clock when he made his appearance at
La Force	ORGANIZATION	, followed by a section of the cohorte the remainder had gone to occupy the
Hotel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	.

		The doorkeeper of the jail , seeing a body of soldiers , in good order , and commanded by a general in uniform , had no doubt that he was acting lawfully , and hastened to obey him . ''

		Lahorie and Guidal were accordingly at once released , and the former received orders to pro- ceed , with a squad of soldiers , to the Prefec - ture de Police , and to arrest the prefect -LRB- M. Pasquier -RRB- , installing in his place
Boutreux	PERSON	, who accompanied him .

		This disposed of , he was to arrest the
Due de Rovigo	ORGANIZATION	, the Minister of War , and himself assume his functions .

		As to
Malet	PERSON	, he took with him 150 men , and proceeded to the military headquarters in the Place Ven - dome , whither we shall follow him presently .

		It was past seven o'clock when Lahorie reached the
Prefecture de Police	ORGANIZATION	.

		Says Pasquier : '' I had just arisen from my bed , when I heard con - siderable noise coming from the rooms leading to my bedroom .

		My valet left me to ascertain the cause of all this commotion .

		On finding himself in the presence of soldiery , he tried to stop its further progress , and barred the way to my door , displaying in so doing re - markable devotion ; he was thrust aside , and received a bayonet wound in the leg .

		I was attempting to reach the stairway leading to the garden , when I was assailed by a baud of soldiers , led by an officer , who forced me to return to my bedroom , while forbidding his men to lay violent hands on me .

		This officer , whom I did not recognize , wore a mantle ; his characteristic feature , his incipient baldness , was concealed by a large hat .

		It was
General Lahorie	ORGANIZATION	.

		He informed me of the death of the Emperor , killed under the walls of
Moscow	LOCATION	, and notified me of the alleged senatus-consultum , which he , however , did not let me read .

		He likewise told me that the citizen
Boutreux	PERSON	was going to assume my functions , and then made me a prisoner in my own room , placing a couple of soldiers on guard over me . ''

		From the Prefecture Lahorie hastened to the
Ministry of Police	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here a far more exciting scene was enacted , which , however , need not be detailed here .

		Suffice it to say that the Due de Rovigo was arrested and hur - ried away to La Force by
General Guidal	ORGANIZATION	, an inveterate personal enemy , who was only re - strained by his superior from obeying to the letter
Malet	PERSON	's order '' to have recourse to the most violent methods . ''

		Lahorie , who signed the commitment , had at once usurped the min - ister 's functions , with the object , as he sub - sequently declared at his own trial , of saving Rovigo 's life .

		This assertion , says
Pasquier	PERSON	, `` Is not consonant with truth , for immediately upon being installed in the official residence , he sent for a tailor , of whom he ordered the habit of a minister ; he then entered the carriage of his predecessor , and had himself driven to the
Hotel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	where he presented himself as Minister of Police . ''

		Meanwhile ,
Pasquier	PERSON	, still under guard in his bedroom , had prevailed on the unwary Bou - treux to show him the senatus-consultum and the proclamation .

		A glance confirmed his sus - picions that both were apochryphal .

		He was still pondering over the probable outcome of this mad enterprise , when a sub-lieutenant of the cohorte , one
Lefevre	PERSON	, entered the room with an order for his commitment to
La Force	ORGANIZATION	, whither he was at once conveyed .

		Arrived at the prison , he was handed over to
Lebeau	PERSON	, the jailor a worthy man , who , says
Pasquier	PERSON	, '' owed his situation to me . '' ''

		As soon as the doors were closed behind me , '' he adds , '' he placed himself at my disposal . ''

		From
Lebeau Pasquier	PERSON	learned the events of the early morn , when Lahorie and Guidal had been freed , and also that the
Due de Rovigo	ORGANIZATION	and M. Des - marets had just been registered as prisoners .

		Obviously , in
La Force	ORGANIZATION	, the Prefect was as lit - tle under duress as were the
General	ORGANIZATION	and the Abbe in the sanitarium of
Saint	LOCATION	-
Antoine	PERSON	; and he was about '' escaping '' with the kindly connivance of Mme.
Lebeau	PERSON	by a side en - trance , when
M. Saulnier	PERSON	, the
Due de Rovigo	ORGANIZATION	's secretary , and
M. Laborde	PERSON	, the town adjutant , arrived with the news that all was over , and that Generals
Malet	PERSON	and Lahorie were under arrest .

		The following is what hastened the issue : On reaching the
Place Vendome	ORGANIZATION	,
Malet	PERSON	pro- ceeded to the house of General
Hulin	PERSON	, com - mander of the military division .

		Leaving his troop at the door , he mounted to the
General	ORGANIZATION	's room , accompanied by two or three of his offi - cers .

		Here he informed
Hulin	PERSON	of the Empe - ror 's death ; but noting , as he thought , a cloud of disbelief on his face , he bade him step into an adjoining room to look over the vouchers .

		The luckless
Hulin	PERSON	acquiesced ; and no sooner had the door closed behind them than
Malet	PERSON	shot him dead with a pistol thus indicating the degree of '' violence '' he expected from his lieutenants .

		Having perpetrated this crime ,
Malet	PERSON	hurried back to his command .

		By this time , as may be supposed , it had been noticed that something wrong was passing at
General Hulin 's	ORGANIZATION	, and an alarm was raised .

		Still ,
Malet	PERSON	managed to gain admission to General
Doucet	PERSON	, chief of the staff , who was at the time reading the senatus-consultum just handed him .

		Dou - cet had detected the forgery , and was protest - ing against the imposture .

		Noting this , the now desperate
Malet	PERSON	drew his pistol , and was 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, about to dispose of
Doucet	PERSON	as he had already disposed of
Hulin	LOCATION	, when Adjutant Laborde promptly disarmed him and placed him under arrest , and then summoned to his aid the troops that guarded the residence .

		The soldiers of the cohorte , however , on learning what had hap - pened , at once surrendered to Laborde and Gen - eral
Doucet	PERSON	.

		Thus , all was over with
General Malet	ORGANIZATION	, after a rather amazing success of four or five hours ' duration .

		Pasquier goes rather fully into the subse - quent trials especially that of Lahorie , whose case was a singularly hard one .

		It is pretty evident that he was completely deceived .

		As for
Malet	PERSON	himself , it is due to his memory to say that he did not hesitate , at his trial , to assume entire responsibility for the foolhardy enter - prise , expressly exonerating his companions , and revealing thereby the strain of nobility in his character .

		As with so many Frenchmen of that time , his political ideal inspired him with the fervor and fanaticism of a religious belief ; and he died for it cheerfully .

		It is some - thing of a satisfaction to know that he died a soldier 's death by the bullet .

		He summed up his cause in these few words : '' The man who has constituted himself the defender of his country has no need of any defence ; he tri - umphs , or goes to his death . ''

		Malet ,
Lahorie	LOCATION	,
Guidal	LOCATION	,
Boccheiampe	LOCATION	,
Sou	PERSON	- lier , and eight officers , were sentenced to death , and shot the next morning on the plain of Grenelle . ''

		And I am of opinion , '' says Pas - quier mildly , `` that a lesser number might have been brought to trial , and that fewer lives might have been sacrificed . ''

		As
Malet	PERSON	was probably the only victim -LRB- except Boutreux -RRB- who was actually guilty of the charge laid , the Prefect 's '' opinion '' seems not unreasonable .

		It remains to account for
M. Lafon	PERSON	the good Abbe who discreetly vanished when the waves ran high .

		He was diligently hunted , as it was known that if the Royalist party had countenanced the conspiracy , the threads of it could only be grasped by securing him .

		All efforts proved unavailing , however ; and
M. Lafon	PERSON	, it seems , busied himself thenceforth in dodging from one hiding-place to another -LRB- do - ing , meanwhile , as much mischief as was com - patible with his personal safety -RRB- , until the Res - toration enabled him to float serenely to the surface .

		Chancellor
Pasquier	PERSON	has supplementally styled his Memoir '' A History of My Time , '' thus forestalling a possible stricture that he has , in composing it , unduly subordinated biog - raphy to history .

		Throughout the work there is an abundance of historical and political narra - tive , with the sagacious , well-weighed views and judgments of Pasquier the statesman ; but there is relatively little that might serve to bring us closer to Pasquier the man .

		The book is richer in political reflection and criticism than in per - sonalia and anecdote though the latter ele - ments are not absent .

		Of humor we discover no trace .

		The Chancellor 's story flows on with the dignity and philosophic calm at times with a degree of the penetration of a De Tocqueville ; and one notes throughout a cer - tain stateliness of phrase , a balance of period , and an elimination of color and detail , trace - able , perhaps , to the classicist standards of the writer 's earlier years .

		Closing with the depart - ure of the Allies from
Paris	LOCATION	, the volume covers an eventful period a time of shifting political fortunes , of fateful struggles on the field and in the cabinet .

		Pasquier treats of these matters with a largeness of view and a precision of knowledge that will commend his work to all serious students of the Napoleonic era .

		The good work of the translator , Mr.
Charles E. Roche	PERSON	, calls for a word of praise .

		E G j AN INDEX-GUIDE TO VENETIAN PAINTERS .

		* Few things are more irritating to the aver - age man than to be told his taste in pictures is bad .

		In the matter of books , he has probably acquired habits of submission at an early age ; but in most cases he is first seriously introduced to pictures when of mature years .

		He is jeal - ous of his personal rights ; he refuses to be dic - tated to by self - constituted connoisseurs ; but he generally ends by quietly acquiescing in their judgments and by reverently if unintelligently prostrating himself before each and every can - vas that may happen to be called after the ortho - dox masters .

		This is as it should be , because untrained instinct is just as likely to miss in pictures as in books or in life , and half - trained instinct is sure to miss .

		But there are diffi - culties in the way of the neophyte in the gal - leries of
Europe	LOCATION	, especially of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		He sees the name of , say ,
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	in his cat - alogue or on the frame before him .

		In his new submissiveness he straightway worships a much-rubbed copy by a pupil of a picture by a pupil of Leonardo .

		THE DIAL 269 false painted idols .

		How they came to be by the unscrupulous vanity of picture fanciers , by sheer carelessness , by honestly stupid attri - bution , this does not concern us here .

		Enough that they exist , and are a trap for the unwary .

		Existing in such numbers , moreover , these lying attributions have of late years piqued connoisseurship to finer and more exact methods , which , aided by the growth of rapid transit and the perfection of isochromatic pho - tography , are now capable of practically certain conclusions .

		Such up-to-date attributions are to be found in Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's account of '' The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance , '' which is among the very first fruits in English of the new art criticism .

		With Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	's In - dexes in hand , the student and the traveller may feel reasonably confident of worshipping , at least among Venetian masters , no false or unknown gods .

		He will find two catalogue - indexes : one to the works of the principal Ven - etian painters in the public galleries , private collections , and churches of
Europe	LOCATION	; the other to the various places in
Europe	LOCATION	containing these works .

		But the serious lay-student needs fuller in - struction yet .

		He may stand before the right picture in the wrong mood .

		It is true that most people will object most strenuously against having their moods cut out for them .

		Titian , they will say , has not the same message for everyone ; everyone has a right to his own par - ticular reading of the master .

		Now we believe this much-flaunted relativity of tastes to be wrong .

		If painting is to give higher pleasure than cooking , it must appeal to our intelligence as well as to our senses .

		And it can only do so by conveying some sort of meaning .

		Now Titian 's meaning , being expressed in a definite and peculiar picture-language , is not open to the chance comer any more than the meaning of a Parisian is open to a German who has never learned French .

		Indeed , the picture-language of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	is even more difficult to the unin - structed than the sound-language of the
Paris	LOCATION	- ian .

		To translate the former for ourselves we must have acquainted ourselves with the nature and limits of picture-language in general and of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	's picture-language in particular ; we must know if and how far the religious and political prejudices of his time allowed him to paint his meaning as clearly and plainly as the medium permitted ; in fine , we must slowly and at many pains learn numerous things of which the chance comer has no conception whatso - ever .

		The sensible student , therefore , will stoop to conquer , will prefer being right to being original .

		Now to say , indeed , that Mr.
Beren	PERSON	- son 's luminous and condensed translation of the picture-language of Venetian painters is in all respects right , would be to assume for our - selves a finality even greater .

		His interpreta - tions are at least plausible and suggestive , and the historical nexus of which they form links is clearly and graphically presented .

		It would be unjust to his own disclaimer to attempt to crowd the progress of Venetian art into any single formula ; but very roughly speaking , Venetian painters may be said in the first place to have been formed under the tute - lage of the Church , then later to have passed through the stage of the patronage of the city to the final independence of the schools .

		And still more roughly , the three stages may be typ - ified by the JPieta , the Pageant , and the Por - trait .

		But we are indulging in generalizations for which the soberer study before us hardly gives warrant .

		The make-up of the book is tasteful outside and in , from the pretty Venetian binding to the frontispiece , a reproduction of
Giorgione	ORGANIZATION	's fascinating '' Shepherd with Pipe . ''

		Some hesi - tation may be felt as to the primer-like method of paragraphing with numerals in bold type ; this device undoubtedly facilitates reference , but it breaks continuity of attention and spoils the page .

		In so short a book the device hardly seems necessary .

May 1	DATE	, bleman , and Lieut ,
von Hbhnell	PERSON	, who is the chief narrator was , in the earlier stages , the famil - iar one of
Livingstone	PERSON	and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	inland from
Mombasa	LOCATION	in
Zanzibar	LOCATION	, the oldest mission sta - tion in eastern
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Instead of going west - ward to
Victoria Nyanza	LOCATION	, they turned north - ward through the mountain regions , which they thoroughly explored ; through the wild and uncultivated
Masailand	LOCATION	, and the shunned and dreaded
Kikuyaland	LOCATION	; discovering new volca - noes , and discovering and thoroughly investi - gating two great lakes which they named for the Crown Prince and Princess of
Austria	LOCATION	, Ru - dolf and
Stefanie	PERSON	.

		Lake
Rudolf	PERSON	is about one - third the size of the
Victoria Nyanza	LOCATION	.

		The trickiness , greediness , quarrelsomeness , and elusiveness of the
Africans	LOCATION	, the rebuffs , disappointments , and obstacles so trying to the patience of other African explorers , were promptly encountered by these travellers ; and the Lieutenant says , `` We soon gave up the idea that we could wander around
Africa	LOCATION	in a light - hearted , careless way . ''

		Indeed , the parapher - nalia of an African trip would prohibit any thought of care-free days .

		These two sports - men started from
Zanzibar	LOCATION	with two hundred Zanzibari , nine guides , nine guards , and four hundred and fifty porters , and a vast number of cattle and donkeys .

		The food for such a regi - ment of men would be no light burden or consid - eration , the wages no small sum .

		The list of the arms and ammunition is in itself astonishing .

		It is with a pleasant sense of renewal of old acquaintance that we find in the early pages of this work , among the newly engaged guides and escorts , the names of various dusky natives of varying reliability who served with
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	,
Junker	PERSON	, the unfortunate Bishop Han - nington , and other travellers ; and we even note that itinerant culinary treasure ,
Speke	ORGANIZATION	's and
Cameron	PERSON	's cook ,
Mhogo	LOCATION	.

		Among the most thrilling pages are those which tell of the ascent of
Mt. Kilimanjaro	LOCATION	,
Mt. Kenia	LOCATION	, Mt. Kibo .

		Those of us who are familiar with the old missionary accounts of
Africa	LOCATION	will remember that these mountains were discovered about the middle of this cen - tury by missionaries of the
Church Missionary Society	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, and that the story told by those pious gentlemen , of snow-capped peaks so close to the equator , was universally discred - ited .

		Not recalling that these missionaries trav - elled with any extraordinary outfit or attend - ance , 1 have searched for and re-read their story , and find that the journey to the mountains , which required seven hundred followers in
1886	DATE	, was made by
Parson Rebman	ORGANIZATION	in
1848	DATE	with nine men and '' weaponed only with an umbrella . ''

		Lieutenant von
Hbhnell	ORGANIZATION	's description of the primeval forests found on these mountains , for - ests which no ' man could penetrate save through paths trodden by the mighty elephants ; of the giant trees , dead through their burden of strange , weird , clinging parasites and lurid - flowered creepers ; with the painful stillness , unbroken by cry of bird or beast or hum of insect , where even at
midday	TIME	, under a tropical sun , a chill , gloomy , greenish twilight pre - vailed , this forceful story makes us compre - hend and almost feel the welcome which our travellers gave in the higher grass-belt to a cheerful , homely , well-known face that of our common violet .

		The description of the happy life in
Taveta	LOCATION	that orderly , prosperous African
Arcadia	LOCATION	confirms
Joseph Thomson	PERSON	's account in his '' Through Masailand . ''

		We can but wonder that some Aryan race has not ere now chosen and invaded that highly blessed and charming spot , and there founded a colony ; though this would never seem feasible while there still ex - ists in eastern
Africa	LOCATION	the slave-trade , and no means of transport from the coast save by hu - man carriers .

		These travellers can not boast , as does Dr.
Johnston	PERSON	in his recent book of African travel , that they did not lose a follower by death .

		Scores fell by the wayside , were lost or drowned , or died of fever .

		All endured great privations , horrible thirst , sicknesses , and dangers , and were in waterless Samburu in very desperate straits .

		So gaunt was Count
Teleki	PERSON	, a power - ful giant whose normal weight was two hundred and thirty-eight pounds , that he weighed but a hundred and forty pounds .

		One of the objects of the expedition was the pursuit of big game , as well as '' heroic ardour to adventurous deeds , '' and in that end it was signally successful .

		Many of the records of the hunts are most spirited and thrilling .

		I have had curiosity enough to make a summary of the game shot by
Count Teleki	ORGANIZATION	from Feb - ruary 18 to
September 28	DATE	, and find he bagged seventy-nine rhinoceroses , three hippopotami , thirty-eight elephants , one giraffe , two lions , one panther , one wildcat , one leopard , and a vast number of buffalo , antelope , zebras , harte - bestes , and other variety of deer .

Europe	LOCATION	.

		Lieutenant von Hb ` hnell does not appear to have been so successful a shot as his compan - ion , and the records of wounded and maimed brutes that escaped death or capture are pain - fully frequent to an unsportsmanlike and bes - tiarian sensibility .

		Such accounts as this are interesting , probably , to a hunter : '' A great yellowish-brown creature suddenly came in sight at a distance of eighty paces .

		It was a giraffe ; but I was so taken by surprise at seeing it so near me and far from the steppes these shy creatures generally haunt , that I could not at first believe my eyes .

		I crept cautiously nearer so as to get a good view of the body and choose the best point at which to aim .

		The giraffe , a splendid full - grown male , did not budge , but went on feeding on the tender topmost leaves on an acacia , without the slightest suspicion of danger .

		All the hunter 's zeal laid to rest among the quantities of game awoke within me again , and as I approached I spied a second smaller giraffe , and realized that the two were a pair who had with - drawn together to the forest .

		After long consideration as to where the heart might be in a body of a form so unfamiliar to me , I fired .

		The buck was wounded to death ; and as he struggled in his last agonies , he turned slowly towards his wife , who stood rooted to the spot , Jier great gazelle-like eyes fixed on her mate .

		The hunting fever once roused , I had lost all mercy , and I did not hesitate to fire at the female .

		Though both now were mortally wounded , the two remained standing , with their forelegs stuck out in front of them ; so I put a rapid end to their sufferings by firing again .

		The lit - tle wife was the first to die ; she fell forwards , and then wound her long neck over on the left till her head al - most touched her tail .

		I did not actually see the buck die , as I was watching the passing away of his mate .

		... I am sorry now I did not measure the male .

		The size of wild giraffes is ever so much greater than one would imagine from seeing them in zoological gardens only , and the largest elephant I saw did not impress me as half so imposing as a half-grown giraffe .

		The flesh tastes not unlike venison .

		The skin is nearly as thick as that of buffalo , and tremendously tough .

		... I also came upon another pair of giraffes which gazed upon me inquisitively and made no effort to escape .

		Though there was really no need to secure any more meat , I could not refrain from firing at the male .

		Mortally wounded , he tried to save himself from falling by stand - ing with forelegs wide apart whilst he swayed his long neck to and fro .

		A second shot brought him down .

		His wife ran off at the first shot for scarcely two hun - dred paces , and then remained standing , gazing sadly at her mate , not even moving away when we busied our - selves about his corpse . ''

		It is with a certain sense of retributive justice that we read the record of the Lieutenant 's first elephant hunt , where he was successful in bring - ing down other game .

		`` I raised the heavy gun and fired at the shoulder near the edge of the huge unwieldly ear .

		At the same moment I got a tremendous blow in the face , and saw blood streaming down on the still smoking gun ... The wounded elephant approached a step nearer and was apparently about to charge .

		There he stood , drawn up to his full height , so that he looked enormously tall and thin , his ears outspread , and his trunk , which he wound in serpentine coils , threateningly uplifted .

		On either side of him , shoulder to shoulder , stood two of his comrades , also with outspread ears and uplifted trunks , whilst behind him loomed the fourth .

		Motion - less the four remained , sniffing the air and peering to - ward our acacia , the silence only broken by the drip - ping down of my blood .

		I had been almost stunned by the blow on my face , and my mad zeal for hunting was gone , and I felt incapable of firing another shot how - ever necessary in my own defence .

		Presently the ele - phants all turned tail and dashed off , the noise of crack - ing branches gradually dying away .

		I now discovered that my nose was split nearly open , the right nostril hanging loose .

		The bands of the elephant-gun have a strong tendency to fly up in firing .

		The sharp-edged comb of the left hammer had slit up one nostril , and cut the bridge of my nose .

		I bound up my nose as well as I could , noted the direction of the elephants ' spoor , and returned to camp in the dark .

		Count
Teleki	PERSON	did not let me go till my face was done up in a regu - lar mask as stiff as plaster of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The wound was not painful , but it was six weeks before it healed .

		A small scar and a numbness of the tip of the nose still remind me of my first elephant hunt . ''

		It is impossible to overpraise the variety and exactness of the information given in this work , nor the lucidity and conciseness of its expres - sion .

		With these volumes in hand , one could purchase the exact stock necessary for travel in eastern
Equatorial Africa	LOCATION	; could know what to select for trading purposes , what to employ to facilitate progress through the various states .

		We are shown the best methods of packing these wares ; the best food for the journey , and the proper proportions of food .

		Though the ex - pedition was not formed with scientific intent , its scientific results were eminently satisfactory .

		Ethnological , ethnographical , and sociological questions receive due attention throughout the pages , and show careful , unbiased , and unim - aginative investigation .

		The geological and petographical results were important , and have been recorded in the
Imperial Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	at
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		The orological surveys were of exceptional value .

		The entomological and botanical lists given in the appendix are attractive , and reveal many hitherto unknown species and varieties ; indeed , one of the most charming characteristics of the book is the love of nature shown in the constant description of flowers and trees .

		The vigilant eyes of the trav - ellers , and what La Bruyere called the spirit of discernment , noted every detail of natural phe - nomena with the same intent love that
Emin Pasha	PERSON	bestowed on like subjects , and that
Stan	PERSON	- ley so constantly derided .

May 1	DATE	, Large and strongly - affixed maps , showing ethnological , geographical , geological , and other statistical data ; a glossary of native words and phrases , and an exceptionally good index , make perfect the book .

		As a piece of book-making it can scarcely be surpassed , not only in its or - derliness and good literary proportions , but in its mechanical attributes .

		I have not noted in the eight hundred pages a single typographical error ; paper and print are alike perfect .

		The illustrations , chiefly taken from photographs , are profuse in number , equally interesting and varied , and -LRB- of the native men and women -RRB- are hideous and startling enough to satisfy the most crying demands for novelty .

		Weapons , costumes , headgear , and ornaments are liberally portrayed .

		The grotesque presentments of the latter would have proved invaluable to Mme.
Cocheris	PERSON	for her new book , '' Les Parures Prim - itives . ''

		On closing the book we are impressed that there is scarcely any attribute a successful Afri - can explorer does not need , for all seem abso - lutely imperative : health , wealth , patience , courage , endurance , craft , enthusiasm , asceti - cism , handiness at every trade and calling , but , above all , energy .

		But this one-sidedness has been partly com - pensated by the religious life of each .

		The vio - lence of the West has been softened by the feminine faith of love , renunciation , obedience , salvation from without .

		It is the very impersonality of her great ecclesiastical institute which offers to man a refuge from self .

		On the other hand , the peaceful impo - tence of the
East	LOCATION	has been spurred by her martial faith of spiritual knighthood , self-reliance , salvation from within .

		The intense individuality of her eso - teric discipline upholds the fertile tranquillity of her surface .

		This stupendous double antithesis seems to me the most significant fact in all history .

		The future union of the types may thus be symbolized as a twofold marriage . ''

		In '' The Present Meeting of East and West , '' the author deals with '' the first attempts to assimilate alien ideals , '' which '' have led to the irony of a quadruple confusion , analogous to the disruption of Alexander 's conquest . ''

		But there is to be another and more intimate union , brought about in some mysterious way by the art of music , and in a manner foreshadowed in some sort by the compositions of
Herr Brahms	PERSON	.

		Here , we must confess , we are unable to follow the argu - ment .

		And the poem ends with a rapturous song of `` The Future Union of East and West . ''

		This is a good deal of philosophical machinery with which to burden a composition of fifteen hundred lines , and the work is too ambitious to be wholly success - ful .

		But it abounds in strong passages , such as the finely imaginative struggle of the archangels , who '' Met as mountains meet , when Titans cast Pelion on Ossa , and their fragments spurt Through startled space a jet of asteroids , '' or the stanzas to
Hangchow	LOCATION	, where -LRB- among other things -RRB- , '' In a tangle of leaves with silken sleeves Thy poets sing on the terraced beach , Where the blue-flagged taverns with mossy eaves Are starred by the pink of the blossoming peach , '' or the following fine epitome of the Viking con - quests : `` Now shot from polar coasts see meteors flash , Long lines of Viking ships , with low black hulls Like vultures , plunging through the Northern seas , Hovering like gulls in track of channel storms , Scouring for prey the long white sunlit cliffs ; Wailing their chant to
Odin	PERSON	like wild winds Surging through organ pipes of naked fjords ,
Wooing Valhalla	LOCATION	to
Northumbrian	ORGANIZATION	hills Or primrose-garnished banks of lovely
Seine	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 273 Wielding the cross as once their bolt of Thor , They skirt with gorgeous sweep
Hispania	ORGANIZATION	's curves , Through pillared gateway of the land-locked sea Set in its rifted coasts of gilded cloud , A blue enamelled dragon !

		Now they break , Those strange Norse champions of a Hebrew god , The threatening onsets of the Saracen , Dispersed like storms which strew with wrecks thy coast , Nurse of a hundred races , Sicily ! ''

		We should like to quote also the fine description of the destruction of the
Summer Palace	ORGANIZATION	in
1859	DATE	, but Mr.
Fenollosa	PERSON	's other poems claim our remaining space .

		Of these , the most important is '' The Dis - covery of
America	LOCATION	, '' described as '' a symphonic poem , '' in four movements , and in a great variety of metres .

		Since both the manner and the matter of the author constantly invite musical comparisons , we will remark that the suggestion of Liszt is here very evident .

		A passage from the soliloquy of Co - lumbus may be reproduced : `` And yet I knew ; and yet I dimly guessed When as a guileless boy I climbed the steep Ligurian cliffs in lusty joy , And gazed far off upon the dimpled breast Of blue-eyed seas that slumbered in the
West	LOCATION	.

		For was I not compelled As by a great hand held To gaze , and gaze , and gaze Through tender brooding miles of purple haze , Till soft-winged isles Seemed lifting orange bosoms to the sun 's last smiles , And my light will , a feather free , Was blown like a trembling bird far out to sea By storm-winds , Alpine-brewed , of passionate prophecy ? ''

		The poem from which this extract is taken must certainly be reckoned among the most notable in - spired by the recent quadri-centennial year .

		As for Mr.
Fenollosa	PERSON	's minor poems , they are always in - teresting , and often satisfying .

		We will end our examples with the lines to '' Fuji at Sunrise '' : '' Startling the cool gray depths of morning air She throws aside her counterpane of clouds , And stands half folded in her silken shrouds With calm white breast and snowy shoulder bare .

		High o'er her head a flush all pink and rare Thrills her with foregleam of an unknown bliss , A virgin pure who waits the bridal kiss , Faint with expectant joy she fears to share .

		Lo , now he comes , the dazzling prince of day !

		Flings his full glory o'er her radiant breast ; Enfolds her to the rapture of his rest , Transfigured in the throbbing of his ray .

		fly , my soul , where love 's warm transports are ; And seek eternal bliss in yon pink kindling star . ''

		Lest this review would seem to have abrogated the traditional fault-finding function of criticism , we will close by remarking the false quantity in the author 's use of '' Granicus . ''

		But this defect is at least partly atoned for by his getting '' Himalya '' right , which few succeed in doing .

		A rather striking imagination , expended impar - tially upon the most disparate themes Semitic , Greek , and mediaeval coupled with some com - mand of dramatic effect , appears in Mr.
Hay	PERSON	's `` Created Gold . ''

		We quote the sonnet on `` Joan of Arc '' : '' Patient and passionless
Joan	PERSON	led her flock .

		When , visioned dimly , bleeding
France	LOCATION	appeared , Circled with ruined homes and fields war-seared .

		It made her life one plan ; her pity , rock .

		She snatched a sword :
France	LOCATION	rose ` mid
England	LOCATION	's mock ;
Joan	PERSON	drove the foe like sheep , their fleeces sheared .

		With fleur-de-lis in maiden hand upreared , She chased and routed
Britain	LOCATION	, shock on shock .

		France crowned her , ' Bravest Virgin ` neath the sun , ' And then betrayed to
England	LOCATION	's baffled host That Maid whose form is skyed till time shall cease .

		Joan , great in triumph , greater was undone :
France	LOCATION	gave her much , harsh
England	LOCATION	gave her most ; Three royal gifts Fame , Martyrdom , and Peace . ''

		A noticeable lack of finish frequently lessens the acceptability of Mr.
Hay	PERSON	's poems , excellent though the stuff with which they deal .

		A contemplative philosophy , the gentle melan - choly of the soul that has borne disillusion with little of the shock that it has for a more passionate natui e , and a semi-religious sentiment tending towards qui - etism , seem the characteristic notes of Mr.
George Santayana	PERSON	's sonnets .

		The restf ulness of their effect , and the placid flow of their thought , may be well felt in this example : '' A wall , a wall around nay garden rear , And hedge me in from the disconsolate hills ; Give me but one of all the mountain rills , Enough of ocean in its voice I hear .

		Come no profane insatiate mortal near With the contagion of his passionate ills ; The smoke of battle all the valleys fills , Let the eternal sunlight greet me here .

		This spot is sacred to the deeper soul And to the piety that mocks no more .

		In nature 's inmost heart is no uproar , None in this shrine ; in peace the heavens roll , In peace the slow tides pulse from shore to shore , And ancient quiet broods from pole to pole . ''

		A group of Sapphic odes , metrically less happy than in expression , follows the sonnets in Mr.
San	PERSON	- tayana 's volume , and these are in turn followed by a few miscellaneous and occasional pieces . ''

		Lucifer , '' a slight dramatic sketch in lyrical measures and blank verse , closes the thin but not unattractive vol - ume .

		It gives us only the pale reflex of a cloistered mind , but delicacy of touch and the perceptions that accompany the cultured outlook are not lacking , and the pages are distinctly pleasing , although their perusal occasions hardly an emotional ripple .

		Mr.
Reginald Fanshawe	PERSON	's `` Two Lives '' is an in - tensely subjective poem whose subject is '' described as a spiritual pilgrimage from nothingness and de - nial to hope and fulfilment ; as a vision of the pro- gress of life , through the experience of nature , self , and , history , to God . ''

		It is put forth as a fragment , and provided with a philosophical preface which strikes the high note of seriousness maintained throughout the poem .

		It is written in the Spen - serian stanza , with interspersed lyrics .

		The title , `` Two Lives , '' is to be taken in a twofold sense .

		Primarily , the song is one of personal bereavement , of two actual lives sundered by the death of a be - loved wife .

		Secondarily , it is a song of the higher life superadded upon the lower by the stern but ultimately gracious ministries of sorrow and of 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, thought .

		This latter aspect of the poem finds ex - pression in the '' Introduction , '' wherein we read : '' Two lives The human woof , The mystic warp divine , Woven by God , who worketh not aloof To his design Intrinsic ; whither all things climb and cross , Fulfilled , begun , Through death and beauty , dream and love and loss , So subtly pierced and spun By His pure Spirit , He doth use The whole world 's service , sacramental , one , Unto its form 's full continent , For high prophetic truth , and doth Himself infuse , Till twain be blent . ''

		It is not often that the ancestry of a poem is so strongly marked as in the present case .

		If the form derives from
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, the thought has the in - spiration of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, while of Shelley is the pas - sion and the lofty idealism .

		Indeed , this twofold debt is fully acknowledged , and the tributes to those great poets are among the finest things in Mr. Fan - shawe 's spiritual autobiography .

		Here is one of the stanzas dedicated to Shelley : '' And though anon his vision floated thin As dreamful cloud across the breathless blue , A pale soul , half monastic , half akin To earth , his passion , as it melted , drew The veil from off a far and sunny view Of a beauty and a brotherhood more free , And from a dawning , dyed to the full hue Of his own faith and golden phantasy , Sank in the purple bosom of a southern sea . ''

		And here is a stanza upon the death of Tennyson : '' Leave him , where death 's completing touch doth paint Round his pale forehead time 's last aureole , And canonize in calm so true a saint Of song , who ever held his vision whole , Unsoiled ; through the pure ether of whose soul , As one sublimed to listen , set apart , God 's music wrought and ripened by control For reconcilement 's broad and mellow art , And beat through nature 's bosom to his human heart . ''

		Mr.
Fanshawe	PERSON	has written a very noble poem , and the world that cherishes '' Epipsychidion '' and `` In Memoriam '' will not lightly cast it aside .

		Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's versatility is so considerable that the public has learned not to be surprised at anything he may undertake .

		From his ingenious contention that Englishmen are Celts to his novel interpretations of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	, from his opinion of Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	as the only living English novelist worth considering to his view of socialism as the only form of political organization that a serious thinker can advocate , we cheerfully accept the whole series of vagaries and wonder what outlet will be the next sought by the author 's busy imagin - ation .

		To consider Mr.
Allen	PERSON	as a poet we are in a measure prepared .

		He has put forth before this ballads of evolution and of socialism , as well as verses of classical provenance .

		His present '' rem - iniscences of excursions round the base of
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	, undertaken for the most part in early manhood , '' include a number of things that we have seen be - fore , and a number of others that we doubtless might have seen also had we searched for them .

		They are facile in versification , more or less imitative , oc - casionally humorous .

		Touches of passion are not wanting , as the revolutionary stanzas having three dates `` 1789 ,
1848	DATE	, 1870 '' for their title shall testify : '' The song of nations .

		Sing and clap your hands : Burst into blossom , all ye barren lands : She comes , to break the linked chains asunder , And snap in twain the adamantine bands . ''

		She came before .

		Her cruel face and fair Smote all our breasts with infinite despair : She passed .

		The brightness of her lurid beauty Was fiercer than our dazzled eyes could bear . ''

		She came again .

		In milder mien she came , With fruits and flowers crowned , but still the same .

		One lurid day crushed down her risen splendour ; She passed in murky clouds of smoke and flame . ''

		Once more she comes .

		Surely our hearts are tried , And every lesser passion cast aside : Shall she not dwell among us now forever , Our one and only love , our deathless bride ? ''

		This is from a group of poems written in
1871	DATE	, and inspired by the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	and the Commune .

		A bas la bourgeoisie !

		is the cry of one of them , and the verses live up to their subversive text .

		But it is a little curious to find these things reprinted a score of years afterward .

		If we are not mistaken , it is a quarter-century since Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	published his last volume of po - ems , and , indeed , the collection now published is made up in considerable part of pieces from the '' lo in
Egypt	LOCATION	'' volume that appeared as long ago as
1859	DATE	.

		It evidently represents the author 's ripest judgment upon his own work , and is a volume re - markable for elevation and originality .

		Such are the poetic glories of the Victorian age that Dr.
Gar	PERSON	- nett , we fear , is fated ever to be reckoned a minor poet ; yet we can not escape the thought that such a volume , in almost any other age of our letters , would have enshrined its author in all the literary histo - ries and made his name famous for years to come .

		We have chosen three extracts in illustration of the various aspects of Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	's .

		verse .

		The first is a passage from the blank verse '' Nausicaa , '' in which the maiden bewails the loss of Odysseus . ''

		I can not bear this evil any more .

		Teach me , again I pray , the art that comes Of wrestling with the lithe Protean sea .

		Then , some night , while these cliffs and feathery trees Spread the deep bay with shadow , ere the moon Surmounts them with her lamp , I will be here , Stand at the boat 's prow , hallow the salt wave With sacrifice , then with a timorous oar Wrinkling the liquid darkness , urge myself Out on the bitter waste of death that hems My little isle of life , look where I may .

		For of three things the one , either I find My Ithacan , my royal mariner , Safe sceptered with the grey
Penelope	LOCATION	; Then will I sue and serve her , spinning out My heartstrings with her wool , until I die .

		Or haply he has perished , and I crowd Long anguish into momentary death .

		Or liker , veers the blast , fills the frail bark , And o'er it mourns the sorrow of the sea . ''

		The sonnet '' To Dante , '' selected , not without dif -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 275 ficulty , from upwards of a score , all subtly wrought , shall be our second example : '' ' Poet , whose unscarred feet have trodden Hell , By what grim path and red environing Of fire couldst thou that dauntless footstep bring And plant it firm amid the dolorous cell Of darkness where perpetually dwell The spirits cursed beyond imagining ?

		Or else is thine a visionary wing , And all thy terror but a tale to tell ? ' '

		Neither and both , thou seeker !

		I have been No wilder path than thou thyself dost go , Close masked in an impenetrable screen , Which having rent I gaze around , and know What tragic wastes of gloom , before unseen , Curtain the soul that strives and sins below . ' ''

		Last of all we give the last two of the four stanzas that make up an exquisite poem called '' Even - Star . '' ''

		I see great cities rise , which being hoar Are slowly rendered unto dust again ; And roaring billows preying on the shore ; And virgin isles ascending from the main ; The passing wave of the perpetual river ; And men depart , and man remaining ever . ''

		The upturned eyes of many a mortal maid Glass me in gathering tears , soon kissed away ; Then walks she for a space , and then is laid Swelling the bosom of the quiet clay . '

		I muse what this all-kindling Love may be , And what this Death that never comes to me . ''

		This reminds us of one of Tourgue ` nieff 's '' Senilia '' the striking dialogue of two Alpine peaks but has a touch of tenderness foreign to the suggested prototype .

		Mr.
Gleeson White	PERSON	is an expert anthologist , and his `` Book-Song '' will be welcome to all who love the subject of which it sings .

		It contains poems , to the number of over one hundred and fifty , written in praise of books or their authors .

		The pieces are all modern , but we are told that a similar collection of `` the golden numbers of past times '' is in course of preparation by Mr.
William Roberts	PERSON	.

		A certain indefiniteness of aim results from the fact that the compiler has ventured beyond the strict category of poems about books , and brought into his collection a number of personal tributes to the writers of books , thus drawing from a practically inexhaustible source .

		But the collection displays good taste throughout , and no one can complain of it as far as it goes .

		A limited edition of the sonnets and lyrics com - prising
Rossetti	PERSON	's `` House of Life , '' beautifully printed after the fashion of the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	, has recently appeared in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The work is re - printed from the original text published in
1870	DATE	.

		The later edition of
1881	DATE	differed from the earlier in the omission of one sonnet '' Nuptial Sleep -LRB-
Pla	ORGANIZATION	- cata Venere -RRB- '' and in the alteration of a few others .

		Rossetti was influenced to make the changes by the disgusting pseudonymous attack of Mr.
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	, and most of his friends thought him over-sensitive for so doing .

		A remark by one of Whitman 's recent critics is equally to the point in the case of
Rossetti	PERSON	and his contemptible assailant : `` Indecent , in my opinion , these poems are not ; but the criticism which universally selects them for discussion and condemnation is extremely indecent . ''

		The present publishers of `` The House of Life '' have reproduced the work -LRB- so they put it -RRB- '' in its innocence and perfection . ''

		In thus acting , they have raised a delicate question of literary ethics , and even incurred some censure . ''

		Have the dead no rights that the living are bound to respect ? ''

		cries one in - dignant moralist .

		The cry seems to us entirely be - side the question .

		When a book has been given to the world it is , in a sense , irrevocable .

		With the right of keeping it to himself the author parts by the act of voluntary publication .

		If he afterwards wishes to withdraw it , or any part of it , he and his friends may plead for a deference to his wishes ; they can not fairly invoke his right .

		And in a case like this , where those nearest to the poet deprecated as unworthy the concession to a philistine sentiment that was involved in the revisions made , it is some - what hypercritical to take a publisher to task for preferring to reproduce the earlier of the two edi - tions .

		One might as well object to having the first edition of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's `` Omar '' reprinted .

		And the whole question is surely one of anise and cum - min in an age which has tolerated the publication of the manuscript fragments of
Shelley	PERSON	, the letters of Keats to
Fanny Brawne	ORGANIZATION	, and the private papers of
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		Until we have settled the weightier matters of the ethical law of literary property , it will be a misapplication of energy to discuss what are , in comparison , scholastic trivialities .

		Reconstruction Few departments of learning have of the science suffered so severely from the bane of Logic .

		O f tradition and technicality as that which deals with the principles underlying all sound knowledge , the science of thinking .

		It is a most hopeful indication of the comprehensive and funda - mental character of the modern scientific reforma - tion , that it has brought with it a most thorough and radical recasting of the logician 's outfit .

		After centuries of scholasticized
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	, and generations of text-books with no wider horizon than the re - quirements of an artificial educational scheme or still more artificial examination , it is the laudable achievement of the
last half century	DATE	to have laid the foundations of a more vitalized and progressive logic , to have overthrown the pertinacious and pernicious notion that the science of thought sprang , Minerva-like , perfect and pure from the head of the logical Zeus .

		It is as a contribution to this spirit of logical reform that the little volume by Mr.
Alfred Sidgwick	PERSON	entitled `` The Process of Argu - ment , '' recently issued by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will find a ready welcome .

		Mr.
Sidgwick	PERSON	devotes his pages to a general discussion of the principles for the determination of argumentative discourse , 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the fixation of belief , not as it might be carried on in the old-time disputations in which one champion set up a dogmatic chip on his shoulder and dared his opponent to find adequate authority for knock - ing it off , but as it occurs in the live and profitably debatable questions of modern science and modern thought .

		The distinction between observation and inference , the nature of generalization , the function of criticism , the significance of belief , the under - lying conceptions of cause and connection , the in - herent complexity of the arguments that dominate and create a point of view , the psychological basis of the thought-habit , are all suggestively but some - what vaguely sketched .

		This indefiniteness of state - ment and purpose is in part inherent in the topic , but a skill in presentation could have much reduced its prominence .

		No intelligent reader , however , is likely to leave the volume without conceding to Mr.
Sidgwick	PERSON	the success of his main purpose , `` to reach a conception of the general nature of ' argument ' -LRB- or battle between belief and doubt -RRB- which shall be a little less abstract , less artificially simplified , than that which the traditional logic has provided . ''

		A readable ^ r -
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	has just pub - voiumeonthe lished an excellent manual of that Jacobean poets .

		8ec tion of English literature which in - cludes the works of '' The Jacobean Poets '' -LRB- Scrib - ner -RRB- .

		Pending the appearance of the master who will some day tell for us the whole story of our lit - erature as it should be told , these careful studies of narrow periods are things to be grateful for , although there is no finality about them .

		The period with which Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's book deals is , of course , some - what arbitrarily limited by the dates of King
James	PERSON	's reign , and is not a natural subdivision of our liter - ary history .

		Perhaps the chief value of the present treatment is to be found in its calling attention to the fact that we often mean Jacobean when we loosely say Elizabethan .

		For an assignment to ''
Eliza	PERSON	and our James '' of the literary trophies of their respective reigns gives to the latter a large share of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and nearly all of the so-called Elizabethan dramatists
Jonson	PERSON	and
Chapman	PERSON	,
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	,
Heywood	PERSON	and
Middleton	PERSON	, Tourneur and
Webster	PERSON	.

		Ford and
Shirley	PERSON	were too late to be even Jacobean .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has writ - ten a book of temperate and carefully-worded criti - cism , rather thickly packed with titles and dates , but for all that very readable , and extremely happy in its illustrative extracts .

		If he can not be an out-and-out Nimrod , he would rather be a
Nathaniel Winkle	PERSON	than no sportsman at all .

		He shows a curious tendency to '' revert , '' to pre - fer the ways and the habitat of the natural man to the milder arrangements of civil society .

		The jun - gle of
India	LOCATION	, the `` bush '' of
Australia	LOCATION	and South Af - rica , echo the crack of his rifle ; his knickerbockers are a known phenomenon on
Kamschatka	ORGANIZATION	's frozen shores ; and we see him in
America	LOCATION	, touring prairie - wards , with his hat-box , tub , and other sporting es - sentials , in quest of buffalo , an enlivening specta - cle to the frontiersman .

		Mr.
Charles Montague	PERSON	, author of '' Tales of a Nomad '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , is one of these roving Britons who , for reasons to us in - scrutable , prefer '' roughing it '' in the wilds to a life of ease in
Pall Mall	ORGANIZATION	or Piccadilly .

		To do him justice , Mr.
Montague	PERSON	seems to have really been a mighty hunter .

		The book is chiefly made up of hunting-sketches , in which the writer gives the pith of his experiences , in a pleasantly off-hand , jaunty style , and without a touch of braggadocio .


South Africa	LOCATION	was the field of his operations , and all was game that came to his rifle including , on occasion , a stray Zulu , or even a Boer or two .

		He served as a volunteer in the Boer War , and gives a good pa - per on '' The Siege of Marabastadt . ''

		Mr.
Montague	PERSON	concludes the paper by predicting a '' great future '' for
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Ultimately , he says , '' there will be a confederation of
South African States	LOCATION	, and I think the
Transvaal	LOCATION	and
Free State	ORGANIZATION	will join , pro- vided that such confederation is not under the Brit - ish flag .

		In another fifty years the people of
South Africa	LOCATION	will be united in the bond and sentiment of Africanderism , and the sad records of strife between British and Dutch will be blotted out forever from their historic pages . ''

		Contemporary composers of
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr -
Arthur Heryey	PERSON	's `` Masters of French Music '' -LRB- imported by
Scrib	PERSON	- ner ^ i nc i u -LRB- j e8 fi ve names of living composers besides
Gounod	PERSON	, who died before the vol - ume was out of the press .

		These are
Ambroise Thomas	PERSON	, Saint Sae ` ns ,
Massenet	ORGANIZATION	,
Reyer	PERSON	, and Bru - neau .

		The sketches are written with intelligence and sympathy , and unite a happy mixture of biog - raphy and criticism not too profound for the appre - ciative but untrained concert and opera goer .

		The author detects in contemporary music the same ten - dency to realism that now invades art and liter - ature .

		As in literature the physiology of the mind appears to be the leading factor , so in music it is rather the minor motives of the action than its out - ward details that the serious operatic composer is tempted to depict .

		Truth of expression and dra - matic characterization are his chief aim .

		The French school has , during this century , left its mark in an undeniable manner upon operatic history , and the versatility of its composers has been proved over and over again .

		Hence a work like the present , analyzing the special peculiarities of the principal representatives of this school , is a welcome addition to musical criticism .

		The story of ^ n '' Oxford and Her Colleges '' -LRB- Mac - the

Goldwin Smith	PERSON	has gathered together an interesting body of information , descriptive , historical , topographical , and architectural .

the University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	dates back to the twelfth century , when ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 277 printing not having been invented and books being scarce , the lecture of the professor was the fountain of all knowledge .

		In the history of the human in - tellect , there is no more romantic period than this of the
Mediaeval Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	.

		The students of that day were a rough set , wearing arms , and using them not only on the roads , beset by robbers , but in con - flicts with the townspeople , with whom the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity was , as it were , at war .

		Between this time and the present , with its comparatively mild town and gown rows , many changes have occurred .

		The Uni - versity has become a Federation of Colleges , each a little polity in itself , each cherishing its own tra - ditions and affiliations .

		The description of these in detail forms the principal subject-matter of Pro- fessor
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's little volume .

		Art and its influence on civilization .

		Prof.
W. H. Goodyear	PERSON	's treatise on '' Roman and Mediaeval Art '' -LRB- Flood & Vincent -RRB- deals with the subject not so much in its technical aspects as with the history of art in its relations to civilization .

		Part L , occupy - ing about a third of the volume , treats of Roman art from prehistoric times to its decadence in the third and fourth centuries after Christ .

		The his - tory of mediaeval art of course covers a longer pe - riod and extends over a wider area of country .

		It terminated when mediaeval thought and culture , and consequently mediaeval art , were displaced by the movement known as the Renaissance .

		One hun - dred and fifty fine illustrations add greatly to the value of the volume , and a good index aids one to turn readily to any special subject among the many and varied branches of art discussed .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Charles Lewis Tupper	PERSON	, of the
Indian Civil Serv	ORGANIZATION	- ice , has prepared an exhaustive historical and political study of '' Our Indian Protectorate '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The work has little excellence of a literary sort , but great value as a storehouse of facts and first-hand observations .

		To the important series of brief biographies entitled '' Rulers of

Macmillau	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- two additions have been made .

		One of them , by Mr.

		In connection with this group of books should be mentioned Mr.

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a graphic narrative from the pen of a participant not in the Mutiny but in the dramatic events which that uprising added to history .

		No name in any part of
India	LOCATION	, '' we are told , '' is so familiar or held in such veneration as that of

		Both of these '' World Classics '' are illustrated , bound in cloth , and neatly boxed .

		We may at the same time mention the pretty paper-covered reprints -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' and
M. Hale	PERSON	` vy 's `` The Abbe '' Constantin , '' the former with a preface by Mrs.
Ritchie	PERSON	, the latter with
Madame Lemaire	ORGANIZATION	's charming illustrations . ''

		The
South Sea Islanders	LOCATION	and the
Queensland	LOCATION	Labour Trade '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is further described as '' a record of voyages and experiences in the
Western Pacific	LOCATION
from 1875	DATE	to
1891	DATE	. ''

		It is the work of Mr.
William T. Wawn	PERSON	, '' Master Mariner . ''

		Mr.
Wawn	PERSON	was engaged during all these years as an importer of Kanaka labor into
Queensland	LOCATION	, and his book , which is little more than a roughly edited '' log , '' is the record of a man who knows his subject .

		The book is a large octavo , with many illustrations .

		The biography of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	prepared by Mr.
James Dykes Campbell	PERSON	for the recent complete edition of Col - eridge 's poetical works , and already mentioned by us in that connection , has been published as an independent volume -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , expanded to portly dimensions by the use of thick paper and larger type .

		This work took rank from the start as the authoritative biography of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, and is not likely to be improved upon .

		There are , however , a few revisions in the present issue , although it gives substantially the text printed with the poems .

		Volume XXXVIII .

		of the Dictionary of National Biography '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- extends from
Milman	PERSON	-LRB- Sir
Francis	PERSON	preceding
Henry Hart	PERSON	-RRB- to More -LRB- ending , not with the
Thomases	PERSON	, but the
Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The
Moores	PERSON	and Mores get nearly a fourth of the volume .


William Minto	PERSON	died just in time to get in .

		The most important of the articles is the ''
Milton	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, filling over sixteen pages , an unusual but certainly not undeserved allowance of space .

		Mr.
Henry Bradley	PERSON	, who undertook to edit the let - ters E , F , G , and H , for the '' New English Dictionary '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has completed his work upon the first of these four letters , and the last instalment of the '' Dic - tionary , '' just published , begins with `` Everybody '' and ends with '' Ezod , '' an obsolete variant of ''
Izzard	PERSON	, '' otherwise '' Z. '' When Dr.
Murray	PERSON	shall have finished his list of '' words that begin with a D , '' they will form , together with the Es , the third of the portly quartos in which the work takes its final shape .

		The fourth instalment of the '' Ariel ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, now published -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , presents a second group of seven comedies , including '' The Two Gentlemen of Ve - rona , '' '' The Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	, '' '' The Comedy of Errors , '' '' Love 's Labour 's Lost , '' '' Measure for Measure , '' '' Taming of the Shrew , '' and All 's Well that Ends Well . ''

		Each play is prettily printed in a simple volume , and provided with outline illustrations .

		An early completion of the edition may be expected .

		278 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	,
NEW YORK	LOCATION	TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
April S3	ORGANIZATION	,
1894	DATE	.

		Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	's thoughtful article on `` Results of the Copyright Law , '' in the
January	DATE	'' Forum , '' was an excellent summing up of the situa - tion as developed since the passage of the Copyright Act of
March 4 , 1891	DATE	.

		To my mind , his opinion that in spite of the law 's defects '' it would be unwise at this time to make any effort to secure amendments '' is the correct one .

		At the same time , the fact that a petition has been brought into the German Parliament calling for the abrogation of the copyright agreement between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, and that this petition has been approved by the committee having it in charge , gives a serious turn to the copyright situation .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	in his article noted that '' it is almost impos - sible for a French or German author to arrange to issue his book in this country -LRB- either in the original or in a translation -RRB- simultaneously with the publication abroad .

		The resetting in the original language , for such limited sale as could be looked for here , would be unduly ex - pensive , while time is required for the preparation of a satisfactory translation . ''

		The great trouble , Mr. Put - nam tells me , is that to secure copyright in a work in a foreign language , it must be re-set here in the original language .

		The copyright of a translation protects that translation only , and if the book is not also published in the original , anyone is at liberty to issue a new trans - lation .

		This state of affairs was brought about by the eagerness of the typographical unions to grasp every advantage .

		The
French Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	made this discovery some time ago , and now that
Germany	LOCATION	threat - ens to take the matter up , the result of the immense amount of labor performed by our copyright leagues is somewhat discouraging .

		After all , I presume that our copyright relations with
Great Britain	LOCATION	are the chief issue at stake , and these are progressing in a fairly sat - isfactory manner at present .

		It is curious to observe how closely the success of books by new English authors is watched by the American reprinters .

		Of course , the successful English author 's second book at once finds an authorized publisher in the
United States	LOCATION	, and is copy - righted ; but the way every new English success is pi - rated in this country shows plainly the need of a time clause in the Copyright Act as long as the printing clause remains .

		Another vexatious copyright question has been raised in a recent interview with Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	,
Librarian of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have not the slightest doubt that ninety in a hundred of those interested will be immensely sur - prised to learn from that interview that in the
United States	LOCATION	the name or title of a book is not protected by copyright . ''

		The law is , '' said Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	, '' that the substance , the literary contents , of a book or publica - tion may be protected by copyright , but not the name not the title . ''

		The filing of title-pages of books in this country , which is required by law , is not , then , for purposes of protection , but for identification merely .

		This seems to be a great injustice , and I asked Mr.
Put	PERSON	- nam if a change in this respect were not needed when the Copyright Act is next amended .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	as - sented , and gave me some interesting information as to the present condition of English copyright law on this point , and as to certain proposed changes .

		In
England	LOCATION	, Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	said , the law as to book titles goes as far in the contrary direction as does ours , in that it permits anyone to copyright all the titles he can think of with or without any real intention to use them for actual books .

		This copyright in a title or titles lasts for the full English term of forty-two years , or seven years after the copyrighter 's death .

		In many cases , au - thors of books have had to pay such copyrighters to relinquish titles on which they unluckily had stum - bled .

		Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	thinks that authors should be at liberty to copyright the titles of their proposed books , but that such copyright should be completed by the publication of the book within a reasonable period -LRB- six months or a year -RRB- , and that failing of this the copyright should become void .

		Also he thinks that copyright in a title should lapse if the book which it represents is out of print for a long period .

		The proposed new En - glish law , introduced by Lord
Monkswell	PERSON	in the present parliament , and still pending , covers these points very fully .

		Copyright in a title must be perfected by pub - lication of the book within six months , and is lost in the case of books which remain out of print over two years .

		Pleasant news comes from the society of Provencal poets known as the '' Fe ` librige . ''

		M. Fe `` lix Gras is now '' capovlie , '' or president of the society , and will without doubt be reflected at the annual meeting to be held at
Nimes	ORGANIZATION	on the twenty-ninth of
April	DATE	.

		The members are making preparations to take their share in the '' floral games '' this
summer	DATE	at
Toulouse	LOCATION	, which were instituted by the troubadours in the fourteenth century , and have never ceased since then .

		The games are open compe - titions in poetry and prose , and the prizes , it will be re - membered , are gold and silver flowers , or for the first prize a natural flower presented with a kiss to the suc - cessful competitor by some damsel of the ancient aris - tocracy .

		The members of the '' Fe ` librige '' also celebrate their own annual feast in
August	DATE	, on the day of their patron saint , Ste.
Estelle	PERSON	.

		This year it will take place at
Avignon	LOCATION	, and will be distinguished by the dedication of monuments to
Roumanilles	LOCATION	, the founder of the Pro- venc.al literary movement , and to
Aubanel	PERSON	, who have recently died . ''

		Les Cigalieres , '' the
Paris	LOCATION	chapter of the Fe ` librige , will come down the Rhone on a boat from
Lyons	PERSON	to take part in the ceremonies , and there will be performances of the Antigone and Edipus in the old Roman theatre at Orange , by the Come ` die Franchise com P an y -
ARTHUR STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		TjITERARY NOTES AND MISCELLANY .

		Lord Macaulay 's '' Journal '' is to be published in full sometime during the year .

		The life of the late Sir

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	will publish a new volume of poems in the autumn .

		It is now nine years since his last volume , '' Firdausi in Exile , '' appeared .

		We learn from an English exchange that Mr.
Theo	PERSON	- dore
Watts	PERSON	has at last decided to publish a volume of poems , which will be printed at the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Goethe-Jahrbuch '' for

		The trustees of
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	have announced the offer for
1894	DATE	for the Fletcher prize of
$ 500	MONEY	for the best essay calculated to counteract the present ten - dency to a '' Fatal Conformity to the World . ''

		The fol - lowing subjects are assigned , with the date at which each essay is to be forwarded : -LRB- 1 -RRB- '' In what ways ought the conception of personal life and duty to be modified ? ''


December 31 , 1894	DATE	.

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- '' Should any restrictions , le - gal or moral , be placed upon the accumulation of wealth ? ''

December 31 , 1898	DATE	.

		These subjects may be treated singly or in course .

		No essay is to exceed 250 pages of 270 words each .

		A circular containing fur - ther particulars will be forwarded to those who apply to President
William Jewett Tucker	PERSON	, of
Dartmouth Col	ORGANIZATION	- Few men have been such '' all around '' scholars as the late
William Robertson Smith	PERSON	.

		We get from `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' this glimpse of his manifold acquire - ments : `` He knew many arts and sciences , few men have ever been privileged to know so many ; but he made each of them , as it were , a part of his existence , and was a specialist in each .

		Apart from the two sub - jects which have made him famous , he was a well-read mathematician , and , in fact , held a mathematical chair for a time at Aberdeen as deputy to the professor .

		He was a profound student of most branches of law , En - glish and foreign .

		He understood the more abstruse branches of anatomy , especially that relating to the move - ments and functions of the eye .

		He was a good theo - retical astronomer .

		He might easily have posed as an eminent naturalist .

		He was both a botanist and a gar - dener an unusual combination .

		He had a fine ear for music , and a real knowledge of it .

		He was an admir - able architectural critic , with a strong leaning towards Gothic .

		He was a great numismatist , so great , and his collections so judiciously made , that we must hope his gold coins , at least , will now be acquired by the Uni - versity or some other public body . ''

		LORD
BOWEN	PERSON	'S TRANSLATION OF VIRGIL .

		The late Lord
Bowen	PERSON	was best known to literature as a translator of Virgil . ''

		The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' has this to say of his work : `` The lay reader will attach greater interest to the work in which in intervals of the leisure of which his life now allowed Lord
Bowen	PERSON	indulged alike his taste for intellectual exertion and his passionate admiration of the great master of Latin poetry .

		The task had for him a fascination which not all his consciousness of its difficulty enabled him to re - sist .

		He was travelling , as he described himself , along a road < strewn with the bleaching bones of unfortunate pilgrims who had preceded him . '

		They < had perished in the wilderness . '

		No one had satisfied the require - ments of this unachievable performance .

		In
Dryden	PERSON	1 the silver trumpet has disappeared , and a manly strain is breathed through bronze . '

		In Conington ' the sweet and solemn majesty of the ancient form has wholly dis - appeared . '

		The task thus shown to be difficult Lord
Bowen	PERSON	proceeded , with characteristic craving for per - fection , to surround by conditions which rendered it ob - viously impossible .

		The English rendering of
Virgil	PERSON	must , if it is to be worth anything , be an English poem ; the English poem must be a translation , not a mere paraphrase ; and , as if these conditions were not suffi - cient to discourage endeavor , the poem must be made to rhyme , to indulge the English ear , and must be not only literally but lineally translated , in order to pre - serve the integrity of the famous Virgilian lines , which are the common coinage of civilized mankind .

		How far towards the accomplishment of such a feat it was Lord
Bowen	PERSON	's good fortune to advance we care not now to estimate .

		Suffice it that on every page are to be found the same exquisiteness , the same patient indus - try , the same conscientious efforts at completeness that characterized every phase of Lord
Bowen	PERSON	's work . ''

		WHY RENAN WAS NOT CONVINCED .

		M.
Jules Simon	PERSON	, contributing some reminiscences of Renan to the '' Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' tells how the latter , in his seminary days ; came to the author for advice . ''

		He said that he came to see me because I was a Breton and a professor of philosophy .

		He wanted , he said , to ask my advice .

		His first word explained the situation to me . '

		I am , ' he said , ' a pupil at
Saint-Sulpice	ORGANIZATION	.

		I must leave the seminary and put off this gown . ' ''

		This was not the first confession of the sort that had been made to me .

		But the others had spoken to me as philosophers , about the conditions of certainty , and the impossibility of reconciling miracles with rational prin - ciples .

		M. Renan talked nothing but philology . ''

		You know , ' he said , ' how inaccurate is the version of Saint
Jerome	PERSON	, and the advantage derived by the apologists from the famous phrase . '

		He flattered me .

		The most remarkable thing about me is my pro- found ignorance .

		I bemoan and blush for it , but have never been able to make up for the defects of early edu - cation .

		I warned him of this , and begged him to enter into all the details necessary to explain the situation . ''

		It seems that Abbe '' Le
Hir	ORGANIZATION	had quoted the phrase of Saint
Jerome	PERSON	, and had deduced from it , in a luminous commentary , the authenticity of Revelation , with all the ensuing consequences . ''

		< It was evident to me , ' said
M. Renan	PERSON	, ' that Abbe * Le
Hir	PERSON	did not know Hebrew , which was sad in a pro- fessor of exegesis . '

		I nodded in assent . '

		Although much agitated , ' my visitor went on , I felt bound to warn him of his misunderstanding .

		I rose , bowed ac - 280 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, cording to custom , and pronounced the usual formula : Liceat loqui , pater reverendissime .

		Do veniam , he kindly said .

		I then set forth that his argument was very strong , but that it rested upon the text of Saint
Jerome	PERSON	, which embodied a contradiction . ''

		You would be right , '' I said to him , '' if Saint
Jerome	PERSON	had faithfully translated the Hebrew .

		But here is the Hebrew text , which says the exact contrary , hence it follows that you are wrong . '' ' '

		And what did Abbe '' Le
Hir	ORGANIZATION	say ? '

		I exclaimed , much interested by this glimpse at the seminary household . '

		He reflected for some time , ' said
M. Renan	PERSON	, ' then he gently addressed to me these very words : '' Monsieur 1 ' abbe '' , you will recite the seven psalms of penitence on your knees before the holy sacrament . '' ' '

		And you , ' I said to him , ' what did you reply ? '

		I replied what is replied in such a case : Gratias ago quam maximas , pater dilectissime . '

		And you did your penance ? ' '

		I did it . '

		Then he delivered a panegyric upon Abbe ' Le
Hir	ORGANIZATION	, which he concluded with these words : ' But he did not know Hebrew . ' '' '

		And then ? '

		I asked . '

		I returned to the charge , ' said
Renan	PERSON	, and only got the same answer .

		But I can ' t spend my life in reciting the psalms of penitence . ' ''

		I smiled .

		He mused .

		But I did not perceive the poignant anxiety of a Christian who is about to lose his faith .

		I saw rather a philosopher who , taking a step in the direction of truth , discovers new horizons .

		I was at once much struck by the situation .

		I said to myself that this was no passionate , self-tormented soul like Lamennais ; that he lived upon curiosity , calm , resolute , smiling . ''

		.

		INSIDE VIEW OF AN EGYPTIAN UNIVERSITY .

		A correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' gives the following interesting particulars about the
University of Cairo	ORGANIZATION	: `` The scene presented by the uni - versity when teacher ^ and pupils are absorbed in their tasks is strange indeed .

		The various classes are com - posed of singularly incongruous elements , for childhood and old age , beardless youths and mature men , sit side by side and learn and recite the same lesson , all sway - ing to and fro as incessantly as the pendulum of a clock .

		These motions are sometimes of a wild and convulsive character , painful to witness , and bear a strong resem - blance to the ecstatic contortions and twitchings of the dervishes .

		The majority of the scholars , too , whether old or young , are not pleasing to look upon , for the Egyptians are a far less handsome and less cleanly race than the other Arabs of northern
Africa	LOCATION	, nor are their costumes nearly as picturesque .

		Each class consists of about a dozen members , who form a circle around the sheikh or pro- fessor , by whom they are initiated into the mysteries of the alphabet or made acquainted with a page of the Koran , as the case may be .

		The voices are harsh and discordant , so that a lesson in progress sounds like a dispute .

		The teacher tests the knowledge of the pupils by questions , and they in turn question him . ''

		The curriculum of the university is thus described : '' Chemistry , astronomy , astrology , and the higher mathematics , once considered indispensable acquire - ments for a scholar , have for many centuries been laid aside , and importance is attached only to the study of the
Koran	LOCATION	, including a knowledge of rhetoric and logic .

		This rote-like system of education naturally represses all originality of thought .

		Besides the
Koran	LOCATION	, a few primers and readers are in use as text-books , and slates and blackboards are employed as in other schools .

		Even less reading than writing is taught , a certain fa - cility in learning by heart alone being considered im - perative .

		The study of grammar begins the regular academic course ; then follows a course in religion , and one in the science of law . ''

		The account is brought to a conclusion as follows : '' There are three grades of sheikhs , the last being sel - dom attained .

		Up to the year
1871	DATE	any student who had committed the whole of a book to memory was dignified with the title of sheikh , and enjoyed the priv - ilege , accorded to the instructors only , of leaning against a pillar .

		Since that time a formal examination has been required , and six sheikhs belonging to different sects judge of the fitness of the competitors for the position .

		The largest attendance at the university was in
1876	DATE	, when the scholars numbered over eleven thousand and the professors three hundred and twenty-five ; yet only one year later the number of pupils had decreased by more than three thousand , and that of the sheikhs by nearly a hundred .

		This extraordinary decline - a de - cline still continuing is to be ascribed to the ravages of war among the Mohammedans , and to the civilizing influence brought to bear upon the Egyptians by the English government , which is doing so much for their enlightenment . ''

		THE DIAL 287
ROGER WILLIAMS	PERSON	, K ; : THE PIONEER OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY .

		; '' ' . ''

		: * '' '' '' By
OSCAR S. STRAUS	PERSON	, Author of `` The Origin of the
Republican Form of Government	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		biographies of
Roger Williams	PERSON	have been written , most of which are now out of print .

		Since the J ^ publication of these earlier works much valuable additional information concerning the pioneer of religious liberty in
America	LOCATION	has come to light .

		Mr.
Straus	PERSON	, the author of the present biography , has given careful study to the subject of
Roger Williams	PERSON	and his work .

		He has searched anew the records of the
Charter House	ORGANIZATION	, where
Williams	ORGANIZATION	attended school as a pensioner , and also the records of
Pembroke College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among other things he has succeeded in determining the year of
Williams	ORGANIZATION	's birth , a matter which has long been the subject of contro - versy among genealogists and historians of
New England	LOCATION	.


Roger Williams	PERSON	is one of the most unique and picturesque characters in our history .

		His life was one long battle for religious liberty .

		The hostilities and prejudices he encountered have such vitality that they have come down by tradition and inheritance to our times .

		The author of this biography has endeavored to bring out the truth without fear or favor , and to present an impartial record of the character and work of this remarkable man , who was in the fullest sense the pioneer of religious liberty .

		A BOOK FOR BOYS AND GIRLS BY RUDYARD KIPLING .

		THE JUNGLE BOOK .

		A perfect treasury of delight for young folks and old folks too .

		No one but the author of '' Plain Tales from the Hills , '' '' Soldiers Three , '' etc. , could have written the fascinating stories that are contained in this volume stories of the Indian jungle , of
Kala Nag	PERSON	, the elephant ;
Shere Khan	PERSON	, the tiger ; and old
Baloo	LOCATION	, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle ; of
Bagheera	LOCATION	, the black panther ; and of Kaa , the python , whose blow is like the blow of a steam-hammer .

		Readers of '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' will remember the stories of '' Rikki-Tikki-Tavi , '' '' Too - mai of the Elephants , '' ''
Mowgli 's Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' Tiger , Tiger , '' which originally appeared in that magazine and attracted wide attention .

		These stories which the
New York	LOCATION	'' Christian Advocate '' has described as '' unique in literature and perfectly delightful in spirit '' are published in the present volume , with additional illustrations , and to them are added '' Kaa 's Hunting , '' `` The White Seal , '' and `` Her Majesty 's Servants . ''

		It is safe to predict that '' The Jungle Book '' will become a classic in children 's literature a book the youngsters will clamor for even after they know all the stories by heart .

Beardsley	PERSON	has managed to appeal to artists and what more could he wish ? ''

Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	for the purpose of considering the important sub - ject of city school organization .

		This Com - mittee , consisting for the most part of school superintendents , has already held a number of meetings , and has planned its work in a man - ner at once practical and exhaustive .

		It will be at least a year before the conclusions of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	can be fully formulated , but an out - line of the work to be undertaken has already been published , and proves so suggestive that we can not refrain from a few comments .

		In the first place , the composition of the
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	commands respect , in - cluding , as it does , many educators of the high - est professional standing .

		The names of Dr.
W. T. Harris	PERSON	, Mr.
W. H. Maxwell	PERSON	, Mr.
A. S. Draper	PERSON	, Mr.
A. G. Lane	PERSON	, Mr.
A. B. Poland	PERSON	, and Mr.
H. S. Tarbell	PERSON	are a sufficient guaran - tee of the scholarship and the experience that will be brought to the deliberations of this body .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	has been divided into three subcommittees , having for their respect - ive subjects , city school systems , the training of teachers , and the correlation of studies .

		This corresponds with an eminently wise and practical classification of the work to be done .

		Finally , a carefully-considered list of questions has been prepared for each of the sub-commit - tees , and will form the basis of the discussion .

		Expert opinions upon these questions will be collected by the members of the subcommittees ; each member will report to his chairman ; and each chairman will report to the full Commit - tee of Fifteen , which is to meet in
November	DATE	.

		This admirable plan of work should result in bringing together a body of competent opinion sufficiently weighty to force itself , in its main lines , upon the acceptance of educational au - thorities throughout the country .

		We have space to call attention to only a few of the questions offered for discussion , but it is easy , for our present purpose , to distin - guish between questions of broad and theoret - ical interest and those of a more technical char - 292 -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, acter .

		In the consideration of the former , there is an a priori element -LRB- or at least an ele - ment based upon inductions made in a wider than the strictly educational field -RRB- to be taken into account ; the latter are mostly to be de - cided by an appeal to educational experience alone .

		Should the members of a board of ed - ucation be elected or appointed ?

		To what ex - tent should teachers study psychology ?

		What should be the purpose of attempting a close correlation of studies ?

		are questions of the first class .

		Of how many members should a board of education consist ?

		At how early an age should young men and women be allowed to teach ?

		What should be the length of recita - tion periods ?

		are questions of the second class .

		We hope that the committee will recognize this distinction , and , with the first class of ques - tions , collect their opinions largely from work - ers in extra-educational fields .

		To the subcommittee on city school systems a highly important series of questions is as - signed .

		They deal with the organization of the executive machinery of education , the dis - tribution of powers among boards , superintend - ents , and teachers , and many cognate topics .

		A committee made up of superintendents will probably seek to magnify the importance of the function of superintendence , at the expense of the board of education and the staff of instruc - tion .

		They will be justified in the one attempt , but hardly in the other .

		Whether a board of education be constituted by election or appoint - ment -LRB- and we look for a strong consensus of opinion in favor of the latter method -RRB- , it is not likely to prove competent to direct the profes - sional work of instruction .

		A wise board will delegate nearly the whole of its nominally ab - solute powers to the educators directly in charge of the school system , and restrict itself to the function of business management .

		The relation of superintendent to instruct - ors , on the other hand , is not so easily to be defined .

		The writer whose recent criticism of our public schools has attracted more attention than any other , and whose opinion certainly deserves consideration , loudly proclaims that more superintendence is the one thing needful for the well-being of the body educational .

		But there is something better than superin - tendence , and that is a teaching force which does not need superintendence .

		And even with the teaching bodies that we now have , there is a good deal of superintendence that does more harm than good .

		The sort of person who gets to be superintendent of schools in many of our counties or smaller cities is not a person to whom we may point with pride .

		Even in our great cities , the superintendent is too likely to fall a victim to the mania for mechanical uni - formity , whereupon dull routine displaces vital teaching in the schools that are unfortunate enough to be subject to his rule .

		A case in point is offered by the question , By whom should text-books be selected ?

		which is among those proposed for this subcommittee .

		To our mind , the answer is clear enough .

		Subject to certain limitations of cost and scope , they should be selected by those who are to use them .

		Nothing stands in the way of this natural and rational answer but the bugbear of uniformity , or the notion that teachers are incompetent to select their tools -LRB- to which objection the reply is obvious -RRB- , or some utterly trivial talk about the cost of buying new books when there are old ones in the family .

		As if the education of every child , upon which we lavish money so freely in other directions , were not worth the paltry additional price of a few books .

		The questions proposed to the subcommittee on the training of teachers cover such matters as the requirements of scholarship , the accept - ance of successful school work in lieu of exam - ination , the scope of the training-school , and the value of such subjects as psychology and the history of education .

		While we do not dis - pute the advantages of normal school work in many cases , we do not think it should be treated as an indispensable requirement .

		After all , the practice of teaching is not a subject to be taught very effectively ; people learn to teach by actual experience , and hardly in any other way .

		The teacher should doubtless know some - thing of the history of education , but this knowl - edge is best acquired by one who is really doing educational work , and its previous acquisition , from books and lectures , is of questionable value .

		As for psychology , it would be difficult to overrate the importance of this subject , but the sort of stuff that passes for psychology in too many of our normal schools is about as use - less as anything that could be devised .

		We be - lieve emphatically in admitting young people to the work of teaching upon their school records rather than upon examination , but the records must be intelligently made and used as a basis for judgment .

		Those who have had actual charge of a young woman 's education , who have come into daily contact with her for years , and studied the development of her mind and character , know very well whether or not she is a fit person to entrust with the delicate work of teaching chil -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 293 dren ; no examination , however well-planned and comprehensive , can possibly furnish so trust - worthy an estimate as may be had from her teachers , in her last year or two of school work .

		This leads us to a point of fundamental im - portance , one not expressly suggested by the questions proposed .

		Fitness to teach is too fre - quently regarded as a matter of scholarship alone , to be determined by examination or re - citation records .

		But even scholarship is less important than character , and what sort of ex - amination can be suggested as a test of moral fitness ?

		In some of our city school systems lit - tle attention , or none whatever , is paid to char - acter ; that is , no systematic inquiry is made into the spirit in which the student has done her school work , into her application , her trust - worthiness , her moral habit , her general serious - ness of aim .

		No examination and no scholar - ship record sheds other than a weak reflected light upon these things , and thus can furnish no real test of fitness in the highest sense .

		In cities where teachers of the primary and gram - mar grades are mainly furnished by the grad - uating classes of the high and normal schools , it ought to be made a sine qua non that the applicant for a position should have a certif - icate of character from those who have taught her during the closing year , or possibly two years , of her course .

		In this matter , an abso - lute veto should be placed in the hands of the instructors .

		We hope that the
Committee of Fifteen	ORGANIZATION	will add this to their list of subjects , and pronounce upon it in no uncertain tones .

		We can think of no single reform that would do more for our city school systems than a gen - eral recognition and application of the princi - ple above enunciated .

		The difficulty under - lying the whole school problem is the difficulty of getting good teachers ; defective scholarship and unfit character are the twin roots of the dif - iiculty , and the reform that we now urge would strike most effectively at one of these roots .

		The subcommittee on correlation of studies is occupied mainly with questions of a techni - cal character , such as may safely be left to the expert judgment of its members .

		Some of the questions have already been discussed by the
Committee of Ten	ORGANIZATION	; others of them offer new problems for solution .

		To determine the dis - tinct pedagogical value of the several studies , and to establish the sequence of topics upon a rational basis , appear to be the chief tasks set before this subcommittee .

		The conclusions reached will cause much discussion , for the problems are among the deepest that confront scientific pedagogy .

		In conclusion , we must express our great satisfaction at the new evi - dence offered by the constitution of the Com - mittee of Fifteen that the organization of Amer - ican education is rapidly advancing , in spite of the necessary and permanent decentralization imposed by our political system , and that by the sort of concerted action of which the Com - mittees of Ten and Fifteen offer types , our edu - cational system seems likely soon to emerge from the haphazard stage , soon to enter upon a more scientific , and hence a more fruitful , phase of its development .

		JOSEPH
KIRKLAND	PERSON	.

		The author of '' Zury '' and The McVeys '' died in
Chicago	LOCATION	the morning of
April 29	DATE	, at the age of sixty-four .

		Among men of letters having their homes in this city , no one was more widely known than
Major Kirkland	LOCATION	, or more deserving of his reputa - tion .

		That reputation was acquired late in life , and based mainly upon three novels -LRB- '' The Captain of Company K '' in addition to the two above named -RRB- which take a high rank among American works of realistic fiction .

		Their author was an enthusiastic admirer of the work of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, and it was upon the lines laid down -LRB- or , at least , chiefly represented in contemporary fiction -RRB- by that novel - ist that his indubitable success was achieved .

		In addition to the three novels named above , Major
Kirkland	PERSON	published `` A History of the
Chicago	LOCATION	Massacre of
1812	DATE	, '' and told '' The Story of Chi - cago '' in a large volume , the most interesting treat - ment of the subject that has ever been made .

		He also contributed to the magazines , and was for a time literary editor of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune . ''

		He was one of the organizers of the
Twentieth Century Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and was its first president , hold - ing the office for two years .

		He was prominent in the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	and the
Chicago	LOCATION	Lit - erary Club .

		He was also one of the few Western members of the
Authors Club	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		He came of an intellectual ancestry , his father having been a professor in
Hamilton College	LOCATION	, and his mother a writer of some note in her day .

		He was born at
Geneva	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, in
1830	DATE	, and came to
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1856	DATE	.

		At the outbreak of the Civil War he en - listed in the
Twelfth Illinois Infantry	ORGANIZATION	, became suc - cessively lieutenant , captain , and major , and was for a time attached to the staff of
General McClel	ORGANIZATION	- lan .

		He was in the battles of Rich Mountain ,
Lau	PERSON	- rel Hill ,
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, and
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	, and at the siege of
Yorktown	LOCATION	.

		He practised law in
Chi	LOCATION	- cago from
1880	DATE	to

		He will be sincerely mourned by an exceptionally wide circle of friends and associates .

		294 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, ENGLISH AT
LAFAYETTE	LOCATION	COLLEGE * It is thought to be somewhat of a specialty in the
Lafayette	LOCATION	teaching of English , that the profes - sors in all departments take part in it .

		The theory is that the main cause of mistakes in speaking and writing English is ignorance of the meaning of words .

		Our grammar is simple , but we catch up our words without thought , and utter them again in the same way .

		On the athletic field we do not know walking from running , nor at the banquet pie from pudding .

		When we undertake to talk about any scientific subject , the expert detects us instantly ; we call whales fishes , mix up sewage and sewerage , and use force , energy , and power as if they were all the same .

		An earnest attempt is made at
Lafayette	LOCATION	to train the students in each department to write on sub - jects connected with it in the words and phrases current among experts .

		The professors in each de - partment are , of course , authorities .

		Every stu - dent is required to hand in two papers a term ; there are three terms in the college year .

		The professors give out subjects which demand research and de - scription in their own departments , and much time is spent by many of them in inculcating not only clear-cut meaning , but also the etymology of scien - tific terms .

		They find the sesquipedalia of the sci - ences can not be held in memory with precision un - less their elements are distinctly perceived .

		This leads to some knowledge of scientific philology , and of accurate spelling .

		The students in the chemical laboratory under Professor
Hart	PERSON	, the president of the
Chemical Section of the American Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	, use the rules of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	for spelling and pronunciation ; they know when to write the termination - in , and when - me ; they are not to be caught blundering with chlorin or quinin , hydrid or oxid , or sulfur .

		The amended spellings recommended by the joint action of the English and
American Philological Societies	ORGANIZATION	and given in the
Century Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	are accepted as correct in college papers , as well as the common spellings in
Webster	PERSON	and
Worcester	LOCATION	.

		Over and above all this is the study of English in literature .

		We find the statement in the his - tories of
Lafayette	LOCATION	that the college had '' European recognition '' for its study of English before the present historical and literary courses were known at other colleges .

		The
Lafayette	LOCATION	courses were established with the maxim that English should * This article is the eighth of an extended series on the Teaching of English at

		be studied like Greek . ''

		A special professorship was established coordinate with the Greek and Latin professorships , with the arrangement emphasized that the professor was not to have the rhetoric , and general theme-writing , and other the like du - ties , but was to handle English classic authors with his classes , study
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	PERSON	r after the same methods as Homer and Demos - thenes .

		This was a pretty precise description fifty years ago .

		Now there are many ways of study - ing Greek , and all of them often scamped in our universities .

		It meant then thorough work .

		Teach - ers were fond of repeating after Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	of Rugby , '' What a treat it would be to teach Shake - speare to a good class of young Greeks in regener - ate
Athens	LOCATION	; to dwell upon him line by line and word by word , and so to get all his pictures and thoughts leisurely into one 's mind , till I verily think one would , after a time , almost give out light in the dark , after having been steeped , as it were , in such an atmosphere of brilliance . ''

		The
Lafayette	LOCATION	courses are still constant to this central idea .

		They are primarily devoted to the study of the language as it is found in masterpieces of literature , the immediate aim being the interpre - tation of these masterpieces , the rethinking of the thoughts of master minds , and storing the memory with their words .

		Four hours a week during two terms , Junior year , are spent with a professor in recitations ; two additional hours are allotted to the preparation for each recitation .

		Three of the reci - tation hours each week are occupied in the
Arnold	LOCATION	fashion , dwelling line by line and word by word upon worthy passages .

		In a play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, for example , and one term is regularly devoted to a play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, a scene , a short scene , may be given out for a morning 's study .

		A consider - able part of it will be read rapidly , or the gist of it given in a few words , and most of the hour will be devoted to a few lines selected as worthy of thor - ough study .

		Any obsolete words or phrases , or singular constructions , will be explained ; but the secret of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's power is not to be found in these .

		The words which are bearers of special meaning or feeling are usually familiar words .

		In searching for their power and charm , the student will trace them through all the places where Shake - speare uses them , using the Concordance to bring them all together .

		He will use the Historical dic - tionary to learn what associations had gathered around them in the earlier ages , beginning some - times in
Beowulf	LOCATION	, and accumulating as they pass to
Alfred	PERSON	, to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, to
Tyndale	ORGANIZATION	, to
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and are used by each with some happy turn or in some mu - sical rhythm .

		He will often find that the peculiar meaning in Shakespeare begins with him , and then it will be pleasant to trace it in later authors , re - peated in quotation or allusion until it becomes per - haps the most familiar meaning .

		All the resources of philology , the comparative study of languages and literatures , rhetoric and oratory , prosody and rhythmic art , psychology , and biography , may be
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 drawn upon , and all available pedagogical arts used to lead the student livelily to rethink the thought and perceive and feel and remember the beauty of the language .

		In this way students come to re - joice in these noble passages , and remember them forever .

		They are thus provided with the very words to guide their higher thought , and with forms of graceful speech which prompt them to easy utter - ances of courtesy and affection and devotion .

		Three of the four hours a week with the professor are used in this way ; the fourth is given to a kind of symposium or seminar .

		Some topic of research belonging to the subject is given out for an essay , which all the class are required to hand in .

		The hour is spent in the reading of essays and criticism of them , and further discussion of the topic car - ried on by the class under the prompting and guid - ance of the professor .

		One such hour may be given to the life and environment of the author ; another to the plot of the play , if one of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays is to be studied ; others to critical discussion of par - ticular scenes as wholes and as proper parts of the play ; others to notable characters in the play .

		There may be philological papers on the language of the play and of the poet ; papers on the origin - ality of the work , how much of it is Shakespeare ; reports of the criticism of particular great critics ; outlines of other related works .

		We used to have lively work of research , frequent peering into all corners of the library , and rejoicing in exploiting fresh mines of fact ; but bibliographic indexing is now so copious ,
Poole	PERSON	's Indexes in the van , and the librarians are so at the service of everybody , and omniscient , that research begins and ends too often with asking the librarian to hand over every - thing there is on the topic , and point out the pages .

		And the essays are apt to show plainly enough that they were written with the books open before the writers , as
Shakespeare had North	ORGANIZATION	's Plutarch when he wrote
Julius Caesar	PERSON	.

		The essays can hardly claim the credit of research , but often have merits which students rank higher than research , and make good material for collisions of memory and wit com - bats at the symposia .

		All this is required work .

		For
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	there is also a prize examination open to all who have fin - ished the required work .

		This is general , covering his life , character , all his works , from any points of view which the examiners may choose at the exam - ination .

		The professor is content with questions which call for direct knowledge of the works and reflection upon them ; such as naming plays and asking for a description of them , and asking which is the best and why ; when they were written and the evidence for the dates ; naming persons and asking for their characters and action ; giving quo - tations and asking where they are found , and the like simplicities ; but examining committees are apt to confront the student with the profoundest ques - tions in psychology and history which the Germans have evolved .

		The winning of this prize is esteemed one of the highest college honors .

		There are two divisions of the students who do not take courses in Greek and Latin .

		These take courses of English , German , and French , which are so taught as to supply similar linguistic training to that obtained from the Latin and Greek .

		They study term by term some English classic just as the others do their Latin classic , giving it four reci - .

		tatioii hours a week .

		Authors commonly selected are
Bunyan	PERSON	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		With a gen - eral method such as has been spoken of in connec - tion with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, philological topics are taken up in progressive order , term after term , such as to prepare these students to unite with students of Latin and Greek in the second term of the Junior year , and go on with the philological study of En - glish .

		Four lessons a week in Anglo-Saxon for two terms are required of all students except tech - nicals .

		They are given near the end of the lin - guistic courses required in college when the students have studied their German , French ,
Latin	LOCATION	,
Greek	LOCATION	, nearly to their completion .

		The
West Saxon	LOCATION	as it appears in the principal literary works is presented as a classical language , and the whole time is de - voted to it as to a sister speech of classical Latin .

		It is studied , we say , like Greek .

		The class begin to read at once extracts from the Gospels .

		They also learn the grammar , the rules for pronunciation , and practice reading the text aloud .

		They learn the paradigms , and rules of syntax , so as to parse rapidly , declining and inflecting freely .

		They learn the rules of letter change , a selected set of them .

		They already know from their other language studies
Grimm	PERSON	's law and the like .

		They learn for continual use the paradigms and syntax , and the common phonetic changes within the
West Saxon	LOCATION	, and from
West Saxon	LOCATION	to English .

		The examination at the end of the first term of Anglo-Saxon is almost wholly de - voted to these matters , and it is known from the first that they must be learned in order to pass with - out conditions .

		In the second term Anglo-Saxon prosody is added to the grammar work , but the time is given mainly to reading Anglo-Saxon authors as we read modern English authors in this course , and to throwing light upon modern English words and idioms by con - necting them with their ancient forms .

		Besides the class examinations , a prize is offered to those who complete the courses for the best general examina - tion in English before
Chaucer	PERSON	; and an additional optional course is given to prepare for examination questions upon the deduction of the Anglo-Saxon forms from originals in the Parent Speech and other comparative grammar , and for additional reading , and literary and biographic and bibliographic study in connection with it .

		The chief use of study of English before
Chau	PERSON	- cer to the American college graduate , the person who used to be known as the gentleman and scholar , is to help him to better understanding and mas - tery of English in
Chaucer	LOCATION	, and since Chaucer .

		The literary charm and power of the works which have survived from the earlier period is slight in 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, comparison with that of the old masters of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, and of the still greater modern authors in our own language and other modern languages , who mold the thoughts of modern men .

		It would seem best , therefore , to devote that moderate por - tion of time which ought to be given to this study in college to a few typical specimens of Anglo-Saxon , and to the comparative study of their idioms in re - lation to modern English , so as to fix in memory illustrative originals to guide and strengthen our speech .

		No one but an incipient professor of lan - guages can well afford to spend his days and nights for long periods of his crowded college life in study - ing books of specimens of all the various early dia - lects of those groping centuries .

		This series of required studies for the whole class is continued during the second term of Senior year by two exercises a week , with weekly written papers from each student arranged for the general study of some author , and the writing of an elaborate ar - ticle , as if for a quarterly review , which must con - tain a discussion of the language of the author .

		With the work of this term goes another prize .

		The best work is done when the author selected is an American .

		Students find their own life and thought depicted in the American authors .

		The language is their own .

		They are specially drawn to them .

		In the college reading-room the Amer - ican periodicals are worn to tatters , while the En - glish publications , which were the main reading of students of the last generation , lie in fair covers , looking fresh from the binder .

		Bryant ,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	, have been handled with most hearty and sympa - thetic admiration and intelligence .

Lafayette	LOCATION	is that on which Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	made the public presentation of this prize for the best study of his own works to
J. W. Bright	PERSON	, of
' 77	DATE	, now Professor of
English Philology in Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, his torch still burn - ing as he runs in the front .

		During the same term a rapid general survey of English literature is given with a compendium , class discussions , and conversations , two hours a week .

		And four hours a week of the last term of the Senior year are given to a review and summary of the lin - guistic side of the college studies in connection with Professor

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		EDUCATION AND LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In connection with the discussion in THE DIAL on the Teaching of English at
American Colleges	ORGANIZATION	and Universities , it may not be amiss to emphasize certain tendencies in the scope and method of literary educa - tion , as bearing on the future of literature .

		Certainly the immediate prospect for literature is not bright .

		Our civilization is daily becoming more democratic ; the people draw all activities toward themselves ; and the literary artist is more than ever tempted to be un - true to himself , to yield to the popular demand and truckle to the average taste .

		Style , as characteristic creativeness , as the expression of lofty individuality , is neither wanted nor appreciated by the great mass of readers .

		Your thorough-going democrat believes in complete equality , material and intellectual ; and he who is unlike or peculiar is regarded as either foolish or conceited .

		The great host of self-assertive self-sat - isfied people despise what they can not understand , or jest at it .

		An illustration in hand is the recent vulgar skit , so universal in the newspapers , about President
Cleveland	LOCATION	's hard lot in being obliged to hear Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	read his latest poem .

		Such is the bourgeoise temper .

		It may appreciate literary cleverness or smartness , but it will flout at talent and genius , at all sustained and dignified discourse and high poetic sentiment .

		In the hurry of this eager , unquiet , democratic age , if men read at all they will read only what appeals directly to them at the first glance , what is short to scrappiness and is startling staccato in expression .

		In brief , the democratization of literature means a childish impres - sionism .

		However , it is folly to lament this tendency , with the pessimists , or , with
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, to rely hereafter upon a '' saving remnant . ''

		Since literature is not , and is never likely to be , as in the past , a product for the few , since the kind of writing which the people demand is the kind of writing which will be done , the only hope of literature is an educated public .

		I take it , then , that the importance for literature itself of the right study of literature in our schools and universities can scarcely be overrated .

		But the results of present methods can hardly be regarded as satisfactory .

		Many of our col - lege graduates and most of our high-school graduates read little more than that lowest form of literature , the newspaper .

		Not one in a hundred , in consulting hi & own taste , takes up an English classic , reads
Milton	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	simply because he likes them .

		And certainly , for the great majority , school in - struction in literature results in no marked and perma - nent uplifting of taste .

		I am far from saying that liter - ary education is a complete failure , but I thoroughly believe that it is generally very defective in spirit and method .

		The chief difficulty arises at bottom from a lack of practical realization of the true end of education as to - tal process .

		The real object of education may be de - fined as a preparation for that largest , freest , most orig - inal development of the mind which is the goal of human evolution .

		And this development ever has been , , and ever will be , distinctly five-fold : religious , moral ^ philosophic , scientific , and artistic , each in its own way , yet forming an interdependent organism of cul - ture .

		A true education , as the vestibule of life , must 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 contain all these forms as coordinate ; every scheme of unprofessional education ought to realize these factors , each for its own sake , an ideal which is yet far before us .

		Just now parvenu science , crass , boorish , and over - bearing , as the parvenu generally is , has got the upper - hand in education .

		Hence we see in literary education , as everywhere else , the undue stress laid on the scientific method , and literature constantly and dominantly in - terpreted from the standpoints of anthropology , psy - chology , history , and philology .

		It is certainly inter - esting and useful to look at literary art from other standpoints than its own ; but for the educative study of literature the main point of view must always be the purely aesthetic .

		The prime object is not to inform the understanding , but to develop the taste , to lead the stu - dent to spontaneously recognize the best art whenever and wherever he finds it , and , what is more , to like it , yea , even to love it .

		Not one educated man in a hundred knows good literature when he sees it ; he must rely upon some critic , or upon his knowledge as to the fame of the author , and straightway he will try to discover the beauties he has been taught to expect .

		But this is not genuine taste ; the deeper and real life does not respond , and if emotion there be , it is wholly artificial .

		The student openly applauds what he is taught to ap - plaud , but in secret he reads and praises the meretri - cious and sensational .

		For the formation and development of a genuine in - dividual taste the student should be led into direct and unbiased contact with the best art .

		He should not even know the author of the piece he is reading , but by re - peated study should get a thoroughly original impres - sion and give expression to it orally or in writing be - fore he receives any instruction .

		The free initiative and spontaneous interest must always be led up to and waited for .

		I would suggest giving a class a short poem for a half-hour 's original study , and asking for written answers to such questions as , What lines please you most ?

		Why ?

		What is the strongest part of the poem ?

		What the weakest ?

		How does it compare with poems previously read ?

		What would you judge as to the au - thor from internal evidence ?

		The student should grad - ually come to a knowledge of authorship from internal criticism alone , and the author should always be subor - dinated to his works .

		That best art which is self-in - terpreting and simple in its aesthetic elements should mainly be used .

		After a measure of taste for the good art is definitely formed , examples of poor and bad lit - erature should be interspersed for detection and criti - cism .

		If this appreciative direct study of literature were made the main method throughout the whole course of education , the ground covered would not be so great as now , but the results in the improvement of taste , and indirectly in the elevation of literature itself , would , I think , be far more considerable .

		A subsidiary method which may sometimes be of value in sharpening the critical sense with advanced stu - dents is to require from them actual literary work .

		However , appreciativeness is by no means vitally con - nected with executive ability .

		Indeed , the literary critic and the litterateur are often quite distinct .

		To enjoy good writing I no more need to be a writer , than to be a musician to enjoy good music , or a preacher to enjoy good preaching .

		The greatest fallacy in the education of to-day is the so-called laboratory method , so far as it supposes that we need to become scientists in order to appreciate science , and artists in order to appreciate art .

		However , we can not enlarge on this point here .

		I conclude that a genuine revival of high art in our democratic civilization is impossible until the general taste be elevated , and this elevation must be largely at - tained through the improvement in scope and method of artistic education .

		Goethe truly says , '' Happy is the man who early in life knows what art is '' ; and this insight into the real nature of art can only be reached and sus - tained by a constant familiarity with the best art dur - ing the whole period of education .

		UNEXPECTED HAPPENINGS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		While the readers of THE DIAL have in memory Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's replies to my letters , kindly permit me to bring to their attention two or three of the odd things with which these replies abound .

		A brief preliminary ex - planation in each case is necessary .

		I. Although a word or a phrase in
Lord Macaulay	LOCATION	's writings has sometimes arrested the unfavorable atten - tion of Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, yet , in the main ,
Lord Macaulay	LOCATION	's En - glish has received Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's approbation .

		In fact , there are passages in Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's discussions of good and bad English which give one the impression that , at the time they were penned , he looked up to or , rather , upon
Macaulay	PERSON	as an unquestionable exemplar of cor - rectness .

		Among the evidences of his regard for the authority of Lord
Macaulay	PERSON	are the following : '' Let us now turn to another writer of high and deserved repute , the last of our really well informed lingual conserva - tives .

		Like Dr.
Newman	PERSON	,
Lord Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	uses , `` etc. -LRB- `` Mod - ern English , '' p. 292 , footnote . -RRB- ''

		I have called the word -LSB- helpmate ' -RCB- classical .

		Lord
Macau	LOCATION	- lay writes , in the first chapter of his History : ' A waiting woman was generally considered as the most suitable help - mate of a parson . ' ''

		-LRB- Ib. , p. 156 , footnote . -RRB- ''

		... it has been seen how many fashions of speech which he -LSB-
R. G. White	PERSON	-RSB- rejects and ridicules are practically war - ranted by
Lord Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		... '' -LRB- '' Recent Exemplifications of False Philology , '' p. 107 . -RRB- ''

		That which he -LSB- De Quincey -RSB- deems to be the English of ' French reporters ' was good enough English , in the last cen - tury , for
Jeremy Benthani	PERSON	, and is good enough , in our cen - tury , for Lord Macaulay . ''

		-LRB- Ib. , pp. 18-9 . -RRB- ''

		... even such a purist as Lord
Macaulay	PERSON	has used '' -LSB- cer - tain words named -RSB- .

		-LRB- '' Modern English , '' p. 142 . -RRB- ''

		Even such a purist as Lord Macaulay uses it more than once . ''

		-LRB- Ib. , p. 300 . -RRB-

		It was natural that I should want to avail myself of an authority so highly esteemed by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, when , in reference to a certain use of known to and a similar use of unknown to , I was citing -LRB- THE DIAL ,
July 1 , 1893	DATE	-RRB- , in opposition to Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's opinion , quotations from many writers of excellent standing .

		Several passages from
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's writings containing the '' breach of idiom '' disapproved by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	were before me , but limita - tions of space prevented the use of more than one , viz .

		: `` Most of these wretches were not soldiers .

		They acted under no authority known to the law . ''

		-LRB-
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, `` Hist .

		Eng. , '' ch .

		xii . -RRB-

		To which I added : '' A remark made by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	concerning another locution may be appropriately quoted here : ' Even such a purist as Lord Macaulay uses it more than once . '

		-LRB- ' Modern English , ' p. 300 -RRB- . ''

		Now , as to the point so made -LRB- which to me seemed rather strong -RRB- , there was an unexpected happening .

		All 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, that Dr.
Hall	PERSON	said about this point was in a postscript to his reply .

		It reads as follows : '' P-S . '

		Even such a purist as Lord Macaulay uses it more than once . '

		This sentence Mr.
Williams	PERSON	quotes from me as ' a remark ' which I make ' concerning another locution . '

		Is my remark amiss as to its wording : ?

		or in what it expresses ?

		I am at a loss to know . ''

		-LRB- THE DIAL ,
August 16 , 1893	DATE	. -RRB-

		This postscript is Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's whole reply to my cita - tion of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	and to my quotation from '' Modern English '' showing Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's opinion of Macaulay as an authority , and that the censured locution was useci by him more than once .

		That the author of '' Modern English '' should fail to see the obvious application oJ that plain sentence cited against himself from his own book , who could have anticipated ?

		But so it came to pass .

		II .

		Most people when expressing their thoughts in print take more care in regard to forms of expression than when writing confidential letters to familiar friends .

		This , I suppose , is true even in the case of writers whose style in print is colloquial and familiar .

		Moreover , a form of expression found in a private letter is not an instance of its use by the writer in print , even though the letter be subsequently published in a book .

		Private letters often get into books , but publication does not convert their phraseology into expressions used in print .

		My apology for stating and insisting on matters so obvious will be found in the fact that , obvious as these simple truths are , they have been wholly overlooked by , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	in his reply -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Dec. 1 , 1893	DATE	-RRB- to my letter published in
THE DIAL	LOCATION	,
September 1	DATE	.

		Strange , as it is , with my words before him -LRB- for he quotes them correctly -RRB- .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	offers , in contradiction of a remark of mine , citations which by the very terms of the remark itself are excluded .

		And strange , too , he rests his case on those citations .

		He produces no other new ones .

		In THE DIAL for
September 1	DATE	, I said : `` Although I have noticed two instances -LRB- one in a letter -RRB- besides the one cited above by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, where the ' imperfect passive ' was employed by Dr.
Newman	PERSON	, yet I am confident that its use by him at least in print was very rare . ''

		After more than a column of desultory preliminaries , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	proceeds to upset the confidence expressed by me above in this manner : `` Between 1832 and
1846	DATE	he -LSB- Dr.
Newman	PERSON	-RSB- was , according to his own adjudication , ` guilty of ' : '' then follow six quotations from
Cardinal Newman	ORGANIZATION	's Letters -LRB- 1891 -RRB- '' published since his death .

		As the volumes in which these letters appear contain , besides the '' Letters , '' some things actually written by
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	for publication , I have taken pains to find the context of these quotations , in order to as - certain beyond a doubt whether the passages cited by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	are parts of private correspondence or whether they occur in writings intended for the public .

		Every one of these six instances of the '' imperfect passive '' cited by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	occurs in a private confidential letter written to a familiar friend .

		Not one of them militates against my reservation as to the use of the imperfect passive by
Cardinal Newman	ORGANIZATION	in print .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, however , in - troduces them with , '' If he -LSB- Mr.
Williams	PERSON	-RSB- had gone farther afield , he would have made the discovery , '' etc. ; and supplements them with '' Nor , perhaps , would it be altogether amiss , if he redoubled his diligence of re - search . ''

		All this , be it remembered , after quoting from me the precise words that shut out such citations .

		A very unexpected happening .

		III .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's reply -LRB- THE DIAL ,
Dec. 1 , 1893	DATE	-RRB- opens with the following statement : '' Descanting on English Imperfects Passive , in the
Appen	PERSON	- dix to my ` Modern English ' -LRB- 1873 -RRB- , I say , respecting ` the sort of phraseology under consideration , ' that ` some of the choicest of living English writers employ it freely . '

		I pro- ceed : ' Preeminent among these stands Dr.
Newman	PERSON	, who wrote , as far back as
1846	DATE	, ' etc. .

		A single relevant citation from him is then adduced . ''

		Mr.
R. 0	PERSON	.


Williams	ORGANIZATION	, in your issue of
September 1	DATE	, takes exception to my qualifier ` freely . ' ''

		No , begging the writer 's pardon I have never in - timated a doubt of the alleged fact that '' some of the choicest of living English writers employ it freely . ''

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's statement of the issue does not define it with sufficient exactness .

		The question raised by me was '' whether Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, at the time he wrote the remarks '' quoted by him above , '' had knowledge of such a num - ber of instances where Dr.
Newman	PERSON	had used this lo - cution in his voluminous writings , that he , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, could fairly say , either by direct assertion or by impli - cation , that Dr.
Newman	PERSON	employed it '' freely , '' whether , in other words , Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, at the time he made the assertion relative to
Newman	PERSON	, had in his knowledge sufficient evidence to justify it .

		The doubt was sug - gested by -LRB- among other things -RRB- : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a very strong an - tipathy which
Newman	PERSON	had expressed for is being ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the fact that Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, in thirty-nine pages of text given to the discussion of is being , etc. , had cited but one in - stance of its use by
Newman	PERSON	, notwithstanding the pre - eminence assigned him among '' some of the choicest of living English writers '' ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- that several inferior writ - ers were , each , cited more than once ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- a strong be - lief that the use of is being , etc. , by
Newman	ORGANIZATION	'' at least in print was very rare . ''

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	, in the course of his desultory reply tells us when he found -LRB- in
1872	DATE	-RRB- the said instance of the use of the '' imperfect passive '' by
Newman	PERSON	, and that , at the time he found it , he recalled the fact that he '' had in the past observed his use repeatedly of like expres - sions . '' ''

		My memory , '' Dr.
Hall	PERSON	adds , '' though I sel - dom trust to it , seldom plays me false . ''

		He then proves the accuracy of his memory and my ignorance of New - man 's usage in regard to is being , was being , etc. , by bringing forward the quotations I have commented on above -LRB- II . -RRB-

		, quotations cited from an edition of letters published nineteen years after his memory had rendered the service specified .

		The citations would be pertinent if offered by Dr.
Hall	PERSON	as evidence of his clairvoyance especially if they had been produced by him before the publication of the private letters where the passages quoted occur but they can not prove that , in and before
1872	DATE	, Dr.
Hall	PERSON	had seen in
Newman	PERSON	's publications so many examples of the '' imperfect pass - ive '' that he could fairly put
Newman	PERSON	among the au - thors of whom he said '' some of the choicest of living English writers employ it freely . ''

		That Dr.
Hall	PERSON	could take such a view of the matter as his reply discloses was by me quite unexpected .

		IV .

		The likening me to a lame devil that needs spec - tacles -LRB- I admit the spectacles imputation -RRB- was unex - pected in merely this the particular form of similitude chosen .

		V .

		Some unexpected things in Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's replies have been mentioned .

		Another thing not at all unexpected should be noticed by a brief remark .

		A characteristic feature of all Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's replies to my letters is the as - sumption that convincing evidence can be rebutted by his bald assertion .

		THE DIAL 299 Books .

		BOOKS ABOUT THE SEA .

		* Fifty years ago a sailor was a sailor not the mere lubberly roustabout or deck-hand one sees on an ocean steamer nowadays .

		His du - ties were as multifarious as his oaths , and his yarns were as stiff as his tarpaulin hat .

		His accomplishments were endless .

		He could `` reef , furl , steer , and handle , '' splice you a rope -LRB- not forgetting the main brace -RRB- in a twinkling , tie twenty different knots wall knots , diamond knots , bowlines , loop , reef , or stopper knots , or what you will in as many minutes ; he was sailor , sail-maker , rigger , carpenter , painter , tailor a nautical
Jack	PERSON	of all trades , in short , to order ; usually he was a cheery companion and a fertile and engaging liar to boot .

		His delight in telling of what he had seen only fell short of his delight in telling of what he had not seen .

		Fifty years ago , too , a ship was a ship not a dirty , snorting Brobdignagian tea - kettle , a thing the gallant Farragut refused to go to well , to Tarturus in .

		She was a thing of grace and sentiment ; a part integral of the element she adorned ; a pearl on the expanse of lapis lazuli ; in the distance , a white-winged phantom slanting away before the breeze like a mist-wreath .

		But , as the song says , '' the ship is gone and
Jack	PERSON	is gone '' ; and with them the glamour of sea-faring and its legendary lore . ''

		Tom Bowling '' is no more ; and we suppose '' Black-eyed Susan '' '' waves her lily hand '' nowhere but in Mr.
Gay	PERSON	's ballad .

		Nobody cares to picture a '' Vanderdecken '' or an '' Ancient Mariner '' cruising about in a steam - boat ; and the '' sea-change '' suffered is , on the whole , a very prosaic one indeed .

		The little book entitled '' Twenty Years at Sea , '' by
Frederick Stanhope Hill	PERSON	, gives , in Part I. , a very realistic picture of sea-life half a century ago .

		As far as it goes , it is as good as
Dana	LOCATION	.

		teen ; and his log recounts his professional pro- gress from the greenhorn phase of '' granny '' knots and deck-swabbing , to the dignities and emoluments of able seamanship .

		The narra - tive is duly spiced with mutiny , pirates , '' shang - haeing , '' etc. ; and the best of it is , it is all true .

		Part II. , '' In the
Naval Service	ORGANIZATION	, '' relates to the Civil War ; and here the author recounts some sufficiently thrilling exploits and inci - dents , quorum pars magna fuit .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's manner is well suited to his matter , and his book is emphatically one that any normally - minded boy -LRB- and we believe there are some left , in spite of Lord
Fauntleroy	PERSON	-RRB- can revel in and profit by .

		The work entitled '' The British Seas '' is a collection of picturesque notes of the British coast and its adjacent waters , by
W. Clark Russell	PERSON	and others .

		To the reader at all '' salt '' in his tastes it is a captivating book , brine - scented and echoing the voices of the ocean like a
Norse	ORGANIZATION	saga .

		Six of the papers '' The Downs , '' '' Down Channel , '' '' The North Sea , '' etc. are Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's , and we need scarcely add they contain some capital '' bits of marine , '' as the painters say .

		Here is one a fleet of
North Sea	LOCATION	smacks putting out for the fishing grounds : '' As they clear the entrance the tide catches them , and away they go in fine style , scattering as the tow - ropes are let slip , and plunging like galloping cart-horses as they take the first of the seas and wash away to the northward .

		Others again , to save towage-charge , ' ratch , ' out as it is called , and a spirited sight it is to witness .

		The seamanship of the fellows is excellent ; they appear to know their little ships as a man the horse he has rid - den for years ; you see a smack under a heavy press leaning down to it till her waterways are under , and heading direct for the granite of the pier ; her bowsprit seems to be in the act of spearing the solid wall , when down goes her helm , round she spins like some waltz - ing girl , nimble of foot ; in a breath or two all is flat - tened in fore and aft , and she is smoking through it on the other tack . ''

		In other papers Mr.
Russell	PERSON	takes us to Rams - gate -LRB- that paradise of
London	LOCATION	'' ` Arry '' and '' ` Arriet '' -RRB- ,
Sandwich	LOCATION	,
Hastings	PERSON	,
Brighton	LOCATION	, the Isle of
Wight	LOCATION	,
Cardiff	LOCATION	,
Newcastle	LOCATION	,
Whitby	LOCATION	, etc. ; he describes the life-boatmen , smugglers , whalers , fishermen , and the like amphibians , in a way that must have charmed Ed ` ard Cut - tle , mariner ; he sketches with graphic pencil many a sound , harbor , and foreland ; and he opens for us the door of tiny public houses , haunted by ` longshore
Jack	PERSON	, who loves , as Mr.
Besant	PERSON	truly says , when not afloat , '' to sit where he can gaze upon a harbor , and ships , and the blue water outside . ''

		And through the open door of these snuggeries there floats an 300 -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, eloquent whiff of rum and tobacco , and usually the sough of some sailor 's yarn . ''

		There she blows ! ''

		one seems to hear him say . '' '

		There she blows ! '

		I sung out from the foretopmast head .

		` Where away ? '

		they bawls from the deck . '

		On the weather quarter , ' says I. ' There she blows ! '

		Up comes the cap'n . '

		And so he drowses on , hoarse as a nor ` wester , com - fortable , mendacious .

		Almost as good as Mr.

		Hamerton , and

Colin Hunter	PERSON	,
Arthur Turner	PERSON	, and others .

		The initial volume -LRB- devoted to
Hawkins	LOCATION	,
Drake	PERSON	, and
Frobisher	PERSON	-RRB- of the series of selected narratives from Hakluyt entitled `` Voyages of the Elizabethan Seamen to
America	LOCATION	'' has reached a second edition .

		Three voyages of
Hawkins	PERSON	are given , three of
Frobisher	PERSON	, and one of
Drake	LOCATION	, together with
Briggs	PERSON	's account of the Armada .

		The narratives , on the whole , seem to bear out Mr.
Froude	PERSON	's characterization of Hakluyt 's book as '' the prose epic of the modern English nation . ''

		Of the several rela - tors in the present volume ,
John Sparks	PERSON	, who writes of
Hawkins	PERSON	's second voyage , seems to bear away the palm , at least in point of liter - ary quality .

		The negroes of
Africa	LOCATION	, the West Indian Caribs , the
Florida Indians	LOCATION	, are described by him with much freedom and vivacity , and not altogether , one fancies , without a touch of Sir
John Mandeville	PERSON	's inventiveness .

		Writing of
Florida	LOCATION	,
Sparks	ORGANIZATION	makes a deduction in nat - ural history that is very amusing .

		Having '' as - certained '' that the region possesses unicorns , he straightway concludes that it abounds in lions , on the cogent ground that '' every beast hath its enemy . ''

		Thus , the wolf is the natural enemy of the sheep , the polecat of the rabbit , the rhinoceros of the elephant .

		So it is with the lion and the unicorn .

		Now
Florida	LOCATION	'' hath its unicorns '' ; ergo , lions must abound there also .

		Q.E.D. .

		That Mr.
Sparks	PERSON	fortified his argument by first catching his unicorn , does not appear .

		The volume is edited by
Edward John Payne	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, who has added a full and scholarly introduction , and a brief account of
Hakluyt	LOCATION	's life and works .

		The last though most important work on our list is Mr.
Edgar Stanton Maclay	PERSON	's '' History of the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' a book , by-the - bye , that is not likely to cool the ardor of those young naval men who are charged with a sin - ful desire to test their new ships and new guns on a real enemy .

		Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	's History is , we believe , the first attempt at a full and contin - uous record of the kind , and it is in the main a satisfactory one .

		The style is spirited and popular , and the author has evidently tried to be accurate and full .

		New facts have been drawn from the records , old facts have been reweighed and recast , and altogether the book is likely for some time to hold its place as the chief popular authority on the subject .

		Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	is a specially good hand at describing a sea-fight .

		The immortal duel between the '' United States '' and the '' Macedonian , '' for instance , is depicted in a style that would not discredit
Smollett	PERSON	, and will probably set the '' Fighting
Bob Evanses	PERSON	'' of our navy to fur - ther lowering themselves in the eyes of quer - ulous and low-spirited editors .

		In his intro - ductory Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	summarizes the services of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		These , he thinks , '' it would be difficult to exaggerate . ''

		During the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	cruisers took from the en - emy about 800 vessels , which involved the cap - ture of , at a modest estimate , 12,000 prisoners , 500 of whom were soldiers of the best English regiments .

		In the two years ' naval war with
France	LOCATION	, about 80 vessels , carrying over 3000 men , were taken ; and the
Barbary	LOCATION	wars gained for the
United States	LOCATION	privileges that were de - nied to European powers .

		The naval war of
1812	DATE	, Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	rightly says , '' did more to humble the-pride of
Great Britain	LOCATION	than any other contest . ''

		For the sec - ond time since the Armada there was a cloud upon her title of Mistress of the Seas .

		At the outbreak of the war the British navy was in the zenith of its glory ; when it closed , British commerce was '' almost annihilated . ''

		Out of eighteen engagements , the royal navy counted fifteen defeats ; and this after the
London	LOCATION	'' Statesman '' of
June 10 , 1812	DATE	, had said : ''
America	LOCATION	certainly can not pretend to wage war with us ; she has no navy to do it with . ''

		Over
1500	DATE	vessels were taken from the En - glish , and more than 20,000 of their seamen were made prisoners .


John Bull	PERSON	was hit hard , in his purse and in his pride , and for the time even the new-blown glories of Trafalgar were forgotten .

		The American victories '' spread a degree of gloom over
London	LOCATION	that was most
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301 painful to observe '' wrote an eye-witness , in a tone that recalls
Pepys	PERSON	's lament over the ad - vent of the Dutch in the
Medway	LOCATION	.

		When the news of the loss of the first frigate reached En - gland , the '' Times '' gravely observed : '' The loss of a single frigate by us , it is true , is but a small one ; when viewed as a part of the
British Navy	ORGANIZATION	it is almost nothing ; yet under all the circumstances of the two countries to which the vessels belonged , we know not any calamity of twenty times its amount that might have been attended with more serious conse - quences to the worsted party . ''

		But when the capture of the second royal frigate was an - nounced , the '' Thunderer '' exclaimed , fairly startled for the moment out of its measured monotone : u In the name of God , what was done with this immense superiority of force !

		Oh , what a charm is hereby dispelled !

		The land spell of the French is broken , and so is our sea spell ! ''

		It was manifest to the thick - est British apprehension that the superiority of the English to the
American navy	ORGANIZATION	lay in numbers and armament alone ; and that Brit - annia 's sea-rule had passed from the roll of the '' eternal verities . ''

		Napoleon 's prediction in
1803	DATE	, when
Louisiana	LOCATION	was ceded , that he had given to
England	LOCATION	'' a maritime rival that would sooner or later humble her pride , '' had reached an early fulfilment .

		Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	devotes some space to showing that the figure-juggling resorted to by English writers to explain away English defeats only exemplifies the pliability of figures in the hands of those who have a case to make out .

		He has taken , we think , some unnecessary trouble here .

		The childish excuse that in every case -LRB- and there were a good many of them -RRB- in which a British ship was worsted by an American the latter was superior to the former in guns and tonnage , is a lame one on the face of it .

		Plainly stated , the truth seems to be that in the naval war of 1812
John Bull	PERSON	, grown somewhat over - confident , was soundly thrashed , at his own style of fighting , by his vigorous offspring .

		Whatever consolation he may draw from the fact that the victor was his own flesh and blood he is entitled to ; but we respectfully decline to entertain the plea that in each encounter he was '' out of condition . ''

		Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	has spiced his narrative with a sprinkling of anecdotes , one of which -LRB- smack - ing not a little of ''
Roderick	PERSON	Random '' -RRB- touch - ing Lord
William Fitzroy	PERSON	, a son of the
Duke of Grafton	ORGANIZATION	and the first commander of the `` Mace - donian , '' we quote .

		His lordship was an agree - able compound of the martinet and the snob : '' He may not have been a first-class sailor , but he was thoroughly conscious of his exalted rank , and was an enthusiastic disciplinarian .

		Bold indeed was the officer who had the temerity to address him as cap - tain , ' or to reply to his commands with a ` Yes , sir , ' instead of < My Lord , ' or Yes , me lud . '

		The '
Mace	PERSON	- donian ' had not been many days out on her maiden cruise when an incident happened that will illustrate Captain
Fitzroy	PERSON	's temperament .

		While she was at Lis - bon one of the sailors , named
Bob Hammond	PERSON	, came aboard intoxicated , and on the next day he received four dozen lashes for the offense .

		As soon as the pun - ishment had been inflicted ,
Bob	PERSON	applied himself lustily to the bottle , and before night he was again ' gloriously drunk , ' and while in this condition he suddenly conceived the idea of making a sociable call on the captain , just to show that he harbored no ill will for the flogging he had received .

		Marching up to the quarter-deck , he ac - costed his commander in the free-and-easy style with which one good fellow should address another , and said , < Hello ,
Billy	PERSON	, my boy , is that you ? '

		Observing that he had made an impression ,
Bob	PERSON	followed up his ad - vantage by saying , < you are young and foolish , my boy just fit to launch .

		You are like a young lion ,
Billy	PERSON	, all your sorrows are to come . '

		As soon as the noble lord could recover his voice he shrieked out , ' Put that man in irons ! ' ''

		History records that next day
Robert	PERSON	was again triced up to the grating , and received his reward in the shape of an extra five dozen from the boatswain 's cat .

		We regret to say that Captain
Fitzroy	PERSON	was not aboard the `` Mace - donian '' when she fell in with the '' United States '' some months later .

		The present volume , opening with a resume of colonial maritime matters , treats of the naval phases of the Revolution , of the French and the Tripolitan Wars , and of the War of
1812	DATE	up to the action between the '' Essex '' and the '' Phoebe '' and the '' Cherub , '' off
Valparaiso	LOCATION	.

		The narrative will be continued and the record brought down to date in Vol .

		Print and pa - per are good , and the illustrations are interest - ing .

		We think it regrettable that there are no portraits .

		Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	has evidently written con amore ; and while his work is free from brag and jingoism , it shows a hearty enthusiasm that goes far to cover minor faults of style .

		It is a good book to read and to cause to be read especially now that American patriotism is be - come a rather parti-colored affair and largely the resultant of a half-dozen or so exotic pa - triotisms .

		It will certainly do our racially - diverse coming generation no harm to learn from Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	what they owe to the Deca - turs , Lawrences , and Perrys , the men who made the flag of the young Republic a valid passport on the high seas .

		E. G. J. 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, SOME RECEXT EDUCATIONAL , BOOKS .

		* No feature of current educational history in the most progressive countries is more marked than its literary feature , as expressed both in periodicals and in books .

		The volume of such literature is constantly swelling .

		Buisson 's list of works in French -LRB- Dictionaire de Pedagogic , 1882-87 -RRB- contains two thousand titles , and is confessedly incomplete ; while Compayre states quite correctly that the German language is still richer in such publications .

		The two great English-speaking countries have done less than
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, but they have still con - tributed largely to swell the stream .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	, besides importing and publish - ing much of the best that appears abroad , trans - lating it when necessary , we every year pro- duce a considerable number of new educational books , of varying degrees of value , to say nothing of the mass of periodical publications , in which no doubt we surpass any other coun - try .

		Unfortunately , we have no American pedagogical bibliography that is complete or approaches completeness .

		Inferior as our work may be , in some particulars , to the best that is produced abroad , we still have in Dr. Bar - nard 's '' Journal of Education '' the most val - uable magazine of educational knowledge that has ever been collected in any single work in any country .

		Then the increasing variety of educational literature should be remarked .

		The two great departments , of course , are theory and practice and history ; but the works devoted to these subjects are flanked right and * MENTAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE CHILD .

		left by a great array of papers , dissertations , studies , essays , and articles devoted to almost every conceivable educational subject , many of which contain valuable materials that will ulti - mately find their way into the standard litera - ture of education .

		It may justly be said that , as the volume of this literature worthily repre - sents the totality of educational activity , so its variety well represents the multiform character of such activity .

		Within a generation there has been a notice - able change in the general character of the more permanent literature .

		A vigorous at - tempt has been made to remove from mental and moral training the old-time reproach of empiricism , by seeking a scientific basis for its processes .

		The term '' pedagogy '' has not only come into reputable use in
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, but it has gained considerable head - way in the
United States	LOCATION	, and even made some impression in
England	LOCATION	.

		But those who dis - allow the word recognize the thing .

		Dr.
Bain	PERSON	calls his well-known book '' Education Consid - ered as a Science , '' and other writers give us other combinations of the same words .

		In this country the new tendency may be very easily illustrated .

		Page 's '' Theory and Practice of Teaching , '' published in
1847	DATE	, was fully abreast of the best thinking of the time , in its partic - ular field .

		It was an excellent book , and has been more widely read than any other book on teaching ever published in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is still read , and is still well worth reading , abounding as it does in sound ideas , in admir - able illustration , and in enthusiasm .

		But it is not scientific ; the '' theory '' is as practical as theory can well be made . ''

		Consciousness '' is found four times in the index , and is always limited by the phrase '' of success '' ; neither '' psychology '' nor '' mental science '' appears .

		A better book of the old type can scarcely be found , but it does not suit the changed tem - per of the times .

		In no point is the new tendency more pro- nounced than in the scientific exploration of the child mind ; or , using the latest neologism , what is called '' paidology . ''

		This movement had long been heralded .


Rousseau	PERSON	sent his own children to the foundling hospital , but behind doors he would listen eagerly to the talk of the children of others .

		Madame Neckar ad - vised mothers to note in a journal each step of progress that their children made in all the vi - cissitudes of physical and moral health . ''

		Like the psychology of the child , pedagogy itself , at least in its first chapters , '' says Compayre ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 303 '' ought to be conceived and written near a cradle . ''

		No other name is so closely iden - tified with this new line of research as that of Professor
Preyer	PERSON	, whose previous treatises , '' The Senses and the Will '' and '' The Devel - opment of the Intellect , '' together constituting one work entitled '' The Mind of the Child , '' are a magazine of facts , carefully observed , closely sifted , and wisely discussed .

		Preyer 's new book , `` Mental Development in the Child , '' is on the same lines , only it is much less com - prehensive , and is particularly intended to bring the subject down to date and to initiate mothers into the science of child study . ''

		For after all , '' the Professor observes , '' the observ - ation of mental development in the earliest years naturally falls to the mother more than to any other person .

		But in order to initiate mothers into so complicated a science as that of psychogenesis , the results already attained in it must be presented to them in a form as easy of assimilation as possible .

		Other per - sons also teachers , both male and female , fathers , older brothers and sisters are to be induced to consider the importance of the facts in this field , which has indeed been lying open for hundreds of years , but has been little trod - den , and is therefore a new field . ''

		For some years American investigators have been pressing into the field of child study , Dr.
Stanley Hall	PERSON	leading the way ; but no better work has been done by any of these students than by Mr.
Tracy	PERSON	in his '' Psychology of Child - hood . ''

		The thesis is not , indeed , fundamentally a study , but rather a compilation of what has been discovered relating to the subject ; still , it is also a substantial contribution to knowledge .

		Particular attention is paid to the subject of language , and not the least valuable feature of the book is its bibliography relating to that topic .

		Besides fifteen unpublished studies that the author used , he gives one hundred and one titles of printed documents , making much the best list with which we are acquainted .

		The publication by the same house in the same year of translations of
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's '' Science of Education '' and
Lange	PERSON	's '' Apperception '' testifies to the growing interest in the pedagog - ical ideas that Herbart organized into the sys - tem that bears his name .

		Beginning with the postulate that ethics furnishes the end of edu - cation and instruction the means , these ideas are both too many and too important to be dis - cussed in this place , beyond the offering of two or three reflections .

		And first , both pedagog - ists and practical teachers , when new ideas are brought before them , or old ideas in a new and striking way , exemplify the tendency to over - emphasis .

		It may be difficult to over - value such factors in education as interest and appercep - tion , but it is not impossible .

		The German phil - osopher no doubt gave to these two factors a new and a well-deserved value , but he did not dis - cover them .

		Neither do they render simple and easy even those parts of training to which they directly relate .

		It will not answer to fol - low the criterion of interest , absolutely , in mat - ters of education .

		It is often purely factitious , and is by no means difficult of creation .

		Again , if
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	over-emphasizes the teacher , he etrs on the safe side .

		Instruction is indeed the com - plement of experience and intercourse . ''

		Who can dispense with experience and intercourse in education ? ''

		asks Herbart . ''

		To do so would be to dispense with daylight and content our - selves with candlelight .

		Fulness , strength , in - dividual definiteness in all our presentations , practice in the application of the general , con - tact with the real , with the country and the age , patience with men as they are , all these must be derived from those original sources of mental life . ''

		Still , they are inadequate . ''

		The kernel of our mental being , '' he continues , `` can - not be cultivated with certain results by means of experience and intercourse .

		Instruction most certainly penetrates deeper into the laboratory of the mind .

		Only think of the power of every religious doctrine !

		Think of the dominating influence which a philosophic lecture so easily , nay , almost unawares , exercises over an atten - tive listener .

		Add thereto the frightful power of novel-reading , for all this belongs to in - struction , either bad or good ... Instruction alone can lay claim to cultivate a balanced all - embracing many-sidedness . ''

		Dr.
Harris	PERSON	justly remarks , in the preface of the book next to be mentioned , '' a correct method is very important in higher education ; it is indispensable in pri - mary education . ''

		It is all right , indeed abso - lutely necessary , to lay stress on scholarship in selecting a college professor , but it is unsafe to forget , as some do , that there is a teaching art .

		There can be little doubt that at present the teaching found in the best public schools , as a whole , is much better than that found in colleges of the same grade of standing .

		To - gether with
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's '' Text Book in
Psychol	LOCATION	- ogy , '' which appeared in the `` International Series '' three years ago , these books furnish an excellent outline of the Herbartian system , by its authoritative expounders .

		The alternative title to Miss Blow 's '' Sym - 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, bolical Education '' shows that it is a contribu - tion to the steadily increasing volume of kin - dergarten literature .

		To appreciate some of the author 's names and headings requires something of that transcendental talent which abounded in
Froebel	LOCATION	.

		However , the leading ideas are clearly and forcibly put .

		Probably many readers will wonder what '' vortical education '' can be , and we fear that in some cases the feeling will sur - vive a reading of the chapter that bears that name .

		Still , we find here such paragraphs as this : '' Many mothers live for their children ; fewer live with their children ; fewer still per - mit their children to live with them .

		Yet noth - ing is more certain than that doing for chil - dren when dissociated from living with them breeds selfishness and fails to awaken love .

		Hu - man hearts can be knit together only by com - mon experiences and sympathies , and every mother would do well to adopt as her motto the words of Luther : ' God , that he might draw man to him , became man ; we , if we would draw children to us , must become children . ' ''

		The chapter called '' Atomism '' is a vigorous criticism of
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	's central ideas .

		Deserved stress is laid on the idea of '' Member-whole '' -LRB- ^ Gleidganzes * -RRB- , which the editor calls the deep - est and most fruitful in the philosophy of edu - cation .

		Dr.
Harris	PERSON	opens his preface with some statistics showing the progress that the kindergarten is making .

		Since 1872 the kin - dergartens in this country have increased from 42 to
3000	DATE	, the teachers from 73 to
5000	DATE	, and the pupils from
1252	DATE	to 100,000 .

		Still , we see no reason to swerve from the opinion that Froe - bel 's ideas , in the long run , will influence educa - tion far more indirectly through the primary school than directly through the kindergarten .

		Few Americans now living have had an equal educational experience with Dr.
E. E. White	PERSON	.

		He has taught in every grade of school from the bottom to the top of the scale , has served as a school superintendent and a college president , and has lectured to tens of thousands of teachers in institutes and
summer	DATE	schools .

		He was also for many years the editor of a widely and favorably known educational journal , and has reflected patiently and clearly on educational problems .

		Besides these qual - ities , he is also master of a clear and direct lit - erary style , and of rich sources of illustration .

		No man whom we can recall is so well fitted as he to write such a book as '' School Manage - ment . ''

		Very naturally , and also very properly , the standpoint of the book is that of the au - thor 's personal experience , observation , and study .

		In the best sense , it is a '' practical book for teachers , and all other persons inter - ested in the right training of the young . ''

		We are confident that there is no better book of the kind extant .

		Nearly two-thirds of the mat - ter is found in the chapter entitled '' Moral Instruction . ''

		The author is evidently in ac - cord with the opinion expressed by Dr.
Bain	PERSON	: '' The difficulties of moral teaching exceed in every way the difficulties of intellectual teach - ing .

		The method of proceeding is hampered by so many conditions , that it barely admits of precise demonstration or statement . ''

		This chap - ter will furnish the practical teacher , and the parent also , with more real practical help than any other similar discussion known to us .

		Dr.
White	PERSON	has a firm grasp of the problems of will - training and of motive .

		He declares in his preface that '' the two most obstructive foes of needed progress in school training are artift - cialism in motive and mechanism in method . ''

		There is also a chapter entitled '' Religion in the School . ''

		The book deserves the wide cir - culation that it is sure to command .

		Its timely appearance is proof that the new devotion to the science of education will not obscure teach - ing and school management as practical arts .

		THE ADVANCE IN EXPERIMENTAL .

		PSYCHOLOGY .

		* It is a lamentable fact that there exists in English no adequate text-book of experimental psychology .

		Although every important seat of learning in the country possesses its psycho - logical laboratory , and although there is con - siderable uniformity of doctrine in modern psychology , far more than could have been expected , seeing that the science is not half a century old , yet the extant text-books are almost as individual and arbitrary in selection and interpretation of facts as were the pre - scientific manuals , from
Aristotle	LOCATION	to
Herbart	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Kiilpe	PERSON	's book , the work of a pupil of Wundt and Miiller , should find a translator ; it is the best in the field .

		The worst that can be said of it is , that its author is too original a psychologist to be content with simple tran - scription and resumption : he can not resist the temptation of making , here and there , positive contributions to our psychological knowledge .

		Modern psychologists , almost without excep - * GRUNDRISS DER PSYCHOLOGIE , AUF EXPERIMENTELLER GRTTNDLAGE DARGESTELLT .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 tion , follow Wundt in dividing up the subject - matter of psychology into description and theory of elements , and description and theory of com - pounds .

		Description means here what it means in the natural sciences .

		By theory is meant the giving of the conditions , psychical and physical , under which a particular state or pro- cess of consciousness comes into being .

		The ele - ments of mind are , possibly , three : sensation , affection -LRB- pleasure - pain -RRB- , conation -LRB- effort -RRB- .

		Some psychologists -LRB-
Miinsterberg	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- seek to re - duce these to one : sensation .

		Others posit all three -LRB- Ladd -RRB- ; while others , again , regard sen - sation and conation as underivative , and treat of affection as an attribute of sensation , ap - pearing under certain circumstances -LRB- Wundt -RRB- .

		For Dr.
Kiilpe	PERSON	the elementary processes are those of sensation and affection , '' effort '' be - ing regarded as a complex of sensible qualities , and '' will '' -LRB- e. g. , in attention -RRB- as an inference from the phenomena of mental inhibition . ''

		Will '' is not given in experience ; it is the supposed psychical cause of these facts of in - hibition , which is hypostatised , and then intro - duced into experience .

		It must not be imagined that the psycholo - gist chooses his '' elements '' at random .

		The difficulty of decision points simply to the dif - ficulty of introspective analysis ; and this will grow less and less , as the methodology of the science is perfected .

		The radicalness of sen - sation is not disputed .

		That of pleasure and pain is arguable , but can , I think , be demon - strated .

		The existence of a separate conative process it is at present impossible either to prove or to disprove .

		Only we may be certain of one thing : that the final appeal must be , not to un - trained self-observation , but to experiment ; to controlled and repeated self - observation .

		If we find any set of experimental results , which can - not be adequately interpreted in terms of sensa - tion and pleasure-pain alone , we are justified in assuming the influence of a third process , which crosses and modifies these .

		Such results would be , e. g. , those of recent investigations into the so-called time-sense , or into the '' oscillations of attention . ''

		It is here , and among similar facts , that the criterion must be looked for ; and there is no reason to despair of its discovery .

		Of the 470 pages of his Grundriss , Dr.
Kiilpe	PERSON	devotes 250 to the elements of mind , 150 to their simpler and less permanent com - binations , and the rest to conscious '' states '' -LRB- attention , self-consciousness , sleep , hypnosis , etc. -RRB- Of the 250 , sensation claims 200 : its consideration , i. e. , occupies much less than half the book .

		And in this are included a long and masterly exposition of the psychophysical measurement methods , and a very original and thorough-going discussion of reproduction and association .

		It can never again , then , be made a reproach to experimental psychology , that it is incompetent to handle anything else than sen - sation .

		And yet why should the preponderance of the treatment of sensation , in a scientific psychology , be in itself a matter for reproach ?

		There are from fifty to a hundred thousand irre - ducible qualities of sensation : there are at best but two qualities of affection , and one of cona - tion .

		And even when sensations are grouped under modalities , by reference to the various sense-organs , we have qualities from those of sight , hearing , smell , taste , touch -LRB- skin and articular surface -RRB- , temperature , strain -LRB- ten - dons -RRB- , fatigue -LRB- muscle -RRB- , equilibrium -LRB- semi - circular canals -RRB- , and from the internal organs of the body .

		So that less must always be said of affection and conation than is said of sensa - tion : they have fewer qualities , of which any - thing can be said .

		The current objection ap - plies only to that pseudo-psychology which is based upon sensation statistics .

		These , it is true , can never supply trustworthy inferences for individual psychology .

		Le chiffre , c'est un grand mensonge is , perhaps , truer here than it was in its original connexion .

		The author distinguishes two forms of the combination of mental elements : the fusion and the association .

		In the former occurs a blending of the intensive and qualitative aspects of conscious content ; in the latter , an approxi - mation of their temporal or spatial attributes .

		The fusion is different from any of its constit - uents ; a new , total process overshadows the original , component processes -LRB- e. g. , a chord in music -RRB- .

		In the association , on the contrary , the primary factors become even more distinct than they were in their previous state of isola - tion -LRB- cf. the contrast of colors upon a playing card -RRB- .

		Emotion and impulse are thus analyzed as fusions ; our space-constructions and volun - tary actions as associations .

		The distinction promises to become fundamental in future psy - chologies .

		Dr.
Kiilpe	PERSON	's treatment is necessar - ily condensed , but none the less clear and con - tinuous .

		The book is not '' easy reading , '' even for the comparatively advanced student ; but it will amply repay labor spent upon it .

		It is well printed , and contains a good index in addition to the table of contents .

		306 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, STUDIES ix SOCIAL SCIENCE .

		* With exaggerated optimism , Mr.
W. H. Mallock	PERSON	, in writing of '' Labour and the Popular Welfare , '' attempts to brush away all efforts for a fairer dis - tribution of wealth .

		He claims that rent secures in
Great Britain	LOCATION	only two and one-fourth per cent of the national income ; whereas Mr.
Giffin	PERSON	's figures , on which Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's estimate is based , giving 65,039,000 as the total income of lands , are entirely misleading . ''

		Lands '' in the British income-tax include farm-houses , but not urban land or railroad or mineral or forest lands , which far exceed the value of agricultural land .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	further arouses suspicion by all manner of calculations as to how little of wealth would be each one 's share on an equal '' divvy , '' and how difficult or impossible it would be to divide equally among a million peo - ple some costly mantle or carpet in the palace of a duke .

		Because the much greater annual product per capita to-day over a century ago can be ascribed to brain-power and the growth of capital , more than to increased efficiency of manual labor , the author endorses , with some exceptions , the general propo - sition that all the results of past ability should of right be the monopoly of living ability , though he holds that , in fact , labor is securing a larger and larger proportion of the product .

		This conclusion radically differs from that of the best American authority on the subject , Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	of the
U. S. Mortgage Census	ORGANIZATION	, who in the
December	DATE	number of the `` Political Science Quarterly '' estimates that nine per cent of our population own seventy-one per cent of our country 's wealth , and 3-100 of one per cent , or 4,097 families , own one-fifth of it , or seven - tenths as much as 11,593,887 families .

		And accord - ing to the same authority , this inequality is much greater than it was twenty and forty years ago .

		In marked contrast with
Mallock	ORGANIZATION	's book is that on '' The Labor Movement , '' by Mr.
L. T. Hob	PERSON	- house , an
M.A.	LOCATION	, and
Fellow of Merton College	ORGANIZATION	, Ox - ford .

		Writing from the standpoint of the mod - erate Fabian Socialists , and at the same time being well read in
Marshall	LOCATION	and other recent economists , Mr.
Hobhouse	PERSON	presents the most reasonable discus - sion of trades unions , cooperation , and gradual ex - tension of societary action , that has yet appeared * LABOUR AND THE POPULAR WELFARE .

New York	LOCATION	:

		from the Fabian standpoint .

		Nothing is said of
Karl Marx	PERSON	's exploded theory of surplus value ; and where any really great changes in industrial organ - ization are advocated , their full realization is con - sidered so distant and their precise form so uncer - tain , while the justice underlying the proposed changes is so strongly presented , as to disarm much criticism .

		How far a better educated society than ours will be able to work out the suggestions of the Fabians , depends much on the extent to which am - bition for social honor , place , and difference of sal - ary , will equal in motive force the profit-making ambition of present business .

		We may not all be so confident on this point as Mr.
Hobhouse	PERSON	, but we can not fail to be stimulated by his treatment of it .

		A brief quotation or two will show his point of view .

		He does not favor the poor because of su - perior worth , but because of greater need .

		Admit - ting that improved environment is only an antece - dent condition for the development of moral forces , and does not of necessity produce such improved morality , he says : '' There is no spite in the Labor movement of to-day , but there is a strong sense of the poverty and misery around us , and a clear conviction that a better use might be made of our enormous wealth .

		We have no wish to send the rich empty away , but , cost what it may , we are determined to fill the hungry with some of the good things of life ... Collective control has not so much to make people good and happy , as to establish the necessary conditions of goodness and happiness , leaving it to individual effort and voluntary association to de - velop freely and spontaneously all the fair flower and fruit of human intercourse and knowledge and beauty which can
spring	DATE	from a sound root firmly planted in life-giving earth . ''

		The work on the growth and outcome of Social - ism , by the well-known writers Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	and Mr.
E. B. Bax	PERSON	, is most disappointing .

		Its historical part lacks in judicial and philosophical breadth and candor .

		The present private owner - ship of capital and land is treated as a conspiracy , against which even violence is not blameworthy , rather than as an historical evolution whose work is certainly not yet accomplished , however great may be some of its evils .

		At least until a new so - cial conscience and a far greater intelligence among the people are developed , all true students must agree that such private ownership is a necessity .

		Our authors appear to rejoice at the passage by the Commune of `` enactments of a distinctly socialistic nature , involving the suspension of contracts , aboli - tion of rents , and confiscation of the means of pro- duction '' ; while the destruction of the
Column Vendome	ORGANIZATION	, `` that base piece of Napoleonic uphol - stery , '' is spoken of as '' another mark of the deter - mination to hold no parley with the old jingo legends . ''

		The surplus-value theory of
Marx	ORGANIZATION	, over - thrown by Boehm-Bawerk and others before him , and no longer insisted on by many Fabian Social - ists , is endorsed here .

		The authors present many suggestions and ideals for the future .

		A gradual
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 evolution , with possibly some degree of violence at a late stage , will , it is thought , practically eradicate our capitalistic system .

		Our present national gov - ernment will largely disappear ; instead will come a universal federative
State	ORGANIZATION	, in which industry will be conducted by villages or cities and by trade asso - ciations .

		Our authors appear at their best when outlining the past and future of art and the mission of machinery pages presumably written in large part by the artist-poet
Morris	PERSON	.

		The growing power of women in the domain of social science is well illustrated in the fact that they are the authors of four of the seven books included in the present review .

		In `` Industrial Arbitration and Conciliation , '' Mrs.
Lowell	PERSON	, after briefly sum - marizing the work of the famous boards of concil - iation and arbitration in the
North of England	LOCATION	, gives for the first time , in English at least , an account of a successful experiment of the same kind among the ignorant and poorly-paid miners of
Belgium	LOCATION	, in the collieries of Bascoup and
Mariemont	LOCATION	.

		Where success lias been attained in these methods of in - dustrial peace , it is shown to be largely due to the readiness of the employer to deal considerately , and on terms of equality , with committees of his men and of labor organizations .

		The most valuable part of the book for Americans is the clear account of the formation and working of the system of conciliation and yearly contracts between organizations of em - ployers and of men in some of the building trades of
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	, where employers have found it decidedly to their interest to recognize the unions , to employ none but union men at eight and nine hours a day , and have yearly contracts and standing committees of conference and conciliation with the representatives of the unions .

		Even where the contractors felt justified in crushing a certain union in
New York	LOCATION	because of its alleged arbitrary character , they at once helped reorganize it .

		Mrs.
Lowell	PERSON	should get out a new edition of her work , incorporating studies of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	boards of arbitration , such as she in part at - tempted in her paper before the
American Social Science Association	ORGANIZATION	in
1891	DATE	.

		The remarkable his - tory of conciliation in the
Ohio	LOCATION	and
Western Penn	LOCATION	- sylvania coal fields , which the reviewer once tried to cover for its first three years up to
1889	DATE	, should also be included and brought down to date .

		Un - fortunately , the best-known example hitherto of con - cilation in
America	LOCATION	the arrangement of the slid - ing-scale in steel and iron work has been greatly shattered by the weakness of the Amalgamated As - sociation and the arbitrary action of the
Carnegie Company	ORGANIZATION	at
Homestead	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Helen Campbell	PERSON	has drawn from the little - read reports of our various bureaus of labor statis - tics , and from other original sources , a vivid account of '' Women Wage-Earners '' in
America	LOCATION	.

		In a new edition , which we understand she contemplates issu - ing , we hope she may not only incorporate the fig - ures on the subject , now just appearing , of the cen - sus of
1890	DATE	, but may add the little that can be gathered of facts about women in our trades-unions , and may also consider the optimistic side of wo - men 's work brought out by Miss
Katherine Coman	PERSON	of
Wellesley	LOCATION	before the
Labor Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION
last summer	DATE	.

		Miss
Balch	PERSON	has given us an excellent summary of the history and principles underlying the relief of the unemployed and needy in
France	LOCATION	, which is especially timely just now .

		Two principles every - where appear in French poor-relief .

		One is the lack of recognition of any duty by society to provide for the pauper class .

		The state department and com - mune largely aid private charities , but are not dis - turbed as they would be , in theory at least , in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, in case no provision whatever for pau - perism should exist in hundreds of communes , or in - adequate provision in others .

		The second principle is the strict control by the state and minor public bod - ies of all private charity .

		All are supervised by pub - lic officials ; and without their consent no money can be collected , even in churches , for charitable pur - poses .

		Although there appear to be fewer paupers in
France	LOCATION	than in
England	LOCATION	, it can not with any certainty be ascribed to this system of relief .

		French thrift a racial characteristic , stimulated by admirable school and postal savings-banks and public pawn - shops , briefly touched upon in this monograph seem more responsible .

		In fact , there has of late in
France	LOCATION	been some approach to the English sys - tem ; but that amusing terror over any socialistic measures , which is the outcome of so many revolu - tions , and , as Professor
Gide	PERSON	has shown , has bound nearly all French economists hard and fast to the car of extreme conservatism , operates also to prevent recognition of any duty of the state to the poor .

		Although Miss
Balch	PERSON	does not make the comment , it seems as if the very refusal of the state to actually undertake much poor-relief is driving it into a greater interference with real liberty , through its resulting control of private philanthrophy , than would follow from the nominally mere socialistic English and American plan , however great the shortcomings in execution of this English system .

		Miss
Julie Sutter	PERSON	, in `` A Colony of Mercy , or Social Christianity at Work , '' has shown how Ger - many has well-nigh completely solved the problem of the proper care of both the professional tramp and of the far more important honest traveller in search of work .

		There are three parts to the Ger - man system : the
Labor Colonies	ORGANIZATION	, of which there are now twenty-six ; the
Relief Stations	ORGANIZATION	, of which there are two thousand ; and the Homes , of which there are four hundred .

		Pastor
von Bodelschwingh	PERSON	, the hero of Miss
Sutter	PERSON	's book , was chiefly con - cerned in developing the
Labor Colonies	ORGANIZATION	by his wonderful success in the first of them at
Bethel	LOCATION	, near
Bielefeld	LOCATION	in
Westphalia	LOCATION	.

		Started in
1867	DATE	as a home for epileptics , other features were from time to time added .

		The
Labor Colony	ORGANIZATION	, called Wilhelmsdorf named for the then Crown Prince , 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	,
Frederick William	PERSON	was started in
1882	DATE	, to reclaim to honest livelihood the submerged population of the district .

		No one is allowed to stay in any one colony more than a year and eleven months , and may leave at any time , with the right to draw through the postoffice , at any safe distance from any outlying saloons , the small earnings allowed besides board .

		He needs no money immediately , thanks to the
Relief Stations	ORGANIZATION	, as he can tramp all over
Germany	LOCATION	without a penny in his pocket , if hon - estly in search of work .

		By no means all are re - claimed , but military discipline and the industrious habits required at the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	work wonderful re - sults .

		Bodelschwingh showed the magistrates of the province that under favorable conditions economy pointed toward the providing of work for the beg - gar , instead of letting him prey upon the people .

		A grant was made by the province , and the success of the venture was so far proved that each of the other twenty-five colonies , started by private action , has received grants from the province upon organ - ization , and subsidies , as there is need .

		Much is done by private effort and contribution , but public reports are rendered annually , and the colonies are to all intent public organizations .

		This state aid and supervision is claimed to be one element of their great success .

		Ten thousand unemployed pass through them yearly .

		An outgrowth of this work , the
Natural	ORGANIZATION	- Verpflegungs Station , or Relief Station , must be referred to .

		They extend all over the land , but a half - day 's journey apart , where the tramp or unemployed may stay one night , working a half - day for his lodging and meals .

		He then must pass to the next station , first having his name recorded in a book , or receiving a vagrancy certificate , which he carries .

		Each station is an employment agency for its own district , and the probability is that un - less he be a willing idler he will find some work in the course of his tramp .

		If he is proved an invet - erate tramp , the workhouse is likely to receive him at last .

		These stations partly support themselves by work done , the deficiency being supplied by the district , all realizing that '' it is cheaper to aid your beggar than to let him beg . ''

		Eight thousand on the average stay in these Stations every night .

		A still more advanced form of help is the
Herberge zur Heimath	PERSON	, or Homes , where the journeyman ar - tisan , travelling for work , may lodge at lowest pos - sible rates .

		These Homes are not forms of parish relief , as are the others , but rather are efforts to supply food and lodging to the recipient at mere cost , and also to furnish for resident workmen in the neighborhood a chance to smoke , buy a single glass of beer if sober , and secure the light and com - panionship which in
America	LOCATION	are only to be found in the saloon .

		The 13,000 beds in these places are always full , the price for meals and lodging being
thirty-six cents	MONEY	a day .

		Miss Sutter strongly em - phasizes throughout the work that the Labor Col - ony , and nearly all of the many other lines of work carried on at
Bethel	LOCATION	, which unfortunately can not be touched upon here , owe their success and wide - spread influence primarily to the wonderful self - devotion of Pastor von Bodelschwingh , united to his remarkable ability as a financier and business manager ; and she is convinced that no such work could hope for similar success without some such strong personality at the helm .

		This country bids fair to discover before long that the same spirit has been working quietly , and is making itself widely felt in such work as is being done at
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	and a few other such settlements .

		Miss
Suiter	PERSON	's book is fascinating in interest , and most valuable in suggestion to all students of the problem of the unemployed .

		BRIEFS oisr NEW BOOKS .

		The Schoolmmter Two neatly - printed volumes , both in Literature , and by the same author and publishers Folklore studies .

		-LRB-
American Book Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , are worthy of being commended to the attention of the teacher and the general reader .

		The one is en - titled `` The Schoolmaster in Literature , '' and con - tains choice selections from the writings of
Ascham	LOCATION	,
Moliere , Fuller	ORGANIZATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Shenstone	LOCATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, Cow - per ,
Pestalozzi	LOCATION	, Page ,
Mitford	LOCATION	,
Bronte	LOCATION	'' ,
Hughes	PERSON	, .

		Dickens ,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
George Eliot	PERSON	, and others , with an introduction by Dr.
Edward Eggles	PERSON	- ton .

		The compilation is made to show '' the part played by the schoolmaster in the literature of di - verse ages and of different nations . ''

		As stated by Dr.
Eggleston	PERSON	, '' it is quite worth while to take the ideal of a good schoolmaster constructed by quaint old
Thomas Fuller	PERSON	, and put it alongside the
Blim	PERSON	- bers , and to place
Shenstone	PERSON	's village school , ' Where sits the dame disguised in look profound , And eyes her fairy throng and turns her wheel around , ' in juxtaposition with the immaculate Miss
Pinker	PERSON	- ton 's most respectable seat of learning in
Chiswick Mall	ORGANIZATION	, or with quaint old
Bartle Mussey	ORGANIZATION	's night - school for full-grown men . ''

		Teachers ' reading - circles will find an abundance of amusement and instruction in this work .

		The other volume is - '' Readings in Folk-lore , '' being a series of short studies on the mythology of
America	LOCATION	, Great Brit - ain , the Norse countries ,
Germany	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
Syria	LOCATION	, .


Egypt	LOCATION	, and
Persia	LOCATION	, with selections from standard literature relating thereto .

		The author , Mr.
Hubert M. Skinner	PERSON	, has given in this work a very fair con - ception of the mythology and folk-lore of the va - rious peoples mentioned .

		The meaning of mythology and folk-lore is presented with fulness and accuracy , and the selections show to what use these things can be put by the poet .

		The selection has been made with excellent judgment .

		Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	some - times goes astray in orthography as when he writes
Frigga	LOCATION	for Frigg , the wife of
Odin	PERSON	, Hela for Hel , .

		the goddess of death ; but in such things many emi - nent writers have stumbled , and the blemishes are not of a kind to mar the work materially .

		Correc - tions should , however , be made in a new edition .

		THE DIAL 309 The life of
Joseph E. Johnston	PERSON	, by * obert M ' Hu S hes > in the `` Great Commanders series -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , may serve a useful purpose in removing the impres - sion , which the general history of the Civil War is apt to produce , that
Johnston	PERSON	was an unsuccessful commander ; an estimate as unjust as that which would place him on a level with
Washington	LOCATION	,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	,
Thomas	PERSON	, or Lee .

		Like
McClellan	PERSON	,
Johnston	PERSON	was a good organizer ; but as a general in the field it is doubtful if he was in any way great .

		Like Mc - Clellan , he seems never to have thought he had forces enough to do what he was set to do ; although it must be confessed that he estimated the forces opposed to him more accurately than
McClellan	PERSON	was usually able to do .

		General
Johnston	PERSON	was careful , however , of such forces as he commanded ; and this may account for the caution of Sherman while conducting operations against him .

		But if
John	PERSON	- ston was not a great general , he always proved him - self a good soldier ; his plans seem to have been well formed , and based on correct theories of strat - egy .

		He deserves the credit of winning the first battle of
Manassas	LOCATION	if , indeed , that fight can be truly called a victory for the Confederates , who were left in possession of the field .

		His conduct of the re - treat up the Peninsular , and of the battle of
Seven Pines	LOCATION	to the moment of his being wounded and forced to relinquish the command , was such as per - haps to justify his biographer in claiming that had he continued in command he would have scored a substantial triumph .

		As regards the part played by
Johnston	PERSON	in the
Vicksburg	LOCATION	campaign , it should be remarked that the forces he controlled were too few to enable him to accomplish any substantial result , and
Pemberton	PERSON	's disobedience prevented the saving of the army he commanded , which would probably have been effected had
Johnston	PERSON	's directions been followed .

		The conduct of the retreat from
Dalton	LOCATION	to
Atlanta	LOCATION	seems to be the achievement on which
General Johnston	ORGANIZATION	's reputation as a military leader must always chiefly rest .

		In reading Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	's account of this exploit , one can not help feeling that not one movement made by the Confederate army was wrong , and that every movement was managed with great skill ; yet General Hood , who relieved General
Johnston	PERSON	, in his book , '' Advance and Re - treat , '' claims with considerable force that the con - stant withdrawal from before the enemy demoralized the Confederates , and was more injurious than the loss of many lives would have been .

		The reader can not fail to admire the personal character of Gen - eral
Johnston	PERSON	.

		He served the cause he had espoused faithfully and zealously ; he was able to bear injus - tice and slights with dignity and patience , and in the end to accept the results of the war with good faith and resignation , and to serve his reunited country with credit to her and to himself , winning the respect and confidence of his late adversaries , and holding the love and confidence of his state and section to the end of a long and useful life .

		The nth century Mr -
Henry Offley Wakeman	PERSON	has in European dealt with the fifth of the eight '' Pe - riods of European History '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- to be covered by the series of volumes which Mr.
Arthur Hassall	PERSON	is now editing .

		Mr.
Wake	PERSON	- man 's period is , roughly , the seventeenth century ; exactly , the years 1598-1715 .

		It is '' the period when
Europe	LOCATION	, shattered in its political and religious ideas by the Reformation , reconstructed its political system upon the principle of territorialism under the rule of absolute monarchs .

		It opens with
Henry IV.	PERSON	, it closes with
Peter	PERSON	the Great .

		It is , therefore , the century in which the principal European States took the form and acquired the position in
Europe	LOCATION	which they have held more or less up to the present time .

		A century in which
France	LOCATION	takes the lead in European affairs , and enters on a course of em - bittered rivalry with
Germany	LOCATION	, in which
England	ORGANIZATION	assumes a position of first importance in the affairs of
Europe	LOCATION	, in which the Emperor , ousted from all effect - ive control over German politics , finds the true cen - tre of his power on the
Danube	LOCATION	, in which
Prussia	LOCATION	becomes the dominant state in
north Germany	LOCATION	, in which
Russia	LOCATION	begins to drive in the Turkish outposts on the Pruth and the Euxine a century , in short , which saw the birth of the Franco-German Question and of the
Eastern Question	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This passage from the opening chapter shows the main lines upon which Mr.
Wakeman	PERSON	has dealt with the subject .

		He has left out some things , such as ''
Portugal	LOCATION	and the Pa - pacy , the internal affairs of
Spain	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	. '

		* It must also be remembered that the history of En - gland enters only incidentally into the plan of the series to which this volume belongs .

		The develop - ment of the French monarchy is naturally the cen - tral subject of the work .

		The style is pleasing , and the book more readable than manuals of such com - pactness are likely to be .

		The author 's judgments are now and then open to question , as when he gives Turgot less credit as a minister of finance than is accorded to Sully or
Colbert	LOCATION	, or when he makes the statement that the monarchies of
Europe	LOCATION	are now as absolute as they were in the seventeenth cen - tury .

		This statement is really extraordinary .

		Child-life in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		`` The Wee Ones of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Har - per -RRB- , by Mae St.
John Brain	PERSON	hall , is principally , if not entirely , a reprint of a series of articles recently published in '' Har - per 's Bazaar . ''

		The subject is written up , with the exception of an occasional `` gush , '' in a charming way ; and is finely illustrated by Mr.
C. D. Weldon	PERSON	, with typical Japanese pictures .

		The work is marred by errors , mostly typographical , in the translitera - tion of Japanese words .

		But , in spite of these mi - nor faults , the book is interesting ; and , though it gives nothing specially new , it shows that the author has gained a clear insight into the life and spirit of Japanese children .

		Having '' omitted all mention of the ' made-over ' Japanese child '' with knee - breeches , shoes , stockings , etc. , the author succeeds 310 -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, A volume of sprightly essays .

		in giving a good picture of the child-life of old
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The five chapters , extending over 136 pages , tell of the indoor and outdoor games and sports of Japa - nese children ; of the family life , with its '' sternest discipline and frolicsome joyousness '' ; of the physi - cal appearance , the dress , the diet , the mental and moral training of the hoys and girls ; of their recre - ations , such as theatre-going , card-playing -LRB- more in - structive than amusing , like our `` Authors , '' '' Logo - machy , '' etc. -RRB- , temple-outings , feasts of flowers -LRB- each in its season -RRB- ; of the Feast of Dolls -LRB- for girls only -RRB- ; of the Feast of Flags -LRB- for boys only -RRB- ; of the New Year 's festivities for all , even children of a larger growth ; and of the ceremonial and hereditary po - liteness in private and in public .

		There are also interesting digressions with reference to the be - loved Empress , who , childless , is the kind mother of 41,000,000 people , and the sympathizing helper especially of the 20,000,000 and more of women of that land ; and to the law and ethics -LRB- if there were any -RRB- of the married state , which , so far as the woman is concerned , is appropriately called , not '' wedlock , '' but '' padlock . ''

		In the style of sprightly allusiveness made familiar of late by the essays of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	, and Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	, are the papers included by Mr.
W. P. James	PERSON	in his volume of `` Romantic Professions '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		These eight essays , which are re - printed magazine articles , are remarkable for finish and point ; their writer has a sort of genius for style , and there is not a dull page in his book .

		For the rest , they are the kind of thing that may be pro- duced by any man who will keep a note-book , and , when enough instances have accumulated under some particular head , will take the pains to serve up his facts in an attractive way , seasoning them with satire , sentiment , and wit .

		It must be admit - ted that Mr.
James	PERSON	does the seasoning unusually well .

		A pleasant example of the author 's manner is this opening paragraph from the closing essay : '' A writer in the ' Daily News , ' for reasons of his own , entered a protest lately against what he called the Magnum Opus theory .

		A man 's friends and acquaintances , he complained , were continually urg - ing him to write a Great Work .

		It was in vain that the victim protested that he did not want to write a Great Work ; or that he had written a Great Work which nobody ever heard of ; or that he could not live -LRB- in this mortal state -RRB- by a Great Work , and must produce things which would yield him his daily bread .

		He might have added that if he did write one , the very last to read it would be these same monitors . ''

		We have had collections of French , ?

		talian > G erma n , and Dutch humor in the '' Humour '' series -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and have read them with an occasional gleam of intelligence , but predominated by the feeling always experienced by the uninitiated in the presence of work that is clearly esoteric in its appeal .

		Neither the humor nor the lyric poetry of one race can ever be successfully put into the language of another .

		The only way to get at them , to pluck out the heart of their mystery , is to read one 's self into the languages to which they belong , and view them in the light of the body of associations that cluster about those languages .

		A volume of '' American Humour '' has just been prepared for this series by Mr.
James Barr	PERSON	, and here , at least , the American reader may feel at home .

		The selection is a good one , for it minimizes the newspaper variety of our native hu - mor that stands for the species with many innocent persons , and gives us good examples from such men as
Saxe	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Irving	PERSON	, `` Artemas Ward , '' and
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	.

		Even Hawthorne figures in the collection , and , after the first shock is over , we must recognize the distinctly humorous quality of Mr.
Higginbotham	PERSON	's '' Catastrophe , '' the piece chosen to represent our most serious writer and greatest literary artist .

		Among living humorists , we have good examples from Messrs.
Harte	PERSON	,
Clemens	PERSON	, War - ner ,
Bunner	PERSON	,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Howells	LOCATION	, Cable , and
Holmes	PERSON	.

		There is also a really useful bibliographical index , the first dictionary of American humorists -LRB- as far as we know -RRB- that has ever been made .

		It includes nearly two hundred writers -LRB- many more than are represented by selections -RRB- , among them such unex - pected names as those of Major Andre '' , President
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	,
Mather Byles	PERSON	, Mr.
Chauncey Depew	PERSON	, and
Thomas Morton	PERSON	`` of Clifford 's Inne , gent , '' upon the strength of his ridicule of the
Puri	PERSON	- tans !

		A few Canadians are included in this index .

		Selections ^ r >
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	, to whose from Gray , caref ul study of the English Roman - prose and verse .

		tic Movement we called attention a few weeks ago , has edited for the '' Athenaeum Press '' series -LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- a volume of selections from Gray , in both prose and verse .

		He gives as an excuse for this edition the fact that Gray 's prose and verse are not commonly found in one volume ; but still better reasons are provided by the carefully - edited text -LRB- which is '' closer to the original editions than anything published since Gray 's death '' -RRB- , by the exposure of some more of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's blunders , by the study of
Gray	ORGANIZATION	's literary development , and by the helpful body of annotations .

		In his introduc - tion , Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	opposes
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's theory of Gray 's sterility , and accounts for the fact in a more com - monplace but more convincing way . ''

		Gray was a scholar , devoted to solitary research , and severely critical ; this kind of temperament is not primarily creative , and does not toss off immortal poems every few weeks . ''

		But possibly the prosaic spirit of the age had something to do with it also .

		An interest - ing chapter of the book is contributed by Professor
G. L. Kittredge	PERSON	, who discusses '' Gray 's Knowledge of Old Norse , '' and incidentally shows that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	is weak in one of his own special strongholds .

		The statement of the latter that '' The Fatal Sisters '' and '' The Descent of Odin '' were translated direct from the Icelandic is shown to be entirely baseless .

		THE DIAL 311 A transition Anyone first seeing the title of the period in the Rev. Dr.
John H. Overton	PERSON	's '' The English Church .

		English Church in the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- would be apt to wonder why its author had not waited until the century had closed before attempting to write its history .

		And when , upon closer examination , it is revealed that this is a sketch of the English Church in the first third only of the present century , it would appear that the title was a misnomer .

		Be this as it may , the book has a peculiar mission to perform , some - what analogous to that of the historical books in the
Apocryphas	LOCATION	.

		And it fulfils this mission admir - ably , furnishing a detailed picture of a period hith - erto much slighted by historical writers .

		Dr.
Overton	PERSON	not only emphasizes the importance of a knowledge of this period as necessary to a full appreciation of the lively times that followed in the Tractarian Movement , but he actually relieves his subject of much of its dulness .

		It must be admitted that his careful attention to men who are otherwise unknown gives to his work something of the character of a local history , and rather emphasizes the insularity of the English Church ; still , the book comes op - portunely , and properly belongs on the same shelf with
Dean Church	ORGANIZATION	's `` Oxford Movement , ''
Liddon	PERSON	's `` Pusey , '' and
Prothero	PERSON	's `` Dean Stanley . ''

Va.	LOCATION	, both be - fore and after the war , a Brigadier-General
C. S. A.	PERSON	and Chief of Artillery in the
Army of Northern Virginia	ORGANIZATION	during that great struggle , and sometime professor in several institutions of learning , bears a striking resemblance to that of
Leonidas Polk	PERSON	, Bishop and General , whose biography was recently reviewed in THE DIAL .

		The Memoirs of Pendie - ton -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , prepared by his daughter , Mrs.
Lee	PERSON	, are more in the nature of family memoirs than is the biography of
Polk	LOCATION	.

		The point of view from which they are written is emphatically Southern , though undoubtedly the pictures given of the hor - rors of the war are accurate .

		A little more careful editing of documents might have been done in the interests of good English .

		It gives one something of a shock to find a learned Bishop writing , '' It looks like it may be my duty '' to do something which he names ; and a boy 's remark , '' I thought you was dead , '' might judiciously have been cor - rected before being put into cold print .

		The author of '' The Adventures in
Algiers	LOCATION	of
Matthew Dudgeon	PERSON	, Gent . ''

		-LRB- Longmans -RRB- , a tale `` now for the first time printed , '' shows a very pretty talent for drawing the long bow .

		The story of a man taken by Algerine pirates and sold into slavery in
Morocco	LOCATION	is not exactly a new one ; but the present writer has managed to furbish up the old theme accept - ably , and he has added a variation in the shape of the corresponding tales told by his supposed f ellow - A volume of astonishing adventures .

		captives a Kurd , a Spaniard , a German , a noble lady of
Florence	LOCATION	, etc. .

		While hardly up to
Miin	PERSON	- chausen in point of mendacity , Master Dudgeon nevertheless does pretty well , as the following may testify : '' One thing occurred during the fight which I did then look upon as of evil omen : at a broadside which we both fired at the same instant , one of their shot met one of ours in mid-air , and in the encounter split in two pieces , one of which flew back upon our captain and killed him .

		Truly it was a marvellous chance that he should thus be slain by one of his own shot . ''

		A carper might suggest that the inci - dent itself was scarcely so `` marvellous '' as the eye - sight that followed it .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Completion of
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's ''

		The last five received by us are ''
Quen	PERSON	- tin Durward , '' '' St.
Ronan	PERSON	's Well , '' '' Redgauntlet , '' '' The Betrothed and
Highland Widow	LOCATION	, '' and that old - time favorite of all healthy youth , `` The Talisman . ''

		Each of these volumes has its special set of original drawings , those of '' The Talisman , '' for example , being ten in number , the work of Mr.
Godfrey C. Hindley	PERSON	.

		Mr.

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
May 10 , 1894	DATE	.

		The Copyright questions touched upon in my last letter have brought me further information as to the working of the Act of
1891	DATE	.

		A sufficient time has now passed to enable publishers generally to understand what methods of procedure to follow in securing them - selves and their authors here and abroad .

		Single stories , poems , and articles in English periodicals , which have not been '' placed '' in the
United States	LOCATION	, are now sent over in advance to this country , put in type , and issued in pamphlet form on the day of the periodical 's publi - cation in
England	LOCATION	, thus securing copyright here for the same matter when subsequently issued in book form .

		It is becoming more and more dangerous to reprint such articles from English magazines , especially if the au - thors are distinguished .

		All this has , of course , become the a b c of the trade among publishers ; but it will be in the nature of information to many of the writing guild .

		Such copyrighted matter as that just mentioned is published here in three different ways : first , by the American branch of the English house ; second , by an American publishing house which is the agent of the English firm ; third , by the private agent of the English publisher .

		In any case protection is legally secured .

		So thoroughly do the English houses understand this question , and in so many cases have they established branch firms here for the publication of their own books , that a leading
Boston	LOCATION	author was tempted to remark to the head of a large American publishing house that the chief effect of the International Copyright Act seemed to be to enable English publishing firms to establish branch houses here , manufacture duplicate plates , and flood the market with English books .

		This is only par - tially true , however , as most English publishers still prefer to issue their books through American houses , who manufacture the plates for both sides of the ocean .

		As to American authors , they no longer have to com - pete with five-cent editions of current books by leading English authors , but issue their works in even competi - tion with the latter .

		In view of the working of the Act , there may be a modicum of wisdom in requiring plates to be manufactured in this country , as otherwise we might be swamped by cheap English sheets in a way to shut off American authors and publishers from fair competition .

		These are the views of a protectionist , however , and I understand that those interested in copy - right reform insist that protection and free trade ought not to enter into the question .

		International Copyright is now secured between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, Bel - gium ,
Switzerland	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		x The Amer - ican
Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	, so its secretary tells me , is now working for copyright with
Greece	LOCATION	,
Norway	LOCATION	and
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Austria	LOCATION	.


Russia	LOCATION	is considered hope - less on account of the press-censorship .


Austria	LOCATION	, I be - lieve , objects to the printing clause .

		Oddly enough , the printing clause is not considered a grave objection by the Spanish authorities , but they do object seriously to the requirement that American editions of Spanish books be registered at
Washington	LOCATION	and the fee paid be - fore copyright can be secured .

		In most international copyright agreements between European countries , reg - istration in the author 's country is all that is necessary for protection in other countries .

		Our late minister to
Spain	LOCATION	, the Hon.
E. Burd Grubb	PERSON	, was unable to overcome this objection on the part of the Spanish authorities .

		It has been suggested that a certificate of copyright from the
United States	LOCATION	consul at
Madrid	LOCATION	, or from the Span - ish minister of foreign affairs , could be made to serve at
Washington	LOCATION	by a special act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The bene - fit would accrue chiefly to Spanish authors , so that Span - ish hindrance seems absurd .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	, by the way , has passed the bill giving Li - brarian Spofford an increased clerical force in the Copy - right department , although the
House	ORGANIZATION	reduced the ap - propriation
$ 10,000	MONEY	, 1 think , it was one-third .

		This increase will be very helpful to Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	, and he proposes to make it serve if possible .

		Business in the Copyright department had reached a point of arrears in which it required six months to reach and return the copyright certificates sent in by publishers .

		Among forthcoming books to be published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is '' The Friendship of Nature , '' by
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	, a daughter of the late Dr.
Samuel Osgood	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, who exerted a wide influence in literary and scientific circles .

		Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	's book has for its sub-title '' A
Chronicle of New England Birds	ORGANIZATION	and Flowers , '' and will appeal strongly to sentimental lovers of Nature .

		There will be an edition de luxe lim - ited to 250 copies .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons will issue on
May 25	DATE	the authorized translation of the Rev.
Paul Sabatier	PERSON	's '' Life of Saint
Francis	PERSON	of
Assissi	LOCATION	, '' which has passed through several editions in
Paris	LOCATION	and created much talk in clerical circles .


Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	has remarked of it that '' for long , very long , nothing has moved me so deeply as this lofty , simple story . ''

		The same firm will publish , in quite another line , '' The Navigator 's Pocket-Book , '' by Captain
Howard Patterson	PERSON	.

		It is in - tended especially as a handy guide for yachtsmen , among whom Captain
Patterson	PERSON	has classes in navigation .

		Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are also bringing out a popular series of fiction for
summer	DATE	reading , of which the books by
Bliss Perry	ORGANIZATION	and
Noah Brooks	PERSON	, already announced , form the opening volumes .

Allen C. Thomas	PERSON	, Professor of History in
Haverford College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The aim of this work is to give the main facts of the history of the
United States	LOCATION	clearly , accurately , and impartially .

		In the belief that the importance of the events which have occurred since the adoption of the Constitution is be - coming more and more recognized , much the greater part of the book is devoted to the era beginning with
1789	DATE	.

		The earlier period , however , is treated with suf - ficient fulness to show clearly the origins of the people and their institutions .

		Throughout special attention is given to the political , social , and economic development of the nation .

		314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, We take the following note from '' The Book-Buyer '' : '' A very interesting contribution to a knowledge of
Sid	PERSON	- ney
Lanier	PERSON	's life and work has come into the possession of ' The Atlantic Monthly , ' and will appear in two sum - mer numbers .

		It consists of many letters written by
Lanier	PERSON	to Mr.
Gibson Peacock	PERSON	, editor of the Philadel - phia ' Evening Bulletin . '

		Through the most active years of the poet 's life , Mr.
Peacock	PERSON	and he were intimate friends .

		From Mrs.
Peacock	PERSON	, the letters , full of detail and rich in all that reveals the writer 's nature , came to Mr.
W. R. Thayer	PERSON	, editor of ' The Harvard Graduates ' Magazine , ' who has prepared them , with an introduc - tion , for print .

		It seems indeed as if the whirligig of time were well at work when a magazine so identified with the North finds the opportunity of rendering gladly a great service to the memory of a poet so distinctly associated with the South . ''

		A LITERARY PARABLE .

		The following '' literary parable '' is contributed to '' The Writer '' by Miss
Harriet Cushman Wilkie	PERSON	: '' One
spring	DATE	morning a farmer knocks at the kitchen door of a city house , with a basket of fresh-laid eggs for sale .

		The mistress expresses delight at obtaining them , declaring , however , that it is her invariable cus - tom to pay for articles after they have appeared on her table , and then only such a price as she thinks fit .

		Ex - pecting an early settlement under those conditions , and being in need of cash for the interest on the mortgage on his farm , the man accepts the lady 's terms and de - parts .

		Week after week and month after month go by , but no payment is made for the eggs .

		When he calls at the house to inquire , the maid informs him that her mistress bids her say that the great variety of seasonable articles of food has prevented the use of the eggs , but that she hopes very soon to find a place for them on her menu .

		In the autumn the farmer is surprised to have the maid hand him the basket , saying that , as the eggs have lost their freshness and are uneatable , her mistress returns them , with thanks for the opportunity for purchasing , and hopes that the farmer will call when - ever he is in town and allow an examination of his stock . ''

		A REVIVAL OF STENDHAL IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	. ''

		S. D. '' writes as follows from
Paris	LOCATION	to the '' Even - ing Post '' of
New York	LOCATION	: '' Another hitherto unpublished work of
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	is coming out soon .

		The cult of this harsh but powerful author of sixty years ago is rather on the increase than otherwise , after a period of waning .

		It is likely to be fed for some time to come from the six volumes of MSS. , preserved mainly in the library of
Grenoble	LOCATION	.

		The present is the sixth volume in book form already pub - lished from this source . '


Lucien Leuwen	PERSON	, ' the name of the new romance , was never finished by the author , though begun before any of his great works .

		In
1834	DATE	, however , he gave careful instructions about publishing it in due time .

		It scarcely disguises even the names of the personages whom he had in mind .

		He says him - self : ' I have followed a usage of painters which I find amusing , and have worked from models . '

		The result is keen enough , at this late date , to verify the forebod - ings of the author , who also left in his directions : ' Care must be taken to remove every allusion that would be too clear and make of the book a satire .

		Vinegar is good , but mixed with cream it makes a detestable dish . '

		Even so , it has been found necessary to suppress cer - tain things which might come home to the children of those whom Stendhal desired to castigate for the part taken in the politics of the
First Empire	ORGANIZATION	and the Restoration .

		It makes up what the scientific jargon , so much in vogue in
France	LOCATION	at present , calls a ' physi - ology ' of the first part of the century ; and like all of this author 's work , it consists mainly of leaves from the autobiography of
Henri Beyle	PERSON	-LRB- of whom
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	was only a pseudonym -RRB- .

		In over 500 pages it pursues the answer to the initial question put before its hero by his father , ' Will you be knave enough to be employed in politics ? ' ''

		CURIOSITIES OF ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION .

		A recent book of reminiscences by Mr.
Frankfort Moore	PERSON	, a
London	LOCATION	journalist , furnishes the following amusing instances of '' English as she is pronounced '' by the occasional Irishman : '' It may be remembered that ten or eleven years ago the late Mr.
Dion Boucicault	PERSON	was obliging enough to offer to give a lecture to English actors on the correct pronunciation of their mother-tongue .

		The offer was , I suppose , thought too valuable to be neglected , and it was arranged that the lecture should be delivered from the stage of the Lyceum Theatre .

		A more interesting and amusing function I have never attended .

		It was clear that the lecturer had formed some very definite ideas as to the way the English language should be spoken ; and his attempts to convey these ideas to his audience were most praiseworthy .

		His illustrations of the curiosities of some methods of pronouncing words were certainly extremely curious .

		For instance , he com - plained bitterly of the way the majority of English ac - tors pronounced the word ' war . ' '

		Ye pronounce the ward as if it wuz spelt w-a-u-g-h , ' said the lecturer gravely . '

		Ye do n't pronounce it at all as ye shud .

		The ward rhymes with `` par , '' `` are , '' and `` kyar , '' and yet ye will pronounce it as if it rhymed with '' saw '' and '' paw . ''

		Do n't ye see see the diffurnce ? ' '

		We do ,
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 315 we do ! '

		cried the audience ; and , thus encouraged by the ready acquiescence in his pet theories , the lecturer went on to deal with the gross absurdity of pronounc - ing the word ' grass , ' not to rhyme with ' lass , ' which of course was the correct way , but almost not quite as if it rhymed with ' laws . ' '

		The ward is '' grass , '' not '' graws , '' ' said our lecturer . '

		It grates on a sinsitive ear like mine to hear it misprenounced .

		Then ye will never be injuced to give the ward '' Chrischin '' its thrue value as a ward of three syllables ; ye 'll insist on calling it ''
Christyen	PERSON	, '' in place of '' Chrischin . ''

		D'ye persave the diffurnce ? ' '

		We do , we do ! '

		cried the audience . '

		Ay , and ye talk about '' soots '' of gyarments , when ev - erybody knows that ye shud say `` shoots '' ; ye must give the full valye to the letter '' u '' there 's no double o in a shoot of clothes .

		Moreover , ye talk of the mim - bers of the polis force as '' cunstables , '' but there 's no `` u '' in the first syllable it 's an `` o , '' and it shud be prenounced to rhyme with '' gone , '' not with '' gun . ''

		Then I 've heard an actor who shud know better say , in the part of Hamlet , `` wurds , wurds , wurds '' ; instead of giving that fine letter '' o '' its full value .

		How much finer it sounds to pronounce it as I do , '' wards , wards , wards '' !

		But when I say that I 've heard the ward '' pull '' prenounced not to rhyme with '' dull , '' as ye 'll all admit it shud be , but actually as if it was within an ace of being spelt '' p double o 1 , '' I think ye 'll agree with me that it 's about time that actors learnt something of the rudiments of the art of ellycution .

		DO YOU know the difference between a mistake and a blunder ?

		When you lay down a good umbrella and take up a poor one , you make a mistake ; but when you lay down a poor umbrella and take up a good one , you make a blunder .

		So in bicycles .

		When you buy a poorer bicycle than you ought to ride , you make a mistake ; when you buy anything but the best you make a blunder .

		When you buy any bicycle without first seeing the '94 Warwick , you make a blundering mistake .

		The best time to correct a blundering mistake is before you make it !

		Therefore get our catalogue .

		Get it at once !

		Do n't leave the chair in which you are now sitting until you have written a postal asking for it .

		These volumes , published simultaneously in

		That Meneval was not the man to neglect his opportunities is shown abundantly by the glimpses of character revealed in his diaries and notes .

		They have been treasured by his family until the present time of pro- found interest in Napoleonic history .

		342 ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITIES .

		Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	, writing six or seven years ago upon the subject of the instruction in English at the English higher schools and universities , complained that '' it attains none of the ends which a subject in itself so full of attraction and interest might be expected to at - tain .

		It fails to fertilize ; it fails to inform ; it fails even to awaken curiosity . ''

		This triple failure he ascribes to the fact that literature '' has been regarded not as the expression of art and genius , but as mere material for the study of words , as mere pabulum for philol - ogy . ''

		Again , the whole machinery of higher education in
England	LOCATION	is subordinated to the in - terests of examiners , and its final product is the successful examinee , the man who is found equal to the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	tests , the classman of the
Tripos	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even so sound a thinker as Pro- fessor
Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	has recently doubted the success of the new Oxford school of English literature , on the ground that the subject does not easily lend itself to the traditional sort of examination .

		Emerson , many years ago , out - lined the New History in the phrase : '' Broader and deeper we must write our annals . ''

		Sim - ilarly , we may say to such cavillers as Profes - sor Smith : '' Broader and deeper must we make our examination papers . ''

		The subject of En - glish literature has far too high an educational value to be neglected merely because it requires some adaptation or reconstruction of a few time - honored methods and adjuncts of teaching .

		The articles upon the higher teaching of En - glish that have been contributed to THE DIAL during the past months go far to show that the objection raised by
Professor Smith	ORGANIZATION	and others is nothing more than a bugbear .

		If American experience -LRB- as recorded in these articles -RRB- counts for anything , we must admit that it establishes beyond question the claims of English as a proper subject of university instruction .

		Does it fail to fertilize , to inform , to awaken curios - ity ?

		Let us see what a few of our educators think about it .

		Says Professor Cook : '' The writer might formulate the especial object which he proposes to himself as the develop - ment in the student , whether graduate or un - dergraduate , of insight and power , and indeed he conceives this to be the end of all education whatever .

		The imparting of information seems to him quite a secondary object ; and a love for literature is most likely , as he thinks , to be promoted by the acquisition of insight and power . ''

		Says Professor
Corson	PERSON	: '' It is con - sidered of prime importance that students should first attain to a sympathetic appreciation of what is essential and intrinsic , before the adventitious features of literature features due to time and place be considered . ''

		Pro- 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, fessor
Dodge	ORGANIZATION	, speaking of the study of Shake - speare , says that grammatical criticism is treated sparingly , and textual criticism even more so .

		He then adds : '' The results of this method of Shakespeare study have been very encouraging , many of the pupils seeming to de - velope from it a real love for the subject . ''

		Professor
March	DATE	writes that the courses under his direction are constant to the central idea of this passage quoted from
Arnold	LOCATION	of Rugby : '' What a treat it would be to teach Shake - speare to a good class of young Greeks in re - generate
Athens	LOCATION	; to dwell upon him line by line and word by word , and so get all his pic - tures and thoughts leisurely into one 's mind , till I verily think one would , after a time , al - most give out light in the dark , after having been steeped , as it were , in such an atmosphere of brilliance . ''

		These remarks , which might be multiplied indefinitely , seem to us fairly typical of the spirit in which the subject of English litera - ture is studied in our colleges and universities .

		Avoiding the dangerous extremes of pedantry on the one hand and dilettantism on the other , our teachers of literature seem to be animated by the desire to impart the spirit of literary ap - preciation no less than the methods of exact scholarship in literary investigation .

		The large proportion of students taking English courses is almost everywhere noticeable , and there is little evidence that these courses are elected because they are '' soft . ''

		There is a recent and growing tendency to base the doctor 's degree upon English as a principal subject , and to en - courage publication of the theses offered .

		In - spection of a number of such theses that have come to hand during the past two years shows them to compare more than favorably with the similar work done in English at the German uni - versities .

		In this American work , aesthetic and philosophical criticism has its full share , and its recognition is not to the detriment of rig - orous training or sound scholarship .

		We have dwelt more fully upon the esthetic than upon the linguistic side of English train - ing , but from no intention of ignoring the im - portance of the latter aspect .

		The linguistic part of the field is in no danger of careless cul - tivation , and has little need of fertilizers .

		The methods of linguistic study have been so thor - oughly formulated and systematized by workers in the classical languages that they may be transferred with slight modification to the sub - ject of the English or any other modern tongue .

		But there is still something resembling anarchy in our treatment of English from the side of aesthetic criticism as well as from that of history or of philosophy .

		Hence it is necessary to direct the attention mainly to these aspects .

		It seems to be of the first importance that the two grand divisions of the subject should be sharply dif - ferentiated .

		By this we mean that a univer - sity should have two departments of English rather than one .

		It is theoretically conceivable that scholars might be found of such broad and balanced culture as to be competent to direct the work in both fields .

		But such men are too rare to be counted upon .

		The English scholars in our universities are , almost without excep - tion , either literary critics or masters of lin - guistic science ; they are rarely if ever both at once .

		Now this means that a department of English having a single head will almost inev - itably become developed upon one side at the expense of the other .

		Such of our institutions as
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, and
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	have clearly recognized this difficulty , and have kept English linguistics dis - tinct from English literature .

		Assuming this differentiation , what should be the qualifications of a professor of English literature proper ?

		His function , to quote from Mr.
Collins	PERSON	once more , '' is the interpreta - tion of power and beauty as they reveal them - selves in language , not simply by resolving them into their constituent elements , but by considering them in their relation to princi - ples . ''

		To perform this function it is evident that he must have a thorough training in the history of criticism , from
Aristotle	LOCATION	to Mr.
Pa	PERSON	- ter ; that he must have a wide acquaintance with literature , ancient and modern , native and foreign ; that he must have a delicately-attuned ear and a cultivated aesthetic sense ; that , finally , he must have in an unusual degree the power of giving literary expression to his thought , and something like a passion for bringing other minds into sympathetic communion with his own .

		He should be , in a word , as nearly as possible such a man as
Arnold	LOCATION	, or
Lowell	LOCATION	, or Sainte-Beuve , among the dead , or as
M. Brune	PERSON	- tiere , or Mr.
Watts	PERSON	, or Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, among the living .

		Men of this type , or approaching this type , some of our universities already have ; the others may obtain them if they will but en - large their horizon sufficiently to recognize the fact that for the work of giving vital instruc - tion in English literature other than merely academic qualifications are needed ; that such qualifications are , indeed , of but secondary im - portance .

		THE DIAL 327 DEATHS OF A MONTH .

		When
Henry Morley	PERSON	announced , seven years ago , that he was about to carry out his long-cherished plan of preparing a systematic history of English writers , it was hoped , as someone suggested at the time , that our literature had at last found its Tira - boschi .

		The suggestion was over-sanguine , for now , the great work but half-completed , the author has found rest from his labors .

		Professor
Morley	PERSON	was born
September 15 , 1822	DATE	, and died on the
14th of last month	DATE	, in the seventy-second year of his age .

		He was educated in
Germany	LOCATION	, and at
King	LOCATION	's Col - lege ,
London	LOCATION	.

		He practiced medicine in his early years , but abandoned the profession in
1851	DATE	, when he went into
London	LOCATION	journalism .

		He assisted
Dick	PERSON	- ens in editing '' Household Words '' and became himself editor of `` The Examiner . ''

		From
1857	DATE	to
1865	DATE	he lectured on English literature at
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the latter year he became professor of the English language and literature at
University College	ORGANIZATION	, holding the chair until
1889	DATE	, when he was made emeritus professor and retired to
Carisbrooke	LOCATION	,
Isle of Wight	LOCATION	, where he has lived during the five years just past .

		In
1879	DATE
the University of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D .

		His writings are very numerous .

		Those of a mis - cellaneous character include '' How to Make Home Unhealthy '' -LRB- 1850 -RRB- , `` Life of Palissy the Potter '' -LRB- 1852 -RRB- , `` Jerome Cardan '' -LRB- 1854 -RRB- , `` Cornelius Agrippa '' -LRB- 1856 -RRB- , '' Memoirs of Bartholomew Fair '' -LRB- 1857 -RRB- , '' Fables and Fairy Tales '' -LRB- 1860 -RRB- , `` Jour - nal of a
London	LOCATION	Play-Goer '' -LRB- 1866 -RRB- , Life of Cle - ment
Marot	PERSON	, and Other Studies '' -LRB- 1870 -RRB- .

		He edited '' The Spectator , ''
Florio	PERSON	's Montaigne , Bos - well 's
Johnson	PERSON	, '' The Universal Library , '' ``
Cassell	PERSON	's National Library , '' and '' The Carisbrooke Library . ''

		His special work as a historian of English literature began with '' English Writers before Chaucer '' -LRB- 1864 -RRB- , and was followed by '' From Chaucer to Dunbar '' -LRB- 1867 -RRB- .

		These stout octavos were fol - lowed by `` Tables of English Literature '' -LRB- 1870 -RRB- , a `` First Sketch of English Literature '' -LRB- 1873 -RRB- , and '' English Literature in the Reign of Victoria '' -LRB- 1881 -RRB- , the latter work being prepared for
Baron Tauchnitz	PERSON	, and published as the 2000th volume of his well-known series .

		In
1887	DATE	, his magnum opus on '' English Writers '' was seriously resumed , and ten of the twenty volumes projected have been given to the public .

		The tenth volume takes us through the reign of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		The eleventh volume -LRB- which we hope was completed before the death of the au - thor -RRB- was to deal with
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his con - temporaries of the reign of
King James	LOCATION	.

		Better than any comment , the list of books above enum - erated serves to indicate
Henry Morley	PERSON	's tireless industry , and to reveal the extent of the gratitude felt for him by every student of our literature .

		It is easy to find minute defects in the work , and to show that its critical quality is not of the highest , but the fact remains that it conceives , and half car - ries out , the most extensive and scholarly treat - ment of English literary history that has yet been attempted .

		English science met with one of the severest of losses in the death , on the 23d of
last month	DATE	, of
John George Romanes	PERSON	.

		He was just forty-six years of age , having been born at
Kingston	LOCATION	, Can - ada ,
May 20 , 1848	DATE	.

		He was educated at
Caius College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, taking natural science honors in
1870	DATE	.

		He was intimately related with
Darwin	PERSON	during the closing ten years of the latter 's life , and has been one of the most energetic exponents of the Darwinian theories .

		Among his works are '' Sci - ence Lectures for the People '' -LRB- 1878 -RRB- , '' Animal In - telligence '' -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , ``
Charles Darwin	PERSON	, His Charac - acterand Life '' -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , `` The Scientific Evidences of Organic Evolution '' -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , '' Mental Evolution in Animals '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- , `` The Star-Fish , Jelly-Fish , and Sea-Urchins '' -LRB- 1885 -RRB- , and `` Mental Evolution in Man '' -LRB-
1889	DATE	-RRB- .

		He has been a frequent contrib - utor to periodicals , and has been one of the stoutest opponents of Professor
Weissmann	PERSON	's new and rev - olutionary theories of animal development .


Edmund Yates	PERSON	, whose death was announced on the
21st of May	DATE	, was a conspicuous figure in Lon - don journalism , but can hardly be said to have done any serious work in literature .

		He was born in
1831	DATE	.

		He wrote many novels and plays , among the former being `` Broken to Harness , '' `` Kissing the Rod , '' `` Black Sheep , '' `` Land at Last , '' `` The Forlorn Hope , '' '' A Righted Wrong , '' '' Castaway , '' '' No - body 's Fortune , '' '' The Yellow Flag , '' and '' The Impending Sword . ''

		He visited
America	LOCATION	in
1872	DATE	, and again in
1885	DATE	.

		In
1884	DATE	he published '' Fifty Years of
London	LOCATION	Life , '' a readable volume of rem - iniscences .

		He is perhaps best remembered for his expulsion from the
Garrick Club	ORGANIZATION	at the instigation of
Thackeray	LOCATION	, about whom he had written an arti - cle which was , to say the least , in bad taste ; and by his imprisonment in
1884	DATE	for another highly in - discreet editorial utterance .

		The cable that brought news of the death of Ro - manes conveyed to us , on the same day , the news of
Madame Renan	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		The widow of the great philologist , who thus survived her husband less than two years , was , it will be remembered , a daughter of the painter ,
Ary Scheffer	ORGANIZATION	.

		Since Renan 's death , his widow has been engaged in preparing for pub - lication his posthumous works .

		Still earlier in the month there came news of the death at
Lindheim	LOCATION	, in the
Duchy of Hesse	ORGANIZATION	, of the death of
Leopold Sacher-Masoch	PERSON	, on the sixth of
May	DATE	, in his fifty-ninth year .

		He was born at Lem - bersr , in
Galicia	LOCATION	, and has done more than all other ' writers together to make that province of the Aus - trian Empire familiar to readers all over the world .

		He studied in
Gratz	PERSON	and
Prague	LOCATION	, and became a pro- fessor of history in the university of the former city .

		His first work was '' Der Auf stand in Gent unter Karl V. '' -LRB- 1858 -RRB- .

		His first novel was ''
Eine Gali	PERSON	- zische Geschichte '' -LRB- 1866 -RRB- .

		This was followed by 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, many others , among which we mention '' Das Ver - machtnis Kains , '' a '' Novellencyclus '' of which the successive parts were published at intervals , '' Die GeschiedeneFrau '' -LRB- 1870 -RRB- , `` Die Republik der Wei - berfeinde '' -LRB- 1872 -RRB- , ''
Maria Theresia	PERSON	und die Frei - maurer '' -LRB- 1872 -RRB- , `` Falscher Hermelin '' -LRB- 1873 -RRB- , `` Der Neue Hjob '' -LRB- 1874 -RRB- , `` Die Ideale unserer Zeit '' -LRB- 1875 -RRB- , `` Wiener Hofgeschichten '' -LRB- 1876 -RRB- , '' Le Cabinet Noir de
Lemberg	PERSON	'' and '' L' Ilau '' -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , both in French '' Die
Messalinen Wiens	PERSON	, '' and ''
Ein Weiblicher Sultan	PERSON	. ''

		His novels found great favor with the French public , attracted by their sensuous quality and their not always ar - tistic realism , and a great number of them have been translated for the '' Revue des Deux Mondes . ''

		He was an enemy of the German Empire and a champion of the Jew .

		His serious works include ''
Ungarns Untergang	PERSON	und Maria , '' ''
Kaunitz	PERSON	, '' '' .

		ZEs - thetik des Hasslichen , '' and '' Ueber den
Werth	PERSON	der Kritik . ''

		He was made a member of the Legion of Honor by the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		ENGLISH AT THE STATE UNIVER - SITY OF
IOWA	LOCATION	*
The State University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	has one Professor of English and one Instructor , and offers during the present year eight courses .

		All but one of these are two-hour courses , making a total of seventeen hours , the actual teaching time being somewhat more , owing to division in classes .

		Of these eight courses , four are required .

		In the Freshman year a choice is given between courses I. and II .

		; in the
Sopho	LOCATION	- more year , between III .

		and IV .

		There are about two hundred and fifty students registered in the va - rious courses , counting perhaps twenty names twice .

		Besides these courses , `` the
University	ORGANIZATION	offers two courses in Elocution and a good deal of private work under a special instructor , and for next year it offers a course in Debating under the joint supervision of the
Professors of Political Science	ORGANIZATION	,
Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, and English .

		But these latter matters hardly come within the scope of the present series of articles .

		courses our idea is not exactly to teach formal rhet - oric as the art is usually presented in the older text - books , but rather to present the subject in a con - structive way , according to the general line of recent thought on the subject .

		We try to habituate the student to writing -LRB- as well as possible , of course , but without insistence on critical work -RRB- , to give him practice in thinking over his material and putting it into good form , to give him exercise in the different modes of presentation .

		Such is the tendency of most of the handbooks on rhetoric and of most of the discussions of the matter published in the last few years .

		The alternative courses offered the Freshmen and Sophomores are literary with a rhetorical flavor .

		In the first year a number of prose authors are read , with comment on their style .

		In the second , the class uses Professor
Minto	PERSON	's admirable Manual .

		It seems that there are always a number of students who make very little of rhetoric as usually taught ; we want , in these courses , to see whether they can do as well by reading good authors as their class - mates do by more direct practice in means and meth - ods .

		In all four courses there is a good deal of essay-writing .

		But as far as we can see at present , the direct work will give the better results .

		In the elective courses , we draw the line sharply between linguistic work and literary .

		If it were practical , I should like to divide further , giving courses devoted particularly to literary history and to the interpretation of literature .

		As it is , how - ever , these last subjects are treated in the same courses .

		In linguistics we give this year a course in Old English and another on Historical English Grammar .

		But these courses -LRB- and a course in
Middle English	LOCATION	as well that has been given -RRB- are not favorites with the student body , and are only given on alternate years .

		For courses in literature , besides the Freshman course -LRB- II . -RRB-

		described above , and the course in En - glish Prose -LRB- IV . -RRB-

		, there is given this year a course of lectures on English Poetry .

		The subject of this course is changed each year , so that the student who wishes may in three years get a fairly complete view of English poetry from Chaucer down , includ - ing a good deal of work on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		A seminary , in the stricter American sense of a research course , we do not have .

		We do , how - ever , give a course for seniors and graduates , which bears a fairly close resemblance in character to the seminar of a smaller German university .

		The work of this course is generally concerned with some as - pects of criticism , and we sometimes follow one method , sometimes another .

		I have gone over a text-book , or lectured , or given out topics for orig - inal work .

		The main idea is that by means of the closer personal relation possible through the inform - alities of the seminary , the spirit of self-reliance and independence shall be developed in the members .

		It will easily be seen from this sketch of our work that the basis of our method is the cutting

		We have two main ideas : first , to give plenty of op - portunity to those who wish to gain a good English style ; and second , to encourage a feeling and taste for good literature .

		HOW SHALL ENGLISH LITERATURE BE TAUGHT ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The articles on the teaching of English at American universities , in current numbers of THE DIAL , are sig - nificant of the growing popular interest in the subject .

		Nevertheless it is noticeable with what commendable caution the several authors avoid the more general and popular aspects of the question .

		But the question is one that is properly within the keeping of the educated opinion of non-professionals , and that concerns the read - ing and literary public more than any other technical question .

		The movement for a reformed teaching of English in the universities represents the outcome of the general reaction against a one-sided and prevail - ingly philological or linguistic presentation of the sub - ject , a movement which has been going on here and abroad for the last twenty years .

		The general tone of the articles in THE DIAL indicates the willingness in - deed , the eagerness of the teachers of English in the universities to meet the demands for a reformed method .

		In some respects it even may be thought that the reac - tion is becoming extreme .

		The interesting question , of course , is by what method may English literature , as distinguished from English philology , be properly taught to advanced classes .

		Everybody is agreed that it should be taught as literature , that a purely literary method should be employed .

		But what is the true literary method ?

		The teaching of literature in English , in the first place , in - volves several technical difficulties .

		There is no exer - cise of translation in itself a delicate and searching literary process when properly pursued , as there is in teaching literature in other languages to English-speak - ing students .

		In place of this it has been proposed to substitute `` interpretation . ''

		But literary `` interpreta - tion , '' even if it could be accurately defined , is a very inadequate and colorless substitute .

		Others among them , Professor
Corson	PERSON	, perhaps would make finished recitation and reading aloud take the place of the exer - cise of translation .

		Both methods under strict lim - itations have their uses ; but either one , pursued alone , is grotesquely inadequate for employment with ad - vanced classes .

		Then there are the various '' scientific '' methods that these new demands are calling forth the '' analytical '' method , the '' inductive '' method , the '' psychological '' method , and how many beside ?

		The fatal objection in every case is that each method , taken by itself , is inadequate and one-sided , although almost all of them have merits .

		To force any one of these methods upon our universities would be but to repeat the disastrous experiment with the inadequate and one - sided philological method .

		The real difficulty lies in the fact that while literary form is a definite subject , capable of definite presentation , the content of litera - ture which to the popular mind is its vital side im - pinges more or less upon most of the university depart - ments concerned with the humanities : history , philos - ophy , sociology , art , and the rest .

		The teacher of En - glish who concerns himself with the subject-matter of his texts soon wanders into forbidden fields and lo !

		the dilletante .

		Under the old education , when the chief groundwork of the other humanities was absorbed through literary texts , it was another matter .

		The ques - tion is , What is the field for the teacher of English lit - erature ?

		Does it properly extend outside of literary history , literary aesthetics , the theory and analysis of style , versification and rhetoric , and the necessary phil - ological apparatus ?

		Above all , let us save the teaching of literature from the men of one method , the successors in disguise of the philologists , and from poachers wandering from other fields who seek to make literature their prey , but whose real interest is in ethics , or psychology , or so - ciology , or linguistics , or even in rhetorical analysis and the general pseudo-sciences of literature so-called .

		330 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Books , INTERPRETER OF SCIENCE TOR THE PEOPLE .

		* In sketching for us the .

		life of
Edward L. Youmans	PERSON	, Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	is writing of one to whom he refers as his `` best and dearest friend . ''

		He calls him '' the interpreter of science for the people . ''

		No name could be more happily chosen .

		The story of such a friend and of such a worker should be both interesting and valuable ; and such we find it .

		We may pass by the description of Mr.
You	PERSON	- mans 's childhood and young manhood .

		It is very interesting , and is well given ; it is even pathetic .

		There were years when strict econ - omy was necessary , the boyhood of diligent reading and study , the early manhood 's hope of a college education blasted by blindness last - ing thirteen weary years .

		There was the no - ble effort to make a living by literary work , against obstacles which would have discouraged most men .

		But courage and hard work con - quered ; success came , and with its dawn light too came to those eyes so long darkened , and a magnificent career opened .


Youmans	PERSON	was a writer ; his text-book of chemistry made a real sensation , and his other works are of value .

		He was a born teacher ; apt at illustration , clear in explanation : his diagrams illustrating the binary theory of chem - istry were most useful .

		He was a brilliant lec - turer ; his public discussions of scientific themes aroused profound interest .

		Writer , teacher , lec - turer , in either field he might have made a ca - reer , in all he won true recognition .

		But it was not in these that his greatest usefulness lay .

		His chief claim to remembrance lies in a three - fold work of a different sort : he introduced the works of the greatest European writers to an ignorant American public , he founded the '' In - ternational Scientific Series '' of books , he es - tablished the '' Popular Science Monthly . ''

		Everyone knows that the Appletons are the publishers in this country of the great English scientists .

		The famous works of
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Hux	PERSON	- ley ,
Lubbock	LOCATION	,
Tyndall	PERSON	, and
Spencer	PERSON	are issued from their house .

		Everyone does not know that , notwithstanding the opportunity for piracy that our copyright laws allow , these authors have re - ceived a generous royalty from these publishers .

		Some may know these facts , but may not know *

		that it was Mr.
Youmans	PERSON	who secured their publication and this generous recognition .

		It was he who watched carefully for every worthy book in '' the new science , '' who called the atten - tion of the firm to it , arranged with the author , helped it through the press , saw that it was properly reviewed and given a chance before our one-time somewhat philistine public .

		This was in itself a vast educational work .

		Mr.
Youmans	PERSON	early became interested in Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	and his philosophy .

		He sought acquaintance with the great Englishman an acquaintance which became personal , ripened into friendship , showing itself in a thousand helpful ways .

		Through
Youmans	PERSON	, Mr.
Spen	PERSON	- cer 's writings were published in
America	LOCATION	, and to him much of their success here was due .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	says : '' As long as he -LSB-
Youmans	PERSON	-RSB- lived , Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	had upon this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	an alter ego ever on the alert , with vision like that of a hawk for the slightest chance to promote his interests and those of his system of thought . ''

		So true was this that on one occasion Mr.
William Appleton	PERSON	said a very good thing in the matter : ''
Henry Carey	PERSON	called in to blow up the Appletons for publishing
Spencer	PERSON	's free-trade doctrines .

		Spencer was an upstart ; his system would soon die like
Comte	ORGANIZATION	's and Mill 's .

		Said
W. H. Appleton	PERSON	, ' I can tell you one thing
Spencer	PERSON	wo n't die so long as
Youmans	PERSON	lives . ''

		In
1862	DATE	Youmans made his first visit to En - gland , and met Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	personally .

		His first impressions are interestingly given in a letter to his sister , so well known on account of her own work in science .

		From it we select a few passages : '' He is the most prompt , ready , adaptive and useful man in such an expedition I have ever known .

		He is wonderfully practical , and handles circumstances as they arise with all the energy and readiness of an experienced business man ... His health is bad .

		The difficulty is with his brain sleeplessness .

		He has not had a night 's rest since he wrote the Psychology .

		He can ' t sleep , and if he does he wakes ten or twenty times during the night .

		He is very excitable , and when excited can not sleep at all , and gets alarmed at the state of his brain and flies from the scene of danger ... He did not say m uch to me about his experience , but alluded to it two or three times in a very simple and touching way in connection with the assistance he had received from
America	LOCATION	.

		That is all the profit he has ever yet had from his work , and he said it was as grateful and opportune as it was un - expected , for he had but little hope from that quarter ; ... and when I looked upon the man , with his health broken and nerves shattered , and remembered that his is the foremost intellect of our civilization , and that he is a man beyond all other men of his age to control the thought of the future ; when I thought of him hampered and harassed for want of means to publish his great thoughts as having to think for the world and then having to pay the expense of instruction , setting up other

		THE DIAL 331 men in intellectual business with a paragraph , I con - fess I thanked God that I have had a little opportunity to do him service . ''

		We can not speak further of this so great work ; it led naturally to the next , the '' Inter - national Scientific Series . ''

		This was a bold en - terprise .

		To have the world 's leaders in science prepare handy books , fit for popular reading , upon some phase of their special theme ; to publish them simultaneously in
America	LOCATION	, En - gland ,
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	; to have the authors properly remunerated for the pub - lication in each country , such were the novel features of the scheme .

		One can not easily conceive the labor involved in planning , inaugu - rating , and carrying out such an enterprise .

		There were many discouragements and difficul - ties .

		England was first visited .

		Here You - mans needed every help that those whom he had assisted could give .

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	was in - terested , and worked in various ways .

		Profes - sor Huxley 's argument seems to have been a telling one with the English scientists : ``
Hux	PERSON	- ley backed me up grandly , and told them how much he had received from the Appletons for reprints . ''

		At last
England	LOCATION	was gained ; then
France	LOCATION	was visited , and then
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Of this last he wrote : ''
Germany	LOCATION	is more ripe for the movement than even
England	LOCATION	; its best men can be procured .

		It was Huxley 's name which carried the thing there . ''

		And so , at last , the new venture was started .

		It has been pro- foundly successful , and the seventy volumes or more , in uniform red binding now so well known are to be seen in every library .

		The excellence of the work is shown by the names of the authors and the titles of their books : sample them
Tyndall	PERSON	's `` Forms of Wa - ter , ''
Spencer	PERSON	's `` Study of Sociology , ''
Cooke	PERSON	's '' New Chemistry , '' Maudsley 's ''
Responsibil	PERSON	- ity , ''
Whitney	PERSON	's '' Life and Growth of Lan - guage , '' de Quatrefages ' `` Human Species , ''
Tylor	PERSON	's `` Anthropology , '' Semper 's `` Animal Life . ''

		And all of this for American readers , the outgrowth of one man 's idea !

		And from it grew the third special work of
Youmans	PERSON	's useful life the '' Popular Science Monthly . ''

		We can not go into details to show how it was partly connected with the Spencer propaganda .

		The first number appeared in
April , 1872	DATE	.

		From that month till the pres - ent time it has done an excellent nay , a great work .

		It has had dark days ; it has been bitterly assailed and decried , but it has gone on and has made a profound impression .

		The American public has needed such a journal and has supported it .

		It has been fearless and out - spoken .

		Until his death in
1887	DATE	,
Youmans	PERSON	was the chief editor , although for long his brother , Dr.
W. J. Youmans	PERSON	-LRB- the present ed - itor -RRB- shared the burden .

		As editor , he was ever ready to speak clearly and plainly upon the burning questions of the day .

		The monthly has been repeatedly branded as irreligious and atheistic .

		It has never been either .


Edward Livingston Youmans	PERSON	was profoundly independ - ent , an original thinker , who never flinched from speaking out a careful thought ; but he was himself a man profoundly religious and earnest .

		We may perhaps fitly close this re - view of his work by two quotations from his address on '' The Religious Work of Science '' : '' The theologians who claimed to be authorized ex - pounders of the divine policy insisted not only that breaks and interruptions of the natural order occurred , but they maintained that it is in these breaches of it that the Creator is most conspicuously and impressively seen .

		Holding that the normal phenomena are of small concern while their ruptures alone disclose divine inter - vention , they left it to the men of science to work out the natural order to its completeness , and to vindicate the Almighty , whose wisdom is witnessed not in the vio - lations , but in the perfections of his works '' -LRB- p. 494 ^ . ''

		In a religious point of view , it -LSB- evolution -RSB- has but one significance .

		Offering a grander conception of the cosniical order and a deeper insight into its wonderful workings than had ever before been obtained , it is the sublimest tribute that the human mind has ever made to the glory of the Divine power to which it must be ascribed .

		With the acceptance of evolution the un - worthy philosophy which has sought to honor God by the derangements of his own work comes to an end and the argument passes into a new phase '' -LRB- p. 499 -RRB- .

		We read in our daily papers of an insurgent navy in Bra - zil , of a deposed president in
Honduras	LOCATION	, of one dictator and two presidents trying at one and the same time to manage Peruvian affairs ; and we smile with superior pity , and wonder what they will do next .

		We accept as a foregone conclusion that '' next '' will be another up - heaval of some sort , though few of us have any historic knowledge upon which to base our suppositions .

		We are in a state of Cimmer - ian darkness concerning the antecedents of our restless neighbors .

		It is to dispel this darkness of ignorance , and to arouse a wider and deeper interest in Latin American affairs , that a series of historical works is being issued by
Messrs. C. H. Sergei & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the initial volume of which was a history of
Peru	LOCATION	by the brilliant writer and able historian , Mr.
Clements R. Markham	PERSON	.

		This is now followed by a history of
Chile	LOCATION	by Mr.
Anson Uriel Hancock	PERSON	.

		Other vol - umes are in course of preparation , and we hope soon to see a complete set of the Latin Amer - ican Republics .

		The aim is to give a histor - ical sketch of the several republics , from the time of the conquest , through the periods of colonial rule and of wars for independence , down through this
last century	DATE	of struggle for constitutional freedom .


Chile	LOCATION	is one of the most interesting and best known of the republics .

		Her belligerent atti - tude during our late little unpleasantness with her gave irresistible opportunities to the carica - turist and to the writer of scathing editorials , so that the peppery little southerner became a very familiar figure .

		The story of
Chile	LOCATION	's con - quest by the Spaniards is thrilling and roman - tic in the extreme .

		The stubborn persistency and cold cruelty of Almagro rivals that of Pi - zarro .

		The bold defiance and unyielding re - sistance of the Araucanians contrasts with the superstitious fear and dreary fatalism of the Incas and Aztecs .

		The bold exploits of the youthful Lautaro , and of the girl warrior
Jane	PERSON	- queo , vie with any tale of Spartan valor or of French heroism .

		Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	has treated this period in a conscientious manner , giving the details of the various campaigns with great fidelity .

		There may be a lack of color in his treatment , but the plain incidents themselves are perhaps sufficiently vivid for the average reader .

		But it was not the character of the conquest alone that modified and moulded the history of
Chile	LOCATION	.

		Another element exercised a more powerful influence on the political and social life : the colonial system , which bound and fettered colonist and Indian alike for nearly three hundred years .

		This period is briefly but adequately treated ; and then the author passes on to the war of independence , which is told in fuller detail .

		In
South America	LOCATION	the contagion of liberty spread from province to province , and the struggle for freedom was combined and simultaneous .

		The history of the revolution in
Chile	LOCATION	is linked with that of the Argentine Re - public , of
Peru	LOCATION	, and of
Colombia	LOCATION	.

		The names of
San Martin	LOCATION	, of Bolivar , and of Belgrano are honored in all alike .

		It is impossible , there - fore , to give a perfectly satisfactory account of
Chile	LOCATION	's struggle for independence in the limited space allotted to that period .

		The author has succeeded , however , in making clear the part that she played in the great drama of liberty .

		The most interesting portion of the book to northern readers is that contained in Parts IV .

		and V. , which are devoted to an account of the war with
Peru	LOCATION	and
Bolivia	LOCATION	, and the civil war of
1891	DATE	.

		In the former , Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	treats his subject very impartially , a difficult thing to do , for in this war the Chileans were clearly the aggressors .

		After reading Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's account of the same war , one 's sympathies are enlisted for the Peruvians , who were mown down by hundreds while defending their coun - try against a foe whose only excuse for invasion was covetousness .

		And so Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	's non - committal attitude is the more notable .

		In Part V. , which deals with the civil war of
1891	DATE	, President
Balmaceda	PERSON	is treated with kindly justice .

		He is given full credit for his work as an educator , as a man of advanced re - ligious and intellectual views , and as a '' good - natured gentleman . ''

		But his faults are not condoned .

		He is condemned for his blind stub - bornness in asserting dictatorial powers , and for his wanton cruelty during the war .

		His most politic action was leaving the world when he did , for this self-sacrifice in removing him - self as the promoter of contention won clem - ency toward his followers .

		Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	concludes his volume with an interesting description of
Chile	LOCATION	and the
Chile	LOCATION	- ans of to-day .

		In the appendix are statistics , the English text of the constitution of
Chile	LOCATION	, and a full list of authorities on Chilean history .

		It is to be hoped the other volumes in this use - ful series will follow rapidly , for we feel assured that they will aid us in a solution of the polit - ical , commercial , and social problems which face us in these republics .

		THE DIAL 333 BOOKS ABOUT NATURE .

		* There is nothing like contact with Nature to keep the heart warm and young .

		It is the true elixir of life , preserving the freshness , the simplicity , and the sweetness of childhood to the farthest limits of old age .

		A love for the flowers , the birds , the clouds and the stars , the hills and the seas , for any form of wild thing or wild life , is the gift of all others to be desired .

		Who has it can in no case be quite des - titute or joyless .

		To him there will be possibilities of comfort and happiness opening up everywhere around .

		A glimpse of the dancing sunshine , a walk in the open fields , a handful of blossoms , a snatch of untutored song from the hedgerow or tree-top , suffices to flood his being with an ecstacy such as only they with kindred souls can understand .

		Abund - ant proof of this truth is offered in a series of expe - riences just now happily published for the convic - tion of mankind .

		The first to fall under my hand is the history of `` An Island Garden , '' by Mrs.
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	.

		Everybody knows that the home of this writer has been for the greater portion of her life in one of the Isles of Shoals , lying some nine miles off the
coast of New Hampshire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Everybody knows , too , that here she has distilled from the strong salt breezes and the unshadowed sunlight playing round her iso - lated habitation , qualities remarkable for the nur - ture of an imagination that was inherently of a vigorous character .

		But everybody does not know what wonderful stimulus to the health and happi - ness of body and mind she has created for herself in the cultivation of the vegetable prodigies that can be coaxed to grow in a fertile plot of ground .

		At the solicitation of friends , she has unfolded the tale in a volume which attracts attention by its sumptuous exterior as well as by its unique contents .

		The pictures embellishing it must in the first mo - ment be disposed of , for they are by Childe Has - sam , whose name is sufficient to pique curiosity .

		They are in colors , and sympathetically illustrate the letter-press , furnishing a variety of outdoor and indoor views .

		All are conceived with artistic feel - ing , which in most instances is charmingly carried out .

		The minor drawings are likewise graceful and suggestive .

		In harmony with the pictures are the various details of the book-maker 's art , with a result rivalling the volumes de luxe we are used to asso - ciate with the holiday period .

		sentences Mrs.
Thaxter	PERSON	strikes a high note which is sustained throughout her dissertation .

		Flowers , she declares , have been like dear friends to her from her infancy , `` comforters , inspirers , powers to up - lift and to cheer . ''

		The seed from which they
spring	DATE	, the dust which nourishes them , were mar - vels overpowering her with a sense of magic and mystery .

		Every blade of grass and humble weed filled her with awe and delight , and by the age of five her fervor of adoration had become like that of the fire-worshipper who falls prostrate at the presence of the sun .

		Her intensity of feeling is a continual surprise , yet is attended with such dig - nity , and leads to such singular and protracted sac - rifice for the objects of her regard , that it commands admiring respect .

		An affection that for weeks to - gether can call one out of bed at four o'clock in the morning ; that will hold one to drudging toil from that hour on to sunset ; that will take one out in the lonely darkness of midnight to minister to some suffering or imperilled plant ; that will induce one to bend for many long days in succession over beds of flowers to rid them of weeds and worms and bugs ; that will , in short , furnish the motive and support for incessant work which most persons would pro- nounce unbearable drudgery , is of a nature that deserves to be called heroic .

		Such is the love Mrs.
Thaxter	PERSON	cherishes for her garden a space of only fifty feet by fifteen , which yields , as her record demonstrates , astonishing fruits to both senses and spirit .

		The flowers are worth all they cost , as an inspiration to their owner , who , in the transports of emotion they kindle , writes of them with an elo - quence which does not pale in comparison with the gorgeous passages of
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		She describes the
California	LOCATION	poppy , for example , with an exuberance and felicity of diction that justify her daring inser - tion of the great master 's famous word-painting of the red poppy , alongside of it .

		A brief extract will give an indication of her graphic power : '' As I hold the flower in my hand and think of try - ing to describe it , I realize how poor a creature I am , how impotent are words in the presence of such perfec - tion .

		It is held upright upon a straight and polished stem , its petals curving upward and outward into the cup of light , pure gold with a lustrous satin sheen ; a rich orange is painted on the gold , drawn in infinitely fine lines to a point in the centre of the edge of each petal , so that the effect is that of a diamond of flame in a cup of gold .

		It is not enough that the powdery anthers are orange bordered with gold ; they are whirled about the very heart of the flower like a revolving Cath - erine wheel of fire .

		In the centre of the anthers is a shining point of warm sea-green , a last consummate touch which makes the beauty of the blossom supreme .

		Another has the orange suffused through the gold evenly , almost to the outer edges of the petals , which are left in bright , light yellow with a dazzling effect .

		Turning the flower and looking at it from the outside , it has no calyx , but the petals
spring	DATE	from a simple pale-green disk , which must needs be edged with sea-shell pink for the glory of God !

		The fresh splendor of this flower no tongue nor pen nor brush of mortal man can fitly re - present . ''

		334 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, An excerpt usually does scant justice to an author ; but there are frequent paragraphs and pages in '' An Island Garden '' that one will of necessity read aloud to a companion , and will mark and re - turn to with ever-renewed enjoyment of their pas - sionate ardor and poetic phraseology .

		Many inter - esting notes on the habits of birds in an island home are interspersed through the volume .

		The song sparrows scratch up pounds of flower seeds every Spring in Mrs.
Thaxter	PERSON	's garden , and yet she loves them as she does the swallows and the humming birds which are as familiar as members of one fam - ily in the circumscribed space of
Appledore	LOCATION	.

		After the brilliant essay on '' An Island Garden , '' there is no appreciable decline in turning to `` A Bird-Lover in the West , '' by
Olive Thome Miller	PERSON	.

		It is pitched in a lower key ; it is quieter in every way .

		But the book has virtues of its own , which win the reader 's immediate favor .

		The sane and sensible spirit pervading it imparts a healthful im - pression .

		At times the reader is aware how the author 's pulses are thrilling , yet she retains full con - trol over her enthusiasm , not once suffering it to escape in strained or hysterical expression .

		This is saying a great deal , for bird-lovers are true lovers , and human excitement seldom runs higher than dur - ing the gracious interviews they secure with the feathered beauties they are wooing .

		The good sense characterizing Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	is exhibited in her method of enjoying a holiday .

		It is her custom every year in nesting-time to spend a month or more in some locality favorable to the study of wild birds .

		It is her season of rest and recreation , and , as she re - lates , the instant of departure from home she takes herself in hand , determined to cast away care and worry and be free to make the most of the precious weeks of pastime . ''

		To insure any measure of success , I always go alone ; one familiar face would make the effort of no avail ; and I seek a place where I am a stranger , so that my ordinary life can not be recalled to me .

		When I reach my tem - porary home I forget , or at least ignore , my notions as to what I shall eat or drink , or how I shall sleep .

		I take the goods the gods provide , and adjust myself to them .

		Even these little things help one out of his old ways of thought and life .

		To still further banish home concerns , I mark upon my calendar one week before the day I shall start for home , and sternly resolve that not until I reach that day will I give one thought to my re - turn , but will live as though I meant to stay always .

		I take no work of any sort , and I banish books , excepting a few poets and studies of nature ... Holding my - self in this attitude of mind , I secure a change almost as complete as if I stepped out of my body and left it resting , while I refreshed myself at the fountain of life . ''

		These are the words of an energetic , independent woman , who is wise enough to discern the right way to profit by a
summer	DATE	's outing , and strong enough to hold to it in defiance of custom and cir - cumstance .

		The chapters comprising her present volume detail the experiences of three seasons spent respectively in
Utah	LOCATION	,
Colorado	LOCATION	, and
Southern Ohio	LOCATION	.

		They are bright , piquant narratives , embodying the noteworthy incidents occurring in her observa - tion of Western birds , among which were the long - tailed chat , the water-ouzel , the magpie , the rock - wren , the cardinal grosbeak , and blackbirds .

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	pursues a peculiar mode of study .

		Arrived at her chosen place of research , she adopts a dress devoid of conspicuous colors , and , equipped with a camp-stool and opera-glass , seeks the spot where some pair of enticing songsters have established their household .

		Then , seated in a near sheltering thicket , she waits and watches in patient silence to note the doings of the unsuspecting couple .

		The hours daily passed in this unremitting investigation seldom go by without a due reward .

		Many new and interesting traits of even our common birds have been thus detected by Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	, who has earned an honorable place among naturalists by her orig - inal and accurate observations .

		Naturally , there is a mingling of the tragical and the comical in her vagrant experiences .

		An affair amusingly described was the sudden intrusion into her secluded thicket of a quadriped of the bovine race , which to her womanly horror proved to be '' no meek cow . ''

		There could be but one conclusion a rapid and discom - fited flight on the part of the observer , who , until the end of that special case under study , hired an impecunious young college student to sit on guard near her retreat , with a club in one hand and a geometry he was laboriously mastering grasped tightly in the other .

		The sketches '' By Moorland and Sea , '' from the pen of Mr.
Francis A. Knight	PERSON	, treat , as their title in - dicates , of scenes met with in pilgrimages by sea and land .

		The writer is not unknown to us , this being the third collection of his papers which has appeared in an American reprint from the original English edition .

		A representative of what is best in his countrymen , Mr.
Knight	PERSON	possesses wide culture and refined tastes .

		With the bent of a naturalist , from early boyhood he has scanned the earth with a keen searching eye which no feature of out-door life has been able to escape .

		He knows the wild plants in their myriad retreats and calls them readily by name , and the ways of all creeping and flying things are familiar to him as are those of his own kind .

		Thus , in yachting , or camping , or merely sauntering , there is no end of incident enlisting his attention , and this he transfers to his sketch-book with an easy grace that is invariable .

		He describes the scenery in northern
Scotland	LOCATION	brought into view in a nautical trip , the midsummer fields , an old manor-house , the birds-nester , and aspects of winter , with minuteness and intelligence , causing his readers to see and en - joy with him much which they would never have discovered of themselves .

		The illustrations are ad - mirably reproduced from drawings or photographs done by the author .

		A similar marked type of the English gentleman is found in Mr.
Aubyn Trevor-Battye	PERSON	, one of her Majesty 's dashing soldiers who hunts and fishes , zoologizes and poetizes , and finally recounts the
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 history of it all with equal zest and ability .

		He has scored a fair success in his '' Pictures in Prose , '' a book made up of short tales from humble life , and descriptions of nature and wild sport .

		Mr.
Trevor	PERSON	-
Battye	PERSON	has speared the noble salmon in our West - ern waters , and hunted the deer and moose in the wilds of the Rockies and of
British America	LOCATION	.

		Another of the odd , limited fraternity who pre - fer to anything else in life a stroll or a sojourn in some solitary place where wild creatures may be surprised and shot , with at least an eye-glance , is Dr.
Charles Conrad Abbott	PERSON	, the author of several volumes of natural history sketches , and of the last in the present group , called from the opening piece , '' Travels in a Tree-top . ''

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	takes mat - ters leisurely in observing and in writing , which makes the latter just a little heavy .

		The student of nature will go through his books from cover to cover for the sake of the scattered remarks that add to his stock of coveted lore , but the general reader will be apt to complain of his lack of vivac - ity and spicy anecdote .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The purpose of Mr.
William Ord	PERSON	- ' . '

		*** '' '' way
Partridge	ORGANIZATION	's '' Art for
America	LOCATION	' ' in art-education .

		y .

		-LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , six essays reprinted from the '' Arena , '' the `` New England Magazine , '' etc. , is '' to raise art to its rightful place in the scheme of general education . ''

		Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	's aim is laud - able , and much that he says is sound and suggest - ive ; but unfortunately his art views have got tangled up at the start with his '' Americanism . ''

		The ground-view of his preface seems to be that what we are to do as a people , if our art is ever to amount to much , is to keep ourselves to ourselves , and not rub elbows too freely with other nations .

		This policy , we gather , is a condition precedent of the great national art in posse -LRB- or in mibibits -RRB- , which , when it finally dawns , is to be , like that other impending wonder , '' Western Literature , '' strictly unique , and no mere cheap modification of a parent stock .

		Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	thinks this art would come sooner and be even more unique if we did not travel so much .

		He is quite sharp with us on this text . ''

		One of the dangers , '' he says , '' which threatens our art , and I may say our manhood , is that of over - travel . ''

		Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	is not alone in this opinion , which is pretty frequently advanced in one shape or another usually , it may be added , by people whose own opportunities for travel have been lim - ited .

		It is generally admitted that the foreigner may enlarge and enrich his mind as much as pos - sible by travel without thereby endangering his status as a citizen and patriot .

		But with an Amer - ican , it seems , the case alters .

		He loses his pa - triotism in proportion as he sheds his provincial - ism ; and the further he travels and the more he learns , the less likely he is to return a '' good American '' a position , on the whole , not specially flattering to the country he started from .

		To Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	's notion that an American endangers his manhood by taking an occasional trip to
Europe	LOCATION	, we are tempted to reply with Mr.
Burchell	PERSON	's favorite monosyllable '' Fudge ! ''

		Such tourist may pos - sibly come back with the un-American conviction that
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and
Berlin	LOCATION	are better built , bet - ter kept , and better ruled than
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	; but this would hardly affect his man - hood otherwise than by leading to a useful display of it at the primaries .

		Naturally Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	disapproves of foreign study for American artists .

		They should , he thinks , stay at home and be '' nur - tured and developed there . ''

		As this view seems to involve the theorem that for American artists the best place for art-study is the place where the advantages for it are fewest , it scarcely needs dis - cussion .

		We suspect these confused notions about art-education -LRB- which are not peculiar to the author -RRB-
spring	DATE	from an imperfect view of the fact that art is , as Hamerton states it , '' at bottom a refined handicraft . ''

		People are apt to ignore , when they talk about the amount of '' soul , '' etc. , a painter puts into his picture , the part played by the trained eyes and fingers .

		The great artist is the one who to great mental gifts joins a consummate mastery of his craft of a system of technical processes which have nothing at all to do with religion , or morals , or patriotism , or Americanism , or any other abstrac - tion of the kind whatever .

		These processes can be best learned where they are best taught , and where their best results are to be found in the greatest profusion that is to say , in the schools and galler - ies of
Europe	LOCATION	; whither we trust every American youth of marked artistic promise may be aided or persuaded to betake himself .

		Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	's es - says , despite his tendency to soar away from the terra firma of plain writing and plain thinking , are occasionally sound and coherent ; and the publish - ers have given them a neat and handy setting .

		The initial numDer of the much her - number of the aided '' Yellow Book '' has appeared , '' Yellow Book '' Messrs.
Copeland	PERSON	& Day being the American publishers .

		It is an illustrated quarterly magazine , edited by Mr.
Henry Harland	PERSON	, and real - izing in a measure the suggestion made by Mr.
How	PERSON	- ells in '' A Hazard of New Fortunes . ''

		That is , each number of the periodical is to be a cloth-bound book , complete in itself .

		In appearance , `` The Yellow Book '' is attractive , except for the cover , upon the design of which the imagination of Mr.
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	has been permitted to run riot .

		Now Mr.
Beardsley	PERSON	is a very clever young man , and he sometimes displays a real mastery of line , but he misses as frequently as he hits , and he has distinctly missed in the present instance .

		Illustrations are also supplied by Sir
Frederic Leighton	PERSON	, TVIr .


Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, Mr.
Laurence Housman	PERSON	, Mr.
J. T. Nettle	PERSON	- ship , and others .

		In spite of these names the book is something of a disappointment upon the decora - 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, tive side .

		Mr.
Nettleship	PERSON	's '' Head of Minos '' is the most striking of the pictures .

		As for paper and print , they are exceptionally beautiful , although we can not say that we like the square form of the vol - ume .

		Of the contents , we may first mention the poems , which are contributed by Messrs. Le Gal - lienne ,
A. C. Benson	PERSON	,
Watson	PERSON	,
Symons	PERSON	,
Gosse	PERSON	, and
Davidson	PERSON	.

		So good a collection of names and pieces of verse is not often found within the covers of a single issue of any periodical .

		The prose contents open with `` The Death of the Lion , '' a story in the subtlest manner of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		Other im - aginative work of high or at least fair quality is con - tributed by Miss
Ella d'Arcy	PERSON	, Mr.
F. M. Simpson	PERSON	, and the editor .

		`` The Fool 's Hour , '' caustically pleasing , is a play by ''
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	'' and Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	.

		The serious features are Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	's admirable essay on `` Reticence in Literature , '' and Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	's '' The Love - Story of Luigi Tansillo , '' with translations of Tan - sillo 's sonnets .

		The contents are filled out by two or three other things , entirely insignificant , which might better have been omitted .

		The names that we have above enumerated certainly constitute a re - markable array , yet the general impression left after examination of the book is that not more than two or three of them are represented by their better work .

		The sponsors of this new-born periodical have kept their promise in excluding '' actuality '' from its pages .

		There is nothing timely about any of the contents as far as subject-matter is concerned .

		But the sort of '' actuality '' that finds expression in man - nerism is abundantly present , and we doubt if the beginning of the twentieth century will find this volume nearly as readable as we now find it late in the nineteenth .

		We understand that the book has had a very large sale .

		Studies in '' Studies in the Evolution of En - the history of glish Criticism '' is the title of a little English Criticism .

		volume of two hundred pages pub - lished by
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	for
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, being the doctor 's thesis of Miss
Laura Johnson Wylie	PERSON	, and especially interesting as one of the first results of the new policy at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	of admitting women to the graduate school .

		It is a very creditable piece of work , modelled very largely upon
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	's recent sketch of the history of French criticism -LRB- '' L'Evolution de la Critique '' -RRB- , with some sugges - tion also in style and spirit of Bosanquet 's '' History of Esthetic , '' although this comparison is hardly fair to Miss
Wylie	PERSON	's less pretentious plan .

		Consid - erable interest has been manifested of recent years in the history of criticism , of which this volume is the latest evidence .

		Courses on the subject are be - ing conducted at some three or four American uni - versities .

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's `` Poetic and Verse Criticism of the Reign of Elizabeth '' -LRB- University of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
1891	DATE	-RRB- considered some of the more technical questions connected with the history of our early criticism .

		Miss
Wylie	PERSON	's work sketches the period that follows from
Ben Jonson	PERSON	to Dry - den , studies
Dryden	PERSON	's criticism more fully , considers the course of the evolution out of classicism in the eighteenth century , interpolates a section on Ger - man aesthetics considered as a source of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's criticism , and ends with an excellent study of Col - eridge 's critical ideas .

		Miss
Wylie	PERSON	keeps in view throughout the period studied the relations of French and German to English literature , and aims broadly to connect technical literary criticism with the pro- gress of critical thought in aesthetics and general philosophy .

		The defect of the work is a somewhat over-ambitious attempt to digest and present the study of too large a field in too small a space , re - sulting in a style of copious and incessant general - ization .

		To the few students who have been over precisely the same ground , the work will be sug - gestive .

		To other readers it will prove interesting , but elusive and inconclusive .

		An historical mono - graph , perhaps , even when written for specialists , should aim at thoroughness and concreteness of dem - onstration , rather than at purely suggestive gener - alization .

		Field sports for women .

		With all our scoffing at the preva - lent '' Anglomania , '' the malady must be allowed to have had its good re - sults .

		Chief of these , we think , is the inoculation of the youth of this land with the English love of out-door sports .

		Thirty years ago , before the ad - vent of `` Anglomania , '' no part of the Anglo-Saxon world could show on the average -LRB- we have Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's word for it -RRB- so many '' black-coated , stiff - jointed , soft-muscled , paste-complexioned '' young men as the cities of our
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard .

		To most of these town-made youths , cricket , boating , boxing , riding , one might almost say walking , were not only practically unknown , but vulgar like rat-baiting and the '' ring . '' ''

		Society , '' says the Doctor , '' would drop a man who should run around the Common in five minutes . ''

		The young people of that day would seem to have dawdled mostly in-doors , precocious copies of their dyspeptic elders , and not , perhaps , altogether unlike their caricatures in ''
Martin Chuz	PERSON	- zlewit . ''

		But Fashion , in one of her lucid intervals , changed all this .

		The seeds of '' Anglomania , '' winged with her approval , were blown abroad in the land ; and it at once became '' good form '' to be athletic .

		Everybody knows the result .

		Young
America	LOCATION	to-day easily holds his own in the field , on the river , or on the mountain-side , with his cousins over-sea ; and one finds nowhere a sounder and sightlier race than the present successors of the sed - entary youths admonished by Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	.

		Not the least hopeful feature of it all is that the really '' up - to-date '' American girl is no whit behind her brothers in this wholesome taste for fresh air and exercise ; and it is to her that the pretty volume before us , '' Ladies in the Field '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is specially com - mended .

		It contains thirteen `` sketches of sport , '' reminiscent and instructive : '' Riding in
Ireland	LOCATION	and '
India	LOCATION	, '' by Lady Greville ; '' Horses and their Riders , '' by the Duchess of Newcastle ; '' Fox -

		Hunting '' and `` Team and Tandem Driving , '' by Miss
Rosie Anstruther Thomson	PERSON	; '' Covert Shoot - ing , '' hy Lady Boynton ; '' Tigers I have Shot , '' hy Mrs.
Martelli	PERSON	; etc. .

		The sketches are all vivaciously and entertainingly written , and we have no doubt they are instructive in their way .

		Mr.
Enoch A. Bryan	PERSON	's '' The Mark in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- is an illustration of zeal without suffi - cient knowledge .

		It may be harsh to judge it by the following : '' So , taking the
England	LOCATION	of Domes - day and Domesday was said to include every yard of land in it , '' yet this is an indication of the mislead - ing character of the book .

		The controversy of the '' Germanists '' and the '' Romanists '' in regard to the mark is set forth with ample reverence for
Seebohm	PERSON	and Coulanges , but with scant courtesy for their opponents ; the attempt to get up a battle over '' the mark in
America	LOCATION	'' savors to an outsider of a per - sonal reminiscence of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	vs.
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	in scholastic rivalry ; and the closing effort to show that the mark theory is a fruitful source of danger in economic discussion as conducted by
Henry George	PERSON	indicates a lack of historical insight into the forward movement of society which Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	contends for eagerly .

		The argumentation on pages 32 and 33 , that because agri are mentioned along with homes and occupations as in possession , they must be holden in severalty , shows an unf amiliarity with early forms of expression ; and the transla - tion on page 35 of the much interpreted classic passage from the '' Germania '' beginning `` Agri pro numero , '' fails to explain the crux of the whole passage '' in vices . ''

		The real value of the book lies alone in its emphasis of the truth that commun - ity of action and a certain equality are proof '' neither of freedom nor of the common ownership of any - thing , '' which the author illustrates happily from the condition of the plantation negro before the Civil War .

		The truth is , however , slowly being rec - ognized in the literature of land tenures in
England	LOCATION	that an eclecticism between the extremes of
Kem	PERSON	- ble and
Seebohm	PERSON	is a safer ground than partisan - ship .

		Thrashing debt ^ contentious people to the the old straw author of '' Junius '' is considerable .

		of `` Junius . ''

		Q ne ig a i ways fancying that the de - bate as to the authorship of the vituperative and over-rated Letters is settled , and being unexpectedly roused to the fact that it is n't by the appearance of a fresh disputant armed with fresh '' proofs '' and as full of the ardor of battle as if the matter were of yesterday - To a plain man interested in the life about him it may seem that the '' Junius '' question is relatively a trivial one .

		But he should remember that there is always a class of disputatious yet schol - arly minds to whom the gravity of a question is in inverse ratio to its bearing on contemporary life and action .

		To some of these minds the riddle set by
North	ORGANIZATION	's and
Grafton	ORGANIZATION	's masked heckler has an absorb - ing interest , and they would probably go on debating it even were the society in which they live and have their being in the throes of dissolution .

		The latest QEdipus to present himself with a solution of the mystery is Mr.
H. R. Francis	PERSON	, a grandson of Sir
Philip Francis	PERSON	.

		Nine out of ten students of the subject are satisfied that Sir
Philip	PERSON	was `` Junius '' ; but to make , as he hopes , assurance doubly sure , and to clinch , as we hope , the matter for all time , Mr.
Francis	PERSON	, in his '' ` Junius ' Revealed '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , recapitulates his ancestor 's case and adds some new and cogent evidence in point .

		Mr.
Francis	PERSON	writes clearly and argues closely ; and his book is certainly one which those interested in its topic should have .

		Several facsimile writings tending to establish Sir
Philip	PERSON	's authorship of the letters are appended .

		National literature of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		A neat and inexpensive volume , of especial interest to thoughtful Irish - men , is '' The Revival of Irish Litera - ture '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
T. Fisher Unwin	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , containing four occasional addresses by Sir
Charles Gavan Duffy	PERSON	, Dr.
George Sigerson	PERSON	, and Dr.
Douglas Hyde	PERSON	.

		The aim of the writers is the promotion of a higher sense of Irish unity , and of a reverence for and familiarity with the national literature and history .

		It may be noted in passing that Sir
Charles Duffy	PERSON	finds that the books now chiefly read by the young in
Ireland	LOCATION	are '' detective or other sensational stories from
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	. ''

		We did not know that the wares of our own book-making Fagins had travelled so far .

		This noxious trash -LRB- the purvey - ors of which are at least as criminal as the crimin - als they form and educate -RRB- Sir
Charles	PERSON	hopes to drive out by making generally accessible in popu - lar libraries good books by native authors such books as are '' fit to win and fascinate young Irish readers , '' and `` make them better men and better Irishmen . ''

		We need hardly say that the present volume appeals to Irish reason rather than Irish passions ; and that it is free from the inflammatory stuff ladled out by the class of agitators the real goal of whose '' patriotic '' endeavors is the pocket-books of their too-trusting countrymen .

		Mr.
Cecil Torr	PERSON	's `` Ancient Ships '' -LRB-
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	, 1894 -RRB- is a scholarly book for scholars .

		One Ancient ships pictured and described .

		of its marked features is an almost complete absence of references to other modern treatises , although , as the author assures us in his preface , he has worked through and profited by the somewhat voluminous literature of his subject .

		Per contra , the original sources of information are cited and discussed in elaborate foot-notes , which fill more than half , on the average , of each page of text .

		Eight plates of illustrations , from ancient paintings , sculptures , coins , etc. , complete the apparatus of the volume .

		These illustrations have been copied , not in the usual fashion , from the compilations , too often untrust - worthy , of predecessors in the same field , but from the most authentic sources , often from casts , with much conscientious verification .

		Although the sub - 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, ject includes all ancient shipping in the
Mediter	PERSON	- ranean , the lion 's share of attention falls to
Greece	LOCATION	.

		There are few men competent to pronounce a de - tailed judgment on Mr.
Torr	PERSON	's book , but we do not hesitate to recommend '' Ancient Ships '' as simply indispensable to any who wish to grapple in earnest with the subject .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have given a charmingly dainty setting to the rather vapid little '' Journal of Mar - tha
Pintard Bayard	PERSON	. ''

		Mrs.
Bayard	PERSON	was the wife of Judge
Samuel Bayard	PERSON	-LRB- one might almost say '' of that ilk '' -RRB- who was appointed by
Washington	LOCATION	in
1794	DATE	as agent to prosecute , under the Jay treaty , the claims of American citizens in the British Admiralty courts .

		The present volume records Mrs.
Bayard	PERSON	's English impres - sions .

		There are two portraits .

		Mr.
Volney M. Spalding	PERSON	's '' Guide to the Study of Common Plants '' -LRB- Heath -RRB- is a text-book for high school grades .

		It is based upon the laboratory method , and provides a series of exercises that cover the most im - portant types of plant life .

		The cryptogamous groups get but few of these exercises , although quite as many as it is desirable to require of the beginner .

		Seven or - ders of endogens and twenty orders of exogens are illus - trated by one or more species each .

		The treatment is suggestive , and well calculated to direct attention to the essential characteristics of the forms taken up for study .

		M. Fre ` de ` ric
Houssay	PERSON	's '' The Industries of Animals '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , is published in the '' Contem - porary Science '' series .

		This English adaptation of a French work has been prepared with the cooperation of the author , but the name of the translator , for some un - explained reason , does not appear .

		It consists of chap - ters on such subjects as the dwellings of animals , their hunting , fishing , methods of defence , their care of the young , and the sanitation of their hives , nests , or other dwellings .

		The illustrations are mostly from
Herr Brehm	PERSON	's '' Thierleben . ''


John Larkin Lincoln	PERSON	-LRB- 1817-1891 -RRB- was for many years a professor in
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	.

		His son , Mr.
William E. Lincoln	PERSON	, has prepared , with pious care , a memorial vol - ume which can not fail to possess the deepest interest for the friends of the scholar who is its subject , and which is not without a certain value for others .

		It includes a memorial address by Professor
George P. Fisher	PERSON	, ex - tracts from
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's diaries and letters , and a selection of his most important papers .

		In these , classical themes predominate , although we find also such modern subjects as ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' ''
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	and the Inquisition , '' ''
James Clerk Maxwell	PERSON	, '' and '' The Historian
Leopold von Ranke	PERSON	. ''

		The book is handsomely published by Messrs.
Hough	PERSON	- ton ,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A
Congress of Jewish Women	ORGANIZATION	was one of the many gatherings held in
Chicago	LOCATION
last summer	DATE	, and the papers of this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, of which Mrs.
Hannah G. Solomon	PERSON	was chairman , are now put forth in a substantial volume by the
Jewish Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the subjects discussed are '' Jewish Women of Biblical and of Mediaeval Times , '' '' Women Wage - Workers , '' '' Mission Work among the Unenlightened Jews , '' and '' How Can Nations Be Influenced to Protest or Interfere in Cases of Persecution ? '' ''

		The Struggle of Protestant Dissenters for Religious Toleration in
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Henry R. Mcllwaine	PERSON	, is the latest of the ''
Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The period covered by this treatise begins with the year
1649	DATE	and extends to the close of the French and Indian War .

		The Quakers , the Huguenots , and the Presbyterians were the princi - pal dissenting sects whose struggles the author describes and whose incomplete victory he records .

		A new edition of ''
Owen Meredith	PERSON	's '' ''
Lucile	PERSON	, '' and a selection from his poems by Lady
Betty Balfour	PERSON	, have been published in two handsome and uniform volumes -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The '' Lucile '' includes the preface to the third edition , in which the author defended himself against the charge of plagiarism .

		The other volume has a lengthy introduction by Lady
Balfour	PERSON	.

		She gives us selections from all of her father 's books except '' The Wanderer '' -LRB- which has been republished in a volume by itself -RRB- , `` Orval '' -LRB- which no one cares to remember -RRB- , ''
Marah	PERSON	, '' and '' King Poppy . ''

		There are also a few hitherto unpublished poems .

		The book for boys that is made to order is not as a general thing to be encouraged , but an exception to this rule must be made in the case of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's '' Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , which is a sequel to his charming '' Prince Prigio . ''

		If we are not greatly out of the reckoning , this book will become a prime favorite , not only with the boys for whom it is written , but also with those children of a larger growth who enjoy artistic nonsense .

		It is quite worthy to stand on the shelf beside the history of Alice in Won - derland .

		The '' Religion of Science '' library -LRB- Open Court Pub - lishing Co. -RRB- , which consists of bi-monthly reprints of independent works , completes its first year by the publi - cation of
M. Alfred Bluet	PERSON	's '' The Psychic Life of Micro - Organisms . '' ''

		The Diseases of Personality '' and '' The Psychology of Attention , '' by
M. T. Ribot	PERSON	, have preceded this issue , the three other numbers for the year having been Dr.
Carus	PERSON	's '' The Religion of Science , '' and two sets of lectures by Professor
Max Muller	PERSON	.

		These books are all of decided value , and place before the public , at a low price , some of the most important results of recent scientific investigation .

		Teachers of the modern languages will be glad to have their attention called to three recent publications of Mr.
W. R. Jenkins	PERSON	. ''

		Short Selections for Translating En - glish into French '' is a useful manual by
M. Paul Bercy	PERSON	. ''

		Le Franc.ais par la Conversation , '' by
M. Charles P. DuCroquet	PERSON	, is for those who think there is such a thing as learning French by chatter .

		The '' Contes de Balzac , '' edited by Dr.
George M. Harper	PERSON	and Mr.
Louis E. Livingood	PERSON	, makes one of the best possible reading books for advanced classes .

		It includes '' Une Passion dans le Desert , '' '' Un Episode sous la Terreur , '' '' Le Colonel
Chabert	PERSON	, '' and three other stories .

		From
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have a '' Short French Grammar '' and a companion pamphlet of '' French Lessons and Exer - cises , '' both by Mr.
C. H. Grandgent	PERSON	, and both deserv - ing of the highest praise .

		Among strictly elementary works , we know of nothing better for American schools than this '' Grammar . ''

		The same publishers send us an Italian text
Gherardi del Testa	PERSON	's '' L'Oro e POr - pello '' edited by Mr.
C. H. Thurber	PERSON	.

		The `` Temple '' Shakespeare -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , to be pub - lished on the play-a-volume plan , is so attractive that we hardly see how it could be improved upon .

		It has the Dent imprint , with all the qualities of tastefulness

		THE DIAL 339 that the name implies .

		The
Cambridge	LOCATION	text is used ; the brief prefaces , notes , and glossaries are by Mr.

		The volumes will be issued in the first folio order .

		A special edition for students , with extra wide margins , is also announced .

		The Hon.

Duke of Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	and Lady Morpeth .

		Most of the letters are written from
Paris	LOCATION	, where Lord
Granville	PERSON	represented his country for many years .

		They are rich in remin - iscences of social life in the early part of the century , and abound in anecdotes of well-known characters . ''

		A Child 's History of
Spain	LOCATION	'' is Mr.
John Bonner	PERSON	's latest addition to his historical series -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , and maintains the high character of its predecessors .

		It begins with 500
B. C.	PERSON	, and ends with a description of
Spain	LOCATION	's present social and industrial conditions , which , after a lethargy of a hundred years , now begin to show marked signs of prosperity .

		The oft-told story of the Spanish discovery by
Columbus	LOCATION	, the dramatic tales of the Spanish conquests by
Cortez	PERSON	and
Pizarro	PERSON	, and the lives of the Spanish heroes
Iturbide	PERSON	and Bolivar , are all given with a freshness and spirit that will render them highly attractive to readers of all ages .

		Volume III .

		of Professor
H. Grsetz	PERSON	's '' History of the Jews '' -LRB- Jewish Publication Society -RRB- carries the narra - tive from the revolt against the Zendiks in 511 A. D. to the capture of

		Among the topics discussed are the Jews in
Arabia	LOCATION	, the golden age of Jewish culture in

		YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
May 28 , 1894	DATE	.

		One of the noteworthy recent importations of Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons who , by the way , have finally removed to their new building in Fifth avenue is Esther Wood 's ''
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	and the Pre-Raphaelite Move - ment , '' the most concise and complete biography of Ros - setti which has yet appeared .

		Mrs. Wood disclaims attempting a final biography , quoting
Hall Caine	PERSON	's state - ment that the one person capable of doing this is Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	, who was
Rossetti	PERSON	's chief confidant in his later years .

		At the same time she has collected and arranged in a well-considered order all the information at hand , and has added to this some interesting remin - iscences of class-room and studio life , and of the Pre - Raphaelites at
Oxford	LOCATION	, unpublished before .

		The book contains several fine reproductions of
Rossetti	PERSON	's paint - ings .

		Almost simultaneously with the appearance of this volume comes the
May	DATE	number of '' The Portfolio , '' with Mr.
F. G. Stephens	PERSON	's monograph on
Rossetti	PERSON	, with a number of reproductions of his pictures not so well made as might be expected in an art-periodical of this character .

		Some of the more important pictures are not given , I know not whether on account of copyright prohibition in
England	LOCATION	or because they are so familiar there .

		The omission is a marked one , however .

		Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	is art-critic of '' The Athenaeum , '' and was one of the original Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , it will be remembered .

		His monograph contains new anecdotes of the group .

		The author is slightly aggressive in his exposition of
Rossetti	PERSON	's influence on younger poets and painters , an influence long since admitted , it should be said that Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	probably has a keen recollec - tion of the time when almost every hand was turned against himself and his brother '' Pre-Raphs . ''

		Among the more important English poets whose verse in some degree is indebted to the influence of
Rossetti	PERSON	, Mr.
Eugene Lee-Hamilton	PERSON	may be counted .

		At the same time he has an independent note of his own , this being only one phase of his poetry .

		For over twenty years Mr.
Lee-Hamilton	PERSON	has been the victim of a spinal trouble , unable to read or write or to be read to , and without the power of locomotion .

		His '' Poems and Transcripts , '' '' The New Medusa , '' '' Apollo and Mar - syas , '' etc. , have been dictated to an amanuensis under these conditions ; and they have made a decided mark in the literary world .

		Some sonnets , also , have appeared in '' The Athenaeum '' and elsewhere , and these , with many more , will be published in a volume called '' Son - nets of the Wingless Hours '' by
Messrs. Stone & Kim	ORGANIZATION	- ball , who have kindly permitted me to copy a few of them for THE DIAL .

		The book seems to me the most noteworthy of its kind which has appeared since the publication of
William Watson	PERSON	's '' Epigrams '' in
1884	DATE	.

		Strange to relate , with the preparation of this book , which is in part an epitome of its author 's tragic exist - ence , the hours have again taken wings for him ; he is able once more to read and write , and is hopeful of a happy recovery .

		He has lived all these years at a farm - villa , '' II
Palmerino	PERSON	, '' near
Florence	LOCATION	, where his half - sister , Miss Violet Paget -LRB- '' Vernon Lee '' -RRB- , has devoted herself to him with unceasing attention .

		Readers of the sonnets quoted will be interested to compare the one en - titled '' What the Sonnet Is '' with Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's '' What is a Sonnet ? ''

		and with the sonnets by
Rossetti	PERSON	and older poets on the same subject .

		340 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, TO THE MUSE .

		To keep through life the posture of the grave , While others walk and run and dance and leap ; To keep it ever , waking or asleep , While shrink the limbs that Nature goodly gave ; In
summer	DATE	's heat no more to breast the wave ; No more to wade through seeded grasses deep ; Nor tread the cornfield where the reapers reap ; Nor stretch free limbs beneath a leafy nave : 'T is hard , ' t is hard ; and so in winter too , 'T is hard to hear no more the sweet faint creak Of the crisp snow , the frozen earth 's clear ring , Where ripe blue sloes and crimson berries woo The hopping redbreast .

		But when thou dost seek My lonely room , sweet Muse , Despair takes wing .

		SEA - SHELL MURMURS .

		The hollow sea-shell which for years hath stood On dusty shelves , when held against the ear Proclaims its stormy parent ; and we hear The faint far murmur of the breaking flood .

		We hear the sea .

		The sea ?

		It is the blood In our own veins , impetuous and near .

		And pulses keeping pace with hope and fear And with our feelings ' every shifting mood .

		Lo , in my heart I hear , as in a shell , The murmur of a world beyond the grave , Distinct , distinct , though faint and far it be .

		Thou fool ; this echo is a cheat as well , The hum of earthly instincts ; and we crave A world unreal as the shell-heard sea .

		WHAT THE SONNET IS .

		Fourteen small broidered berries on the hem Of
Circe	ORGANIZATION	's mantle , each of magic gold ; Fourteen of lone
Calypso	ORGANIZATION	's tears that roll 'd Into the sea , for pearls to come of them ; Fourteen clear signs of omen in the gem With which Medea human fate foretold ; Fourteen small drops , which Faustus , growing old , Craved of the Fiend , to water Life 's dry stem .

		It is the pure white diamond Dante brought To Beatrice ; the sapphire
Laura	PERSON	wore When Petrarch cut it sparkling out of thought ; The ruby Shakespeare hewed from his heart 's core ; The dark deep emerald that
Rossetti	PERSON	wrought For his own soul , to wear forevermore .

		BAUDELAIRE .

		A
Paris	LOCATION	gutter of the good old times , Black and putrescent in its stagnant bed , Save where the shamble oozings fringe it red , Or scaffold trickles , or nocturnal crimes .

		It holds dropped gold ; dead flowers from tropic climes ; Gems true and false , by midnight maskers shed ; Old pots of rouge ; old broken phials that spread Vague fumes of musk , with fumes from slums and slimes .

		And everywhere , as glows the set of day , There floats upon the winding fetid mire The gorgeous iridescence of decay : A wavy film of color , gold and fire , Trembles all through it as you pick your way , And streaks of purple that are straight from Tyre .

		1
From Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	also come the first two num - bers of `` The Chap-Book , '' a dainty little semi-monthly publication devoted to literary criticism , poetry , aud fic - tion , by approved and by unknown writers .

		For the second number , just about to be published , Mrs.
Moul	PERSON	- ton contributes a quatrain ; Mr.
Richard Henry Stod	PERSON	- dard reviews
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's '' A Lover 's Diary '' at some length and most appreciatively ; a poem by
Bliss Carman	PERSON	, `` The Prayer in the Rose Garden , '' is given ; there is a story by
Pereival Pollard	PERSON	; and there are one or two entertaining '' skits . ''

		The combination of taste and energy shown by this young firm is characteristic of the time , and will not be without results .

STEDMAN	PERSON	.

		TjITERARY NOTES A1STD MISCELLANY .

		Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's '' Perlycross '' is just about to appear from the press of
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	's '' Victorian Anthology , '' illus - trating his '' Victorian Poets , '' will be published in the autumn .

		The
English Spenser Society	ORGANIZATION	, after twenty-six years of activity , has published its farewell volume , a reprint of Heywood 's '' The Spider and the Flie . ''

		The
D. Van Nostrand Co.	ORGANIZATION	have nearly ready '' Mod - ern Methods of Sewage Disposal , '' by Colonel
G. E. Waring	PERSON	, Jr. ; and '' New Roads and Road Laws in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Roy Stone	PERSON	.

		The double
summer	DATE	number of '' Poet-Lore '' will con - tain an exceptionally interesting series of articles , among them being : `` Saga Literature , '' by Mr.
J. H. Wisby	PERSON	; ''
Einar Christiansen	PERSON	, '' by Professor
D. K. Dodge	PERSON	; and '' Literature and the Scientific Spirit , '' by Professor
L. A. Sherman	PERSON	.

		The annual report of the trustees of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's birthplace shows that there were 18,000 paid admissions in
1893	DATE	materially fewer than in
1892	DATE	.

		The falling off is ascribed to the depression in
America	LOCATION	and to the
Chicago	LOCATION	exhibition .

		The report shows an adverse bal - ance of 697 .

		The large body of literature attributed to
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	will be included in unabridged form , and in English , in two volumes , to be brought out in
London	LOCATION	.

		They will bear the title '' The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The text from which the translation has been made is that of the
Geneva	LOCATION	folio of
1658	DATE	in
Latin	LOCATION	.

		In a recent magazine article , '' Mark Twain '' told of the discovery of his '' Jumping Frog '' story in a Greek text-book , the inference being that the story had a clas - sical prototype .

		But the resemblance was so striking that it proved too much , and now Professor
Sidgwick	PERSON	, who prepared the text-book in question , states that he took the story straight from its American source , merely to use it as an exercise for translation into Greek .

		Mr.
John Seymour Wood	PERSON	is to be the editor of a new monthly magazine published at
New York	LOCATION	in the interest of college men in particular and the public in general .

		We are told that the magazine will cover all matters of interest to college graduates in art , literature , politics , and athletics , that Mr.
Albert Stickney	PERSON	will contribute articles on political and economic questions , and that Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	will write literary critiques .

		Messrs.
Houghton Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just issued a pamphlet entitled '' Good Literature . ''

		It is divided into three parts .

		The first part contains the opinions of em - inent men who favor the use of literature in schools .

		In part two are given the methods of using literature adopted by a number of educators .

		The third part con - tains a graded list of literary masterpieces suitable for
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 school use .

		There is an interesting introduction to the whole , showing what the aim of the publishers has been in supplying good literature in a cheap form .

		Mr.
James Tomkinson	PERSON	has edited the diary of his father ,
William Tomkinson	PERSON	, who served in the
Penin	LOCATION	- sular and
Waterloo	LOCATION	campaigns -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The gen - eral reader will take slight interest in this unpretentious record of a soldier 's life , but it undoubtedly has value as a document , even at this late day .

		The volume is illustrated with maps and engraved portraits . ''

		The pictures they publish of me , '' says Mr.
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	, '' vary considerably .

		They represent every type from the most godlike creatures to the criminal classes ; and their descriptions of me vary in proportion from a man with a ' noble bearing ' to a ' blighted boy . '

		I do n't mind what they say as a general rule , only I did object when somewhere in the States an in - terviewer wrote , ' A tall willowy column supported his classic head , from which proceeded a hacking cough . '

		I could not forgive that ! ''

		This amusing paragraph is taken from '' The English Illustrated Magazine . ''

		The following plaint of an aggrieved writer appears in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Critic '' : `` Six years ago I wrote an article on the education of women for a
New York	LOCATION	mag - azine , which was accepted .

		This year my request to be allowed to see my article again was granted , and on reading it over I found it so absolutely behind the times changes in regard to women have been going on so rapidly that I have been obliged to write it completely over again .

		I have now returned my manuscript to the editor with the request that he forward it to me every six years , in order that I may keep it up to a decent standard of timeliness ! '' ''

		The Canadian Bookseller '' for
April	DATE	contains some interesting statistics .

		During
1893	DATE	, the total number of copyrights registered throughout the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	was 449 , of which only ten were novels .

		The total value of books , etc. , imported during the year was
$ 890,000	MONEY	, the
United States	ORGANIZATION	contributing
$ 476,000	MONEY	, as compared with
$ 327,000	MONEY	from great
Britain	LOCATION	.

		English authors will be more interested to learn that the imports of copyright books , on which they are supposed to receive a royalty of 12 per cent ad valorem , amounted to only
$ 13,000	MONEY	.

		Under the new tariff it is proposed to abol - ish the collection of this royalty , and to impose a uni - form duty on all books -LRB- other than music , maps , and prints -RRB- of
six cents	MONEY	per pound avoirdupois . ''

		The Independent '' closes an interesting account of the recently discovered Hymn to Apollo with the fol - lowing suggestion , which we heartily endorse : '' The glory of having unearthed these precious musical frag - ments at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	would to-day belong to the
American School of Classical Studies	ORGANIZATION	at
Athens	LOCATION	, had the
$ 80,000	MONEY	necessary for the
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	excavations been raised in
America	LOCATION	more promptly .

		Let the past supply lessons for the present .

		The
American School	ORGANIZATION	has just received the privilege from the
Greek Government	ORGANIZATION	of excavating the northern slope of the
Acropolis	LOCATION	at
Athens	LOCATION	, where the most important public buildings of the ancient city are un - doubtedly buried under fifty feet of earth .

		It is to be hoped that the friends of classical learning and culture in
America	LOCATION	will be more prompt this time with their subscriptions . '' ''

		The Pall Mall Budget '' reports a remarkable liter - ary discovery by '' an advanced Baconian . ''

		The writer proves -LRB- cryptographically speaking -RRB- that
Bacon	PERSON	, the great originator of all the English literature of his age , was also the author of `` Box and Cox . ''

		This he sets forth from the back of the first edition , where the name of the play is printed HOX AND COX These columns read from top to bottom , give BACON OXDX .

		Here the author not only actually signed his own name , but gave the date also ; for , taking out the letters that have a numerical value , we have CXDX , which , added , give 620 .

		This stands for
1620	DATE	, the date of the '' Novum Organum '' and without doubt of '' Box and Cox '' also .

		A
Walt Whitman Society	ORGANIZATION	, with Mr.
Horace L. Trau	PERSON	- bel as secretary , has been planned , and is just now per - fecting its permanent organization .

		Its objects are : 1 .

		The consolidation within a single organization of all persons who are interested in the life and work of
Walt Whitman	ORGANIZATION	.

		2 .

		The establishment of Centres in differ - ent parts of the world , which shall bring together the lovers and admirers of Whitman , and which , by the maintenance of correspondence and the exchange of views , shall tend to close fraternal relations among the members of the Society .

		3 .

		The publication , from time to time , of Whitman literature and of such essays and other papers as may be deemed valuable in elucidation of Whitman 's philosophy of life , or in exposition of his poetry and principles .

		Miss
Emily James Smith	PERSON	, a fellow in the department of Greek of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, has just been elected to the deanship of
Barnard College	ORGANIZATION	, and will enter upon the duties of that responsible position in the
fall	DATE	.

		As a classical scholar ,
Miss Smith	ORGANIZATION	is probably un - surpassed by any woman in the country .

		She studied under Professor
Shorey	PERSON	at
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	from
1885	DATE	to
1889	DATE	, under Professor
Jebb	PERSON	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	during the following year , then taught for two years in the
Packer Institute of Brooklyn	ORGANIZATION	, and for the past year has been working once more under Professor
Shorey	PERSON	, at the Uni - versity of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		She published a volume of '' Se - lections from Lucian '' two or three years ago , and will also be remembered as the author of `` The Hungry Greeklings , '' a brilliant paper recently contributed to '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		The Association for the
Encouragement of Greek Studies	ORGANIZATION	, of
Paris	LOCATION	, has lately given , in the amphitheatre at the
Beaux	LOCATION	- Arts , a performance of the Hymn to Apollo which was brought to light last year at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, with the music to which it was originally set .

		This is the first time that any important piece of Greek music has ever been reproduced .

		Much has been known of the esteem in which music was held among the Greeks , but very little has been known of the Greek music .

		The inform - ation to be drawn from ancient writers on the subject is quite sterile , and , as
M. Theodore Reinach	PERSON	said in a lecture which preceded the hymn , it is no more possible to judge of Greek music from their works than it would be to get a clear idea of Greek architecture out of Vit - ruvius .

		It was known that the acquaintance of the Greeks with harmony and instrumentation was no more than rudimentary ; in polyphony they did not go beyond two-part singing .

		On the other hand they had three modes the Lydian ,
Phrygian	LOCATION	, and Dorian where we have only the major and minor .

		It is in the Dorian mode , the most incontestably Greek of the three , that the newly found hymn is written .

		From the hymn it appears that the Greeks had two methods of musical no - tation , using either geometrical signs , or letters .

		They had no musical staff , and the sign was written over its 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, word .

		When the same note came twice , or more times , in succession , only one sign was used , that is , it was not repeated .

		Twenty-eight lines of the hymn have been recovered , and eighty measures of the music .

		Mme.
Remade	PERSON	was the singer of it , giving it first in Greek and then in French .

		For the accompaniment , the ci - thara and the flute of the Greeks were replaced by a harp , and the clarinette register of a harmonium .

		M. Rein - ach , in his lecture , promised the audience a '' jouissance delicate et aigue . ''

		The first impression of the hear - ers seems to have justified the last adjective .

		The music is written in a five-eight time , strange to modern ears .

		But the ears soon grew accustomed to this , and even found some charm in it ; and delight followed .

		The hymn was discovered in the Athenian treasury at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, where the French School of Archaeology have been making excavations .

		It was engraved on marble slabs .

		The treasury itself was a small building , erected by the Athenians just after
Marathon	ORGANIZATION	, to receive the offerings sent to the great temple at
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, in the close neighborhood of which it is situated .

		The Greek of the hymn has been put into French by MM .

		Thdodore Rein - ach and
Georges d'Eichthal	PERSON	.

		A PROPOSED TENNYSON MEMORIAL .

		Mr.
Douglas W. Freshfield	PERSON	, of Freshwater , Isle of
Wight	LOCATION	, is circulating the following appeal among the American public : '' As a member and at the request of the local com - mittee appointed for the erection of a memorial to the late Poet Laureate in this place his home for forty years I write to ask your aid in making general the character of the monument selected .

		It has been de - cided to erect on the highest crest of the down over - looking the western end of the island , and between the roads of Farringford and the English Channel , a gran - ite monolith in the form of an lona cross .

		The design will be furnished by Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	,
R.A.	LOCATION	With the per - mission of the authorities of the
Trinity House	ORGANIZATION	, who propose to change the name of the landmark from the
Nodes Beacon	ORGANIZATION	to the
Tennyson Beacon	ORGANIZATION	, the present structure , a pile of tarred wood , erected last year , will be removed and its place taken by the cross .

		The spot chosen , the ' ridge of the noble down ' Tennyson loved , will , I believe , recommend itself to his friends , and the companions of his daily walks .

		As a land and sea mark , in view of every ship that passes in or out of the Needles , or under the island , the beacon cross should form a con - spicuous and fitting memorial to one of
England	LOCATION	's great poets . ''

		A considerable sum has already been subscribed lo - cally and among the late Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	's friends .

		But more money is needed to make the monument what it should be in scale and finish .

		There must be many both in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	who would wish to be contrib - utors to this memorial .

		I am desired to ask all such to be good enough to forward their contributions before
July 1	DATE	next to the Rev.
J. Merriman	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, Freshwater , Isle of
Wight	LOCATION	, by whom they will be at once acknowl - edged .

		A complete subscription list will be sent in due course to every subscriber . ''

		In this connection it is interesting to note that the memorial to
Keats	PERSON	, provided by the efforts of an Amer - ican
Committee	ORGANIZATION	headed by Mr.
F. Holland Day	PERSON	, has taken the form of a marble bust of the poet , which is soon to be unveiled in the parish church at
Hempstead	LOCATION	.

		About one hundred American men of letters and artists defrayed the cost of this memorial .

June 16	DATE	, NEW WORKS OF FICTION .

		Under the Red Robe .

		A Romance .

		With 12 full-page Illustrations by
R. CATON	PERSON
WOODVILLE	LOCATION	.

		12mo , cloth , ornamental ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		`` Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's new novel takes us again to
France	LOCATION	; and this time it is to
France	LOCATION	under the
Red Robe of Cardinal Richelieu	ORGANIZATION	.

		... It is interesting , in comparing this romance with its predecessor , ' A Gentleman of
France	LOCATION	, ' ... to note certain striking points of similarity in such dissimilar books .

		In each case a person of high rank is to be taken prisoner for political reasons , and to be conveyed under guard to the Cap - ital .

		In each case the man delegated to the task is a gentle - man whose life or fortune hangs upon the successful perform - ance of his dangerous mission ; and in each case it is this man who tells the story of the adventure , and of the way the he - roine learns to love him .

		With such essential features in common , the two narratives are yet so managed that these resemblances seem only casual .

		It is a point in art , then , that the author should be able to construct two successive books upon such like themes .

		It is interesting , too , to set side by side the heroes of the two novels .

		Such comparison shows that Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	knows well how to discriminate varieties of bravery ... Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's heroes are not run from the stock mold , nor from any one mold .

		They neither look nor act alike .

		But ... though they are cast in different molds the metal is still the same bravery of a thoroughly mascu - line kind .

		The author is an artist in character as well as in plot , or , to put it specifically , he is an artist in making his plot portray his characters , and his characters carry on his plot .

		To this skill in construction , this insight into people , add the choice of stirring themes , and the charm of a fresh , direct style , and the elements of Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's success are evident . ''

		Critic . ''

		As perfect a novel of the new school of fiction as '
Ivan	PERSON	- toe ' or '
Henry Esmond	PERSON	' was of theirs .

		Each later story has shown a marked advance in strength and treatment , and in the last Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	... demonstrates that he has no su - perior among living novelists ... There are but two char - acters in the story his art makes all other but unnoticed shadows cast by them and the attention is so keenly fixed upon one or both , from the first word to the last , that we live in their thoughts and see the drama unfolded through their eyes .

		A delightful love story .

		The interest of the reader is con - stantly excited by the development of unexpected turns in the relation of the principal lovers .

		The romance lies against a background of history truly painted ... The descrip - tions of the court life of the period and of the factional strifes , divisions , hatreds of the age , are fine ... Worthy of a very high place among historical novels of recent years . ''

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` EdnaLyall 's ... new story ... is one of her best .

		It has , naturally , enough of tragedy to make it intensely in - teresting , without being sensational in any offensive sense .

		The heroine ,
Doreen	PERSON	, is a delightful character , sturdy , strong , lovable , womanly , and genuinely Irish .

		Miss
Bayly	PERSON	is a con - scientious writer , imbued with deep feeling , a high purpose , and her style is attractive and pure . ''


Boston Daily Adver	ORGANIZATION	- tiser . ''


Edna Lyall	PERSON	has evidently made a close study of the Irish question , and she sees its varying aspects and problems with a desire to do justice to all , while she stands firmly on her own principles ... There is much to recommend in
Edna Lyall	PERSON	's books , and her admirers are many .

		The book will be read with interest ... It is yet well written and compre - hensive , treating of universal principles in a broad way and presenting characters in whom one becomes interested for their own sake . ''

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.00	MONEY	. ''

		Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	has done nothing better : ... it may well be doubted if he has ever done anything half so good .

		The tale is one of the good , old-fashioned sort , filled with the ele - ments of romance and adventure , and it moves on from one thrilling situation to another with a celerity and a verisimili - tude that positively fascinates the reader ... The story is told with astonishing variety of detail , and in its main lines keeps close to historical truth .

		The result is a really splendid piece of romantic literature .

		The illustrations , by
Maurice Greiffenhagen	PERSON	, are admirable in spirit and technique . ''

$ 1.00	MONEY	.

		This remarkable novel , introducing many of the characters , inci - dents , and scenes in the great tragedy of the Crucifixion , is the latest work from the pen of a writer who has won great fame in
England	LOCATION	for her vivid romances upon spiritual themes .

		She possesses a pictur - esqueness of style and a grasp of character and situation of unusual power , and the tone of the book is in all respects deeply reverential , taking no liberties with the sacred text .

		This volume is edited by Captain
King	PERSON	, who writes the first story , which gives its name to the book .

		Most of the others are by officers of the army , each giving a varied and peculiar flavor of adventure to the stories . ''

		The author of ' The Colonel 's Daughter , ' '
Marion	PERSON	's Faith , ' ' Captain
Blake	PERSON	, ' and a dozen more popular military novels , needs no introduction to American readers .

		From the lowest soldier to the highest officer , from the servant to the master , there is not a character in this or in any of Captain King 's novels that is not wholly in keeping with expressed sentiments .

		There is not a movement made on the field , not a break from the ranks , not an offense against the military code of discipline , and hardly a heart-beat that escapes his watchfulness . ''

		The ' Autonym ' Library opens well with Mr.

		It is a novelty in the literature of the supernatural .

		.

		373 LIVING WRITERS OF FICTION .

		As the nineteenth century draws to a close , it still finds in the novel its favorite form of reading .

		Nearly every civilized country has , for the full hundred years -LRB- if not for more -RRB- , given hearty allegiance to this literary form , and fashion , while dictating countless variations of subject-niatter and mode of treatment , has not ventured beyond the limits imposed by this form .

		The public libraries everywhere report that from sixty to eighty per cent of the books circulated are novels ; publishers ' lists from all parts of the world show a large preponderance of works of fiction ; and the average reader , asking himself what books he has read during the past year or decade , will name half a dozen novels for every book of history , or collection of essays , or volume of poems .

		If ever a long - felt want was supplied in the history of civil - ization , it was when the literary instinct of nineteenth century writers realized the fact that the new age was to be , beyond any of its predecessors , a book-reading age , and hit upon the new kind of book that was to supply the new demand .

		We wonder now what our an - cestors ever did without novels -LRB- for , from the height of superior opportunities , we can not give the name of novel to the sort of thing whereof Dunlop was the chronicler -RRB- , and we read with mingled pity and amazement of the way in which they devoured solemn tomes of ancient history , or pastoral conceits expressed in arti - ficial verse , or the chit-chat of the eighteenth century essayist .

		When we think of the read - ers of '' Clelie '' or of ''
Clarissa	PERSON	, '' the situation becomes pathetic , for those eager souls were , in their dull way , groping towards the light ; dim and tantalizing visions of the possibilities of romance must have been vouchsafed them ; yet no nearer than such Pisgah-summit -LRB- their Pisgah but a sort of foothill -RRB- were they ever to approach the promised land .

		That fiction has been the characteristic liter - ary form of the nineteenth century is indisput - able .

		That it will occupy a similar position in the twentieth century it would , perhaps , be rash to conclude .

		Yet the chances of its so doing are considerable ; the impulse is by no means spent or even waning ; and it would be still more rash to make any equally specific alternative statement .

		Just now we have no intention of predicting anything , but rather of making the briefest possible survey of the art of fiction in its present state , or rather the most summary sort of catalogue of those chiefly em - inent in its practice .

		Ignoring all ephemeral successes and merely local celebrities , we ask the question : What men and women now liv - ing have produced works of fiction of anything like enduring value , works that appeal to a more lasting constituency than that of the hour , to a wider audience than that offered by the immediate environment of their authors ?

		352 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, Of the three or four great novelists that Rus - sia has produced , Count
Tolstoi	PERSON	alone is left , and from him there is little reason to expect any further work comparable with '' War and Peace , '' ''
Anna Karenina	PERSON	, '' or even with '' The Cossacks . ''

		The writer of almost first-rate fic - tion has become a producer of third-rate tracts , and literature mourns the defection .

		But the great
Slavonic North	ORGANIZATION	has sent us of recent years , in the person of
Henry k Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, the Pol - ish novelist , a writer of fiction quite the equal of the Russian soldier turned pietist .

		His mag - nificent romantic trilogy devoted to the seven - teenth - century wars of the Polish Common - wealth , and his subtle piece of psychological analysis called '' Without Dogma , '' are mas - terpieces in their respective kinds , and with them Polish literature renews the appeal to European attention first made by
Mickiewicz	PERSON	half a century ago .

		The one notable name of literary
Hungary	LOCATION	at the present day is that of the veteran
Maurus Jokai	PERSON	, who has written in - numerable novels , and whom his countrymen have recently taken much delight in honoring .

		The step from
Hungary	LOCATION	to
Austria	LOCATION	is easy , politically if not ethnically , but no Austrian novelist seems greatly worthy of mention .

		Prob - ably the most important names are those of
Herr Karl Emil Franzos	PERSON	, whose `` Ein Kampf urn 's Recht '' is certainly a great novel , and the
Ritter von Sacher-Masoch	PERSON	, whose reported dis - patch to a better world we recently joined the American press in chronicling , but who , we are now happy to say from later accounts , is still among the living .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	, both
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	and
Herr Freytag	PERSON	are still at work , although the former is producing poor novels and the latter none at all .

		But the author of '' Problematische Naturen '' and `` Hammer und Amboss '' is one of the great names of German nineteenth-century literature , and the author of '' Soil und Haben '' and '' Die Verlorene Handschrift '' is even more assuredly another .


Herr Heyse	PERSON	, also , who has written two of the best German novels in existence , remains in the ranks , and may yet give the world a worthy successor to `` Kinder der Welt '' and '' Im Para - diese . ''

		The conspicuous group of German nov - elists who have dealt with the romance of an - cient history should in the present connection at least be represented by
Herr Felix Dahn	PERSON	's ''
Ein Kampf	PERSON	um Rom , '' and possibly also by one or two of the better among the many ro - mantic fictions of Dr.
Ebers	PERSON	.

		In the Scandinavian countries , the first place among writers of fiction must be given to
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	.

		As a writer of peasant idylls ''
Arne	PERSON	, '' `` Synnove Solbakken '' and the like he first became known to the world out - side of
Norway	LOCATION	; as the author of the two ambi - tious books of his later years `` Det
Flager	PERSON	i Byen og paa Havuen '' and '' Paa Guds Veje '' he has greatly extended and strengthened his already wide reputation .

		We will say , par - enthetically , that these books are to be had in English translations , respectively entitled '' The Heritage of the Kurts '' and '' In God 's Way . ''

		Before turning from the
North of Europe	LOCATION	to the South , a word may be given to the new blood infused into the life of Dutch literature by the somewhat morbid sensitivists , of whom
Heer Louis Couperus	PERSON	is the most conspicuous , and another word this time of unqualified praise to the Dutchman who calls himself ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	, '' who has contracted the singular habit of writing his novels in the En - glish language , and whom we should insist upon claiming as an ornament of our own fiction were not his themes so unmistakably Dutch .

		It is a little curious that
Italy	LOCATION	, from whom we have reason to expect much , should have no contemporary writer of fiction deserving of mention here ; should have produced , indeed , but one great novel in the course of the cen - tury .

		One need only evoke the recollection of '' I
Promessi Sposi	PERSON	'' to realize how compara - tively insignificant is the best that is offered by any Italian novelist now living .

		On the other hand ,
Spain	LOCATION	, towards whom we had lit - tle reason to look for literary activity , has shown a promising development during the past few years , and has produced , in
Senores Valera	LOCATION	, V aides , and
Galdos	PERSON	, a group of nov - elists of whom any country might be proud .

		When we turn to
France	LOCATION	, we - find an em - barras de richesse indeed , for
France	LOCATION	and En - gland have throughout the century shared the highest honors in the art of fiction .

		While other countries have produced great novelists now and then , these two have been well sup - plied nearly all the time .

		At present , although
France	LOCATION	can boast no Balzac , no '' Stendhal , '' no Flaubert , no
Dumas	PERSON	pere , and no Hugo , she still boasts the creative genius that gave us the immortal
Tartarin	PERSON	and the immense vitality and force that have produced the
Rougon	PERSON	- Macquart series , the grace and humor of the author of '' L'Abbe Constantin , '' and the sub - tle psychology displayed in '' Cosinopolis , '' by the newest of the Academicians .

		And besides MM .

		Daudet and
Zola	ORGANIZATION	,
Halevy	PERSON	and Bourget , there are the names of M. Feuillet ,
M. Cher	PERSON	-
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 353 buliez ,
M. Anatole France	PERSON	,
M. Edouard Rod	PERSON	, and so many others that we hardly know where to stop in the enumeration .

		Coming at last to the literature of our own language , we find , upon the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, that three novelists emerge very dis - tinctly from the group of the older men Messrs.
Blackmore	PERSON	,
Black	ORGANIZATION	, and Hardy .

		They have all been prolific , and the best work of each is very good work indeed .

		Yet no one can fairly claim for ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' and '' The Maid of Sker , '' for '' A Daughter of Heth '' and '' Sunrise , '' or for '' The Return of the Na - tive '' and '' Tess of the D'Urbervilles , '' that they are seriously comparable with the best works of
Scott	LOCATION	, or
Thackeray	PERSON	, or even
Dickens	PERSON	.

		Nor is it possible to admit that Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	has yet shown herself to be a novelist of the rank of
George Eliot	PERSON	or
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	.

		She , as well as the three men whom we have mentioned , must perforce be content to know that their rank is the first only because their age is degenerate .

		Among the older men we must also mention Mr.
Shorthouse	PERSON	, although it seems likely that he will be remembered as the man of one book , just as
Blanco White	ORGANIZATION	is remembered as the man of one sonnet .

		But ''
John Inglesant	PERSON	'' is one of the noteworthy books of the generation , and will not soon be forgotten .

		Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, too , must be reckoned with the older men , although his reputation -LRB- in any broad sense -RRB- is young .

		Whether the unwieldy craft that he has set afloat will escape shipwreck or not is a prob - lem we confess our inability to solve .

		Among the younger men we have , of course , the eccen - tric and unclassifiable Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, and such restorers of the good old fashion of historical romance as Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	and Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	.

		We also have Mr.
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, who has style and invention so hap - pily commingled that he is likely to please at least one more generation than his own .

		In our own country , the art of fiction may be said to hold its own , a phrase which means far less than it would in
France	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	.

		Hawthorne is the only really great artist we have ever had , and his genius , exquisite as it was , had such close limitations that he by no means answers to the long-felt need for a
Great American Novelist	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nor does this much-in - voked abstraction show any signs of taking ma - terial shape .

		For neither Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	nor Mr.
Howells	PERSON	nor the prolific and entertaining Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	may the title be claimed .

		We are sometimes inclined to think that Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	comes nearer than any other to achiev - ing the distinction .

		But the place of honor among our living novelists should probably be given to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, although ''
Elsie Venner	PERSON	'' and '' The Guardian Angel '' lie so far back of the present as to seem to belong to another age .

		What other living American has given us two novels -LRB- or even one -RRB- of such enduring interest and vitality ?

		WILLIAM D
WIGHT WHITNEY	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the death of
William Dwight Whitney	PERSON	, which occurred at New Haven
June 7	DATE	, is fallen the prince of American scholars .

		Others of our countrymen have been and are highly honored for their achieve - ments in learning , but none has so united in him - self breadth and accuracy , the power to produce and stimulate , simplicity and singleness of purpose .

		Scholarship was to him more than an accomplish - ment , it was a lofty mission pursued with all the force of an intense moral earnestness .

		Like
Lowell	PERSON	's dominating trait of patriotism , which rose to the degree of a passion , was the jealous devotion of
Whitney	LOCATION	to the service and honor of his profession .

		It was this which at times caused him -LRB- as was also true of our urbane and gentle-spirited poet -RRB- to twist his ... , , gilt of words Into a scourge of rough and knotted cords ,
Unmusical	LOCATION	, that whistle as they swing , '' and it is in this depth of devotion to his high calling that we must find the motive for the trenchant vigor of his polemic , and not in any odium scholasticum or American assertiveness .

		To a man of his ideals , the currency of scholarship was debased by looseness of method or inaccuracy of statement , embellished though it might be by whatever daintiness of con - ceit , or however much it might presume upon unques - tioning popular acquiescence .

		He was born in
1827	DATE	in
Northampton	LOCATION	,
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts , in a region which has perhaps contributed to this country a larger share of intellectual ability than any other of its * size .

		After graduating at
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	, he was for three years a clerk in a
Northampton	LOCATION	bank , and while thus engaged he spent his spare hours in the study of languages , especially Sanskrit .

		It is not unreasonable to attri - bute to his acquaintance with the world of practical affairs some of the wholesome breadth and calmness of his judgment in other fields .

		He was in many ways a man of wide sympathies .

		He shared with his distinguished brother a strong taste for the nat - ural sciences , being for many years a member of the
American Association	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- attending its meeting in

		He pur - sued graduate studies for one year at

Bopp	PERSON	,
Weber	PERSON	, and
Rudolph Roth	PERSON	.

		His 354 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, wide reputation dates from the edition of the stand - ard text of the
Atharva Veda	LOCATION	, prepared by
Roth	PERSON	and himself , based upon the manuscripts , and in every way an admirably solid performance .

		In
1854	DATE	he wa 's made Professor of Sanskrit at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, with the additional chair of
Comparative Philology	ORGANIZATION	in
1870	DATE	.

		His lectures on '' Language and the Sci - ence of Language , '' originally given before the popular audiences of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	and
Lowell Institutes	ORGANIZATION	, were published in
1867	DATE	, and at once at - tracted the attention of the learned world , remain - ing to the present time an authoritative statement of the mission and methods of philological research .

		Somewhat discursive in treatment , they are supple - mented by his later essays , particularly his chapter on the Science of Language in the article '' Philol - ogy '' in the ninth edition of the '' Encyclopaedia Britannica , '' which is of particular interest for its putting of his standpoint regarding the ultimate be - ginnings of human speech , which , according to Whit - ney , have their origin in man 's practical necessity for a means of communication , and not in any nat - ural existence of names corresponding to certain conceptions .

		Any attempt to determine how and when this communication first broke forth must re - main futile .

		The prevailing use of the voice for this purpose is a survival according to natural fit - ness .

		The first signs were doubtless imitative , whether of sounds heard in external nature or of the natural emotional outcries of primitive man , and such a language-stock as these elements would sup - ply is quite sufficient for the development of actual human speech .

		While in
Germany	LOCATION	in
1867	DATE	he was asked by the firm of
Breitkopf & Hartel	ORGANIZATION	to prepare a Sanskrit grammar for their proposed Indo-Euro - pean series .

		He accepted the commission , and ap - proached the subject for the first time in a manner corresponding to enlightened philological demands .

		The characteristic features of this work were its being an attempt to make a scientific grammar based upon the actual facts of the language , rather than on the inherited traditions of native schools , in its giving a full consideration of the Vedic dia - lect , and in treating the language throughout as ac - cented .

		It is no exaggeratioij to say that up to the present time no attempt has been made to improve upon this splendid monument of learning , and that wherever philology is studied the Sanskrit grammar of
Whitney	LOCATION	is a unique and indispensable adjunct .

		His complete edition of the Taittiriya Praticakhya -LRB- 1871 -RRB- obtained the
Bopp Prize	ORGANIZATION	from the
Berlin Academy	LOCATION	as being the most important publication in Sanskrit during the preceding three years .

		His predominant influence in the American Oriental So - ciety , of which he was president after
1884	DATE	, and to the publications of which he contributed a large share , remained potent and inspiring long after his impaired health forbade his attendance upon meet - ings .

		His last great service of superintending the publication of '' The Century Dictionary '' was brought to a successful close .

		That work , whose projection was looked upon somewhat jealously as a sort of premature intrusion upon the field planned by the English Philological Society , has trium - phantly vindicated its raison d'etre , and is one of the cherished possessions of the English-speaking world .

		He took an appreciative interest in the World 's
Congress of Philology	ORGANIZATION	held in
Chicago	LOCATION
last year	DATE	, approved of its plans , and aided in them by explicit suggestion of themes for discussion .

		I have a vivid memory of my first meeting with this venerated scholar when , years ago .

		I made a pilgrimage to New Haven to consult with him about my own plans .

		He received me in his beau - tiful home , filled with all the symbols of a broad and refined culture , with a dignified but simple and considerate manner that was most reassuring .

		In fact , nothing was more characteristic of this great man -LRB- who was sometimes represented abroad as a wai ` ning example of overbearing self-conceit -RRB- than the cordial and unpretentious encouragement he gave beginners in their early endeavors , and the courteous respect with which he entertained their productions , immature and blundering as these often were .

		In looking on his genial , ruddy face , crowned with its silvery hair , I felt , as perhaps never else - where in the same degree , that homage which man - kind pays to the eminent scholar , as one of the highest products of civilization and human culture .

		I have never wondered that a certain professor in the
University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	was wont to allude to him as '' die Zierde der Wissenschaft . ''

		THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE NOVEL .

		When a certain division of literature is , for his - torical reasons , dominant in current literary produc - tion , it is like a drag-net which ensnares divers sorts of fish .

		It attracts not only the natural makers in that form , but others whose gifts fit them better for some other work but who can not resist the centrip - etal pull of this most popular activity .

		Thus , in the Elizabethan days the drama was the type of liter - ature which represented the age , most interested the public , and consequently engaged the main attention of the begetters of literary masterpieces .

		And hence it is that we meet with men like
Peele	PERSON	,
Greene	PERSON	, and Lodge , and later ,
Cartwright	PERSON	and
Shirley	PERSON	, whose call to play-making was not imperative , whose work was more or less imitative .

		Had the mode of the day in letters demanded the essay or the novel , they would as readily have turned in those directions .


Peele	PERSON	was naturally a superior controversialist , Lodge could write so exquisite a prose pastoral as '' Ros - alind '' whence
Shakespeare	PERSON	drew his lovely '' As You Like It , '' and
Shirley	PERSON	had powers as a lyrist exampled in so dainty a song as that entitled '' A Lullaby . ''

		At present the novel is the all-engulfing literary form .


Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	has asked of late : '' What shall be the novel , the literature , of the future ? ''

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 355 as if the two terms were coterminous and inter - changeable .

		Fiction has made sad inroads upon the ancient and honorable champaign of Poetry ; the essay is as naught to it in popularity and applause ; while even the stern historian tries to give his chron - icle of the past , of '' old , unhappy far-off things , '' a narrative interest , and some boldly throw their history into the guise of an historical romance , albeit their purpose is not artistic but didactic the im - parting of knowledge rather than the giving of pleasure .

		Fiction , in short , is the modern magnet toward which all literary product and power is drawn .

		That this predominance is in some ways an evil -LRB- despite the indisputable virtues of the novel -RRB- , that it is possibly fraught with danger to general literary poduction , is a thesis which will at least bear further amplification .

		The injury done to poetry has been alluded to .

		When
Walter Scott	PERSON	, after triumphing in narrative and ballad verse , took up the writing of romances and charmed all
Europe	LOCATION	, he gave English fiction an importance and dignity hardly enjoyed by it before .

		Without overlooking Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	's testimony that
Richardson	PERSON	's '' Pamela '' wrung tears from the chambermaids of all nations , it is pretty safe to say that with the Waverley Novels our fiction , as a distinct form , gained a prestige which , in spite of fluctuations and what at present some incline to call a woeful devolution , it has never lost .

		And verse has suffered a proportionate decay of author - ity .

		It has come to pass that verse-men adopt a semi-apologetic tone in putting forth their wares , and the soi-disant scientific spirit of the age tends to look askance at such activity .

		To be sure , this indifference to poetry may easily be exaggerated .

		If the critic go back to any earlier period of En - glish poetry , much the same influences may be de - tected : the poets themselves timid and knee-supple ; their carping judges aghast at the dearth of good work , and with their mouths full of praise of some previous day .


Walter Scott	PERSON	's accent in speaking of `` The Lady of the Lake , '' before its publica - tion , has , for us , a curiously tentative and depre - catory sound .

		And to read to-day such a critique as
Peacock	PERSON	's `` Four Ages .

		of Poetry , '' wherein not
Scott	PERSON	alone , but Lord
Byron	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Cole	PERSON	- ridge , and
Southey	PERSON	are dismissed with contemptuous paragraphs , is sufficiently amusing , while suggest - ive of the irresistible tendency to belittle the fore - ground in favor of the historical perspective a strange reversal of the ordinary laws of composi - tion .

		But aside from all this , it is true enough that contemporaneous poetry is , speaking broadly , toler - ated rather than appraised ; if the text of sales be applied , the comparatively small editions of verse the regular edition being 500 volumes , and limited editions of less size being a fad of the time show the same thing , from the publisher 's garish point of view .

		Look , too , at the relative value set on fiction and verse in the magazines , those faithful registers of popular taste .

		The story is the sine qud non , the one literary form which must be supplied ; the quatrain or sonnet is tucked in to fill unseemly gaps between articles .

		Its function is that of a tail-piece .

		In the days of Good Queen
Bess	PERSON	, poetry in play - form was the acceptable mode of literary expression : there was then a happy conjunction of public de - mand and artistic supply , though whether they stood in the relation of cause and effect is matter for par - ley .

		But so much may be roundly affirmed : what the play was to that time , the novel is to this .

		Those now writing verse must expect and be con - tent with smaller sales , slower reputation , and , in a sense , an uncongenial environment .

		As a result , the fictional maelstrom sucks in some who in an - other day would have been poets , or who , having the name of poets , would have done greater work in verse than will ever come from them under exist - ing conditions .

		It is a curious query , What might Kipling have achieved in poetry in an age which made the poetic drama the recognized mode of ex - pression ?

		This , with two or three of his fine bal - lads in mind , to say nothing of the dramatic in - stinct in his fiction , is not so superficial a suggestion as might at first appear .

		But born into these lat - ter-day conditions , he is an Uhlan of story-telling , who only now and then makes a side-charge into the placid domains of Poesy .

		Fiction , again , draws the natural essayist away from his metier .

		Those heretical enough to pre - fer the essay-work of
Henry James	PERSON	to his novels will think of him in this connection ; a humorist like
Mark Twain	PERSON	, undoubtedly a teller of tales , but hardly a novelist in the full modern content of the word , is another exemplar .

		The cult of the analytic in fiction has led many writers , whose forte lay in such effects rather than in synthetic creation , into novel-making ; and , conversely , perhaps the analytic tendency has been thus exaggerated until it has cul - minated in The Story-That-Never-Ends .

		Interesting questions and cross-questions arise here .

		But the main contention , that this modern maelstrom , with its secret undertow , has drawn the essayists into its potent circle , to the impoverishment of the essay delightsome form made luminous by the names of
Montaigne	LOCATION	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	, and Arnold and , as well , to the dubious improvement of Fiction itself , is for easy apprehension .

		Recently , and in large part due to the brilliant critical papers of such English and American writers as Pater ,
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Moore	PERSON	,
Lang	PERSON	, and Repplier , a reaction in favor of the es - say is observable , and it may be this will grow into a veritable renaissance .

		So far , however , it is lit - tle more than a beginning ; that the reading of the older and standard essayists has been checked by the novel and its half-breed ally , the newspaper , can not be gainsaid .

		But regarding Fiction alone , what are the effects of this autocracy which it maintains in the world of literature ?

		To our thinking , we get bad novels , and too many of them , because of it .

		The form has so supreme a power , and the emoluments are so glit - tering , that those who have it in them to do good work lash themselves to unnatural exertions in or - 356 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, der to answer the demand , and sell their second - best in lieu of their best , which takes more time .

		Very few of our modern novel-writers exhibit the conscientious care and leisurely method of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	or Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The temptation is great , and the danger extreme .

		And far worse than this , a horde of hangers-on rush into the field and by their an - tics , utterly lacking coherence , with no raison d'etre to justify their presence , bring what is a gift , an art , and a consecrated labor into misunderstanding and disrepute .

		It is fast coming to the point where a man who has not written a novel gains thereby a certain distinction : and this surely is ominous for the highest interests of Fiction .

		But it is ques - tionable if the novel will remain indefinitely the dominant type , the maelstrom engulfing the various kinds of literary power and activity .

		All analogy points the other way , begetting a presumption in favor of some new form , or the revival of an old .

		It is not impossible that with a new impulse in poe - try of the narrative or dramatic order , Fiction will find its elder sister occupying her sometime place as a coequal .

		Indeed , the forecast for the drama , uniting as it does the most splendid creative liter - ary energy with action of the most direct and uni - versally appealing kind , is especially bright .

		And the literary movement in this direction of late sug - gests an ultimate shifting in the relative importance of those forms of literary expression which in our day engage the interest and affection of men .

		Ten of those in the above list will give their entire time to the - work of instruction ; five give a part of their time .

		One course in English literature , and only one , is re - quired of all the students .

		This must be taken during the first year of undergraduate work .

		It seems desira - ble that the pupil be introduced promptly to the treas - ures of his own literature ; it is well that he should learn early that the condensed milk of text-books can not suffice for his mental nutriment , that all the fact-books - and reasoning books , taken together , can not accomplish his intellectual salvation , can not give him a liberal ed - ucation .

		This required course is an introduction to the study of literature .

		It gives a brief outline of the his - tory of English literature , together with studies in the chief literary forms the drama , narrative poetry , lyric poetry , the novel , the essay .

		It may seem to some that more than one quarter should be given to this work , but it is the policy of the
University	ORGANIZATION	to have as few required courses as practicable .

		Some election is allowed dur - ing the second year of college work ; after
the second year	DATE	there are at present no required courses whatever .

		Of the elective courses in English literature , each calls for four or five hours of class-room work a week for an entire quarter ; except that some of the Seminar classes meet only two hours per week .

		The courses are arranged chronologically , those that are more general coming at the end .

		The
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	work in English literature falls especially to Professors
Moulton	PERSON	and
Butler	PERSON	.

		Since
October 1 , 1893	DATE	, Associate Professor
Butler	PERSON	has served most successfully as Director of the
University Exten	ORGANIZATION	- sion
Department	ORGANIZATION	, and has given sixty Extension lectures .

		Since
January 1 , 1894	DATE	, Professor
Moulton	PERSON	has conducted two courses of regular class work at
the University	ORGANIZATION	, and lias delivered ninety-six Extension lectures .

		No other American institution does so much in this line of work as
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many courses of lec - ture-studies in English literature are offered for the coming year .

		It is not the policy of
the University	ORGANIZATION	to encourage Extension lecturing on the part of the regu - lar class-room force , though such courses are given un - der special circumstances .

		The masterpieces of our literature are studied at
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	primarily as works of literary art .

		If one says that '' English should be studied as Greek is , '' then it must be asked , How should Greek be studied ?

		To investigate every possible question that can be raised in connection with a piece of literature is to be thorough indeed ; but is it not possible , in being thorough , to be thoroughly wrong ?

		An artistic whole , like a vital one , is something indefinitely greater than the sum of its parts .

		We should not fail in artistic study to make the whole the centre of interest .

		The study of the most charming of the English classics has too often been made a mere starting-point for laborious investigations into antiquities , history , geography , ety - mology , phonetics , the history of the English language , and general linguistics .

		The stones of learning have been doled out to students hungry for the bread of lit - erature .

		Literary masterpieces should be studied chiefly , it seems to me , for their beauty .

		It is because of their charm , their beauty , that they have immortality ; it is only because of this that we study them at all .

		If the student is not helped to enter into their beauty and to love them for it , the teaching would seem to be wrong somewhere .

		No study can be too minute and careful which aids one in gaining a vital appreciation of a great masterpiece .

		An unfailing source of rest and refresh - ment , a life-long process of self-education , great ideals of life and character , to all of these the student should gain access through the study of English literature .

		For the most part the literary and linguistic lines of study are kept apart at this
University	ORGANIZATION	; but not entirely .

		Linguistic questions are sometimes vital to the interpre - tation of a passage ; for example , the word '' weird '' in the phrase '' the weird sisters '' in '' Macbeth '' calls for explanation , and will repay the most careful study .

		Even in a literary study of Chaucer it is necessary to pay careful attention to his language .

		I must not be understood as objecting to the most thorough study of the English language .

		It is a fair question whether a certain amount of such study should not be required of ^ all college students .

		According to a great law of edu - cation , '' the law of the nearest , '' the history of the En - glish tongue is the most fitting and helpful introduction to the general study of the life and growth of language .

		Only in the mother-tongue does the student have access to the actual phenomena of speech .

		Here one boun - dary of linguistic investigation the terminus ad quern is the present form of the language ; and this meets his ear at every turn .

		The present life and growth of one 's native tongue can be studied at first hand , and is the great source of light for the study of language-change in the past .

		Few recent movements in education have been more marked than the increased attention given to the historical study of English .

		In addition to the two literary courses already men - tioned , Assistant Professor Blackburn offers nine courses in Old English , the History of the English Language , etc. , for the year beginning
July 1 , 1894	DATE	.

		Every student is required to take a course in rhetoric and English composition at the beginning of his under - graduate work .

		Theme-writing is required throughout the first two years .

		The instructors in rhetoric expect the students to find the subjects for their themes , or com - positions , in the various other departments where their studies lie .

		The principles and rules of rhetoric , they hold , help a man to treat a subject appropriately ; but he must find some subject himself , or one must be found for him .

		A list of topics , together with helpful refer - ences , is furnished to the classes .

		These topics are rec - ommended by the instructors in the various departments in which the students are working , and usually have some vital connection with the subjects that are discussed in the class-room .

		Fourteen elective courses in rhetorical study are offered for the coming year by Messrs.
Wilkinson	PERSON	,
Herrick	PERSON	,
Lovett	PERSON	, and
Lewis	PERSON	.

		Every college graduate should be able to prove that he is liberally educated by the grace and skill with which he expresses his thoughts .

		Much practice in writ - ing is required of every student who takes his college course in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		I trust that it is only because of the youthfulness of our institution that active literary societies do not yet exist among our stu - dents .

		This should be remedied , since the voluntary rhetorical practice obtained in organizations of this kind is most helpful .

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has fifteen departmental clubs ; these are united in an organization called
The University Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Original papers are read before the English Club by instructors , students , and invited guests .

		Three clubs are appointed each quarter to present papers at a public meeting of
the University Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		A prize of fifty dollars goes to the student chosen by competition to represent each club .

		Two so-called '' senior '' fellowships , or four '' junior '' fellowships , are assigned to the department of English .

		These are granted to college graduates of exceptional ability who plan to do advanced work in English .

		Ow - ing to the large number of applicants , four '' junior '' fellowships have been awarded for the coming year .

		Each of these gives to the holder exemption from the payment of tuition and
$ 320	MONEY	in cash .

		Two other fel - lowships for this department have been provided for this year by private generosity .

		* The prize of .500 offered by the Duchess of
Maryborough	LOCATION	for the best poem commem - orating her husband 's deeds was won by the writer of the following stanza : '' Five hundred pounds , too small a boon To set the poet 's Muse in tune That nothing might escape her .

		Were I to attempt the heroic story Of the illustrious
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's glory , It scarce would buy the paper . ''

		Since this thrifty bard pocketed the
Duchess	ORGANIZATION	's guineas the hero of
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	has had , as a rule , less flattering critics .

		Detraction , as well as death , '' loves a shining mark '' ; and the shafts of satire and invective , winged and envenomed by party hate and sped by strong and sure hands , have pierced to the quick '' great Marl - bro 's '' renown .

		Whatever may have been the motives that ruled his conduct ,
England	LOCATION	owes much to
Marlborough	LOCATION	; and it is high time that his career should be fully reviewed and his genius and services shown in the same clear light that has been shed upon his faults .

		Partisans of the Duke , if any there be , will find little to cavil at on the score of scant ap - preciation in the work of his latest biographer , Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two beautiful volumes before us , forming the first instalment of his book , reach only to the death of
William III.	PERSON	, to the threshold , that is , of
Marlborough	LOCATION	's real life-work .

		Leaving thus untouched his crown - ing years , during a part of which he virtually ruled
England	LOCATION	and fairly outshone in the field the '' Sun King '' himself , they cover the period of the gravest of the charges against him ; and to this fact we may primarily ascribe their pretty constant , and we think unfortunate , strain of advocacy .

		A pleasant narrator and a clear and cogent military critic , Lord
Wolse	PERSON	- ley , despite his truth of statement and his occasional censures , plainly holds a brief for his hero ; and he proceeds throughout to deny or to palliate his alleged shortcomings , from leze-majesty to bad spelling , with a zeal the momentum of which lands him in the amazing conclusion that the Duke of

		We may say at once that Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	is too good a soldier to be a good casuist ; and his honesty , more - over , being at odds with his logic , he usually starts out by stating the case against his client so fairly as to hopelessly weaken his subse - quent rebuttal .

		At some points , certainly , the student of Swift and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	will find reason to modify his views ; but even on Lord
Wolse	PERSON	- ley 's own showing we think the final judg - ment on
Marlborough	LOCATION	must still be that , in the words of the moderate Green , `` Of honor or the finer sentiments of mankind he knew noth - ing . ''

		A notable , and not , we think , a very happy attempt at whitewashing is our author 's chap - ter on the
Brest	LOCATION	affair `` the basest , '' says
Macaulay	PERSON	, '' of all the hundred villainies of
Marlborough	LOCATION	. ''

		It may be remembered that in
1694	DATE
William III	ORGANIZATION	.

		planned a naval and mil - itary expedition against
Brest	LOCATION	, which had been left temporarily defenseless by the departure of
Tourville	ORGANIZATION	's squadron .

		The town was to be surprised , and secresy as to the destination of the expedition was of the first moment .

		The matter leaking out ,
William	PERSON	's plan was treach - erously disclosed to
Louis	LOCATION	in time to enable him to put
Brest	LOCATION	in a state of defense , and sub - sequently to entrap the English and defeat them with great slaughter .

		Four hundred sea - men and seven hundred soldiers were mowed down by the fire from
Vauban	PERSON	's skilfully - placed batteries , and
Talmash	PERSON	, the English commander and
Marlborough	LOCATION	's military rival , received his death-wound .

		Talmash died , it is said , protesting that he had been lured into a snare by treachery which was afterwards proved to be the case .

		A century later a copy or translation of a letter from
Marlborough	LOCATION	to James II .

		giving full information of the pro- jected attack on
Brest	LOCATION	was found in the
Scotch College	ORGANIZATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	; and he has since been pretty generally held responsible for the disaster and the slaughter of his countrymen .

		At the time of writing he was in disfavor at court ; and his object , aside from a wish to ingratiate him - self with
James	PERSON	, with whom he had been for some time coquetting , is held to have been to ruin
Talmash	PERSON	and to force himself on Will - iam as the only Englishman fit for a high mil - itary post .

		Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	admits that
Marl	ORGANIZATION	- borough wrote the infamous letter to James r but he denies that he was thejirst informant .

		His defense is that when the Duke wrote he did so knowing that
William	PERSON	's plan had already 1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL been betrayed to
St. Germains	LOCATION	; and that there - fore the French preparations which led to the English defeat were not due to his specific act of writing . ''

		If , '' says Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	, '' it be conclusively proved that the preparations were the result of information obtained by
Louis	LOCATION	from others previous to the date of Marlbo - rough 's letter , then this charge falls to the ground . ''

		Granting the facts to be as Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	states them , his defense if indeed he means it as such seems little better than a quibble .

		For in knowingly allowing the
Brest	LOCATION	expedition to sail to certain failure and possi - ble destruction
Marlborough	LOCATION	certainly became particeps criminis in the original betrayal ; and his meanly writing to
James	PERSON	, with a flourish of doing him a service which he knew was no ser - vice , is only a further proof that he was , as his foes assert , a virtuoso in duplicity a man at all points '' for close designs and crooked coun - cils fit . ''

		It should be added that our author by no means acquits
Marlborough	LOCATION	of gross mis - conduct in the
Brest	LOCATION	matter . ''

		It can not be forgotten , '' he says , '' that the great man for whom
England	LOCATION	built
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	palace did in - trigue with his country 's enemies . ''

		Churchill 's course in the Revolution of
1688	DATE	is more easily defended .

		There are junctures at which treason becomes , as
Rousseau	PERSON	said of insurrection , '' a public duty '' ; and the land - ing of
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	at
Torbay	DATE	assuredly marked one of them .

		Protestant Englishmen were by that event called upon to choose be - tween disloyalty to a dangerous tyrant who had repeatedly broken his Coronation oath , and disloyalty to the nation ; and the choice lying between a peccadillo and a crime , most men chose the former .

		A lingering superstition as to '' the right divine to govern wrong '' alone made the dilemma a real one .

		Abstractly con - sidered , treason to
James II.	PERSON	, an arbitrary bigot bent on enslaving his people and restoring a creed to which nineteen twentieths of them were bitterly opposed , was not only justifiable but laudable , and the word must be stripped of its uglier connotations .

		But
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's case was a special one , involving special consid - erations .

		What we are to regard in weighing his conduct seems to be : his personal relations to
James	PERSON	, the time and mode of his desertion , and , lastly and chiefly , his governing motives .

		There is no doubt that
James	PERSON	had been from the first his fast friend and benefactor , having raised his whilom page step by step from pov - erty to wealth and from obscurity to distinction .

		Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's plea that '' if we calmly weigh
Marlborough	LOCATION	's services and compare them with his rewards , the debtor and creditor account does not seem to be unfairly balanced , '' is hardly admissible , the double tie of fealty and gratitude being something more than a mere adjustable matter of debit and credit .

		Besides , the services of which Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	speaks were rendered to James the king , who had an official right to ask them of Churchill the subject ; when the time came to repay
James	PERSON	the man , at some personal cost and risk , Churchill was found more than wanting , for he left his benefactor in the lurch , and this at a moment when he knew his defection must prove decis - ive .

		The secession of
Marlborough	LOCATION	made it necessary for James to leave the field to his rival .

		In respect of the Revolution , two rela - tively honorable courses were open to
Marl	ORGANIZATION	- borough .

		When he found James resolutely bent on restoring Roman Catholicism he should have thrown up his commissions and gone to
Holland	LOCATION	, as
Talmash	PERSON	did , or else he should have followed his master 's fortunes to the end .

		Both these courses meant a leap in the dark ; so he elected neither .

		At no juncture do we find this supremely cool and dispassionate gamester risk - ing a move the event of which could not be fairly reckoned beforehand .

		While intriguing and strengthening his hand with
William	PERSON	he maintained his hold upon
James	PERSON	; and not till the chances were plainly and materially against the latter did he unmask .

		Then he boldly threw his sword in the descending scale and turned it hopelessly against his life-long friend and protector .

		With characteristic adroitness he contrived to hoodwink the King up to the last moment .

		Before leaving
London	LOCATION	to con - front
William	PERSON	in the field ,
James	PERSON	made him a Lieutenant-General with an important com - mand .

		At the final council , after the fight at
Wincanton	LOCATION	, and
Combury	ORGANIZATION	's ominous flight , when the
King	PERSON	left it to the conscience of his officers to fight for him or else to openly and honorably resign their commissions ,
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	, with treachery in his heart , ostentatiously spurned the latter alternative .

		To further gild his spurious loyalty he even urged the now fal - tering King to strike a resolute blow for his crown .

		At this council
James	PERSON	made a really touching appeal to the loyalty of his officers .

		He tells in his memoirs : '' They all seemed to be moved at this discourse , and vowed they would serve me to the last drop of their blood the
Duke of Graf	ORGANIZATION	ton and my Lord Churchill were the first that made this attestation . ''


Three days later	DATE	, '' my Lord Churchill , '' see - 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, ing his way clear , went over to
William	LOCATION	; and we confess that the questionable circumstances attending his treason throughout seem to us to outweigh , in an estimate of his character , the extenuating facts that its results were benefi - cial to his country and that
James	PERSON	had for - feited his general claim on English loyalty .

		That the hero of Tel-el-Kebir should enlist on a forlorn hope is natural enough ; and we need not be surprised to find him trying to show , when he comes to the question of
Marl	ORGANIZATION	- borough 's motives , not only that his treason to
James	PERSON	was the result of pure patriotism and zeal for religious liberty , but that he acted throughout in opposition to what he believed to be his own interests .

		Something more than bare logic is needed to show that the leopard can change his spots .

		The course indicated is so utterly at variance with what is known of
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's general character as to be incred - ible unless attested by the strongest facts .

		Theoretically speaking , no man capable of sac - rificing himself in the cause of patriotism could have acted as he did in the
Brest	LOCATION	mat - ter .

		Besides , the fact that as soon as
James	PERSON	's restoration seemed fairly probable he began intriguing with him , and unblushingly pro- fessed the deepest contrition for his past con - duct , is fatal , we think , to our author 's case .

		Tyranny and popery notwithstanding ,
Church	ORGANIZATION	- ill showed himself willing , other plans failing , to bring
James	PERSON	back to the throne from which he himself , more than any other Englishman , had helped to oust him .

		The scene between
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	and the Jacobite agent is instruct - ive : '' Will you , '' pleaded the penitent rebel , '' will you be my intercessor with the King ?

		Will you tell him what I suffer ?

		My crimes now appear to me in their true light ; and I shrink with horror from the contemplation .

		The thought of them is with me day and night .

		I sit down to table ; but I can not eat .

		I throw myself on my bed ; but I can not sleep , '' etc. , etc. .

		Perhaps Macaulay is not so far from the truth when he adds , '' the loss of half a guinea would have done more to spoil his appetite and to disturb his slumbers than all the terrors of an evil conscience . ''

		To follow the tortuous maze of
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's policy is difficult enough ; but it is probable that , at bottom , his intrigue with
James	PERSON	was only a part of his main design of placing on the throne his wife 's puppet and '' the
Church	ORGANIZATION	's wet-nurse , Goody Anne . ''

		* That
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's religion was a factor in his *
Walpole	LOCATION	's epithet .

		disloyalty to
James	LOCATION	is beyond dispute .

		His Protestantism , while more a matter of early inoculation than reasoned conviction , was sin - cere ; and he honorably resisted all tempta - tions to abjure it .

		In this solitary virtue is rooted the disproof of our author 's statement that
Churchill	LOCATION	, in aiding
William	PERSON	to the throne , believed that he was sacrificing his own inter - ests .

		It had finally grown clear to him that , under
James	PERSON	, his only road to immediate ad - vancement lay through apostasy '' the one crime from which his soul recoiled . ''

		It was even evident , as we read in the Duchess of
Marlborough	LOCATION	's Vindication , '' that as things were carried on by
King James	LOCATION	, everybody sooner or later must be ruined who would not become a Roman Catholic . ''

		Churchill did not wish to apostatize , still less did he wish to be ruined ; and events soon showed him a way out of the dilemma .

		Rarely skilled in casting the po - litical horoscope , he read in the growing discon - tents in the kingdom that even apostasy , what - ever its immediate rewards , was likely to prove a most doubtful way of advancing his inter - ests in the future .

		James 's fatuity in , treat - ing like serfs a free people who had within the memory of the living sent their King to the scaf - fold for less , would plainly sooner or later cost him his throne ; and a Protestant successor was inevitable .

		Everything pointed to
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	as the most popular claimant .

		As soon as all this was clear to Churchill he made over - tures to
William	LOCATION	, and the event as usual proved his calculations to be correct .

		Such extraor - dinary services as he had it in his power to ren - der , through his talents , his military commands , and , above all , through his influence over Will - iam 's strongest rival ,
Anne	PERSON	, could not go un - rewarded ; nor did they .

		On
William	PERSON	's acces - sion he was promptly made Gentleman of the Bedchamber and
Earl	PERSON	of
Marlborough	LOCATION	, and was once more on the high road to preferment .

		Allowing then all reasonable weight in the matter to
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's Protestantism , and even crediting him with a possible flash of fitful pa - triotism , it seems clear that his course in
1688	DATE	might well have been dictated by the most cold-blooded self-interest .

		He had nothing to gain , as events were going , in standing by
James	LOCATION	; he had everything to gain in going over to
William	LOCATION	.

		In fact
Marlborough	LOCATION	's course in the Revolution , when calmly considered , seems of a piece with his whole life and tem - per .

		His sense of
James	PERSON	's past benefactions quickly vanished with his hope of benefactions to come ; and throughout the war of conflict -
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 361 ing policies and interests , cool and self-centred as at
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	and Malplaquet , he fought , like the
Smith	PERSON	of
Perth	LOCATION	, `` for his own hand . ''

		The world , or the saner and humaner part of it , will cheerfully agree with our author in condoning such of
Marlborough	LOCATION	's errors as may be fairly laid to the score of youth .

		It is mostly your '' Unco Guid , '' or those frost-bitten souls who find their melancholy account in '' damn - ing sins they have no mind to , '' who are im - placable in these cases .

		Marlborough 's early surroundings , too , were of the worst , and would have tried Saint
Anthony	PERSON	.

		To a handsome youth like
John Churchill	PERSON	the court of
Charles II.	PERSON	, where chastity was scorned and common decency was laughed at as prudish , was a hot - bed of temptation ; and Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	admits that his hero was naturally no
Joseph	PERSON	.

		What
Charles	PERSON	's court ladies were is indicated by the outspoken
Pepys	PERSON	, who says : '' Few will ven - ture upon them for wives .

		My Lady Castle - maine will in merriment say that her daughter -LRB- not above a year or two old -RRB- will be the first mayd in the court that will be married '' ; while as to the court gentlemen , we read of 44 orgies at which the Lord Chancellor , the Lord Treasurer , and other dignitaries , drank them - selves into a quarrelsome frenzy , and ended by stripping to their shirts . ''

		The court of the Restoration was little better than a magnified bagnio ; and the king who presided over it and set the mode in morals and manners was , with all his easy bonhomie and his singular turn for science , a
Yahoo	ORGANIZATION	at bottom .

		That
Churchill	PERSON	did not pass through the fire un - scathed is not to be charged against him too severely .

		But here again his more or less ven - ial errors were tainted and blackened by their sordid accompaniments .

		Avarice in youth is as ugly as lewdness in age ; and at two-and - twenty Churchill seems to have been steeped in this '' good old-gentlemanly vice . ''

		We can forgive and even smile at his escapade of leap - ing through the
Castlemaine	ORGANIZATION	's window to avoid '' Old
Rowley	PERSON	, '' who had been apprised of his poaching ; but when we learn that he after - wards accepted and carefully invested her lady - ship 's draft in payment of his agility , our good - humor cools .

		There is probably more malice than truth in
Pope	LOCATION	's couplet touching this draft `` The gallant , too , to whom she paid it down , Lived to refuse his mistress half a crown '' but it is pretty clear that Churchill , '' thrifty even in his vices , '' took wages compared to which the spoils of
Turpin	PERSON	were nowadays counted honorable gains .

		Our author sub - stantially , and perhaps not altogether unjustly , partly excuses this acceptance of money on tne ground that '' they all did it , '' and he in - clines to laud its investment as a case of thrift and foresight rather remarkable in so young a man .

		Thrift and foresight it certainly was ; for the Castlemaine gift , swelled by similar contributions from like quarters , proved to be the germ of the largest private fortune in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope .

		Marlborough 's parsimony is neatly satir - ized in a verse suggested by the bridge at
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	a pretentious structure spanning a rivulet which trickles sparingly below : '' The lofty arch his high ambition shows , The stream an emblem of his bounty flows . ''

		Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	takes issue with those who have charged
Marlborough	LOCATION	with gross illiter - acy .

		He admits that his spelling was bad , but he urges that '' in his time there was no recog - nized standard of spelling , and that if he failed in this respect , it was in company with Lord Chancellor
Somers	PERSON	and a host of other well - known and even learned contemporaries . ''

		To carp at genius on the score of sixpenny de - fects which a year 's schooling might have rem - edied is a small business ; and
England	LOCATION	may well forgive the victor of
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	for signing himself '' Your lordchipe 's humbell servant . ''

		We should regret if , while dwelling at length on those views of Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's which seem to us questionable , we had conveyed the im - pression that his book is a misleading or in the least degree an uncandid one ; and we repeat that its fairness and fulness of statement offset its sometimes doubtful logic .

		Ample data are furnished from which the reader may draw his own conclusions .

		The story of
Marlborough	LOCATION	's boyhood and school-days and of his youth is given with a fulness heretofore unattempted ; and the author has added a succinct and lively account of his period and of the people about him .

		The portraits of
Charles	PERSON	and of
James	LOCATION	, of
Sarah Jennings	PERSON	and her devoted '' Mrs. Mor - ley , '' are capitally done , and show beyond ques - tion that Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	, unlike his hero , can use the pen as well as the sword .

		Altogether admirable is the account of Sedgemoor and here our author has a signal advantage over
Macaulay	LOCATION	in that he is a thorough military ex - pert .

		His story of the battle is a foretaste of the treat awaiting us in the promised volumes embracing Queen
Anne	PERSON	's wars .

		A man of ac - tion and a man of his time , Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	treats himself to occasional '' asides '' -LRB- usually at the expense of the chronically-indignant 362 -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, British taxpayer -RRB- on current questions .

		Com - menting on Sedgemoor , he says : '' This , the last battle fought in
England	LOCATION	, was fought to secure
James	PERSON	his crown .

		If through the folly and parsimony of our people we should ever see another , it will be fought in defence of
London	LOCATION	.

		The struggle will be not for a dynasty , but for our own very existence as an independent nation .

		Are we prepared to meet it ?

		The politician says Yes ; the soldier and the sailor say No . ''

		Describing Monmouth , he says : '' He was one of that sort of cut-and-dried , old-fash - ioned officers , who could not believe it possible that badly-armed , slovenly-looking regiments , untrained in the formal evolutions of a regular army , could be of any real military value .

		To officers of his class it was , and still is , heresy to hold that a man can be capable of doing a soldier 's work unless he is dressed like a cockatoo , and drilled to stand like a ramrod , with his nose in the air . ''

		What would the Prussian drill-sergeant say to that ?

		There are many illustrations largely por - traits after the Buccleugh miniatures ; and the volumes are at all points beautiful and even sumptuous pieces of book-making .

		* One of the earliest and most devoted of the class known as '' book-lovers '' those uncor - rupted and unjaded mortals who love and rev - erence a book per se as well as for what it con - tains was the good Bishop of

		O Blessed God of Gods in Zion ! ''

		he writes in his Philobiblon , '' how great a flood of pleasure delighted our heart as often as we had leisure to visit and sojourn at

		There are delightful libraries , fragrant beyond stores of spices ; there are green pleasure-gardens of all kinds of volumes . ''

		The quays of

		The books he saw were not objects of barter in num - berless stalls planted along the banks of the

		their changes .

		So , '' in these vocal days '' as Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	tells us in his preface to
M. Octave Uzanne	PERSON	's '' Book-Hunter in
Paris	LOCATION	'' '' when there are books about almost everything under the sun , no one need wonder that so quaint a fraternity as the stall-keepers on the quays of the Seine should have a volume all to themselves . ''

		If one is to take
M. Uzanne	PERSON	literally , the antiquated figure of the stall - keeper '' who has disappeared '' was cast in a quite different mould from the more prosaic stall-keeper of to-day .

		Pere Malorey , who died in
January , 1890	DATE	, had kept a stall on the
Quai Conti	PERSON	, at the corner of the Pont des Arts , for sixty-two years .

		Strictly honest , of good sense , something of a scholar , he was '' known and esteemed by the world of book-sellers , biblio - philes , and the learned , who found books at his stall and information in his talk , '' - says
M. Uzanne	PERSON	.

		And this fine old gentleman was well satisfied with his business , and had no thought of rising above it .

		The stall-keeper of to-day is of another genus .

		Let M. Uzanne introduce him : '' It is
Chevalier	PERSON	, the old waiter at the Salle Sylvestre , well known for his indisguisable ignorance and his any - thing but Athenian idiom .

		He hardly knows how to read ; none the less his is one of the stalls where you will find the most books and the best books ; he has already made enough money to have his investments . ''

		It is usually the character of yesterday who interests us most ; so we turn back to
Pere Foy	PERSON	, a quaint character , the friend of '' the learned , the witty and lamented Bibliophile
Jacob	PERSON	, ''
Paul Lacroix	PERSON	.

		When the aesthetic soul of the late Emperor was perplexed by the appearance of pauper
Paris	LOCATION	, he would have swept away , as so many dealers in old rags , the stall-keepers on the quays .

		But their friend -
Lacroix	PERSON	in - duced the Emperor to take a stroll with him one day ; and coming along the Quai Malaquais , they saw an old man warming himself at a fire of papers in a portable stove .

		To complete the story in
M. Uzanne	LOCATION	's words : '' From time to time he took a volume from a pile of books by his side and tore out a handful of leaves to feed the fire .

		The Emperor approached , and , with some in - terest , wished to know what work was thought so value - less as to be used as a combustible .

		Pe * re
Foy	PERSON	who is not acquainted with his reputation to-day ?

		quietly handed the volume to the Sovereign , and
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		read with stupefaction the headline in these triumphal words : ' Conquetes et Victoires des Francois . ' ''

		This dear old
Pere Foy	ORGANIZATION	had a very checkered career .

		A fire finally destroyed the greater part of his stock of books , and the insurance company paid him in cash fifteen thousand francs .

		Thenceforth he did nothing ; '' he did
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 363 not renew his books ; he did not change his clothes ; he let his feet protrude beyond his socks ; all the shirt he had was just enough to carry a collar . ''

		With such diverting stories , incidents , and experiences ,
M. Uzanne	PERSON	's book is filled .


M. Emile Mas	PERSON	has sprinkled the text and the mar - gins with scenes and figures that are equally diverting .

		From the windows of his lodgings ,
M. Uzanue	PERSON	could see from the
Pont Royal	ORGANIZATION	to the Pont des Arts '' that long array of stalls that border the
Seine	LOCATION	, and which the curiosity of the loungers is passing under review from morn to eve '' ; and this picture , always within his view , he has reproduced in its many and varied phases , so that now the reader at a dis - tance can see the moving panorama of the quays as it has passed so often in review before the author .

		In the appendix is a very touching account of a notable banquet given to the book - stall men , in
November , 1892	DATE	, in accordance with the bequest of the late
M. Xavier Mari	PERSON	- mer .

		About ninety-five stall-keepers were pres - ent at the banquet , and they spent a happy hour in discussing a repast the like of which was quite new to many of them .

		occasion , as the author of ``
Adam Bede	PERSON	'' showed herself , to discard preaching altogether without re - leasing the attention .

		This Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	can hardly be said to have done as yet , although ''
David Grieve	PERSON	'' promised much in that direction .

		Comparing Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	with
George Eliot	PERSON	, or , to be more specific , `` Marcella '' with ``
Felix Holt	PERSON	, '' we are conscious of two marked contrasts .

		The incomparable rich - ness of
George Eliot	PERSON	's mind becomes only the more apparent when we put the two works side by side , although Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's pages always reflect a ripe - ness of culture and a degree of seriousness quite unwonted among writers of fiction .

		Furthermore , emotion sometimes gets the upper hand -LRB- or very nearly gets it -RRB- in Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's books , whereas
George Eliot	PERSON	kept it strictly subordinated to intellect .

		We may say in addition that `` Marcella '' is more dis - tinctly a book of a single character than any of
George Eliot	PERSON	's more considerable performances .

		The heroine is the only person who interests us very much ; her parents are imperfectly realized , her so - cialist friends are abstractions of varying degrees of shadowiness , the humble folk , whom she so pas - sionately desires to help , impress us chiefly with the squalor of their surroundings and arouse a sympa - thy that is mainly reflected from
Marcella	LOCATION	herself .

		Even her lover ,
Aldous Raeburn	PERSON	, has a touch of the priggishness that makes it possible to hold the type up to a sort of mild ridicule , as in the cases of
Schiller	PERSON	's
Marquis of Posa	ORGANIZATION	and
Tennyson 's King Arthur	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a general rule with the one rather notable exception of
Wharton	LOCATION	the characters of the novel seem to be delineated as they appear to
Marcella	PERSON	's eyes rather than to the objective judg - ment of the artist who , '' contemplating all , '' should project them one by one upon the scene , endowing each with its proper vitality .

		It is a little unfor - tunate that the artist should have thus abdicated to her creature , because
Marcella	PERSON	, charming and high - minded as she appears to us , has no sense of humor , and is essentially a thing of impulse and passion .

		Now human life is never revealed in its truth to an observer under the sway of emotion , nor in its ful - ness to one who has tears for its sorrows but no

		364 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, smiles for its mirth .

		Life is a terribly serious thing , no doubt , in many of its aspects , but it is fortunate that it is not always interpreted for us by so tensely - strung a medium as that of
Marcella	PERSON	's nature .

		The book is occupied from beginning to end with the social problem in its more recent English envisage - ment .

		It calls , consequently , for examination as a study in sociology no less than as a transcript of life .

		What attitude towards socialism does it as - sume ?

		Is the author carried away by sentimental - ism , or does she keep in constant view the hard un - compromising facts with which any settlement of the social problem must fit ?

		The reader is con - stantly putting the questions to himself , and differ - ent portions of the work seem to offer varying answers .

		It is only when the end is reached , and the author 's method taken fully into account , that these questions may be fairly answered .

		Then only will adequate credit be given to Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's dra - matic treatment of the subject ; then only will the reader realize that the conflicting answers that from time to time seem to emerge merely reflect the phases of
Marcella	PERSON	's storm and stress period of de - velopment , and that the poise of soul eventually at - tained by her is typical of what must be the final attitude -LRB- as far as finality in such matters is possi - ble -RRB- of every calm and rational nature brought face to face with the social problem .

		The critical point , in the development both of
Marcella	LOCATION	's character and of the problem with which she is struggling , appears to be reached when she declares to one of her socialist fellow - workers : '' No !

		so far as Socialism means a political system the trampling out of private enterprise and competi - tion , and all the rest of it I find myself slipping away from it more and more .

		No !

		as I go about among these wage-earners , the emphasis do what I will comes to lie less and less on possession more and more on character .

		I go to two tenements in the same build - ing .

		One is Hell the other Heaven .

		Why ?

		Both belong to well-paid artisans with equal opportunities .

		Both , so far as I can see , might have a decent and pleasant life of it .

		But one is a man the other , with all his belongings , will soon be a vagabond . ''

		One need read no more than this to discern that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's view of the social problem is both wise and conservative .

		No one , indeed , familiar with her earlier books , could reasonably have doubted that she would thus place the final emphasis upon character , or have feared that she would be misled by the allurements of any scheme , with whatever eloquence urged , that seeks to bring on earth peace , good-will toward men , by application from without .

		She might almost have taken for a motto these words of Dr. Ibsen : '' Men still call for special revolutions for revolutions in politics , in externals .

		But all that sort of thing is trumpery . ''

		In style , '' Mar - cella '' is probably Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's best book .

		This makes an occasional slip all the more surprising , and we can not understand how she could have used the word '' demean '' in the illiterate sense .

		It is also surprising to find
Arnold	LOCATION	's familiar '' Yes !

		in the sea of life enisled '' misquoted as '' On the broad seas of life enisled . ''

		For a near relative of the poet to have done this is less excusable than for another .

		The contrast is very striking between Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's restrained and thoughtful art and the careless and inartistic work displayed in '' A Yellow Aster . ''

		These defects are partly accounted for by the very amateurish character of the performance , but there is a residuum of offensiveness not so pardonably to be explained away .

		The writer is clearly determined to be effective , and is fairly successful in her aim , but at the heavy cost of every grace of diction and nearly all verisimilitude .

		We are compelled to take more literally than she would probably wish the sug - gestion of the title , and to assert that her heroine is even more impossible than a yellow aster , or a black tulip , or any other horticultural monstrosity .

		It is a pity that the book should be so repellant to the artistic sense , for it has qualities of humor and pathos that are not without promise , and for which much might have been done by restrained and care - ful cultivation .

		But the writer has chosen to appeal to the roughened palate and the jaded sense , and she has her reward .

		Had she been wiser , she would have known that a sensational entrance into the field of literature is the thing above all others to be avoided by anyone who hopes to attract serious attention .

		The heroine of '' The Rubicon '' is something of a monstrosity , too , and in much the same way as the heroine of '' A Yellow Aster . ''

		Both are wo - men who , we are given to understand , have enor - mous potentialities for love and self-sacrifice , but who , en attendant the development of these latent qualities , are capable of acting with phenomenal heartlessness and even brutality towards the men whom they have respectively pledged themselves to love , honor , and obey .

		The woman of '' The Ru - bicon '' is more seriously wicked than '' Dodo , '' and far less attractive in her wickedness .

		But she has at least the grace to put an end to her destructive career by suicide , and the action becomes her , how - ever little the ethical finality attaching to it .

		The only merit of this novel is afforded by its occasional bits of bright observation and satirical comment ; as a piece of construction , it is slovenly both as to style and to composition in the larger sense .

		What is meant for a tragic climax -LRB- the scene in the opera box -RRB- is ludicrous in its ineffectiveness and inadequacy . ''

		You are a wicked woman , '' says
Reggie	PERSON	, and turns on his heel .

		The remark is truthful enough , but the particular instance offers nothing to occasion it .

		A new novel by Mr.
Blackmbre	PERSON	could not fail to be an event of much importance , were the work less entertaining than ''
Perlycross	PERSON	. ''

		One undoubtedly feels that he has read it all before , and that the Devonshire village which gives the book its name is a spot long since familiar .

		One feels also that in this particular case the framework of the story is too slender for the wealth of ornamental detail
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 365 bestowed upon it that there is an intolerable deal of sack for the poor half-pennyworth of bread .

		But the charm of Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's manner is irresist - ible ; his humor is wholesome , and his poetic feel - ing is genuine and deep . ''

		Perlycross '' is not to be compared with the four or five best works of its author , but is , for all that , thoroughly enjoyable .

		Its very whimsicalities of style and temper are an essential element in its attractiveness , and quaintly help to set forth the old-fashioned , kindly , high - minded personality that we everywhere feel to lurk behind the scenes .

		The author of `` An Englishman in
Paris	LOCATION	'' has turned his hand to the composition of a detective story , and we can not say that he has been success - ful .

		When we think of the work of
M. Gaboriau	PERSON	, or even of Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	, `` The Mystery of the Patrician Club '' appears by comparison imperfectly conceived and clumsily unfolded .

		Mr.
Vandam	PERSON	in - dulges in all the stock phrases of melodrama , and does not even spare us the '' dull thud . ''

		There is nothing about the book that can be taken seriously , not even seriously enough for the purposes of the rather low type of fiction to which it belongs .

		But we do not always care to take things seriously in hot weather , and for an idle hour by the seaside the tale will serve . ''

		With Edged Tools '' -LRB- a title borrowed , it would seem , except for a variation in the spelling of the adjective , from Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	's novel -RRB- is a book of alternating adventures in
Africa	LOCATION	and draw - ing-room conversations in
London	LOCATION	.

		It all turns upon the doings of a heartless coquette , who en - gages herself , in a manner , with two men at the same time .

		These men , unwitting of the tie that binds them , meet in
Central Africa	LOCATION	, and join in a money-making enterprise which turns out favorably .

		When they return to claim their promised brides , there turns out to be only one of her for both , and neither of them seems to care for her any longer .

		Whereby she gets her just deserts .

		The African part of the story relates to the search for a myste - rious shrub named simiacine , greatly desiderated by medicine men , and worth many times its weight in gold .

		There is hardly a real character or a natural situation in the book ; on the other hand , there is some cleverness of dialogue and abundant action .

		According as the reader cares for one or the other pair of characteristics , he may elect to read or to reject it .

		The novel of adventure seems just now to be hav - ing an English renaissance , and the popularity of such works as '' The White Company '' and '' A Gen - tleman of
France	LOCATION	'' points to a distinct reaction in popular taste from the allurements of realism and analysis .

		Mr.
Westall	PERSON	's '' For Honor and Life , '' which is a rather better book than the author has accustomed us to , is a story of the Swiss Guards , qui ne sacrimenti fidem fallerent , fortissime pug - nantes ceciderunt , on the tenth of
August , 1792	DATE	, thereby achieving immortality and the rock-carved Lion of
Lucerne	LOCATION	.

		The particular guard who is Mr.
Westall	PERSON	's hero escaped the massacre of that day , otherwise there would have been no story for us .

		Of his subsequent connection with a plot to aid the escape of the
King	LOCATION	, of the fair maiden whose beaux yeux led him into numerous venturesome enter - prises , and of many other matters , we read with quite breathless interest , albeit with the cheerful conviction that a happy ending of the story awaits us in the closing chapter .

		Mr.
David Christie Murray	PERSON	's latest novel has for its theme the rescue of an Italian patriot from the Austrian dungeon in which he had been left to rot for twenty years , and the subsequent activity of the rescued man in
London	LOCATION	as an organizer of the rev - olutionary movement of
1848	DATE	.

		The rescuer , who tells his own story , is inspired by the fair eyes of the Italian 's daughter , and , after many tribula - tions , makes her his wife .

		The story is told with the homely and affected bluffness supposed to befit the narrator , is filled with more or less exaggerated incident , and is sensational in tone without being more than moderately interesting . ''

		Under the Red Robe '' is sure of an audience , both because Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	wrote it , and because the ever-fascinating figure of Richelieu dominates the action .

		Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	gives us the Richelieu of
Dumas	PERSON	and Lord Lytton rather than the car - dinal-minister of actual history , but few will quar - rel with him for that .

		Indeed , the Richelieu of romance seems assured of a genuine immortality , whatever may befall the annals of Louis XIII .

		and his reign . ''

		Under the Red Robe '' is an autobio - graphical episode .

		The hero is a decayed and dis - solute gentleman , sent by the Cardinal upon a per - ilous expedition to the Spanish frontier , and acquit - ting himself with much address and more grace than his antecedents would lead the reader to expect .

		The story is packed with adventure , and possessed of romantic charm in a high degree .

		Let Mr.
Wey	PERSON	- man write a few more books of the sort , and he will fairly earn the title of the English Dumas .

		If the judgment be based upon the originality of plot , the best of the four novels of adventure in our present selection is '' The Prisoner of Zenda . ''

		The scene is laid in one of the smaller German monarch - ies so plentiful before
1871	DATE	, and the prisoner is the rightful king , held in confinement by his ambitious and unscrupulous brother .

		The hero is an adven - turous Englishman , whose extraordinary resem - blance to the prisoner enables him to personate the captive monarch , assume the crown in his place , and wear it successfully for three months .

		Fantastic , as the plot appears in this skeleton outline , it is given much verisimilitude by the ingenuity of the narrator .

		Uneasy lies the head , we may be sure , of this illegitimate crown-wearer , but the situation is saved by his pluck and his sagacity , and he suc - ceeds in rescuing and restoring to the throne his royal double .

		The story is singularly well-knit , rapid in action , and uninterruptedly interesting .

		366 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, There is no serious attempt at characterization , but much play of pleasing sentiment , and much dra - matic excitement , in its pages .

		A young English nobleman of profligate charac - ter and reckless disposition gets into a scrape , leaves his home , and begins a new life in the wilds of
British America	LOCATION	.

		There he marries a half-breed of French and Indian blood .

		The son of this union , when full-grown , learns of his English re - lations , and , the parents having died , goes to En - gland to claim his name and his family .

		Pretty nearly all novels nowadays deal with problems , and the problem of '' The Trespasser '' is to set forth the effect of this triple ancestry upon a man sud - denly brought into contact with the refinements of a highly civilized society .

		There is no trouble about recognition , and the new-comer holds his own in most respects , a strong character and a natural adaptability seeing him safely through many diffi - cult situations .

		But the wild strain in his blood as - serts itself in the end , and works much disaster .

		Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's treatment of this theme is always in - teresting and often brilliant .

		The story is well - constructed and shows much dramatic power .

		If we may borrow one of the author 's own phrases , we should say that there is a good deal of '' raw color '' about it .

		The subtleties of analytic art are not within Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's reach , but he makes up for their lack by rather striking qualities of invention and imaginative passion .

		The entirely wanton in - troduction of an element of clairvoyant claptrap is the one marked fault of the book , and its uncanny effect is produced at too great a cost .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	is evidently ambitious to become the novelist of life in
America	LOCATION	as well as in
Italy	LOCATION	or the
East	LOCATION	, of life in
New York	LOCATION	no less than of life in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		It can not fairly be claimed that he has succeeded in this task , and the reason is not far to seek .

		His talent is essentially romantic , and there is nothing romantic at all about
New York	LOCATION	society .

		He has made three attempts to handle this material : `` The Three Fates , '' probably the weakest of all his books , ''
Marion Darche	PERSON	, '' a sketch too slight to be seriously considered , and ''
Kathar	PERSON	- ine Lauderdale , '' the book now under examination .

		All that we can say of it is that it is better than the two others .

		But it can not for a moment be com - pared with the really remarkable '' Saracinesca '' novels , with '' Pietro Ghisleri '' or ''
Greifenstein	PERSON	, '' with '' A Roman Singer '' or '' To Leeward . ''

		Clever and fluent as Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	always is , the romantic remains his element , and the doings of '' society '' are almost as dull in his pages as they are in reality .

		His technique is nearly always good , and the reader can get some satisfaction from that .

		But even technique fails him in what may be taken as the central episode of ''
Katherine Lauderdale	PERSON	, '' and the spectacle of the hero solemnly invoking the tes - timony of the family physician to prove that he -LRB- the hero -RRB- is not drunk , excites to a mirthf ulness that can hardly have been contemplated by Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	.

		A number of writer * have discovered of late that the history of this continent offers much material excellent for the purposes of romantic fiction .

		The present age , indeed , is not very romantic , except in the pages of Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	, but one has only to get back a hundred years or so to find abundant inspiration .

		Mrs.
Ryan	PERSON	is one of the latest explorers in these little-trodden regions , and her new novel , '' A Flower of
France	LOCATION	, '' takes us to eighteenth cen - tury
New Orleans	LOCATION	, finding in its mixed population , its old-world relations , and its turbulent annals , so much interesting matter that her canvas suffers from being overcrowded .

		We can not say that the material is very well arranged , or that the story is at all points probable , but the book is at least en - tertaining and deserves a certain degree of praise .

		The late
Wolcott Balestier	PERSON	was a man of unusual personal charm , and was felt by more than one ju - dicious critic to exhibit the promise of literary achievement .

		At the time of his death his literary luggage was , it must be confessed , of the slender - est description , and it is not until recently that his most considerable work has seen the light in book form . ''

		Benefits Forgot , '' with its taking Shake - spearian title , is a work of promise rather than of fulfilment , but the promise is at least nearer fulfil - ment than was the case with the three or four slighter predecessors of this story .

		Its author was still in the chrysalis stage , and evidently struggling towards the attainment of a distinctive manner .

		Whether he would have acquired such a manner is a problem never to be solved .

		His association with Mr.
Kip	PERSON	- ling seems to have had an unfortunate effect ; throughout the book the presence of this alien in - fluence is felt .

		The attempt to write a Kiplingese adapted to American conditions results only in an unpleasant jerkiness of style and construction .

		Dur - ing the early chapters , the characters seem to have gone daft , so singular and inexplicable are their ac - tions .

		One would think them to be breathing the over-oxygenated atmosphere produced by the exper - iment of Doctor Ox rather than the rarefied air of
Colorado	LOCATION	altitudes .

		After we get used to their ec - centricities they seem to become more nearly nor - mal .

		As for the point of honor about which the whole story turns , the author himself does not seem to have been quite decided , and the question of right and wrong is obscured by not a little casuis - try .

		We are not told enough about the origin of the tangle concerning the ownership of the ranch and the mine to be quite sure as to what is right and what wrong .

		Questions of this sort may be settled in two ways : either by strict reference to the legal conditions or by appeal to the general fairness of the situation .

		Either settlement would be , in a way , satisfactory ; but Mr.
Balestier	PERSON	got the technical and the moral claims inextricably confused , and does not provide the data for a disentanglement .

		Miss
Woolson	PERSON	's posthumous novel is , like her ear - lier books , essentially a study of manners , although there is enough of passion to free the story from
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 367 the reproach of monotony , and keep it well above the level of commonplace .

		The scene is mainly in the
Asheville	LOCATION	of twenty years ago , but shifted at times to the
Florida	LOCATION	that the author knew so well .

		The characters are drawn with admirable distinct - ness and vitality , those of
Horace Chase	PERSON	and his wife bearing , in all their words and actions , the warrant of their own actuality .

		The self-righteous - ness of the sister-in-law ,
Genevieve	PERSON	, seems to us a little exaggerated , but , with this possible excep - tion , the characters have the singular merit of be - ing kept within truthful bounds under circumstances that would have tempted many writers to distortion for the sake of heightened effect .

		We should hardly say that ''
Horace Chase	PERSON	'' will add noticeably to Miss
Woolson	PERSON	's reputation , but it shows that her rather unusual powers were sustained to the last , and it is a worthy accession to the half-dozen books that stand as a memorial of one of the most capable and conscientious of our recent novelists . ''

		If only there were more of it ! ''

		will be the exclamation of most readers of '' Overheard in Arcady , '' by Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	our own cis-At - lantic
Robert Bridges	ORGANIZATION	.

		This altogether charming little book consists of a dozen bits of dialogue based upon the humorous fancy of bringing together the principal characters in a man 's books , and setting them to talking about their creator .

		Thus ,
Bartley Hubbard	PERSON	,
Fulkerson	PERSON	,
Annie Kilburn	PERSON	, and others , talk about Mr.
Howells	PERSON	;
Daisy Miller	PERSON	and the Mas - ter discuss Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	; the Lady and the Tiger converse about Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	; while Mr.
Craw	PERSON	- ford falls into the hands of
Corona Saracinesca	LOCATION	,
Russell Vanbrugh	PERSON	, Mr.
Isaacs	PERSON	, and
Ram Lai	PERSON	, who , strangely enough , all happen to meet on a P. and 0 .

		steamer .

		That Mr. Bridges brings an audacious fancy to the execution of this novel idea is evident from mere mention of the dialogue between the Lady and the Tiger , and still more so from the fact that Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	, in another of these ingenious compositions , calmly discuss their peculiar mutual relations .

		Here is a bit of the dialogue be - tween a few of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's characters : MAKJORIE : '' There is the original Bad Boy now !

		Do n't you know
Tom Bailey	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, the distinguished poli - tician and editor ?

		He is at the
Surf House	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- Greetings and introductions -RRB- .

		We were speaking of you .

		Mr.
Flemming	PERSON	thinks your biography the best of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's novels . ''

		BAILEY -LRB- in despair -RRB- : '' Can I never live down that awful tale of my youth !

		Some people really believe that I did all those things .

		I think I should have been nominated for gov - ernor last
June	DATE	if a rival paper had not unearthed what it called my ' Terrible Record as a Boy in
Rivermouth	LOCATION	. ' ''

		FLEMMING -LRB- laughing -RRB- : '' I remember , but I heard a dozen men at the club declare that they would like to have a chance to vote for the original of the Bad Boy .

		They all looked upon you as the friend of their youth .

		I have n't a doubt that every winter a wave of midnight explosions sweeps over the villages of this country .

		It means that the next crop of boys has been i eading the ' Story of a Bad Boy . '

		It is passed along from gen - eration to generation of village youngsters with '
Tom Brown	PERSON	' and ' Verdant Green . '

		That is true immortality for an author .

		There are no books we love so long , no authors we remember so kindly , as those we read and delighted in when young . ''

		BAILEY -LRB- with mock earnestness -RRB- : '' Then I 'm condemned to go down to posterity as the terror of good parents and cor - rect school-teachers .

		I am even mistrusted by the village police everywhere ! ''

		MAKJORIE -LRB- cutting in -RRB- : '' But the village girls wo n't love you the less for it . ''

		FLEMMING -LRB- judiciously -RRB- : ''
Aldrieh	PERSON	did one very fine thing with the ' Bad Boy ' ; he annihilated the prig in American ju - venile literature for a generation . ''

		MARJORIE : '' And that 's almost as good as being the de - lightful poet that he is .

		-LRB- A maid appears in the doorway . -RRB-

		And now we T ll have luncheon . ''

		-LRB- Exeunt . -RRB-

		When we say that `` Overheard in Arcady '' is as good as this throughout , we should do enough to send it a host of readers . ''

		A Little Dinner in Ar - cady '' closes the volume , the guests being English and American novelists and such of their characters as
Daisy Miller	PERSON	,
Diana	PERSON	-LRB- of The Crossways -RRB- , Meh Lady , and the Princess Saracinesca . ''

		Life , '' who acts as host , explains the seating : '' I told each man to bring one of his own family .

		Then I mixed the names in a hat and drew this combination . ''

		The conversation is after such fashion as the following : DAISY
MILLER	PERSON	: `` Think of our flattering
Charley Rich	PERSON	and his set .

		They are so conceited now that they think all the girls are in love with them .

		We have to train all the young nobs down with sarcasm before they are endurable .

		We are onto their style . ''

		PRINCESS SARACINESCA -LRB- to Page -RRB- : `` What queer English that young woman speaks !

		I fear that I must have had an uncultivated teacher in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		It 's all so strange to me . ''

		PAGE : '' You must come and visit us in
Ole Vahginia	LOCATION	, my deah lady , to heah the real old English language .

		We are descended from the Cavaliers , madam . ''

		PRINCESS : `` Now , I understand the peculiar spelling in `
Marse Chan	PERSON	. '

		It 's old English , is n't it , like Chaucer and Beowulf ? ''

		PAGE -LRB- shifting the subject -RRB- : `` Oh , I say , Meh Lady , you must invite the Princess down to the old plantation .

		She is writing a book about
America	LOCATION	, and I reckon it will be all Bos - ton and
New York	LOCATION	, as usual , unless we divert her . ''

		MRS. HAWKSBEE : '' Invite me too , please .

		I want to see
America	LOCATION	.

		I only know what I 've read about it in Mr.
James	PERSON	's novels , and what Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has told me . ''

		BUNNER -LRB- behind his hand to Page -RRB- : `` She must have a beautiful chromo picture of us then in her mental gallery .

		Imagine taking your impression of
America	LOCATION	from
James	LOCATION	and Kipling ! ''

		We must say in closing that the fun in which Mr. Bridges indulges is always good-natured , and that it serves as a mask for not a little genial and se - rious criticism the criticism that delights in pay - ing tribute to whatever it finds that is lovely and of good report in the work under consideration .

		Some of the many volumes of short stories that have recently been published seem to call for a few words of description or comment .

		The characteristics of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's work are so well known as hardly to need re-statement .

		* 1 ' Life 's Little Ironies '' is the title given to a score of tales and character sketches .

		They deal with people who would be abso - lutely uninteresting in the hands of any less a mas - ter , and even his genius has much to contend with in their presentation . ''

		A Tragedy of Two
Ambi	ORGANIZATION	- tions '' and `` On the Western Circuit '' are perhaps the strongest of these aptly-entitled tales .

		Miss Harraden 's '' In Varying Moods '' will probably attract more attention than it deserves .

		The stories 368 -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, are very slight , and the mark of the amateur senti - mentalist is upon them . ''

		The Umbrella-Mender , '' the best and most original of them , is a little sugges - tive of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		Of the six stories in Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	's volume , four are upon the Western themes that she handles with such picturesque effect and easy mas - tery .

		These are distinctly the best , and among them '' In Exile '' and '' The Watchman '' seem to us the most attractive .

		They exhibit many of the qualities displayed by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	, although without his humor .

		In its place there is a certain gravity and a certain reserved poetical feeling that may be held sufficient to make up the balance .

		There are eight stories in Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's volume , widely varied in their themes .

		The author has considerable powers of in - vention , but they often lead him to forced and even preposterous situations .

		More than once , also , does he give the cord of sensibility a decided wrench .

		But the stories are readable , and more ; at their best they are strongly interesting .

		The volume of seven stories just published by Mr.
Davis	PERSON	shall serve us for a bonne louche .

		We are inclined to think '' The Exiles '' the best story that Mr.
Davis	PERSON	has written , although '' His Bad Angel '' is a good second .

		It would certainly be rash to say that all the good stories have been told as long as the fertile genius that has given us these and so many others is at work .

		Few writers know so well what to say , just how to arrange it , or just when to stop .

		There is not a wearisome page in the volume , and the author shows himself singulai-ly independent of the hack - neyed devices of the professional story-teller .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Public Libraries in
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
William I. Fletcher	PERSON	's little book on `` Public Libraries in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , written for Professor
Todd	PERSON	's '' Columbian Knowledge '' series , is so good a book for its purpose that we fear our few remarks will do it but imperfect justice .

		It discusses , in brief chapters that almost invariably contain just the things that ought to be said and no others , such subjects as library legislation , buildings , catalogues , and management , the relation of the library to the community , the selection of books , and the training of the librarian .

		One may find words of soberness and wisdom upon nearly every page .

		We select a few examples . '' '

		First , appoint your librarian , ' is a maxim worthy the attention of newly formed boards of trustees . ''

		`` Experience has shown that care is necessary to avoid the opposite dangers , on the one hand of a library administration left to the mercy of shifting politics , and on the other of one run as a close corporation tending naturally to be - come a one-man power . ''

		`` The way , then , to start a library is to start it , not to make great plans and invoke State aid at the outset ; but in a simple way to make a beginning from which the library may grow . '' ''

		A well-ordered library must admit read - ers to its shelves , where , under proper restric - tions , they may look over the books on a given sub - ject and not be confined to the narrow range im - posed by the limitations of reading-room use . ''

		The whole gospel of library architecture is condensed into this sentence : '' The order should be to require the architect to put a presentable exterior on an in - terior having only use in view , and not , as is so often done , to require the librarian to make the best he can of an interior imposed by the exigencies of the architect 's taste or the demand of a building committee for a monumental structure . ''

		Here are some golden words upon the selection of books r `` Sometimes the work of selection is allowed to pass into the hands of some one who is supposed to be competent because he is a book-fancier , possibly something of a bibliomaniac , but who fills the library with books which constitute a literary museum , rather than a literary laboratory or workshop . ''

		On the sub - ject of cataloguing , Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	entertains the ra - tional notion that a catalogue should be made intel - ligible to those who want to use it .

		This doctrine needs urging in view of the recent vogue of systems that only the initiated can understand . ''

		The classi - fication schemes , '' Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	says , `` proceed on the idea of taking the whole field of knowledge as the unit , and dividing and subdividing it by some logical process , with a large infusion of arithmetic in the case of the decimal systems and some others .

		They are thus quite completely theoretical , and in practice are too rigid and mechanical to fit the nat - ural differentiation of books one from another ; for the books in a library do not lend themselves to such a process of logical subdivision . ''

		As an illus - tration of his views , the author gives us a simple outline classification of the books likely to be found in the general public or college library , and his pub - lishers have reprinted this chapter in a volume by itself , with the title , '' Library Classification . ''

		We should like to discuss the thoughtful chapter on `` Library Laws , '' but must refer readers to the book for that .

		As a compendium of fact , Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's little treatise is of much value .

		We note particu - larly its history of the library movement in Amer - ica , its account of special libraries and collections , , and its tables of library statistics .

		The illustrations , also , are remarkably well chosen , being mostly plans of buildings and portraits of librarians .

		Among the latter we note the fine likeness of
W. F. Poole	PERSON	, and the biographical sketch ending with mention of his recent death `` the heaviest loss American libra - rianship has known . ''

		Perhaps the best thing we can say of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's book is that Dr.
Poole	PERSON	would have given his cordial approval to almost every line of it .

		The sixth volume of Professor
Hux	PERSON	- ley 's `` Collected Essays '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a reprint of the ''
Hume	PERSON	'' written for the '' English Men of Letters '' series , supple - mented by two chapters on
Berkeley	LOCATION	.

		We learn Prof ,
Huxley	LOCATION	's Studies in
Philosophy	LOCATION	.

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 369 from the introduction that the author once expected to write a companion volume on
Berkeley	LOCATION	, '' but the burdens and distractions of a busy life led to the postponement of this , as of many other projects , till too late . ''

		The chapters here included are really studies for that work .

		The following remarks , which can not be accepted without some reserve , indicate Professor Huxley 's attitude towards the fundamen - tal problems of philosophy , and at the same time suggest the limitations , which are not only his own , but those of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	as well .

		The re - marks take the form of a word of advice to the younger generation . ''

		If it is your desire to dis - course fluently and learnedly about philosophical questions , begin with the lonians and work steadily through to the latest new speculative treatise .

		If you have a good memory and a fair knowledge of Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, French , and German , three or four years spent in this way should enable you to attain your object .

		If , on the contrary , you are animated by the much rarer desire for real knowledge ; if you want to get a clear conception of the deepest problems set before the intellect of man , there is no need , so far as I can see , for you to go beyond the limits of the English tongue .

		Indeed , if you are pressed for time , three English authors will suffice ; namely ,
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Hume	PERSON	, and Hobbes . ''

		From these three writers one may get , we are told , '' as much sound philosophical training as is good for any - one but an expert . ''

		This statement is so near the truth that we almost regret to insist upon the claims of
Kant	PERSON	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		Yet there can be no doubt that they also are `` good for anyone , '' not even an expert , and that , furthermore , they sup - ply certain elements absolutely essential to the com - prehension of the philosophical problem , elements hardly to be got from a study of the author 's great trio of English thinkers .


Baynes	PERSON	's The Shakespearian studies of the Shakespearian late
Thomas Spencer Baynes	PERSON	, to - studies .

		gether with a paper on `` English Dictionaries , '' have been collected in a volume now published -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , and prefaced by a bio - graphical sketch of the author .

		This sketch is the work of Professor
Lewis Campbell	PERSON	, and gives an excellent idea of the activity displayed by
Baynes	PERSON	as a professor of philosophy and literature , as a journalist , and as editor of the `` Encyclopaedia Britannica . ''

		The Shakespearian studies now re - printed include the following : `` What Shakespeare Learnt at School , '' '' Shakespearian Glossaries , '' '' New Shakespearian Interpretations , '' and the '' Encyclopaedia Britannica '' article on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the latter , the editor says with justice : `` The strength of this essay lies not so much in the spe - cial as in the general preparation of the writer .

		It was deeply rooted in his own life , and drew upon his whole past experience , in the world , not less than in the study .

		His attempt to replace Shake - speare in his actual environment is wonderfully suc - cessful , and amid such a farrago of all shades of probability , to have taken a definite line and held to it with so much substantial likelihood , is surely a re - markable achievement . ''

		Of this essay Bishop Words - worth said : '' I can only describe it as represent - ing an enormous amount of multifarious reading and of energetic thought , boiled down to a consist - ency so refined that it gives no sign of the process it has undergone .

		It strikes me as the most won - derfully massive and complete piece of work in the way of literary criticism I have ever seen ; and I doubt whether there is anything to equal it in that line . ''

		This is of course exaggerated , but the sub - stantial value of the biography , as well as of the other papers in this volume , is not to be disputed .

		The study of `` What Shakespeare Learnt at School '' is particularly valuable .

		By a careful examination of the grammar schools of the sixteenth century , and of the books used in them , it is found possible to construct with something like completeness the poet 's early education , while the conclusions thus reached from a priori reasoning are abundantly cor - roborated by careful examination of the plays them - selves .

		It is particularly instructive to compare the prominent place given to
Ovid	LOCATION	in the schools of the time , on the one hand , with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's marked fondness for and familiarity with that poet , on the other .

		So much prodigious nonsense has been written about
Shakespeare	PERSON	's learning that it is com - forting to find the subject sanely discussed from a rational point of view .

		Old Celtic Romances .

		In the second edition of Dr.
P. W. Joyce	PERSON	's '' Old Celtic Romances '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , we find twelve charm - ing old tales part verse , part prose translated from the original Gaelic manuscripts as preserved in
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	and in the
Royal Irish Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		His principle of translation has been to preserve the spirit and manner rather than the ex - act words ; the originals being simple in style , the English is of the kind he supposes the old shanachies -LRB- professional story-tellers -RRB- themselves would have used , had they spoken English instead of Gaelic .

		Like the Welsh legends of
Arthur	PERSON	and his Round Table , or the Arabian romances of Haroun-al-Ras - chid and his Court , these stories centre generally around the exploits of some favorite hero .

		One of them , `` The Voyage of Maildun , '' a tale of the eighth century , has an added interest from the fact that it was Dr.
Joyce	PERSON	's translation that furnished
Tennyson	PERSON	the inspiration for his poem '' The Voy - age of Maeldune . ''

		In `` An Old Master and Other Po - litical Essays '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Professor
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	gives some valu - able contributions to political science .

		In the first and second papers of the volume `` An Old Mas - ter '' -LRB- who is
Adam Smith	PERSON	-RRB- , and `` The Study of Politics '' he discusses methods of investigation and presentation in this science , and makes an elo - quent plea for men who , like
Adam Smith	PERSON	, '' will The Study of Politics 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, dare to know a multitude of things .

		Without them and their bold synthetic methods , all knowledge and all thought would fall apart into a weak analysis .

		Their minds do not lack in thoroughness : their thor - oughness simply lacks in minuteness . ''

		The third essay is a sound presentation of '' Political Sov - ereignty '' as resident in '' the law-making organ of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, in contravention of the crude theorizing that would lodge it in the people .

		The substance of the fourth and fifth papers , on '' Character of Democracy in the
United States	LOCATION	'' and '' Govern - ment Under the Constitution , '' is a demand for re - sponsible leadership in our government , which shall bring organization and unity into our now hope - lessly sporadic methods of legislation , and shall fasten upon
Congress	ORGANIZATION	'' an even more positive form of accountability than now rests upon the President and the courts . ''

		The methods of '' An Old Mas - ter '' pervade this valuable little book .

		A pioneer worker for women .


Mary Mortimer	PERSON	was one of that band of earnest women , of whom
Cathe	PERSON	- rine
Beecher	PERSON	was the chief , who half a century ago did so much for the cause of the ed - ucation of women in what was then '' the new West . ''

		It seems almost like ancient history to read of the difficulties and the strangeness of their work , as told by Mrs.
Minerva Brace Norton	PERSON	in ''
Mary Morti	PERSON	- mer : A Memoir '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- .


Milwaukee	LOCATION	was one of the promising young cities in which their labors were most successful , and Miss Mortimer spent nearly twenty-five years of her life as Principal of Mil - waukee
Female College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The record of her able and inspiring career , her wide and gracious influ - ence over the many young lives with whom she came in contact , has been written by a careful and affectionate hand .

		Such lives must ever be worthy of tribute , since , to quote Miss
Mortimer	PERSON	's own words , '' Few things are so soul-cheering in the weary pilgrimage of life as the knowledge , brought home to one 's heart , of the life and triumphs of genius and goodness . ''

		Waymarks in
Church History	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a volume entitled `` Waymarks in Church History '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- ,
William Bright	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	,
Canon of Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, and
Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History	ORGANIZATION	, has collected a dozen of his lectures and articles written for
Church	ORGANIZATION	magazines during the decade 1883-93 .

		The subjects , includ - ing Gnosticism , Ante-Nicene Sectarianism , the
Arian Controversy	ORGANIZATION	,
S. Basil	PERSON	, the controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries ,
Cyril	PERSON	of
Alexandria	LOCATION	,
Pelagianism	LOCATION	, the
Papacy	LOCATION	, the Clergy and Secular Employments ,
Bede	PERSON	and Laud , may seem , at first glance , already well worn , but each is treated with direct reference to some recent question which has arisen , thus giving to the papers a present-day in - terest .

		The collation and republication of the es - says have not only provided the opportunity for careful recension , but also for the addition of an important appendix to each .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Volume 47 of '' The Century , '' now published in cloth covers , is noticeable for its articles about
Napoleon	PERSON	, mu - sical composers , and
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, for its publica - tion of three papers by
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	, for '' Mark Twain 's '' '' Pudd ` nhead
Wilson	PERSON	'' and Mrs.
Foote	PERSON	's ''
Cffiur d'Alene	PERSON	, '' and for the 340 illustrations , among which Mr.
Timothy Cole	PERSON	's Dutch masters are easily first .

		These engravings from
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	,
Jan Steen	PERSON	, and
Frans Hals	PERSON	are worthy successors of the Italian masters included in Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's earlier series .

		Mr.
George Waring	PERSON	, Jr. , translates from the Dutch of
Heer J. G. W. Fijnje	PERSON	van Salverda an interesting lit - tle book on '' Aerial Navigation '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , and sup - plements it by a resume of the recent experiments of Professor
Langley	PERSON	and others .

		The book is timely , for its subject is '' in the air , '' and most mechanics who have followed the course of recent experimental work look for a speedy practical application of the principles that have been established by Messrs.
Langley	PERSON	,
Maxim	ORGANIZATION	, and
Holland	LOCATION	.

		It is hardly necessary to say that the balloon idea is now practically abandoned , and that mechanics look to some form of aeroplane as the solution of the problem presented .

		Professors
W. A. Stevens	PERSON	and
Ernest D. Burton	PERSON	have collaborated in the preparation of '' A Harmony of the Gospels for Historical Study '' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The version of
1881	DATE	is taken as a basis , and from it the editors have made an analytical synopsis of the four gospels , employing the device of parallel columns as far as it is practicable to do so .

		The work is a '' Harmony '' in the sense of an exhibit , not of an explanation or re - conciliation .

		There are nine principal divisions of the narrative with many sections and sub-sections .

		The ap - paratus of the book is quite elaborate and complete , but too complicated to be mastered without considerable study .

		When mastered , it ought to prove very helpful .

		The two-volume work upon '' Big Game Shooting '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which Mr.
Clive Phillipps-Wol	PERSON	- ley has edited for the '' Badminton '' library , is a verit - able encyclopaedia for that sportsman whose ambition soars above the domestic hare or the grouse of his na - tive heath .

		It includes nearly two score of articles by the best specialists upon the several subjects included there being articles by such mighty hunters as Sir
Sam	PERSON	- uel
Baker	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
F. C. Selous	PERSON	, Mr.
Warburton Pike	PERSON	, and Mr.
W. A. Baillie-Grohman	PERSON	.

		The volumes are abund - antly and artistically illustrated .

		Among late modern language texts we note
Herr Freytag	PERSON	's '' Der Rittmeister von Alt-Rosen , '' one of the '' Alineii '' series , edited , with an interesting introduc - tion , by Professor
James T. Hatfield	PERSON	;
Schiller	PERSON	's ``
Maria Stuart	PERSON	, '' edited by Prof.
Lewis A. Rhoades	PERSON	; and an adaptation , by
M. P. Desages	PERSON	, of Me * rimeVs '' La Chron - ique de Charles IX . ''

		All three of these books are ad - ditions to the lengthy list of
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		That pleasant poet ,
William Browne	PERSON	of
Tavistock	LOCATION	, who wrote ''
Britannia	ORGANIZATION	's Pastorals '' and many other things , now makes a two-volume appearance in the '' Temple '' library -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , for which his works have been edited by Mr.
Gordon Goodwin	PERSON	.

		Mr.
A. H. Bul	PERSON	- len 's introduction adds a distinct charm to this already charming edition .

		We note that the present editor very definitely assigns to
Browne	PERSON	the familiar lines '' On the Countess Dowager of
Pembroke	LOCATION	, '' and the evidence cer - tainly favors his authorship as against that of
Jonson	PERSON	, or indeed of any other .

		1894 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 YORK TOPICS .


New York	LOCATION	,
June 11 , 1894	DATE	, With the opening of the
summer	DATE	season , novels are more than ever the books of the hour .

		The success of some of them is really phenomenal .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's ''
Katharine Lauderdale	PERSON	'' is now in its sixth edition , and Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's '' Marcella '' has , I believe , reached a fifth large edition in this country alone .

		Publishers are con - sidering manuscripts sent them with more and more care , fearful of overlooking what may prove to be the success of the season .

		This is particularly true of novels offered them for copyright publication by English pub - lishers .

		Messrs.
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	believe that '' A Daughter of Music , '' by
G. Colmore	PERSON	, an English lady , which they have just brought out , will attract the same general attention here that it is gaining in
England	LOCATION	, where it has been compared to ''
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	. ''

		This firm has been very active in securing the works of leading novelists .

		Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	will publish Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	's next volume , `` The Lilac Sunbonnet , '' and they have arranged to issue Dr.
Conau Doyle	PERSON	's coming novels .

		They will also publish Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's `` The Manxman '' in the
fall	DATE	.

		In their `` Town and Country Series '' will soon appear '' Outlaw and Law - maker , '' by Mrs.
Campbell Praed	PERSON	, '' A Mild Barbarian , '' by
Edgar Fawcett	PERSON	, and '' Dr.
Janet	PERSON	of Harley Street , '' by
Arabella Kenealy	PERSON	.

		They will also publish Miss
Kate Sanborn	PERSON	's '' Abandoning an Adopted Farm , '' which re - counts her amusing failure in adopting a farm pre - viously abandoned by someone else , and which of course is a sequel to her former book on the same subject .

		This will appear in Messrs.
Appletons	PERSON	' new `` Handy Volume Series , '' in which they .

		will reissue '' Mrs.
Lim	PERSON	- ber 's Raffle , '' a novel by Mr.
William Allen Butler	PERSON	, pub - lished anonymously some ten years ago and now first acknowledged by the author of '' Nothing to Wear . ''

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	appear to be reaching out Bostonwards , for they announce a volume by Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	, `` The Scarlet Poppy , and Other Stories . ''

		One or two of these stories have ap - peared in this firm 's periodicals .

		The book includes , besides the title story , '' The Tragic Story of
Binns	PERSON	, '' '' The Composite Wife , '' Mrs.
Claxton	PERSON	's Skeleton , '' and other of Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	's always fresh and entertaining studies .

		Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	, the author of that weirdly grotesque volume , '' Toppleton 's Client , '' will bring out through Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	'' The Water Ghost , and Others , '' a book of ghost-stories full of the spark - ling dialogue , original situations , and the pervasive hu - mor in which this author excels .

		New volumes of fiction announced by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are `` A Suburban Pastoral , and Other Tales '' by Professor
Henry A. Beers	PERSON	, of
Yale Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity , and '' Quaker Idyls '' by Mrs.
S. M. H. Gardner	PERSON	.

		Professor Beers 's standard manuals of English and American literature , his life of
Willis	PERSON	, and his volume of poems , '' The Thankless Muse , '' have made him known aside from his college work .

		The present volume is the first collection of his stories which has been made .

		The title story is perhaps the best sketch of suburban life in an American city yet written .

		Professor Beers 's stories are marked by powerful but artistically sup - pressed feeling .

		Almost all of them relate to American life .

		Mrs.
S. M. H. Gardner	PERSON	is a resident of
Andover	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, but the scenes of her ''
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	Idyls '' are laid in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and some of them deal with anti-abo - litionist times .

		It is more than ten years since Mr.
Edgar Fawcett	PERSON	began the publication of a series of novels and short stories , the scenes of which were laid in
New York	LOCATION	modern
New York	LOCATION	, that is .

		It had occurred to him to look about his native city and to make use of metropol - itan scenes and types familiar to him from boyhood .

		Some of the sketches in his volume of '' Social Sil - houettes , '' while lacking nothing in romantic quality , presented to view most lifelike personifications of char - acters common in our social life .

		Almost at the same time with Mr.
Fawcett	PERSON	's occupation of the
New York	LOCATION	field , a number of other novelists selected the same ground as the locality of their stories , notably Mr.
Henry C. Bunner	PERSON	, Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	, and Mr.
William Henry Bishop	PERSON	, to say nothing of a host of lesser writers .

		Just at present there seems to be a revival of the
New York	LOCATION	novel .

		It is hard to say whether the city is becoming more interesting , but at least Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	with her '' Bachelor Maid , '' Mr.
Ma	PERSON	- rion
Crawford	PERSON	with his ''
Katharine Lauderdale	PERSON	'' and the sequel he is now writing , and Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	with his new ''
Harper	PERSON	'' serial , '' The
Golden House	ORGANIZATION	, '' have found it worth their while to write about things '' here at home . ''

		A curious paragraph has been going the rounds , to the effect that the Rev.
Walter Mitchell	PERSON	, whose '' Two Strings to his Bow '' has just been published by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the author of an earlier novel entitled '' Tacking Ship off Shore . ''

		Readers of the '' Atlantic Monthly '' will remember that '' Tacking Ship off Shore '' was a poem , and it is , I think , one of the finest sailing-poems in the language .

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's former novel , ''
Bryan Maurice	PERSON	, '' was first published in
1866	DATE	and reissued in
1888	DATE	.

		During the Puritan Gen - esta races he published another fine sailing poem , '' The Cup Defender , '' which was widely copied .

		The death of Mr.
Thomas Niles	PERSON	, of Messrs.
Roberts Brothers	PERSON	,
Boston	LOCATION	, was a great surprise to most of his friends , but it appears that he had suffered from peri - odical attacks of illness for some time , although saying little about it .

		He was much liked by all publishers and authors who knew him , and gained an enviable rep - utation for fair dealing .

		He was not , as has been gen - erally stated , the sole owner of the publishing-house with which he was connected , Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	being the chief owner and having always taken an active part in the business , though preferring to remain in the back - ground .

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	and Mr.
Niles	PERSON	shared equally in the literary and business management .

		Messrs.
Roberts Brothers	ORGANIZATION	recently brought out a copy - righted edition of
George Egerton	PERSON	's '' Keynotes , '' which they accepted on its merits , and which they are thus able to sell exclusively in this country .

		They are just about to publish `` The Dancing Faun , '' by
Florence Farr	PERSON	, for which they anticipate an equal success .

		Both these volumes have decorative title-pages designed by
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	, which indeed are quite the fashion .

		The
Edinburgh	LOCATION	edition of the works of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, in twenty volumes , will be published in this country by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , who have secured a portion of the limited and only edition of one thousand copies .

		The consent of four English publish - ing houses was necessary in order to perfect the plan of this edition .

		It will be published in library style , with little decorative matter , save a few frontispieces , under the supervision of Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	.

		There will be three volumes of `` Miscellanies , '' including early writ - ings and unsigned articles from periodicals .

		In quite 372 -LSB-
June	DATE	another department of literature , I do not see why some one does not collect Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's variously published works in a similar standard edition .

		Mr.
Noah Brooks	PERSON	's '' Tales of the
Maine	LOCATION	Coast '' is just out , and will be wel - comed as his first volume of fiction for grown-up readers .

		He is now once more a resident of
Castine	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, his birthplace , and he has endeavored with success to por - tray the characteristics of the people and the natural scenery of the
Maine	LOCATION	coast .

		Many of his characters are drawn from real life , and the town of
Castine	LOCATION	itself is thinly disguised as ''
Fairport	LOCATION	. ''

		The titles of some of the stories are ''
Pansy Pegg	PERSON	, '' '' The Apparition of
Jo Murch	PERSON	, '' The Phantom Sailor , '' '' The Waif of
Nautilus Island	LOCATION	, '' and '' A Century Ago . ''

		The ''
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	'' of
France	LOCATION	has decided to print the catalogue of its collection , which , amount - ing to more than two and a half million volumes , is the largest in the world .

		Mr.
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	, who , as readers of '' The Witch of
Prague	LOCATION	'' know , has dabbled a little in mod - ern mysticism , contributes to '' Book Reviews '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- for
June	DATE	an article called '' A Modern View of Mysticism . ''

		His discussion of the subject is somewhat too credulous to be taken very seriously .

		It was fitting that
M. Bourget	PERSON	should succeed his master
Taine	PERSON	in the French Academy , and hardly less so that
M. Albert Sorel	PERSON	should have been awarded the chair left vacant by the death of
Maxime Ducamp	PERSON	.


M. Sorel	PERSON	's most important work is ''
L' Europe	LOCATION	et la Re ` vo - lution Franchise , '' in four volumes .

		The death of the Hon.
Roden Noel	PERSON	is cabled from
London	LOCATION	.

		He was born in

		The following '' true story '' is from '' The

Signer Gallina	PERSON	, the Italian playwright and poet , has been granted a yearly pension of
$ 500	MONEY	by the syndic and municipality of
Venice	LOCATION	, to enable him to continue writing without continually facing the necessity of seek - ing other employment to keep the wolf from the door .

		For twenty years he has been writing plays which are likely to rank with
Goldoni	ORGANIZATION	's in mirroring actual Ital - ian life , and his admirers will rejoice to know that his .

		long struggle against poverty is practically ended .

		A '' Universal Index to the World 's Technical and Scientific Literature '' is announced for publication in .


Vienna	LOCATION	.

		The work as contemplated is intended to fur - nish a comprehensive index to the literature of scientific subjects .

		It will include periodicals as well as books , , and is meant to represent all the known literature that has appeared in any part of the world on technical or scientific topics .

		Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, who is passing the letter D of the '' New English Dictionary '' through the press , states that American readers can render a great assistance by not - ing early instances of all the terms of American poli - tics , since this research is very difficult if undertaken in

		Professor
A. S. Isaacs	PERSON	, of this university , has received permission from the author and publisher to translate into English Professor
Max Koch	PERSON	's admirable '' History of German Literature , '' issued a few months ago in Ger - many .

		The work has been very favorably noticed in .

		Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	, in a recent interview , spoke as follows of the Spanish novelists : '' The modern Spanish ?

		There are many novelists of the first rank among them that ought to - be more widely read than they are .

		I may mention
Perez Galdos	PERSON	his ' Dona Prefecta ' is excellent Juan -
Valera	LOCATION	, author of '

		over his grave in
Gottingen	LOCATION	.

		It was in
Gottingen	LOCATION	that the young student of theology was made a ballad-writer by the study of Bishop
Percy	PERSON	's '' Reliques , '' and here - he wrote his ''
Lenore	PERSON	. ''

		The grave is now marked only by a weatherbeaten column .

		Subscriptions will be re - ceived by the Dieterisch ` sche Buchhandlung at
Gottin	LOCATION	- gen , the house which originally published
Burger	ORGANIZATION	's poems .

		The
London	LOCATION	''
Bookman	PERSON	'' publishes monthly lists of the new books most in demand at the principal book - selling centres of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	.

		These lists usually consist of six books each , named in the order of their popularity .

		In the lists for
May	DATE	we notice that Mr.
Stead	PERSON	's book , '' If Christ Came to
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' has the first place in the esteem of
Middlesbrough	LOCATION	readers , while
Edinburgh	LOCATION	holds it fourth , and Liverpool sixth .

		As for
London	LOCATION	, it is ranked fourth by the West End , and second by the
East	LOCATION	.

		Fashionable
London	LOCATION	, it seems , pre - fers The Yellow Book , '' Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Astrophel , '' ''
1894	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 373 and Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's ''
Tennyson	PERSON	. ''

		Manchester ,
Birming	PERSON	- ham ,
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and
Aberdeen	ORGANIZATION	will have none of it .

		The Loubat prizes of
$ 1000	MONEY	and
$ 400	MONEY	established at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	by
Joseph F. Loubat	PERSON	for the best works published in the English language upon the his - tory , geography , archaeology , ethnology , philology , or numismatics of
North America	LOCATION	have been awarded for
1893	DATE	as follows : First prize to Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	for his '' History of the
United States of America During the Administrations of Madison	ORGANIZATION	and
Jefferson	PERSON	, '' in nine volumes ; second prize to Mr.
A. F. Bandelier	PERSON	for his '' Report of Investigations Among Indians of the South - western States , '' in two volumes .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has pre - sented to the
College	ORGANIZATION	, for the purchase of books for the library , the sum awarded to him .

		A friendly correspondent calls our attention to the inadvertance whereby , in the last issue of THE DIAL , the late
Madame Renan	PERSON	was spoken of as the daughter , instead of the niece , of the artist
Scheffer	PERSON	, and to the more serious error of publishing the obituary of
Herr von Sacher-Masoch	PERSON	before the Galician novelist had de - parted this life .

		Of this error , we can only say that we shared it with a large section of the American press .

		The statement was so generally published that we had no reason to doubt its accuracy .

		Like the report that Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	had been appointed Poet Laureate , it got into circulation no one knows how , and ran its course .

		We understand that
Herr von Sacher-Masoch	PERSON	is still se - riously ill .

		The
London	LOCATION	''
Bookman	PERSON	'' has this tribute to the ver - satility of the late
W. Robertson	PERSON	Smith : '' His pub - lished works , high and varied as their importance is , give but a faint idea of the extraordinary man who wrote them .

		It was often said of him that he knew more than any other man alive .

		Music alone seemed to have no interest for him , except a scientific one .

		But of all the other arts , of all sciences , of all histories , literatures , and philosophies , his knowledge was amazing ; no one knew the limits of it ; and his readiness in the command of it seemed almost superhuman .

		For hours , for a long day even , he could talk without weariness or dulness on subject after subject to his company 's heart 's content , and never be commonplace , never fail to stimulate and in - struct .

		His wealth of ideas was almost as marvellous as his wealth of knowledge ; his mind was far too restless to stay content even with the enormous collection of facts and of other men 's opinions that he had at such com - mand . ''

		MR. WARNER ON CHARACTER DELINEATION IN FICTION .

		Mr.
C. D. Warner	PERSON	, in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly '' for
June	DATE	, thus writes of character delineation in modern fiction : '' It is true to say that modern fiction deals more with experience than with character .

		The novelist is more concerned with certain ideas or views of life , with his own experiences got too often at second hand from other novels than with the creation of characters in which life can be seen without his explanations .

		When we refer to certain great works of fiction we always think of their defined and vivid characters , which take their places in history as visible to our minds as any people who ever lived , whereas in most recent novels we find mostly an attempt to set forth ideas or a state of society , and in thinking of them we recall the study of motives , the sketch of traits , incidents of daily life , stopping short of adventure , and the more or less wide and knowing comments of the author .

		These are , to be sure , the raw materials of fiction , but until they are embodied in personality , in characters , they fail to cre - ate perfect illusion .

		The novelist who has not creative genius , or is too lazy to represent life in characters , some - times resorts to ear-marks , or names them by label or some trick or phrase or gait .

		But so little are the char - acters realized by the author or felt by the reader that the speech of one might be taken for that of another , and is not at all distinguished in page after page of level dialogue .

		To avoid this sameness of utterance , resort is had to dialect for so bad spelling and defect - ive grammar are often named .

		Play-writers have an advantage , for their characters are visibly represented , and can be distinguished by their voices and peculiar - ities of manner and dress , but they also often resort to the inartistic expedient of catchwords and repeated phrases .

		It is true that a given society of people use substantially the same language ; that is , well-bred people speak in one way and illiterate people in an - other way .

		The great difficulty of the novelist is to distinguish by their speech persons using substantially the same language .

		But no two persons do con - verse in the same way ; the distinctions between them may be fine , but they are always recognized , for they come out of the character , which is never repeated .

		This fine discrimination , in dialogue as well as in action , can never be attained by a writer until he dramatically realizes his character , and is then truthful to his con - ception .

		We talk a great deal about novels being true to life , but can we think of any novel that is true to the universal apprehension , and that has passed from gen - eration to generation , that does not owe its life to its vivid characters ? ''

		CORRECTING A MISTAKE .

		DO YOU know the difference between a mistake and a blunder ?

		When you lay down a good umbrella and take up a poor one , you make a mistake ; but when you lay down a poor umbrella and take up a good one , you make a blunder .

		So in bicycles .

		When you buy a poorer bicycle than you ought to ride , you make a mistake ; when you buy anything but the best you make a blunder .

		When you buy any bicycle without first seeing the '94 Warwick , you make a blundering mistake .

		The best time to correct a blundering mistake is before you make it !

		Therefore get our Catalogue .

		Get it at once !

		Do n't leave the chair in which you are now sitting until you have written a postal asking for it .

		When it arrives , live on it for fifteen minutes .

		Examine the
Table of Contents	ORGANIZATION	for the New Features of
1894	DATE	the new sectional wood rims , New Patent Adjustable Handle-Bars , New Rear Brake , New Frame with bearings on the same level , New Chain Adjustment , etc. , etc. .

		Do n't overlook the old
Warwick virtue of Construction	ORGANIZATION	which has given these wheels the reputation of being '' built on honor . ''

		This is a very important feature .

		So , too , are the Warwick dust-proof bearings , for they are the only ones in the world .

		When the fifteen minutes are up , if you do not decide to purchase a
Warwick	LOCATION	, no harm has been done .

		But why speak of the impossible ?

		If you study a
Warwick Catalogue	ORGANIZATION	carefully fifteen minutes , you will buy no other make .

		Secure the Catalogue To-day .
